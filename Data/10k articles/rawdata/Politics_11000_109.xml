In this [[National Herald scam#National Herald Panchkula land grab scam|AJL-National Herald Panchkula land grab scam]], the Congress government gave the National Herald 3,500 square meters of plot number C-17 in Sector 6 of [[Panchkula]] in Haryana in 1982 [during [[Bhajan Lal]]'s [[Indian National Congress]] rule] to publish a newspaper, but for ten years, there was no newspaper published from here. Hence, as per the rules the land should have been returned to the government, but the ownership was illegally transferred to AJL/[[National Herald (India)|National Herald]] by Hooda government in 2013. This case and National Herald's possession of INR 2000 crores worth land are being currently investigated by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (c. December 2017).&lt;ref name=scam1&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=hi&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fperformindia.com%2Fland-fraud-of-gandhi-family%2F Rahul ji!

Gunjiyal, was mentioned in FIR the investigating officer (IO) of the case.&lt;ref name=ajl21/&gt;

===Investigating agencies===

===Persons under investigation===

==Current status==
On 1 December 2018, CBI filed the chargesheet against Hooda, Moti Lal Vohra and AJL Ltd for the allotment of 3360 sqm plot in Sector 6 in 2005 in violation of the rules. As per the chargesheet, the plot was originally allotted in 1982, but allotment automatically lapsed as no construction was carried out within the prescribed ten years, resulting in [[Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran|HUDA]] (now called HSVP) retaking the ownership of the plot in 1992. Chargesheet states that Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who was then chairman of HUDA and chief minister of Haryana, re-allotted the plot in 2005 at 1982 price with interest by violating the rules, resulting in loss of INR 620,000 to the govt of Haryana.&lt;ref name=chargesheet1&gt;[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cbi-files-chargesheet-against-ex-haryana-cm-bhupinder-singh-hooda-congress-leader-motilal-vora-in-ajl-land-allotment-case/articleshow/66893311.cms CBI files chargesheet against ex-Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress leader Motilal Vora in AJL land allotment case], Economic Times, 1 December 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy''''' was written by a committee chaired by [[Dean Acheson]] and [[David E. Lilienthal|David Lilienthal]] in 1946 and is generally known as the '''Acheson–Lilienthal Report''' or '''Plan'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/baruch-plans U.S. State Department: The Acheson–Lilienthal &amp; Baruch Plans, 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; The report was an important American document that appeared just before the start of the early [[Cold War]]. It proposed the international control of [[nuclear weapon]]s and the avoidance of future [[nuclear warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=2620 ''History Channel'': Acheson–Lilienthal Report released] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501071840/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=2620 |date=2009-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Mayers,  "Destruction Repaired and Destruction Anticipated: United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Atomic Bomb, and US Policy 1944–6." ''International History Review ''38#5 (2016) pp 961-83.&lt;/ref&gt;  As American distrust of Stalin grew, the Report was simply ignored.  A version was vetoed by the USSR at the UN.

==Historical context==
Two schools of thought concerning nuclear weapons emerged in the United States immediately after the end of World War II. One school, which had [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] as its chief proponent, believed that the apparent secrets of the atomic bomb were scientific in nature, and could not be monopolised forever. They further felt that to hold the bomb ostentatiously in reserve, whilst negotiating with the [[Soviet Union]] not to develop one, would simply drive [[Russia]] into developing their own weapon to restore the balance of power.

The other school included men like [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]], who felt that the US monopoly on atomic weapons had been honestly earned, and should not be surrendered. In their view, the Soviet Union understood only power, and could only be met with nuclear weapons.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] was divided between the two positions. He was distrustful of the Soviet Union, but still did not want to lead the world down a path to destruction. He continued to solicit views from both sides. Stimson resigned in September 1945, and thereafter the task of promoting his approach fell primarily on [[Under Secretary of State]] and later Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]].

A proposal to pass the responsibility for the control of atomic energy to a [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] was endorsed by both the USA and the Soviets in 1945. They had the forum, but the United States had not yet articulated a policy that it wished the new commission to adopt. To resolve the problem, Acheson was appointed to head a committee to set forth United States policy on atomic energy.

The other members of the committee were scientists [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]] and [[Vannevar Bush]], the director of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], which controlled the [[Manhattan Project]], and [[John J. McCloy|John McCloy]], and General [[Leslie R. Groves]], who had been the military officer in charge of the Manhattan Project. Acheson decided that the committee needed technical advice, so he appointed a board of consultants with [[David Lilienthal]], the well-regarded chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], as chairman. He also appointed [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], scientific leader of the Manhattan Project, who provided influential advice. Oppenheimer’s contribution lay in an idea to police the production of atomic weapons from monitoring source mines for [[uranium]].

==Overview of the report==
On March 16, 1946, the committee's report was presented to the [[State Department]], which released it to the public on March 28. The ''Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy'' soon became known as the ''Acheson–Lilienthal Report''. The primary message of the report was that control of atomic energy through inspections and policing operations was unlikely to succeed. Instead, the report proposed that all fissile material be owned by an international agency to be called the [[Atomic Development Authority]], which would release small amounts to individual nations for the development of peaceful uses of atomic energy.

In the first years of the atomic era, it was generally believed that the great obstacle facing a would-be developer of an atomic bomb was the acquisition of sufficient fissile material. In response, the Acheson–Lilienthal Report proposed that the complete path from the uranium and thorium mines to post production be under international ownership. 

In addition, the report proposed that the United States abandon its monopoly on atomic weapons, revealing what it knew to the Soviet Union, in exchange for a mutual agreement against the development of additional atomic bombs. This was to prove too controversial. Although Truman accepted the report in general, his appointment of financier [[Bernard Baruch]] to carry the proposal forward in the [[United Nations]] led to demands for punishment for violations, and that those penalties could not be vetoed by the [[United Nations Security Council]], as well as unrestricted inspections within the USSR, whilst still insisting that the USSR should agree not to develop the bomb. These were modifications that neither Acheson nor Lilienthal accepted. This, combined with U.S. continued insistence on retaining the bomb until they were satisfied with the effectiveness of international control, ultimately led to the plan's rejection by the Soviet Union, to the surprise of no one.

An '''advocate general''' is a senior officer of the law. In some common law and hybrid jurisdictions the officer performs the function of a legal advisor to the government, analogous to [[attorneys general]] in other common law and hybrid jurisdictions. By contrast, in the [[European Union]] and some continental European jurisdictions, the officer is a neutral legal advisor to the courts.

==India==
{{See also|Advocate general (India)}}
In [[India]], an advocate general is a legal advisor to a [[state governments of India|state government]]. The post is created by the [[Constitution of India]] and corresponds to that of [[Attorney General of India]] at the central-level. The Governor of each state shall appoint a person who is qualified to be appointed judges in [[List of high courts in India|high court]].

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan an advocate general of the Province of the Punjab is a constitutional post and is an authority duly appointed under Article 140 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. A person who is qualified to be appointed as a Judge of the High Court is appointed as the Advocate General for the province. He is the principal law officer of the Province.

The Advocate General and his office defends and protects the interest of the provincial government and gives invaluable legal guidance to the provincial government in formulation of its policy and execution of its decision.Advocate-General of the Punjab is also ''Ex Officio'' Chairman of Punjab Bar Council.

The office of the Advocate General is directly connected with the High Court of the province. Pre-independence (1947) the High Court of judicature for the premises of Punjab and Delhi was established at Lahore and was called the High Court of Judicature at Lahore. After independence of Pakistan, the High Court at Lahore ceased to have jurisdiction over Delhi and the then East Punjab. On 14 August 1947 the High Court (Lahore) Order, 1947, preserved the continuance of the High Court at Lahore with all rights, powers and privileges as hitherto enjoyed and possessed by it before the appointed day. The Governor-General of the Dominion of Pakistan became the substitute of the Crown in matters of appointment etc. of Judges of the Lahore High Court.

===England and Wales===
The concept of "advocate general" fits less comfortably into a common law system than a civil law system; and England, the archetypal common law jurisdiction, has no such officer, nor is there any equivalent person to address and advise any court.

However, England does have an [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], who serves one of the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] and whose duty is to advise the [[The Crown|Crown]] and [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] on the law. His deputy is the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], who serves the same function.

===Scotland===
{{Main|Advocate General for Scotland}}

Historically, the [[United Kingdom Government]] was advised on matters of [[Scots Law]] by the [[Lord Advocate]] but following the [[Scotland Act 1998]] and the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]] the Lord Advocate became a member of the [[Scottish Executive]].

It was necessary to create a post to advise the [[British Government]] in [[Her Majesty's Government|Westminster]]. Thus, the new post of [[Advocate General for Scotland]] was created. The advocate general's role differs from that formerly held by the Lord Advocate in that they are only charged with advising the UK Government on matters pertaining to [[Scots law]], the Lord Advocate having retained his responsibility as the chief [[public prosecutor]] in Scotland and head of the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] on his transfer to the Scottish Executive.

===Northern Ireland===
{{Main|Advocate General for Northern Ireland}}
The position of [[Advocate General for Northern Ireland]] was created following the devolution of policing and justice powers to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] on 12 April 2010. The [[Attorney General for Northern Ireland]] reports to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], and, accordingly, the Advocate General advises the UK Government on matters of Northern Ireland law. The post is held by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] by virtue of office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/Devolution.aspx Attorney General's Office: Statement on Northern Ireland devolution, 12 April 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705174807/http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/Devolution.aspx |date=July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other European jurisdictions==
The position of advocate general is well established in the [[France|French]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and some other continental European [[legal system]]s, where higher courts are assisted by these legal officers. They are not advocates representing clients in courts. They are not judges either, although they are full members of the courts. They mainly offer legal advice to judges on the cases being tried. They may also have a [[prosecutor|prosecution]] role, depending on countries and on the nature of cases (criminal or civil). 

The position of advocate general (''avocat général'') already existed in the French legal system before the [[French Revolution]], when they were found in the then higher courts (''[[parlement]]s'', ''[[cour des aides|cours des aides]]'', etc.) and proposed legal solutions to the judges in cases involving the State, the Church, the general public, communities, or minors. Since the French Revolution, they are found in the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], the [[Court of Audit (France)|Court of Audit]], the [[Judiciary of France#Appellate courts|Courts of Appeal]], and the [[Cour d'assises|Assize Courts]]. They have more of a prosecution role than before the French Revolution, especially in the Assize Courts, in which people accused of [[felonies]] are tried.

===European Union===

The [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU) has one judge from each Member State, assisted by eleven advocates general whose role is to consider the written and oral submissions to the court in every case that raises a new point of law, and deliver an impartial opinion to the court on the legal solution. Although Advocates General are full members of the court, they do not take part in the [[court]]'s deliberations, and the Advocate General’s opinion is not binding on the court. Although the court reaches the same solution as the Advocate General more often than not, it cannot usually be stated that the advocate general's opinion has been 'followed' in any given case, because the court may have reached the same conclusion via different legal reasoning. The role of Advocate General is created by Article 19(2) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] and Articles 253 and 254 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].

===Benelux Court of Justice===
When the [[Benelux Court of Justice]] answers requests for a preliminary ruling, it also first considers the advice of an advocate general. the court has three, one from each participating country (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) and taken from the procureurs-general of the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13014">The '''American Woman Suffrage Association''' ('''AWSA''') was a [[Single-issue politics|single-issue]] national organization formed in 1869 in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/756/mode/2up "American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)], ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'', Volume 2, Chapter XXVI, p. 756.&lt;/ref&gt; The AWSA lobbied state governments to enact laws granting or expanding women's right to vote in the United States. Its most prominent leader, [[Lucy Stone]], began publishing a newspaper in 1870 called the ''[[Woman's Journal]]''.  Designed as the voice of the AWSA, it eventually became a voice of the women's movement as a whole.   

In 1890, the AWSA merged with a rival organization, the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]].  The new organization, called the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], was initially led by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who had been the leaders of the NWSA. 
==Origins==

Following the Civil War, in 1866, leaders of the abolition and suffrage movements founded the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA) to advocate for citizens' right to vote regardless of race or sex. Divisions among the group's members, which had existed from the outset, became apparent during the struggle over the ratification of two amendments to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Movements Succeed and Fail|last=Banaszak|first=Lee Ann|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=6-8}}The exlusion of women from voting was so unchallenged in the nineteenth century that it was not necessary to have a law prohibiting this participation. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Radicalism of the Women Suffrage Movement||last=DuBois|first=Ellen|publisher=JSTOR|year=1975|pages=2}} &lt;/ref&gt; The proposed [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which guaranteed equal protection of the laws to all citizens, regardless of race, color, creed, or previous condition of servitude, added the word "male" to the Constitution for the first time. The proposed [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] extended franchise to African American men, but not to women. Following its contentious 1869 convention, the AERA dissolved, leading to the formation of two organizations lobbying for woman suffrage, the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA).

The AWSA was founded in November 1869 at a convention in Cleveland that was organized by leaders of the [[New England Woman Suffrage Association]] (NEWSA).  The NEWSA had been created in November 1868 as part of the developing split within the women's movement.  The AWSA and the NEWSA operated separately with somewhat overlapping leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Feminism and Suffrage: The Emergence of an Independent Women's Movement in America, 1848-1869 |last=DuBois |first=Ellen Carol |authorlink=Ellen DuBois|year=1978 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location= Ithaca, NY |isbn=0-8014-8641-6|pages=164, 195–196 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1870, [[Lucy Stone]], the leader of the AWSA, began publishing an eight-page weekly newspaper called the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'' as the voice of the AWSA.  Eventually it became a voice of the women's movement as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seneca Falls and the Origins of the Women's Rights Movement |last=McMillen |first=Sally Gregory| year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-518265-0|pages=208, 224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzVRlFXiYswC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more radical NWSA, led by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], condemned the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] as an injustice to women. The AWSA was the more conservative of the two groups. Its founders, including [[Lucy Stone]], [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]], [[Julia Ward Howe]] and [[Josephine Ruffin]], strongly supported the Republican Party and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], which they felt would not win congressional approval if it included the vote for women. Another of its members was noted abolitionist and women's rights advocate [[Sojourner Truth]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Votes for Women|chapter=2: Voices of Suffrage: Sojourner Truth, Francis Watkins Harper, and the Struggle for Woman Suffrage |last=Painter|first=Nell Irvin|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=Jean|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-513017-0|location=New York|pages=51-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to NWSA ==
AWSA distinguished itself from NWSA in several additional ways:

# The AWSA included both men and women.  The NWSA was all-female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The AWSA chose not campaign on other issues related to gender equality, focusing its efforts on suffrage. The NWSA also took positions on a number of other women's rights issues, including advocating easier [[divorce]] laws and an end to discrimination in employment and pay.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Woman's Suffrage|last=McBain-Stephens|first=Jennifer|publisher=Rosen Publication Group|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=16-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The AWSA believed success could be more easily achieved through state-by-state campaigns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States|last=Flexner|first=Eleanor|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of this strategy, the group adopted a federated structure, establishing state and local chapters throughout the nation, and particularly in the East and Midwest. The early NWSA advocated for securing woman suffrage through a federal constitutional amendments, although its work also moved to the state level during the 1880s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# The AWSA supported traditional social institutions, such as marriage and religion.  The NWSA criticized aspects of these institutions that they felt were unjust to women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# The AWSA employed less militant lobbying tactics, such as petition drives, testifying before legislatures, and giving public speeches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The AWSA also founded its own magazine, the ''[[Woman's Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA374#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Women's History in America|last=Cullen-DuPont|first=Kathryn|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438110332|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edited by Lucy Stone, it featured articles by the group's members and cartoons by [[Blanche Ames Ames|Blanche Ames]], [[Lou Rogers]], [[Mary Sigsbee]], [[Fredrikke Palmer]] and [[Rollin Kirby]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some state and local organizations affiliated with the AWSA also produced journals, most notably, the ''Women Voter'' ([[New York City]]), ''[[Maryland Suffrage News]]'' ([[Baltimore]]) and the ''[[Western Woman Voter]]'' ([[Seattle]]). The NWSA used litigation and other confrontational tactics to bring attention to their cause.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Policy victories ==
Several modest but significant gains for women suffrage occurred during the twenty year period of AWSA activity. Women in two Western states, [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]], won the right to vote. An average of 4.4 states per year considered, but did not adopt woman suffrage. Eight additional states also considered [[Referendum|referenda]] on the issue; none, however, were successful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Formation of the National American Woman Suffrage Association ==
The AWSA was initially larger than the NWSA, but it declined in strength during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony: Place Inside the Body-Politic, 1887 to 1895|authorlink=| editor1-last=Gordon |editor1-first=Ann D.| year=2009 |publisher= Rutgers University Press|location= |volume=5|isbn=978-0-8135-2321-7|pages=xxv, 55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&amp;pg=PR25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanton and Anthony, the leading figures in the NWSA, were more widely known as leaders of the women's suffrage movement during this period and more influential in setting its direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Chance: The Struggle over Woman Suffrage and Black Suffrage in Reconstruction America|last=Dudden|first=Faye E.|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-977263-6|page=12|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1880s, it became increasingly clear that group rivalries were counterproductive to the goal of votes for women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Conversations about a merger between the AWSA and NWSA began in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbkbAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of Woman Suffrage|last=Harper|first=Ida Husted|last2=Anthony|first2=Susan B.|date=1902|publisher=The Hollenbeck Press|year=1902|isbn=|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of negotiations, the organizations officially joined together in 1890 to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The leaders of this new organization included Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], [[Mary Church Terrell]], [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] and [[Anna Howard Shaw]]. Stanton served in a largely ceremonial capacity as the NAWSA's first president while Anthony was its leading force in practice.The suffrage movement distanced itself from labor groups and kept its focus on the more affluent levels of society.  

The first three volumes of the six-volume ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'' were written by the leaders of the NWSA prior to the merger.  It included a 107-page chapter on the history of the AWSA, the NWSA's bitter rival, but provided much more information about the NWSA itself that was written from its own point of view. This unbalanced portrayal of the movement influenced scholarly research in this field for many years.  Not until about the middle of the 20th century did the AWSA begin to receive adequate scholarly attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights |last=DuBois |first=Ellen Carol |authorlink=Ellen DuBois|year=1998 |publisher= New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8147-1901-5 |pages=216, 234 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Urn8GOy9EsQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BuzzFeed]] identified Bpoplive as an attempt to reach the key youth demographic by the Leave campaign.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed1st"/&gt; Leave.EU described the event as related to the American [[Rock the Vote]] campaign, a non-partisan attempt to engage young voters, who traditionally have low turnout.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed1st"/&gt;

The cancelled 8 May event was explicitly organised by Leave.EU and [[Grassroots Out]]; however, on 26 May 2016, Leave.EU disclaimed any role in the 19 June festival beyond endorsing it.&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leave.eu/en/news/0/statement-leaveeu-is-an-endorser-of-bpoplive-no-more-than-that|title=Statement: Leave.EU endorses BPopLive – nothing more|date=26 May 2016|accessdate=26 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530232124/http://leave.eu/en/news/0/statement-leaveeu-is-an-endorser-of-bpoplive-no-more-than-that#|archive-date=2016-05-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official organiser was "Brexit Live", which is registered as a non-party campaign group separately from Leave.EU, which means that Bpoplive's costs did not count towards Leave.EU's spending limits. However, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' noted that Bpoplive was being organised by Leave.EU's leaders, and Brexit's Live's spokesperson—who was also Leave.EU's spokesperson—told the ''Mirror'' that Bpoplive's expenses "probably should" be registered under Leave.EU, but that they had not broken any rules.&lt;ref name="Brexit Live"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brexit-concert-now-star-three-8102783|title=Brexit concert will now star three quarters of Bucks Fizz and an Elvis impersonator |author=Mikey Smith and Dan Bloom|date=2 June 2016|accessdate=3 June 2016|newspaper=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First attempt==
The first Bpoplive concert was organized for 8 May 2016, the day after [[United Kingdom elections, 2016 (disambiguation)|local and regional elections]].&lt;ref name="LeaveAid"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/feb/26/leave-aid-grassroots-out-anti-eu-festival-hottest-music-event-nigel-farage|title=Leave Aid: Grassroots Out’s anti-EU festival is the hottest music event of the year|date=26 February 2016|accessdate=25 May 2016|author=Marina Hyde|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line-up was announced as including [[UK garage]] duo [[DJ Luck and MC Neat]], [[electro swing]] sextet [[The Electric Swing Circus]], [[house music|house]] act [[Phats and Small]] and a DJ set from [[Sigma (duo)|Sigma]].&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed1st"/&gt; The [[press release]] for the event also promised "speeches from leading personalities and politicians who support leaving the EU".&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/apr/08/brexit-crisis-the-leave-lobby-wants-a-music-festival-but-its-hottest-acts-want-out|title=Brexit crisis: the leave lobby wants a music festival but its hottest acts want out |date=8 April 2016|accessdate=25 May 2016|author=Marina Hyde|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contacted by the press, all artists except Phats and Small—who could not be contacted—claimed that they had not been told that the event was political, and would not be participating.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed1st"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; A Leave.EU press officer denied that the event was political, and said that there had been two possible concepts for the event—a partisan pro-Brexit rally and a non-partisan "Rock the Vote" type event—and that the wrong press release was sent out by mistake.&lt;ref name="Crisis"/&gt; The event never went ahead.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

==Second attempt==
Bpoplive was subsequently rearranged to be held on 19 June 2016, the Sunday before the referendum. The line-up was announced as [[boyband]] [[5ive]], [[R&amp;B]] singer [[Alesha Dixon]], boyband [[East 17]], disco group [[Sister Sledge]] and the soul singer Gwen Dickey from the band [[Rose Royce]].&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed1st"/&gt; Tickets were made available starting from £23. 5ive were announced as a duo, with only [[Ritchie Neville]]—who had previously made comments that were interpreted as being in favour of the Leave campaign—and [[Scott Robinson (singer)|Scott Robinson]] from the group taking part, while [[Sean Conlon]], who had tweeted messages in support of [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|EU migrants]], was not included.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/boyband-5ive-pull-out-brexit-8038617|title=Boyband 5ive pull out of Brexit concert after learning it was a political rally |newspaper=Daily Mirror|date=24 May 2016|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire band subsequently withdrew.&lt;ref name="Mirror"/&gt; Alesha Dixon, East 17 and Sister Sledge also pulled out.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed2nd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scrapbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalscrapbook.net/2016/05/concert-billed-as-biggest-rally-in-british-history-to-leave-the-eu-is-already-falling-apart/|title=The concert billed as "biggest rally in British history" (to Leave the EU) is falling apart|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=25 May 2016|website=Political Scrapbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicists for both 5ive and Dixon said that they had not been told that it was a political event.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed2nd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1701383/alesha-dixon-pulls-out-of-brexit-concert|title=Alesha Dixon Pulls Out Of Brexit Concert|date=24 May 2016|accessdate=25 May 2016|newspaper=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only artist to confirm participation was Gwen Dickey, who said that she would still be taking part as an entertainer but that as an American she could not vote in the referendum and had no opinion on it one way or the other.&lt;ref name="Mirror2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/alesha-dixon-pulls-out-brexit-8041216|title=Alesha Dixon pulls out of Brexit concert featuring Nigel Farage after learning it was a political rally |author=Mikey Smith|date=24 May 2016|accessdate=25 May 2016|newspaper=Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the acts, Leave.EU campaigners [[Nigel Farage]], [[Liam Fox]] and [[Kate Hoey]] were set to give speeches.&lt;ref name="StayAnotherDay"/&gt;

==Third attempt==
Following the collapse of the second line-up, Leave.EU director [[Arron Banks]] announced that there would be a third line-up, who the campaign's Head of Communications [[Andy Wigmore]] described as "British Patriots [who] want to leave the EU".&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/brexit-concert-bpop-live-leaveeu-463488?rm=eu|title='Bpop Live' Brexit Gig 'To Get New Lineup'|newspaper=Newsweek|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=26 May 2016|author=Josh Lowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2016, Leave.EU announced "Bpop Live version 3.0", with a line-up comprising [[Cheryl Baker]], [[Mike Nolan (singer)|Mike Nolan]], [[Jay Aston]] and [[Bobby McVay]] performing as "[[Bucks Fizz#The Fizz|Formerly of Bucks Fizz]]"&lt;ref group=note&gt;The rights to the name "Bucks Fizz" remain with [[Bobby G]], whose group was not booked to perform at Bpoplive.&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Elvis impersonator]], Gordon Hendricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/leaveeuofficial/posts/962475383850703|website=Facebook|author=Leave.EU|date=1 June 2016|accessdate=2 June 2016|title=Leave.EU Facebook post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3rd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-bpoplive-bucks-fizz-elvis_uk_574ff2dfe4b040e3e818fc2c|title=‘Brexit’ Concert Unveils Members Of Bucks Fizz And Elvis Impersonator In New Line-Up|author=Graeme Demianyk|date=2 June 2016|accessdate=2 June 2016|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; R&amp;B singer [[Alexander O'Neal]] and soul singer [[Kenny Thomas (singer)|Kenny Thomas]] were subsequently added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LeaveEUOfficial/status/738792378388086784|title=Tweet from Leave.EU|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=3 June 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly of Bucks Fizz confirmed on their Twitter account that they were playing but did not endorse either Leave or Remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CherylMikeJay/status/738691144805154816|title=Tweet from Formerly of Bucks Fizz|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=3 June 2016|website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, [[Ray Lewis]] of [[The Drifters]] was added to the line-up, and the ticket price was reduced to £5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/bpop-live-tickets-pro-brexit-11469730|title=BPop Live: Tickets for Pro-Brexit pop concert slashed to £5 after bands pull out|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=15 June 2016|website=Birmingham Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brentwood and Ongar Independent Conservative Party''' was founded in 1999 by members of [[Brentwood and Ongar (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentwood and Ongar]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Association. This breakaway group alleged that the local Conservative association had been infiltrated by the local [[Peniel Pentecostal Church]] in [[Pilgrims Hatch]], with 119 church members joining and some having installed themselves in key posts.&lt;ref&gt;''In the name of the Father'', [[The Independent]], 20 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

The members of the Independent Conservatives were subsequently expelled from the mainstream Conservative Party for being members of a group that was standing in opposition to them. The claims were investigated by [[Conservative Central Office]] who decided that evidence did not suggest [[entryism]].

Until the [[Brentwood Council election 2002|2002 election]], the Brentwood and Ongar Independent Conservative Party had a [[councillor]] in [[Shenfield, Essex|Shenfield]], Anthony Galbraith, who had [[cross the floor|crossed the floor]] in the council chamber from the mainstream Conservative Party. The party never succeeded in having any election candidates elected.

In February 1999, the Independent Conservatives issued a [[press release]] suggesting that the Peniel church was a cult and was 'a danger to the people of Brentwood'. The church sued for [[libel]], and Galbraith settled for an undisclosed sum and admitted that the 'allegation referred to was wholly untrue'.&lt;ref&gt;''Church members win 'cult' libel damages'', [[The Daily Telegraph]], 21 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independent Conservatives were instrumental in encouraging [[Martin Bell]] to stand for the [[Brentwood and Ongar (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentwood and Ongar constituency]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]].

The party was dissolved and removed from the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] register on 18 November 2003.

'''Buyer Agency Agreements''' are where a [[Realtor]] represents the buyer of [[real estate]].

== Creation ==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}

With the advent of "Buyer Agency" (Buyer Brokerage) in the early 1990s as opposed to [[seller agency]], a real estate Agent/Broker agrees and contracts to represent the Buyer in her purchase of a home/property.  Buyer Agency Agreements were developed to set out the terms and conditions of this representation.  They are similar to the written "Listing Agreements", required between [[Listing (finance)|Listing]] Agents and Sellers (property owners).  Buyer Agency Agreements set out the main conditions of the relationship between the [[Buyer Agent]] and her Buyer Client including such things as the duration of the agreement, the commission to be earned/paid, and the various rights, duties and obligations of the parties.

== Fiduciary duties ==
The Buyer Agent owes [[fiduciary]] duties to the Buyer under this relationship and agreement, including fidelity, honesty, dedication to purpose, acting in the Buyer's best interests, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The fiduciary duties are often labeled "candor, loyalty and good faith"; see [[Fiduciary]] or ''[[Meinhard v. Salmon]]'' for a thorough discussion of fiduciary duties.&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission to be paid to the Buyer's Agent in the Buyer Agency Agreement, though ultimately the Buyer's [[obligation]], is generally offset in whole or in part against  the share, or "co-op", commission offered by the Listing Agent through the [[Multiple Listing Service]] ("MLS"). 

An exclusive buyer agent is a real estate agent who works for a company that does not ever represent sellers in real estate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naeba.org |title=Exclusive Buyers Agents &amp;#124; First Time Home Buyers Agents &amp;#124; Real Estate Buyers Agents |publisher=Naeba.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive buyer agents (and their clients) avoid the conflict of interest of working with an agent who promotes their listings or their firm's listings. It is beneficial to a buyer to have representation because the agent is responsible for acquiring information on the property and advising the buyer based on that information. Without an agreement, the agent may not have an obligation to work with the buyer's best interests in mind.

== Conflict of interest ==
A [[Realtor]] that is acting as a Buyer's Agent has a significant economic conflict of interest if their commission is split with the Seller's Agent, as in most real estate transactions. Because a commissioned Buyer's Agent is paid more if the Buyer pays more money, the Buyer's Agent has a direct economic incentive to make the Buyer pay more for a property.

'''''Democracy''''' is a [[government simulation game]] that was first developed by [[Positech Games]] in 2005, with a sequel released in December 2007 and a third game in 2013. The player plays as if they are the [[president]] or [[prime minister]] of a democratic government. The player must introduce and alter policies in seven areas – tax, economy, welfare, foreign policy, transport, law and order and public services. Each policy has an effect on the happiness of various voter groups, as well as affecting factors such as crime and air quality. The player has to deal with "situations", which are typically problems such as petrol protests or homelessness, and also has to make decisions on dilemmas that arise each turn.

==Gameplay==
After deciding which nation to play as, the player must win the support of various [[Political factions|factions]] which make up the [[constituency|electorate]], including the religious, [[patriotism|patriotic]], parents, [[Capitalism|capitalists]], [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Liberalism|liberals]], [[Conservatism|conservatives]] and others, and thus win the ensuing elections that take place. The player introduces policies and uses sliders to change the amount of government funding, level of a [[tax]] or generally the law and regulations in that particular area. Of course, because each individual person belongs to several factions (e.g.: a Poor Conservative Smoker who is a Patriot or a Rich, Socialist person who is also a Drinker), it is practically impossible to control all the voters. Before each [[general election]], two promises are made by the player to the electorate (e.g.: reduce [[unemployment]] by 10%). If the player has not kept these promises by the next election, the people become annoyed and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] increases.

To make policy changes, the player must spend political capital, which is generated by loyal ministers.

The player must also try to balance the [[budget]] and pay off the [[Government debt|country's debts]] without losing votes and causing [[tax evasion]] due to very high taxes.

There are also many events, dilemmas and situations in the game which the player must deal with. An example of an event might be the curing of a disease, a dilemma may be who to appoint as a senior judge and a situation may be high levels of [[pollution]]. An event happens, sometimes due to policies however the player doesn't take part; they simply profit or suffer from it. A dilemma is an important decision which must be resolved for the turn to be ended and situations are ongoing conditions which must be dealt with or helped and enjoyed.

==Modding==
The games designer has described the code behind the game as being based on a [[neural network]]. This has allowed the game to be very easily modded, and most of the 'game logic' in it is openly editable in simple text [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files, allowing players to change the way the core mechanics of the game operate. A number of mods have been released for both the first and second game in the series, and are generally released on the Positech forum. Mods have included new countries (and real countries for ''Democracy 2'') and the addition of factors such as inflation, as well as enhancement of the voter cynicism factor in ''Democracy 2''.

==Sequels==
A sequel to the game was released in December 2007, which, while very similar to the original in terms of gameplay, differs in that it uses fictional nations (although modders have converted the real nations from the original for play on the new version), and has numerous new features, including party membership, terrorism and real world statistical data. Many of the previously existing features have been enhanced: for example, the amount of political capital needed to change a policy now differs depending on which policy one is changing, and whether one is introducing it, raising it, lowering it, or cancelling it. In December 2008, ''Democracy 2'' won the Game Tunnel "Simulation game of the year" award, something the first game had already achieved. In October 2013, ''Democracy 3'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positech.co.uk/democracy3/#|title=Democracy 3 &amp;#124; Take Control of your Country!|author=Rock Paper Shotgun|date=|publisher=Positech.co.uk|accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015 Positech announced an 'expandalone' for the game set entirely in Africa, with a different simulation model, music and graphics entitled ''Democracy 3: Africa''.

==Release and reception==
The original game was released in 2007 in the United States by [[Tri-Synergy]], with added events and policies, and a special mode in which the player controls a fictional nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trisynergy.com/news.asp?nid=14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028001308/http://www.trisynergy.com/news.asp?nid=14|date=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received "mixed" reviews, according to game aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/democracy|title=Democracy|website=Metacritic|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Website Game Tunnel scored the game 8/10 overall, stating "losing a game of ''Democracy'' is almost as rewarding as winning your next election" and "there is always the motivation to do better next time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gametunnel.com/gamespace.php?id=74&amp;tab=3 | title = Review by Game Tunnel | author = Voss, Moritz | publisher = Game Tunnel | date = 2005-07-09 | accessdate = 2007-05-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194653/http://www.gametunnel.com/gamespace.php?id=74&amp;tab=3 | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also awarded ''Democracy'' its own 2005 'Simulation Game of the Year' award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=400 | title = 2005 Sim Game of the Year by Game Tunnel | author = Carroll, Russell | publisher = Game Tunnel | date = 2005-12-13 | accessdate = 2007-05-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194512/http://gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=400 | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[About.com]] rated the game 3.5/5 and said "''Democracy'' does exactly what it sets out to do - get you thinking about how even small changes effect [sic] different groups of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/gr/democracy.htm | title = "Democracy" Review | author = Marchelletta, Courtney | publisher = [[About.com]] | accessdate = 2007-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Democracy 3'' also received "mixed" reviews, according to Metacritic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/democracy-3|title=Democracy 3|website=Metacritic|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Polish magazine ''[[CD-Action]]'' stated that the game "does much more for understanding democracy than any citizenship lesson,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/democracy-3/critic-reviews|title=Democracy 3 Critic Reviews|last=|first=|date=|website=Metacritic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Schindel's critical review for ''Unwinnable'' noted several inaccuracies concerning the in-game effects of imposing [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], legalizing drugs, and strong [[Labour law|labor laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unwinnable.com/2018/05/25/democracy-3-and-the-absurdity-of-government/|title=Democracy 3 and the Absurdity of Government|last=Schindel|first=Daniel|date=|website=Unwinnable|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spin-off game, titled ''Democracy 3: Africa'', was quietly released in early 2016. The game focused entirely on nations on the continent of Africa and added features to address the corruption, authoritarianism, military dictatorships, and [[female genital mutilation]] that is abundant on the continent. Players are tasked with fixing these issues, or regressing further into a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/11/03/democracy-3-africa-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://steamcommunity.com/app/427470&lt;/ref&gt;

In midsummer of 2018, Positech Games announced that it would release an updated version of the game, in the form of ''Democracy 4''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcgamer.com/democracy-4-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/15/democracy-4-announced/&lt;/ref&gt; While a specific release date has not been presented, the official website declares that the game will be published in 2019. This title, as with the spin-off, ''Democracy: Africa'', will be produced by a joint venture between [[Positech Games]] and [[Stargazy Studios]]. In addition to ''Democracy: Africa'', Stargazy previously provided translation and [[Video game localization|localization]] services for ''Democracy 3''. New features added to ''Democracy 4'' will include simulated corruption, crackdowns on political freedoms and free speech, and even authoritarianism. Events and decisions in the game will be updated to reflect the passage of time between the release of ''Democracy 3'' and ''Democracy 4''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.positech.co.uk/democracy4/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">'''Digital self-defense''' is the use of [[self-defense]] strategies by [[Internet]] users to ensure [[digital security]]; that is to say, the protection of confidential [[personal electronic information]].&lt;ref&gt;“Components of Security”, http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~snoeren/stp307/ppt/sld002.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Internet security]] software provides initial protection by setting up a [[firewall (computing)|firewall]], as well as scanning computers for [[malware]], [[viruses]], [[Trojan horses]], [[computer worm|worms]] and [[spyware]].  However information at most risk includes personal details such as [[birthdate]]s, [[phone number]]s, [[bank account]] and [[schooling]] details, [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious affiliation]]s, [[email address]]es and [[password]]s.  This information is often openly revealed in [[social networking]] sites leaving Internet users vulnerable to [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and possibly [[Internet crime]]. Mobile devices, especially those with [[Wi-Fi]], allow this information to be shared inadvertently.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital self-defense requires Internet users to take an active part in guarding their own personal information. Four key strategies are frequently suggested to assist that protection.

==Computer security==
Computer security in this context is referring to [[Internet security]] software. The ongoing security of private information requires frequent updating of virus and spyware definitions so that ongoing developments in malicious software cannot interfere with, or copy, private information.&lt;ref&gt;"Secure your computer", © Commonwealth of Australia 2010 and © Stay Smart Online. http://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/home_internet_users/secure_your_computer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Email Accounts and Usernames==

===Choice of Appropriate Email Account===
The practice of utilising more than one [[email]] account to separate personal and business usage from recreational usage is a strategy commonly used to manage personal privacy. The free and ready availability of email accounts from sites such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] or [[Hotmail]] allows the protection of personal identity through the use of different names to identify each email account. These [[throw-away account]]s can be discarded or replaced at will, providing another level of protection.

===Choice of Username===
A [[username]] is required to set up email accounts and to open accounts for various official, commercial, recreational and social networking sites.  In many cases, an email address may also be utilised as a username. Usernames that correlate with personal information such as names or nicknames are more at risk than ones that are cryptic or anonymous, particularly on social and recreational sites.

==Password Strength==
A [[password]] is a mandatory security measure that accompanies usernames. The use of personal data to construct passwords i.e. family members’ names, pet’s names or birth dates increases the risk to confidential information and are easier to crack than long complicated passwords so [[password strength]] is a key strategy for protecting personal information. A password can be weak or strong:a weak password is ''cutekittens'', a strong password is ''?lACpAs56IKMs''.

According to [[Microsoft]] an ideal password should be at least 14 characters in length and have letters, punctuation, symbols, and numbers, where complexity is added by the inclusion of uppercase letters.&lt;ref&gt;"Create Strong Passwords", Microsoft Safety and Security Center. {{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214012154/http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |archivedate=2011-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing Personal Information Using Privacy Options==
[[Social networking]] sites offer greater security risks to personal electronic information because sensitive, private or confidential information such as [[personal identifier]]s are routinely used to create public profiles.&lt;ref&gt;"Safer Social Networking". © Commonwealth of Australia 2010.http://www.cybersmart.gov.au/Parents/Brochures%20and%20posters%20and%20contacts/Cybersmart%20contacts.aspx#Information&lt;/ref&gt; Many websites give options to suppress the amount of personal information revealed through the customisation of privacy settings. However privacy settings can reset if changes to the website occur.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economic systems sidebar}}
The '''economics of fascism''' refers to the [[Economics|economic]] policies implemented by [[Fascism|fascist]] governments. Historians and other scholars disagree on the question of whether a specifically fascist type of economic policy can be said to exist. Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared.&lt;ref&gt;Baker&lt;/ref&gt; Payne, Paxton, Sternhell et al. argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization.&lt;ref&gt;Payne; Paxton, Sternhell, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman and Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and an absence of serious economic thinking. They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Woodley, ''Fascism and Political Theory'', Routlede, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-415-47354-5}}, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics of fascist economies==
The first fascist movements arose in the last years of [[World War I]]. They were a form of radical [[nationalism]] carrying a promise of national rebirth, they blamed [[liberalism]], [[socialism]] and [[Economic materialism|materialism]] for the decadence they perceived in society and culture, and they expressed an appreciation for violence and the role of leadership and willpower in shaping society.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant fascist economic belief was that prosperity would naturally follow once the nation has achieved a cultural and spiritual re-awakening.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''Fascist Economic Policy'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Different members of a fascist party would often make completely opposite statements about the economic policies they supported.&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, "German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler", 1985, pp. 61-68&lt;/ref&gt; Once in power, fascists usually adopted whatever economic program they believed to be most suitable for their political goals. Long-lasting fascist regimes (such as that of [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]]) made drastic changes to their economic policy from time to time.

Fascism rose to power by taking advantage of the political and economic climate of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly the deep polarization of some European societies (such as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]), which were [[democracy|democracies]] with elected parliaments dominated by supporters of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] and [[Marxism|Marxian socialism]], whose intense opposition to each other made it difficult for stable governments to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists used this situation as an argument against democracy, which they viewed as ineffective and weak.&lt;ref&gt;John Weiss, ''"The Fascist Tradition"'', Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1967. pp. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist regimes generally came into existence in times of crisis, when economic elites, landowners and business owners feared that a revolution or uprising was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Leighton, ''"Social Philosophies in Conflict"'', D. Appleton-Century Company, 1937. pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists allied themselves with the economic elites, promising to protect their social status and to suppress any potential working class revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, the elites were asked to subordinate their interests to a broader nationalist project, thus fascist economic policies generally protect inequality and privilege while also featuring an important role for state intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascists opposed both [[Socialism|international socialism]] and [[Free market|free market capitalism]], arguing that their views represented a [[Third Position|third position]]. They claimed to provide a realistic economic alternative that was neither ''laissez-faire'' capitalism nor [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morgan, ''Fascism in Europe, 1919-1945", New York, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; They favored [[corporatism]] and [[class collaboration]], believing that the existence of inequality and social hierarchy was beneficial (contrary to the views of socialists),&lt;ref name = "Mussolini"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1932|title=The Doctrine of Fascism| encyclopedia = [[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|publisher=''Istituto Giovanni Treccani''|location=[[Rome]]}} "[Fascism] affirms the irremediable, fruitful and beneficent inequality of men"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Weiss, ''"The Fascist Tradition"'', Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1967. pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; while also arguing that the state had a role in mediating relations between classes (contrary to the views of liberal capitalists).&lt;ref&gt;Calvin B. Hoover, ''The Paths of Economic Change: Contrasting Tendencies in the Modern World'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 25, No. 1, Supplement, Papers and Proceedings of the Forty-seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association. (March, 1935), pp. 13-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of fascist economies was economic [[dirigisme|dirigism]],&lt;ref&gt;Tibor Ivan Berend, An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; meaning an economy where the government often subsidizes favorable companies and exerts strong directive influence over investment, as opposed to having a merely regulatory role. In general, fascist economies were based on private property and private initiative, but these were contingent upon service to the state.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Gregor, The Search for Neofascism: The Use and Abuse of Social Science, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascist governments encouraged the pursuit of private profit and offered many benefits to large businesses, but they demanded in return that all economic activity should serve the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Gaetano Salvemini]] argued in 1936 that fascism makes taxpayers responsible to private enterprise because "the State pays for the blunders of private enterprise... [[Privatizing profits and socializing losses|Profit is private and individual. Loss is public and social]]".&lt;ref&gt;Salvemini, Gaetano. ''Under the Axe of Fascism'' 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Payne]] argues that fascist movements defended the principle of private property because they held it to be "inherent to the freedom and spontaneity of the individual personality", but that they also aimed to eliminate the autonomy or in some cases the existence of large-scale capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley (1996). ''A History of Fascism''. Routledge. {{ISBN|1857285956}} p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Jurgen Kuczynski characterizes a fascist economy as a type of "monopoly capitalism", which preserves the "fundamental traits of capitalist production", such as the fact that production is carried out for the market by privately owned firms which employ workers for a certain wage.&lt;ref&gt;Kuczynski, Jurgen, "Germany: Economic and Labour Conditions under Fascism", Greenwood Press, New York, 1968. Routledge, {{ISBN|0-8371-0519-6}}, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that fascism is "nothing but a particular form of government within capitalist society",&lt;ref&gt;Kuczynski, Jurgen, "Germany: Economic and Labour Conditions under Fascism", Greenwood Press, New York, 1968. Routledge, {{ISBN|0-8371-0519-6}}, pp. 34&lt;/ref&gt; which instead does feature a major role for the state as was also the case in some early capitalist societies of previous centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kuczynski, Jurgen, "Germany: Economic and Labour Conditions under Fascism", Greenwood Press, New York, 1968. Routledge, {{ISBN|0-8371-0519-6}}, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascism operated from a [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] view of human relations and their aim was to promote superior individuals and weed out the weak.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of economic practice, this meant promoting the interests of successful businessmen while destroying [[trade union]]s and other organizations of the [[working class]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 48-51&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist governments declared the trade union movement illegal and replaced it with labor organizations under the direct control of the government, which ensured that workers could not undertake any effective economic action.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Gorman, ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 1: "Fascism and the Trade Union Movement", 1937, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in these labor organizations was compulsory,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaetano Salvemini]], ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 3: "Italian Trade Unions Under Fascism", 1937, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; their leaders were appointed by the ruling party rather than elected by the members&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaetano Salvemini]], ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 3: "Italian Trade Unions Under Fascism", 1937, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and they were presented as a new type of unions which would serve to harmonize the interests of workers and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaetano Salvemini]], ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 3: "Italian Trade Unions Under Fascism", 1937, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice they primarily served the interests of major business owners, who were able to lobby the ruling party to appoint the leaders they desired.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaetano Salvemini]], ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 3: "Italian Trade Unions Under Fascism", 1937, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In order to maintain and increase the profits of industry, fascist states eliminated the possibility of mass protest and then cut wages either directly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Gorman, ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 1: "Fascism and the Trade Union Movement", 1937, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strike action|Strikes]] were strictly banned and prison sentences could be given to employees who stopped working as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Leighton, ''"Social Philosophies in Conflict"'', D. Appleton-Century Company, 1937. pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, fascists discouraged or banned foreign trade, supporting [[protectionism]]. Fascists believed that too much international trade would make the national economy dependent on international capital and therefore vulnerable to international economic sanctions. Economic self-sufficiency, known as [[autarky]], was a major goal of most fascist governments.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''"Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany"'', Routledge, 1995, {{ISBN|0-415-33629-5}}, pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, fascism was highly [[militarism|militaristic]] and as such fascists often significantly increased [[military spending]]. Recruitment into the military was one of the main policies used by fascist governments to reduce [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Gorman, ''The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism'', Chap. 1: "Fascism and the Trade Union Movement", 1937, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===State capitalism===
{{See also|State capitalism#Use by Italian Fascists|Fascism and ideology#Capitalism}}
Fascism has had complicated relations regarding capitalism, which changed over time and differed between Fascist states. Fascists commonly have sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism to the state.&lt;ref name="comparison1980"&gt;Payne, Stanley G., Fascism: Comparison and Definition. (Madison, Wisconsin; London: University of Wisconsin Press, 1980) p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fascism does support [[private property]] rights and the existence of a [[market economy]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the economic hardships that resulted from "[[war communism]]", which almost toppled the leadership of Soviet Russia in 1921, fascists in Germany and Italy followed the examples of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which had endorsed "[[state capitalism]]" and permitted the public to trade, buy and sell for "private profit".&lt;ref&gt;V. N. Bandera "New Economic Policy (NEP) as an Economic System," ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 71, No. 3 (June, 1963), 265-79: p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Bolsheviks]] were averse to the principles of open markets and profit, they were nonetheless forced by dire circumstances to allow "privatization and private initiative" that resulted in a Soviet "mixed economy".&lt;ref&gt;[[L.K. Samuels]], "The Socialist Economics of Italian Fascism," ''Library of Economics and Liberty'', July 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenez, Peter, ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; For fascist leaders, following the two economic pillars of Fascism—"productionism" and "syndicalism"&lt;ref&gt; [[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;—was more important than adhering to ideological commitments that could risk economic collapse and mass unemployment that had plagued Lenin's nationalization policies.

Mussolini claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would "lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, [whether the outcome be state capitalism or state socialism] the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito; "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933)". ''Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions''. Fertig, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Mussolini identified his economic policies with "state capitalism" and "state socialism", which later was described as "economic dirigisme", an economic system where the state has the power to direct economic production and allocation of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]], ''An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe'', New York: NY, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political economy of Fascist Italy==
{{Main|Economy of Italy under fascism}}

The [[National Fascist Party]] of [[Benito Mussolini]] came to power in Italy in 1922 at the end of a period of social unrest. [[Working class]] activism was at a high point, militant [[trade union]]s were organizing increasingly frequent [[strike action|strikes]] to demand [[labor rights|workers' rights]] and the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was making significant electoral gains. This caused widespread fear among Italian business circles and part of the [[middle class]], who believed that a [[communist revolution]] was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Leighton, ''"Social Philosophies in Conflict"'', D. Appleton-Century Company, 1937. pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt; With the traditional right-wing parties appearing incapable of dealing with the situation, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] turned to the young Fascist movement, which he considered to hold a hardline right-wing orientation by violently suppressing strikes and appointed Benito Mussolini prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Leighton, ''"Social Philosophies in Conflict"'', D. Appleton-Century Company, 1937. pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his rise to power, Mussolini defined his economic stance by saying: "The [Fascist] government will accord full freedom to private enterprise and will abandon all intervention in private economy".&lt;ref&gt;Carl T. Schmidt, ''"The corporate state in action; Italy under fascism"'', Oxford University Press, 1939. pp. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, during the first four years of the new regime under a multiparty coalition government (1922–1925) the Fascists had a generally ''laissez-faire'' economic policy under the Finance Minister [[Alberto De Stefani]], a former stalwart leader in the Center Party.&lt;ref&gt;Howard M. Sachar, ''The Assassination of Europe, 1918-1942: A Political History'', Toronto: Canada, University of Toronto Press, 2015, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Free competition was encouraged and De Stefani initially also reduced taxes, regulations and trade restrictions on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Richman, ''"Fascism"''.&lt;/ref&gt; De Stefani reduced government expenditure and balanced the budget. Some previous legislation introduced by the Socialists, such as the [[inheritance tax]], was repealed.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''"Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment"'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, prosperity increased and by mid-1920s industrial production had passed its wartime peak, but this was accompanied with inflation.&lt;ref name="Patricia Knight page 64"&gt;Patricia Knight, ''Mussolini and Fascism'', Routledge 2003 page 64&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, this was a period when Fascist economic policy mostly followed [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] lines, with the added features of attempting to stimulate domestic production (rather than foreign trade) and balancing the budget.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''"Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment"'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also a period when the Italian Fascist government undertook a large-scale privatization policy, which was among the first such policies in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/12319/RSCAS_2009_46.pdf?sequence=2|title=FROM PUBLIC TO PRIVATE:PRIVATIZATION IN 1920'S FASCIST ITALY|agency=European University Institute|accessdate=5 August 2017|quote=Contemporary economic analyses of privatization have so far overlooked the Fascist privatization policy in 1922-1925 Italy, which may well be the earliest case of large-scale privatization in a capitalist economy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy was the only country that sold state-owned enterprises and assets to private firms in the 1920s; the next country to adopt this approach was Nazi Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/12319/RSCAS_2009_46.pdf?sequence=2|title=FROM PUBLIC TO PRIVATE:PRIVATIZATION IN 1920'S FASCIST ITALY|agency=European University Institute|accessdate=5 August 2017|quote=The Fascist government was alone in transferring State ownership and services to private firms in the 1920s; no other country in the world would engage in such a policy until Nazi Germany did so between 1934 and 1937.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian privatizations included the sale of most state-owned telephone networks and services as well as the former state monopoly on match sale. The state monopoly on life insurance was eliminated, the metal machinery firm Ansaldo was returned to private ownership (after having been nationalized by the previous government) and private firms were awarded concessions to set up tolls on motorways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/12319/RSCAS_2009_46.pdf?sequence=2|title=FROM PUBLIC TO PRIVATE:PRIVATIZATION IN 1920'S FASCIST ITALY|agency=European University Institute|accessdate=5 August 2017|quote=Mussolini’s government privatized the State monopoly on match sale, and suppressed the state monopoly of life insurance; it sold most State-owned telephone networks and services to private firms, reprivatized the metal machinery firm Ansaldo and awarded concessions for tolled motorways to private firms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, "once Mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power... ''laissez-faire'' was progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention, free trade was replaced by protection[ism] and economic objectives were increasingly couched in exhortations and military terminology".&lt;ref name="Patricia Knight page 64"/&gt; De Stefani was forced to resign in 1925 because his policy of free trade was opposed by many Italian business leaders, who favored [[protectionism]] and subsidies to insulate domestic business from international competition. In 1926, Mussolini gave an impassioned speech demanding monetary policies to halt inflation and stabilize the Italian currency (the [[Italian lira|lira]]). He also took the final step of officially banning any kind of strike action. From 1927 to 1929, under the leadership of the new Finance Minister Alberto Beneduce, the Italian economy experienced a period of [[deflation]], driven by the government's monetary policies.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''"Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment"'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Lyttelton (editor), ''"Liberal and fascist Italy, 1900-1945"'', Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Italy was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]]. The Italian economy, having just emerged from a period of monetary stabilization, was not ready for this shock and prices fell and production slowed. [[Unemployment]] rose from 300,787 in 1929 to 1,018,953 in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''"Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment"'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to handle the crisis, the Fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities.&lt;ref&gt;Gaetano Salvemini, ''"Italian Fascism"''. London: Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; The government also issued new securities to provide a source of credit for the banks and began enlisting the help of various [[cartel]]s (''consorzi'') that had been created by Italian business leaders since 1922. The government offered recognition and support to these organizations in exchange for promises that they would manipulate prices in accordance with government priorities.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''"Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment"'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of mixed entities were formed, called ''instituti'' or ''enti nazionali'', whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses. These representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business. The government considered this arrangement to be a success and Italian Fascists soon began to pride themselves on this outcome, saying they had survived the Great Depression without infringing on private property. In 1934, the Fascist Minister of Agriculture said: "While nearly everywhere else private property was bearing the major burdens and suffering from the hardest blows of the depression, in Italy, thanks to the actions of this Fascist government, private property not only has been saved, but has also been strengthened".&lt;ref&gt;Carl T. Schmidt, ''"The corporate state in action; Italy under fascism"'', Oxford University Press, 1939. pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

This economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere in what came to be known as [[corporatism]]. From 1934 onwards, believing that Italy could have avoided the Great Depression if it had not been linked to international markets, Mussolini insisted that [[autarky]] should be one of the primary goals of his government's economic policy. To this end, the Fascists began to impose significant tariffs and other trade barriers.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''"Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment"'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 172&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Mussolini boasted that three-quarters of Italian businesses "is in the hands of the state".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schmidt, ''"The Corporate State in Action London"'', Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1939, pp. 153–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Toniolo, editor, ''The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59; Mussolini’s speech to the Chamber of Deputies was on May 26, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Various banking and industrial companies were financially supported by the state. One of Mussolini's first acts was indeed to fund the metallurgical trust [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]] to the height of 400 millions Liras. Following the deflation crisis which started in 1926, banks such as the [[Banco di Roma]], the [[Banco di Napoli]] or the [[Banco di Sicilia]] were also assisted by the state.&lt;ref name=Guerin3&gt;[[Daniel Guérin]], ''[[Fascism and Big Business]]'', Chapter IX, Fifth section, p.197 in the 1999 Syllepse Editions&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Mussolini created the [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale]] (IRI) with the special aim of rescuing floundering companies. By 1939, the IRI controlled 20% of the Italian industry through [[Government-linked company|government-linked companies]] (GLCs), including 75% of [[pig iron|pig iron production]] and 90% of the [[shipbuilding]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Blinkhorn]], ''Mussolini and Fascist Italy'', 2nd edition, New York: NY, Routledge, 1991, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini also adopted a [[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] policy of government spending on public works to stimulate the economy. Between 1929 and 1934, public works spending tripled to overtake defense spending as the largest item of government expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Nicholas, ''Mussolini: A New Life'', Sterling Publishing, 2005 page 233&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Mussolini said about Keynes that "despite the latter's prominent position as a Liberal", his work may be considered a "useful introduction to fascist economics".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Strachey Barnes]], ''Universal Aspects of Fascism'', Williams and Norgate, London: UK,  1928, pp. 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascists also expressed great interest in the works of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. &lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Pareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, the key question was how actively the rulers ruled and for this reason he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed Mussolini's rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the "pure" economic forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Political Ideologies |last=Eatwell |first=Roger |author2=Anthony Wright  |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=1999 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist intellectuals were determined to foster economic development in order for the economy to “attain its productive maximum”. They believed that their historic responsibility was to "develop to its ultimate conclusion the creative elements that remain alive in capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascists and their precursors had always been focused on the need to bring about a more productive society through the economic collaboration of the classes, opposing class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; They believed in the critical importance of economic productivity as a revolutionary force and they were "productivists, rather than distributionists".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Fascist government also made efforts to appear concerned with the real interests of its subjects in order to create a "consensual, charismatic regime" and to render the masses of the peninsula governable.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist ideologues argued that the discontent of the lower classes represented a potential threat to the "well-being, the internal security, the power and the existence of the state" and therefore measures had to be taken to alleviate this discontent.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued that a "minimal concern for the well-being of the labor force" served the national interest, by improving productive potential.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the government pursued a complex social welfare and assistance program, which "compared favorably with the more advanced European nations" despite the lower level of industrial development on the Italian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship'', Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, following the Italian invasion of [[Ethiopia]], the [[League of Nations]] imposed trade sanctions on Italy. This forced Italy to achieve autarky immediately and strengthened Mussolini's belief that economic self-sufficiency was vital to national security. The sanctions did not have their intended effects because the Italian government had already begun restricting trade and preparing for autarky. In particular, Italy imposed a severe ban on most imports and the government sought to persuade consumers to buy Italian-made products. For instance, it launched the slogan "''Preferite il Prodotto Italiano''" ("Buy Italian produce").&lt;ref&gt;William G. Welk, ''"Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment"'', Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 175&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1935, the government compelled individuals and businesses to turn over all foreign issued securities to the Bank of Italy ([[Banca d'Italia]]). On July 15, 1936, the economic sanctions on Italy were lifted, but the Fascists continued to insist on economic isolation.

Throughout the 1930s, the Italian economy maintained the corporatist model that had been established during the Great Depression. At the same time, Mussolini had also growing ambitions of extending Italy's foreign influence through both diplomacy and military intervention. After the invasion of Ethiopia, Italy began supplying both troops and equipment to the Spanish nationalists under General [[Francisco Franco]], who were fighting in the [[Spanish Civil War]] against a leftist government. These foreign interventions required increased military spending and the Italian economy became increasingly subordinated to the needs of its armed forces. By 1939, Italy had the highest percentage of state-owned enterprises after the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Knight, ''Mussolini and Fascism'', Routledge (UK), {{ISBN|0-415-27921-6}}, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Italy's involvement in [[World War II]] as a member of the [[Axis powers]] required the establishment of a [[war economy]]. This put severe strain on the corporatist model since the war quickly started going badly for Italy and it became difficult for the government to persuade business leaders to finance what they saw as a military disaster. The [[Allied invasion of Italy]] in 1943 caused the Italian political structure and the economy to rapidly collapse. On the other hand, the Allies and the Germans took over the administration of the areas of Italy under their control. By the end of the war, the Italian economy had been all but destroyed—per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Lyttelton (editor), ''"Liberal and fascist Italy, 1900-1945"'', Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political economy of Nazi Germany==
{{Main|Economy of Nazi Germany}}

[[Adolf Hitler]] regarded economic issues as relatively unimportant. In 1922, Hitler proclaimed that "world history teaches us that no people has become great through its economy but that a people can very well perish thereby" and later concluded that "the economy is something of secondary importance".&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, "Hitler's Einstellung", 1976, p. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler and the Nazis held a very strong [[idealism|idealist]] conception of history, which held that human events are guided by small numbers of exceptional individuals following a higher ideal. They believed that all economic concerns, being purely material, were unworthy of their consideration. Hitler went as far as to blame all previous German governments since [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] of having "subjugated the nation to materialism" by relying more on peaceful economic development instead of expansion through war.&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, "German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler", 1985, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, the Nazis never had a clearly defined economic programme. The original "[[National Socialist Program|Twenty-Five Point Programme]]" of the party, adopted in 1920, listed several economic demands,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Stephen J. (1996), Weimar and Nazi Germany, Harcourt Heinemann, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; but the degree to which the Nazis supported this programme in later years has been questioned. Several attempts were made in the 1920s to change some of the program or replace it entirely. For instance, [[Gottfried Feder]] proposed a new 39-point program (1924) that kept some of the old planks, replaced others and added many completely new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, "German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler", Oxford University Press, 1985. p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler refused to allow any discussion of the party programme after 1925, ostensibly on the grounds that no discussion was necessary because the programme was "inviolable" and did not need any changes. At the same time, Hitler also never voiced public support for the programme and many historians argue that he was in fact privately opposed to it. Hitler did not mention any of the planks of the programme in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and only talked about it in passing as "the so-called programme of the movement".&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, "German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler", Oxford University Press, 1985. p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler called his political party "National Socialist", but he was clear to point out that his interpretation of socialism "has nothing to do with [[Socialist mode of production|Marxian Socialism]]", saying that "Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not".&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ludwig Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, University of California Press, 1982, p. 137. Hitler quote from ''Sunday Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later time, Hitler said: "Socialism! That is an unfortunate word altogether... What does socialism really mean? If people have something to eat and their pleasures, then they have their socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, ''"German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler"'', Oxford University Press, 1985. pg 77&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed a wish that he had called his party "social revolutionary" instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Heiden]], "A History of National Socialism", vol. 2, New York: NY, Rutledge, 2010, p. 85.

Hitler made very different statements about his economic views on different occasions and at one point was quoted as saying: "I had only to develop logically what social democracy failed.... National Socialism is what Marxism might have been if it could have broken its absurd ties with a democratic order.... Why need we trouble to socialize banks and factories? We socialize human beings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/Slouch_Purge15.html Nazis and Soviets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511190923/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/Slouch_Purge15.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At another point, Hitler said in private that "I absolutely insist on protecting private property... we must encourage private initiative".&lt;ref&gt;A private statement made by Hitler on March 24, 1942. Cited in ''"Hitler's Secret Conversations." Translated by Norman Cameron and R.H. Stevens. Farrar, Straus and Young, Inc. 1953. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; On yet another occasion, he qualified that statement by saying that the government should have the power to regulate the use of private property for the good of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Allen Epstein, Principles for a Free Society: Reconciling Individual Liberty With the Common Good, De Capo Press 2002, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, he later asserted: "It is my firm conviction that property rights... must be unconditionally respected. Any tampering with them would eliminate one of the most vital incentives to human activity and would jeopardize future endeavor".&lt;ref&gt;''"Hitler's Secret Conversations." Translated by Norman Cameron and R.H. Stevens. Farrar, Straus and Young, Inc. 1953. p. 368. The quoted statement was made by Hitler in May 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler clearly believed that the lack of a precise economic programme was one of the Nazi Party's strengths, saying: "The basic feature of our economic theory is that we have no theory at all".&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, "The German Economy in the Twentieth Century", Routledge, 1990, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hitler's political beliefs]] drew heavily upon [[social Darwinism]]—the view that [[natural selection]] applies as much to human society as it does to biological organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler, "Mein Kampf", vol. 1, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler believed that history was shaped by a violent struggle between [[nation]]s and [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]; and that a nation needed to be united under a strong, centralized state led by an heroic leader in order to succeed in this struggle and that individuals within a nation battled with each other for survival; and that such ruthless competition was good for the health of the nation because it promoted "superior individuals" to higher positions in society.&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Turner, "German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler", 1985, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-war economy: 1933–1939===
Before World War II, the Nazis placed non-Nazi Party professionals in charge of economic policy. Hitler appointed [[Hjalmar Schacht]], a former member of the [[German Democratic Party]], as Chairman of the [[Reichsbank]] in 1933 and minister of economics in 1934. At first, Schacht continued the economic policies introduced by the government of [[Kurt von Schleicher]] in 1932 to combat the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. These policies were mostly [[Keynesian]], relying on large [[public works]] programs supported by [[deficit spending]]—such as the construction of the [[Autobahn]]—to stimulate the economy and reduce [[unemployment]] (which stood at 30% in early 1933). There was a major reduction in [[unemployment]] over the following years, while price controls prevented the recurrence of [[inflation]].

The Nazis outlawed independent [[trade union]]s and banned [[Strike action|strikes]], creating the [[German Labor Front]] (DAF), which became one of the largest organizations in Germany, comprising over 35,000 full-time employees by 1939.&lt;ref&gt; [[Richard Bessel]], ''Nazism and the War'', New York: NY, Modern Library, 2006, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; They also directed Schacht to place more emphasis on military production and rearmament. After the Nazi takeover in 1933, Germany slowly began to recover from the Great Depression. Several economists, such as [[Michal Kalecki]], have seen the German recovery as an example of [[military Keynesianism]]. However, others have noted that the bulk of the German military buildup occurred after 1936 when the economic recovery was well underway.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In the 1930s, Nazi Germany transferred many companies and services from state ownership into the private sector, while other Western capitalist countries were moving in the opposite direction and strove for increased state ownership of industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf|title=Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany|accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Germà Bel|date=13 November 2004|format=PDF|work=[[University of Barcelona]]|publisher=IREA|quote=[T]he Nazi regime transferred public ownership and public services to the private sector.

First, especially in the early years of the Nazi regime, it was used as a way to build good relations between the government and business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf|title=Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany|accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Germà Bel|date=13 November 2004|format=PDF|work=[[University of Barcelona]]|publisher=IREA|quote=It is likely that privatization – as a policy favorable to private property – was used as a tool for fostering the alliance between Nazi government and industrialists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Nazi government greatly increased public expenditure, especially on military re-armament and infrastructure projects. Existing sources of revenue were not sufficient to cover the new expenses, so the government was forced to sell assets in order to gain funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf|title=Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany|accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Germà Bel|date=13 November 2004|format=PDF|work=[[University of Barcelona]]|publisher=IREA|quote=Nazi economic policy implied a sharp rise in public expenditure. The intensity of this increase was unique among the Western capitalist countries in the pre-war period. Consistent with this, financial policy was subject to strong restrictions, and exceptional methods were devised to obtain resources. In fact, Schacht was considered more a financial technician than an economist (Thyssen, 1941, p. 138). Privatization was one of the exceptional methods used.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1933, the Reinhardt Program was introduced. It was an extensive infrastructure development project that combined indirect incentives, such as tax reductions, with direct public investment in waterways, railroads and highways.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century"'', Routledge, 1990, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The Reinhardt Program was followed by other similar initiatives, with the result that between 1933 and 1936 the German construction industry was greatly expanded. In 1933, only 666,000 Germans worked in construction and by 1936 the number had increased to 2,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century"'', Routledge, 1990, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, road construction was expanding at a very rapid pace. This was part of Hitler's war preparations as Germany needed a state-of-the-art highway system in order to be able to move troops and materials quickly. As a side effect, cars and other forms of motorized transport became increasingly attractive to the population, therefore the German car industry also experienced a boom in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century"'', Routledge, 1990, p. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ideology of the Nazi Party was founded on the principle of inequality between races and advocated a war of racial conquest, it also promised social welfare and other benefits for racially pure, able-bodied Germans who supported its aims.&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, ''Hitler’s Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State'', New York: NY, Metropolitan Books, 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Nazi German government established an agency called the [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt]] (NSV, National Socialist People's Welfare) to achieve its goal of racially directed social welfare. Hitler instructed NSV chairman [[Erich Hilgenfeldt]] to “see to the disbanding of all private welfare institutions”, in an effort to direct who was to receive social benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 92, p 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this selective welfare structure, Nazi administrators were able to mount an effort towards the “cleansing of their cities of ‘asocials’”, who were deemed unworthy of receiving assistance for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Geyer, Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Underlining the importance of nationality and race, [[Joseph Goebbels]], the Nazi [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|propaganda minister]], claimed in 1944: “We and we alone [the Nazis] have the best social welfare measures. Everything is done for the nation”.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Klemperer, ''I Will Bear Witness: A Diary of the Nazi Years, 1942-1945'', Vol. 2, Random House, Inc., 2001, p. 317. Goebbels’ editorial was written on April 30, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, military spending in Germany exceeded 10% of GNP (higher than any other European country at the time). Military investment also exceeded civilian investment from 1936 onwards. Armaments dominated government expenditures on goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century"'', Routledge, 1990, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; That year also represented a turning point for German trade policy as world prices for raw materials (which constituted the bulk of German imports) were on the rise. At the same time, world prices for manufactured goods (Germany's chief exports) were falling. The result was that Germany found it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance of payments. A large trade deficit seemed almost inevitable, but Hitler found this prospect unacceptable. Thus Germany, following Italy's lead, began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century"'', Routledge, 1990, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Italy, Germany did not strive to achieve full [[autarky]], even though in May 1933 Hitler's regime had defaulted unilaterally on Germany's foreign debt along with a decree for sweeping capital controls that made it difficult to engage in foreign trade.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Crafts and Peter Fearon, editors, ''The Great Depression of the 1930s: Lessons for Today'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware of the fact that Germany lacked reserves of raw materials and full autarky was therefore impossible, thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners and—when possible—only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century"'', Routledge, 1990, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1930s, the aims of German trade policy were to use economic and political power to make the countries of Southern Europe and the Balkans dependent on Germany. The German economy would draw its raw materials from that region and the countries in question would receive German manufactured goods in exchange. Already in 1938, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece transacted 50% of all their foreign trade with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century"'', Routledge, 1990, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1930s, German businesses were encouraged to form cartels, monopolies and oligopolies, whose interests were then protected by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schweitzer, ''"Big Business in the Third Reich"'', Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1964, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Big Business in the Third Reich'', Arthur Schweitzer states:
{{cquote|Monopolistic price fixing became the rule in most industries, and cartels were no longer confined to the heavy or large-scale industries. [...] Cartels and quasi-cartels (whether of big business or small) set prices, engaged in limiting production, and agreed to divide markets and classify consumers in order to realize a monopoly profit.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schweitzer, ''"Big Business in the Third Reich"'', Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1964, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same book, Schweitzer details the triangular power structure that existed between the Nazi Party, big business and the generals in 1936. Within a few years of Hitler's accession, "middle-class socialism" had been defeated, collective bargaining had been banned and unions had been outlawed—large companies were favored over small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schwietzer "Big Business in the Third Reich"&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Hitler became chancellor, Germany refused to pay its reparation payments as was mandated in the Versailles Treaty. It also diverted large sums of money to rearmament, which violated that treaty. This had the support of the generals and the business community since their profits were guaranteed on these orders.

Under Hjalmar Schacht, a policy was introduced whereby certain nations who traded with Germany (such as the United States) had to deal with special banks. Foreign currency was deposited in these institutions and Americans were paid for their goods (especially raw materials) in ''scrips'' that could only be redeemed for German goods in kind. These scrips soon declined in value as they were not truly fungible and many were used by travellers to Germany in the mid-1930s. Schacht was able to build up foreign currency reserves for later use.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schwwietzer, "Big Business in the Third Reich"&lt;/ref&gt;

Big business developed an increasingly close partnership with the Nazi government as it became increasingly organized. Business leaders supported the government's political and military goals and in exchange the government pursued economic policies that maximized the profits of its business allies.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schweitzer, ''"Big Business in the Third Reich"'', Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1964, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime policies: 1939–1945===
{{See also|Hunger Plan|Forced labor in Germany during World War II}}
Initially, the outbreak of World War II did not bring about any large changes in the German economy. Germany had spent six years preparing for war and a large portion of the economy was already devoted to military production. Unlike most other governments, the Nazis did not increase direct taxes by any significant amount in order to fund the war. The top income tax rate in 1941 was 13.7% in Germany as opposed to 23.7% in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''The German Economy in the Twentieth Century'', Routledge, 1990, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Hitler's policy of  ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") strongly emphasized the conquest of new lands in the East and the exploitation of these lands to provide cheap goods to Germany. However, in practice the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front and the Soviet [[scorched earth]] policy meant that the Germans found little they could use. On the other hand, a large quantity of goods flowed into Germany from conquered lands in the West. For example, two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. Norway lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Braun, ''The German Economy in the Twentieth Century'', Routledge, 1990, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1939 to 1941 and while the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] was in effect, there was trade between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union provided raw materials and Germany provided finished industrial goods. In the first year, Nazi Germany received "one million tons of cereals, half a million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates" and at least one million tons of soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,'' New York: NY, Simon &amp; Schuster (2011) p. 668&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Nazi–Soviet trade included machine tools for manufacturing munitions, the cruiser ''Luetzow'', "plans of the ''Bismarck'', heavy naval guns and other gear and some thirty of Germany's latest warplanes, including the Messerschmitt fighters 109 and 110 and the Ju-88 dive bombers".&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany'', New York: NY, Simon &amp; Schuster (2011) p. 668&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Soviets received diesel engines, generators, turbines, locomotives and “samples of German artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment”.&lt;ref&gt;Text of trade treaty of Feb. 11, 1940 and figures on deliveries, ''Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1919-1945'', VIII, Washington: U.S. Department of State, pp. 762-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,'' New York: NY, Simon &amp; Schuster (2011) p. 668&lt;/ref&gt; This trade ended abruptly in June 1941, when [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]].

Even before the war, Nazi Germany maintained a supply of [[slave labour]]. This practice started from the early days of [[labour camps]] of "undesirables" ({{lang-de|unzuverlässige Elemente}}), such as the homeless, homosexual and criminals as well as political [[dissident]]s, [[communism|communists]], [[Jew]]s and anyone that the regime wanted out of the way. As the war progressed, the use of slave labour experienced massive growth. [[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of war]] and civilian "undesirables" were brought in from occupied territories. Hundreds of thousands of Poles, Jews, [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and other conquered peoples were used as slave labourers by German corporations such as [[Fritz Thyssen|Thyssen]], [[Krupp]], [[IG Farben]] and even Fordwerke—a subsidiary of the [[Ford Motor Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Sohn-Rethel, Alfred ''Economy and Class Structure of German Fascism'', CSE Books, 1978 {{ISBN|0-906336-01-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1944, slave labour made up one quarter of Germany's entire work force and the majority of German factories had a contingent of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Thad Allen, ''The Business of Genocide'', The University of North Carolina Press, 2002. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis also had plans for the deportation and enslavement of Britain's adult male population in the event of a [[Operation Sealion|successful invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, William. ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Arrow books 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of military spending in the German economy began growing rapidly after 1942 as the Nazi government was forced to dedicate more and more of the country's economic resources to fighting a losing war, therefore civilian factories were converted to military use and placed under military administration. By late 1944, almost the entire German economy was dedicated to military production. At the same time, Allied bombings were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tooze, ''The Wages of Destruction'', Penguin Books, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-670-03826-8}}, pp. 648–649&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political economy of Franco's Spain==
[[Francisco Franco]], dictator of [[Franco's Spain|Spain]] from the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the 1930s until his death in 1975, based his economic policies on the theories of [[national syndicalism]] as expounded by the [[Falange]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "phalanx"), the Spanish Fascist party founded in 1933 by [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], which was one of Franco's chief supporters during his bid for power.

===Protectionism and syndicalism===
During and after the Spanish Civil War, Franco and the Falange created a [[corporatism|corporative]] system based on the Italian model. [[Economic liberalism]] was replaced with [[Economic interventionism|economic intervention]] according to the wishes of the corporations, which also set prices and wages. Combined with [[autarky]] and in the absence of [[Marshall Plan]] aid after the [[World War II|Second World War]], Spain's post-war economic growth stagnated. The Spanish corporative system was less successful than the Italian experience. At one point, the Spanish farmers' corporation created a massive bread shortage by setting the price too low. As a result, bread production was abandoned in favour of other, more profitable goods. Although the aim of this policy was to make bread accessible to the poorest among the population, the opposite occurred and a black market emerged.

As in Italy, wages were set by the state in negotiations between officially recognized workers' syndicates and employers' organizations, with the state as mediator. During the Spanish Republic, workers' groups had aligned with the [[Communism|communists]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]] or other [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] forces. However, Franco's regime tended to favour the interests of large businesses despite its syndicalist rhetoric. In response, workers created illegal syndicates and organized strikes, which usually were repressed brutally by Franco's police state.

===Liberalization and Opus Dei===
In 1954, Franco abandoned the corporative system in favour of free market reforms implemented by economic technocrats. Many of these technocrats were members of [[Opus Dei]], a [[Roman Catholic]] lay group to which Franco had given powerful positions within the Ministry of Finance and Economics.&lt;ref&gt;"The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest." ''A Country Study: Spain'' &lt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms of the 1950s were a huge success and Spain experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the "[[Spanish Miracle]]", continuing until Franco's death in 1975. During this period, tourism became an important part of the Spanish economy. Although the corporatist organs and rhetoric from the earlier years of the Franco regime were maintained, they now played a secondary role. Spain's economy was further liberalized by the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] following Franco's death.

===Family finances and ''permiso marital''===
During Franco's years, Spanish law discriminated strongly against married women. Without her husband's approval, referred to as the ''permiso marital'', a wife was prohibited from almost all economic activities, including employment, ownership of property or even travel away from home. The law also provided for less stringent definitions of such crimes as [[adultery]] and desertion for husbands than it did for wives. Significant reforms of this system were begun shortly before Franco's death and they have continued at a rapid pace since then. The ''permiso marital'' was abolished in 1975; laws against [[adultery]] were cancelled in 1978; and [[divorce]] was legalized in 1981. During the same year, the parts of the civil code that dealt with family finances were also reformed.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Eric Solsten and Sandra W. Meditz (eds.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2687">The '''emission reduction unit''' ('''ERU''') is an emissions unit issued under a [[Joint Implementation]] project in terms of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. An ERU represents a reduction of [[greenhouse gas]]es under the Joint Implementation mechanism, where it represents one [[Metric_ton|tonne]] of [[Co2e|{{CO2}} equivalent]] reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php#E |title=Glossary of climate change acronyms 'E' |publisher=UNFCCC |accessdate=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==

To allow comparison between the different effects of gases on the environment, scientists have defined multipliers for gases that compare their greenhouse potency ([[global warming potential]]) relative to that of carbon dioxide.

One example of a [[Joint Implementation]] project resulting in an emission reduction unit, is the production of [[biogas]]es by [[landfill]] sites.  These gases consist of mainly [[methane]] which escapes to the atmosphere if it is not collected.  The main reason for dealing with methane is that it has a 100-year global warming potential multiplier of 25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu PDF] Araxto, P. et al. (2008) ''IPCC WG1 AR4 Report''&lt;/ref&gt; compared to carbon dioxide (i.e. has 25 times the greenhouse potency).  Collection of methane is usually accompanied by its combustion.  Burning one tonne of methane produces nearly 3 tonnes of {{CO2}}, thus reducing its [[greenhouse effect]] by (25-3=22) ERU.

In December 2012, ERU prices crashed to a low of 15 euro cents before recovering to 23c after news that EU’s Climate Change Committee was to vote on a ban of ERUs from countries that have not signed up to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">'''EudraGMP''' is the database of the [[European Community]] of manufacturing authorisations and of certificates of [[Good Manufacturing Practice|good manufacturing practice]]. The EudraGMP system was launched in April 2007, for use by European Medicines Regulators.  Access for the general public, via Internet, is available since 2009 using the URL : http://eudragmp.ema.europa.eu.

EudraGMP is part of the EU telematics strategy, which has been conceived in order to meet the strategic objectives of the [[European Commission]], the [[European Medicines Agency]] and the Member State competent authorities.

EudraGMP is part of a larger database known as EudraGMDP, which contains information on:
* “Manufacturing and import authorisations
* Good manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificates
* Statements of non-compliance with GMP
* GMP inspection planning in third countries” &lt;ref&gt;EudraGMP.EMA. 2007. Web November 13, 2013. http://eudragmdp.ema.europa.eu/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The public database allows the general public access to information regarding manufacturing inspections completed by regulatory authorities from all European Economic Area (EEA) countries. Prior to the enactment of the EudraGMP database, information only came from a limited number of European countries. The European regulatory authorities update the database continuously and expect it to grow extensively over the next few years as more “GMP certificates are imported each year.”  
&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Derek. “Regulatory Highlights from February – July 2011.” Organic Process Research &amp; Development. (2011):15;970-973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The database serves as a quick reference for checking the good manufacturing practice (GMP) of a potential contract manufacturer. One can search by the “company name, location, or certificate number and find details on the types of products or activities that the company conducts and the date of the most recent GMP inspection.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">'''Fabrizio Comencini''' (born 6 November 1953 in [[Garda, Veneto|Garda]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] politician.

Comencini started his political career in the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), for which he was elected to the [[Regional Council of Veneto]] in 1985 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/maggio/19/Liga_veneta_all_attacco_Mai_co_0_9505195163.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, during his second term in the Council, he switched to [[Liga Veneta]]–[[Lega Nord]]. In 1994 he was elected secretary of the party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1994/luglio/31/Bossi_tutto_sbagliato_blind_trust_co_0_9407318636.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1995 he was re-elected to the Council. During his tenure as leader, Lega Nord had its best electoral result so far in Veneto and in any other region, scoring 29.7% of the vote at the [[Italian general election, 1996 (Veneto)|1996 general election]].

In 1998 Comencini broke with [[Umberto Bossi]] in the name of [[Venetian nationalism]] as opposed to [[Padanian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/settembre/18/Liga_Comencini_sbatte_porta_va_co_0_98091812874.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/settembre/23/Liga_vuole_divorzio_dalla_Lega_co_0_98092313070.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/settembre/24/Comencini_autodeterminazione_per_Veneto_co_0_98092411645.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he commanded a majority of Liga Veneta's regional councillors (7 out of 9: [[Ettore Beggiato]], [[Alessio Morosin]], [[Mariangelo Foggiato]], [[Alberto Poirè]], [[Michele Munaretto]], [[Franco Roccon]] and himself), Comencini was not supported by the majority of Liga Veneta who supported [[Gian Paolo Gobbo]] instead. He thus resigned as national secretary and formed a new party called [[Liga Veneta Repubblica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/ottobre/05/Rinasce_Liga_Veneta_Repubblica__co_0_9810052496.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/105565/106042-assemblea-costituente-della-liga-veneta-repubblica-presso-il-palazzetto-dello-sport-di-s-martino-di|title=[106042] - Assemblea Costituente della Liga Veneta Repubblica (presso il Palazzetto dello Sport di S.

Most recently, Comencini ran in the [[Venetian regional election, 2015|2015 regional election]] for [[Independence We Veneto]] (in support of [[Luca Zaia]]'s second term as [[President of Veneto|President]]), but was not elected.

'''Gender-based price discrimination''' is a form of [[economic discrimination]] that occurs when one gender is charged a different price than another gender for identical goods or services.  Race and class-based [[price discrimination]] also exists.&lt;ref name="Dueserhaus"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duesterhaus|first=Megan|last2=Grauerholz|first2=Liz|last3=Weichsel|first3=Rebecca|last4=Guittar|first4=Nicholas A.|date=2011-12-07|title=The Cost of Doing Femininity: Gendered Disparities in Pricing of Personal Care Products and Services|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257772245_The_Cost_of_%20Doing_Femininity_Gendered_Disparities_in_Pricing_of_Personal_Care_Products_and_Service|journal=Gender Issues|volume=28|issue=4|pages=175–191|doi=10.1007/s12147-011-9106-3|issn=1098-092X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of [[discrimination]] often have legal ramifications, but a study of gender-based price discrimination first looks at gendered price disparities. From there, the question of whether gendered price disparities prove an intent to discriminate or constitute illegal discrimination can become a legal inquiry that is developed by examining the law of the applicable [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Ayres"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ayres |first=Ian |last2=Siegelman |first2=Peter |date=1995-01-01|title=Race and Gender Discrimination in Bargaining for a New Car|jstor=2118176|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=85|issue=3|pages=304–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gender-based price discrimination is typically disapproved of, but not universally. In the United States, a few states have adopted statutes forbidding gender-based price discrimination, but these policies are largely unenforced.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=William W.|date=October 2007|title=When Should We Permit Differential Pricing of Information?|url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/55-1-1.pdf|journal=UCLA Law Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, price disparities negatively affect women more often than men. For example, a study by the [[New York City Department of Consumer Affairs]] found that, on average, women's products cost seven percent more than similar products for men.&lt;ref name=nycca&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf |title=From Cradle to Cane: The Cost of Being a Female Consumer|last=|first=|date=December 2015|website=New York City Consumer Affairs|publisher=|access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gender-based pricing exists in many industries, including insurance, dry cleaning, hairdressing, nightclubs, clothing, and personal care products. The legality of gender-based price discrimination in matching markets has been of debate in the United States and European Union since the 1990s. The debate is centered around whether gender-based pricing is a form of gender discrimination. In other words, instead of prices being based on a market-based analysis of the effects on competition, gender-based pricing may instead reinforce negative stereotypes about both women and men in matching markets.&lt;ref name=Tregouet /&gt;

Gender-based price disparities have been found in [[Personal care|personal care products]], [[Retail|retail sales]], and consumer service prices. They also exist in the pricing of insurance, such as [[health insurance]] and [[Vehicle insurance|car insurance]].&lt;ref name=Dueserhaus /&gt; Other studies suggest that gender-based price disparities often occur when negotiating and purchasing new cars.&lt;ref name=Ayres/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2138865 |title=Dealer Price Discrimination in New Car Purchases: Evidence from the Consumer Expenditure Survey on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ayres|first=Ian|date=February 1991|title=Fair Driving: Gender and Race Discrimination in Retail Car Negotiations|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discount prices based on gender may also be a type of gender-based price discrimination. A common gender-based price discount is a "[[Ladies' night]]" promotion, in which female patrons pay less for alcoholic drinks or a lower cover charge than male patrons do.&lt;ref name="Tregouet"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tregouet|first=Thomas|date=July 11, 2015|title=Gender-Base Price Discrimination in Matching Markets|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|publisher=Elsevier|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rank&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rank|first=Jessica E.|date=2005|title=Is Ladies' Night Really Sex Discrimination?: Public Accommodation Laws, De Minimis Exceptions, and Stigmatic Injury |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254657363_Is_Ladies'_Night_Really_Sex_Discrimination_Public_Accommodation_Laws_De_Minimis_Exceptions_and_Stigmatic_Injury |journal=Seton Hall Law Review |doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumption tax]]es on certain products but not others have also been viewed a form of gender-based price disparity. For example, in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, [[tampon]]s are often [[Tampon tax|subjected to a consumption tax]], while related products such as condoms, lubricant, and several other medical items are exempt from the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/tampon-tax-a-bloody-outrage-20130221-2etl5.html|title=Tampon tax a "bloody outrage"|last=Orr|first=Aleisha|website=WA Today|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/31299254/why-the-tampon-tax-is-here-to-stay---for-a-while-at-least|title=Why the "tampon tax" is here to stay - for a while at least|last=reporter|first=Amelia Butterly Newsbeat|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/142965/states-that-tax-tampons-period-tax/|title=These are the states that tax you for having a period|website=Fusion|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the enforcement of laws against gender-based pricing make two arguments. They suggest that courts should dismiss cases involving gender-based pricing because the injury to the plaintiff is so inconsequential that they should not be entitled to relief. They also point to economic efficiency as a justification.&lt;ref name="Rank" /&gt; In response to the economic efficiency argument, scholars suggest that gender-based pricing should be prohibited on moral grounds, stating that gender should not be used as a proxy for other characteristics, especially when based on stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Rank /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Larry|date=November 1992|title=What Makes Wrongful Discrimination Wrong? Biases, Preferences, Stereotypes, and Proxies|url=|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gendered price disparities ==
Gender research has heavily focused on the interaction between gender and the economy. Typically, research in this area involves the issue of the [[gender pay gap]].  Another aspect of gender research in economics is the less studied issue of gender-based price disparities in the cost of goods and services across different industries. Scholars suggest that the existence of gendered price disparities contribute to [[gender inequality]] by creating an economic burden that does not exist for the other gender and by reinforcing [[gender role]]s in the marketplace.&lt;ref name=Dueserhaus /&gt;

=== Personal care industry ===
There are a number of different studies on the price disparities between personal care products and services that are marketed towards females and males. For example, the [[New York City Department of Consumer Affairs]] (DCA) conducted a study of prices of goods in New York City across five industries, including personal care products.&lt;ref name=nycca/&gt; Other universities and academics have also studied the prices in personal care products and services.&lt;ref name=Dueserhaus /&gt;

==== Personal care services ====
While studies have shown significant price disparities in personal care products between men and women, gendered price disparities across personal care services has been inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Dueserhaus" /&gt; A recent study titled ''Cost of Doing Femininity'' examined two areas of personal care services that had directly comparable prices between men and women: hair salons and dry cleaners. The study found that only 15 out of 100 randomly selected hair salons had the same prices for both men and women, and none of the salons charged women less than men. Dry cleaning prices depended on the type and amount of fabric, with more embellishments corresponding with higher prices. This price factor, however, tended to negatively impact women more often than men because women's garments are more likely to be embroidered or be made of delicate fabric.

==== Personal care products  ====
Gendered price disparities in personal care products are more apparent than in personal care services and across other industries. By and large, the price disparities in personal care products are notably higher than in other industries and cost women around 13 percent more than men. This disparity is especially significant considering women purchase these products more regularly than men.&lt;ref name="nycca" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/markets/415/consumer-goods-fmcg/|title=Consumer Goods &amp; FMCG {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/260963/leading-fmcg-companies-worldwide-based-on-sales/|title=Leading FMCG companies worldwide based on sales, 2014 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices for hair products, followed by razors, cost the most for women - typically costing women almost 50 percent more than men.&lt;ref name="nycca" /&gt;

=== Hair care industry ===
Price disparities in hair salon services between men and women are thought to be justifiable because women's hair is often longer and more complicated to maintain and cut. In recent years, however, this stereotype has changed. Men are often experimenting with their hair, including hair loss treatment and hair color. While women may still spend a considerable amount for hair color and other treatments, many women prefer basic haircuts. Additionally, salon-quality hair styling tools are readily available and easy to use at home.&lt;ref name="Liston-Heyes"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liston-Heyes|first=Catherine|last2=Neokleous|first2=Elena|date=2000|title=Gender-Based Pricing in the Hairdressing Industry|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Policy|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gendered price disparities for hair salon services have also been documented in different locations across the United States and Europe. The California Assembly Office of Research conducted a survey of five large California cities and found that forty percent of the hair salons charged women, on average, five dollars more than men for a standard haircut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1996|title=Civil Rights -- Gender Discrimination -- California Prohibits Gender-Based Price Discrimination -- CAL. CIV. CODE S 51.6 (WEST SUPP. 1996)|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gendered price disparities in haircut prices also has been found in New York City: Of 199 hair salons examined, nearly 48 percent of hair-cutters charged women more than men for a simple haircut.&lt;ref name=Dueserhaus /&gt;

=== Vehicle insurance ===
The price disparities between men and women in the [[vehicle insurance]] market is one of the few instances where men typically pay more than women for identical products and services. Unlike in the markets for retail or personal care products, however, these gender-based price differences can be rationally explained. Because men are believed in general to behave in more risky behaviors than women (driving at excessive speeds, driving recklessly, driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, etc.), the cost of insuring men is greater than the cost of insuring women, and this cost difference is reflected in insurance rates calculated in part on the gender of the insured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Christine|last2=Jenkins|first2=Michael|date=July 2006|title=Gender Differences in Risk Assessment: Why do Women Take Fewer Risks than Men?|url=http://journal.sjdm.org/jdm06016.pdf|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|publisher=|volume=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite vehicle insurance typically costing men more, there is some research to suggest that women actually pay more under the fixed annual pricing system because men drive more miles and are involved in twice as many accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Patrick|last2=Butler|first2=Twiss|last3=Williams|first3=Laurie L.|date=June 1988|title=Sex-Divided Mileage, Accident, and Insurance Cost Data Show That Auto Insurers Overcharge Most Women|url=http://www.centspermilenow.org/Reprints/342.pdf|journal=Journal of Insurance Regulation|publisher=National Association of Insurance Commissioners|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Car price negotiations ===
For most Americans, new car purchases are their largest consumer investment after buying a home. In 1991, Harvard Law Professor Ian Ayres examined whether the process of negotiating for a new car disadvantaged women and minorities. The study was conducted in the Chicago area and involved 180 price negotiations at 90 dealerships. The study's testers included individuals of different races and genders and each was instructed to use the same negotiation strategy. Each tester entered a car dealership and bargained to purchase a new car. The results of the study concluded that white males received significantly better prices than non-whites and women. For example, white women paid forty percent more than white men, and black women paid more than three times the price negotiated by white men.&lt;ref name=Ayres/&gt;

=== Health insurance ===
While men engage in more risky health-related behaviors (smoking, drinking excessively, etc.), this is not reflected in the health insurance market, as women tend to pay more than men. Although the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] made gender-based differences in premium prices illegal, this disparity has continued to exist. One explanation for this is that women make more use of the health care services made available to them by their insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4EhDAAAQBAJ|title=Handbook on Gender and Health|last=Gideon|first=Jasmine|date=2016-05-27|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9781784710866|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, women tend to use maternity care or take their children to the doctor.

== Law and policy ==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has not enunciated a workable evidentiary standard to govern claims of subtle and unconscious forms of discrimination.&lt;ref name=Ayres/&gt;  Further, there is no general federal law explicitly prohibiting gender-based price discrimination.&lt;ref name=Ayres /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lam&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/battle-of-the-prices-is-it-ever-fair-to-charge-one-sex-more/381546/|title=Battle of the Prices: Is It Ever Fair to Charge One Sex More?|last=Lam|first=Bourree|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many pricing decisions are made by private businesses, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] generally does not apply, and sex was not included as a protected class under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title II|federal public accommodation law]]. As a result, these issues tend to be [[federalism in the United States|left to the states]].

In recent years, an increasing number of states and localities have enacted laws and policies prohibiting gender-based price discrimination in public accommodations, such as nightclubs and bars.&lt;ref name="Tregouet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rank" /&gt; For example, courts in [[California]], [[Florida]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Iowa]], and [[Maryland]] have consistently ruled against gender-based pricing. However, other states such as [[Illinois]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Michigan]], have adopted a case-by-case approach on the issue.

=== California ===
California passed the Unruh Civil Rights act in 1995, making California the first state to enact legislation to protect against gender-based price discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;CAL. CIV. CODE § 51.&lt;/ref&gt; California Assemblywoman Jackie Speier introduced the Gender Tax Repeal Act to "try to address the persistent problem of gender-based discrimination in the sale of services related to haircuts, laundry, dry cleaning, and alterations."&lt;ref&gt;CALIFORNIA SENATE JUDICIARY COMM., COMMITTEE REPORT FOR 1995 CAL. A.B. 1100, 1995-1996 Reg. Sess. 2 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The law was enacted to prohibit businesses from charging different prices for services based on a customer's gender.&lt;ref name=McMurry&gt;{{cite web|first=Christine |last=McMurry |title=The Cost of the Gender Gap: California has a new law that makes it illegal to charge men and women different prices for the same service. But some businesses are still taking women to the cleaners |website=SFGATE |date=May 19, 1996|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-Cost-of-the-Gender-Gap-California-has-a-new-2981757.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"According to the California Assembly's Office of Research's study, 64 percent of dry cleaners in five metropolitan areas charged women more than men to launder an identical article of clothing, and 40 percent of hair salons charged women more for basic haircuts."&lt;ref name=McMurry/&gt;}} The Gender Tax Repeal Act provided for civil actions in which courts may award a minimum of $1,000 or up to three times the amount of actual damages in addition to attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' CAL. CIV. CODE § 51.6(d), 52(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the Gender Tax Repeal Act aided in combating gender-based price discrimination in the pricing of services, but did not prohibit such price differentials with respect to products.

On January 21, 2016, California State Senator Ben Hueso introduced Senate Bill 899&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB899 S.B. 899, 2015-2016 Reg. Session (Cal. 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; to extend prohibiting gender-based price discrimination from services to products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20160417/pink-tax-comes-under-fire-after-research-shows-womens-products-costlier-than-mens Teri Sforza, ‘Pink Tax’ comes under fire after research shows women's products costlier than men's]. Los Angeles Daily News (Apr. 17, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Senate Bill 899 proposed to prohibit businesses from price discriminating with respect to goods of "similar or like kind" based on a customer's gender. On March 31, 2016, Senator Hueso introduced amendments clarifying that businesses may charge more for a product if there are legitimate differences in costs of labor, materials, or tariffs.&lt;ref name="CALIFORNIA SENATE JUDICIARY COMM 2016"&gt;CALIFORNIA SENATE JUDICIARY COMM., COMMITTEE REPORT FOR 2016 CAL. S.B. 899, 2015-2016 Reg. Sess. 12 (Mar. 31, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments also clarified that "substantially similar" products included products of the same brand, share the same functional components, and share 90 percent of the same materials and ingredients.&lt;ref name="CALIFORNIA SENATE JUDICIARY COMM 2016" /&gt; Senate Bill 899, sponsored by Consumer Federation of California, received support from the American Civil Liberties Union of California, California Public Interest Research Group, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, and Women's Foundation of California.&lt;ref name="CALIFORNIA SENATE JUDICIARY COMM 2016" /&gt; On April 12, 2016, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 5-1 in favor of Senate Bill 899 and will advance the bill with a Senate Hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB899 SB-899 Gender Discrimination, History, California Legislative Information], (Apr. 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miami-Dade County, Florida ===
In 1997, [[Miami-Dade County]] in Florida passed an ordinance prohibiting businesses from charging different prices for products or services based solely on the customer's gender. However, businesses are permitted to charge a different price for products or services that involve more time, difficulty, or cost.&lt;ref name=Ordinance/&gt;{{efn|"Nothing in this section prohibits bona fide discount programs based on gender classifications so long as such programs are not designed, intended or used to deny any individual or group access to the premises or the right to patronize the premises and such program is for a limited period of time."&lt;ref name=Ordinance/&gt;}} Miami-Dade County's ordinance also permits limited discount programs based on gender.&lt;ref name=Ordinance&gt;Miami-Dade County, Fl., Gender Price Discrimination Ordinance (May 20, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, a business may advertise "Ladies Free on Friday Night", as long as men are not prevented from patronizing the business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamidade.gov/business/laws-price-gender.asp MIAMI-DADE COUNTY CONSUMER PROTECTION, Price Gender Discrimination] (Feb. 26, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George W. Taylor''' (July 10, 1901 – December 15, 1972) was a notable [[professor]] of [[industrial relations]] at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and is credited with founding the academic field of study known as [[industrial relations]].&lt;ref name="Shils1"&gt;Shils, "George W. Taylor: Industrial Peacemaker," ''Monthly Labor Review,'' December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He served in several capacities in the federal government, most notably as a [[mediation|mediator]] and [[arbitration|arbitrator]].  During his career, Taylor settled more than 2,000 [[strike action|strikes]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;"George W. Taylor Dies At 71," ''The New York Times,'' December 17, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, he helped draft the [[New York (state)|New York]] state [[civil service]] law which legalized [[collective bargaining]] in that state but which also banned strikes by public employees—legislation widely known today as the [[Taylor Law]].&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, ''Administering the Taylor Law: Public Employee Relations in New York,'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Taylor was born in the Kensington industrial neighborhood of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on July 10, 1901.  His uncle owned a textile mill, and his father, Harry Taylor, was a superintendent at a hosiery mill.  He graduated from [[Frankford High School]] in 1919.  Taylor intended to go into the mills after graduating from high school, but his high school principal persuaded him to attend college instead.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

In 1921, Taylor graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[economics]] from the Wharton School.  His senior thesis was on the history and overdevelopment of the hosiery industry in Pennsylvania. He became a professor in the department of [[business administration]] at [[Albright College]], and obtained his [[doctorate]] in economics from the Wharton School in 1929.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1926, George Taylor introduced the [[Hemline index]] theory, which holds that hemlines on women’s dresses fluctuate with the economy, measured by stock prices or gross domestic product. The "theory"  still receives regular attention in the media and, in 2010, some academic validation.

In 1930, Taylor received an appointment as an assistant professor at his alma mater, the Wharton School.  In his first years as a professor at Wharton, Taylor founded the academic field of industrial relations, which covered labor arbitration, mediation, and other forms of [[alternative dispute resolution]]. In his lifetime, he became known as the "Father of American Arbitration."&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

Teaching was Taylor's first love throughout his life.  He often said that he "had chalk in his veins" and hated to leave the classroom.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt; He was recognized as a dynamic speaker and excellent lecturer, and remained a highly sought-after public speaker even at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

Taylor was named a full professor in 1944, and was eventually named to the Gaylord P. and Mary Louise Harnwell Professor of Industry. Upon his retirement from active teaching in 1964, the University of Pennsylvania named the endowed chair after him.  He continued to lecture and speak to students on campus until his death in 1972.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

==Industrial relations career==
In 1928, Taylor received his first commission as an industrial relations specialist.  His thesis on the hosiery industry in Pennsylvania led [[Emil Rieve]], president of a Pennsylvania hosiery workers' union, to seek his help as an umpire in an organizing dispute. In 1929, he settled his first strike, at the Aberle Hosiery Mill near [[Reading, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

Taylor received national acclaim for helping mediate an end to a strike at Apex Hosiery in Philadelphia in 1932. Under the terms of the 1931 [[collective bargaining]] agreement between the Full Fashioned Hosiery Manufacturers of America and the [[American Federation of Hosiery Workers]], he was appointed "impartial chairman" for the independent arbitration committee established by the contract. The position became a model for similar collective bargaining clauses nationwide.  During his 10 years as impartial chairman, Taylor established a national minimum wage in the hosiery industry.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

In 1935, after a period of service to the federal government, Taylor become impartial chairman for a labor arbitration committee established by the Men's Clothing Manufacturers' Association and the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]]. He held that position until 1961.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

By 1940, Taylor had settled roughly 1,400 labor disputes without a strike.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

In 1941, Taylor served as an impartial arbitrator between the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) and [[General Motors]]. During this time, he became close with UAW president [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

Taylor entered federal service again in 1951.  He left it in 1952, and although he continued to teach at the Wharton School he also was the official arbitrator of internal [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) jurisdictional disputes.  He served in this capacity for three years, and his work became a model for handling inter-union disputes after the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) and CIO merged in 1955.&lt;ref name="Shils2"&gt;Shils, ''Industrial Peacemaker: George W. Taylor's Contribution to Collective Bargaining,'' 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime, Taylor was credited with coining a number of common collective bargaining terms, including "tandem," "escalator clause," "productivity improvement," "interplant inequity," and "ability to pay."&lt;ref name="Shils2" /&gt;

Taylor was a strong advocate of private sector collective bargaining, but believed that governments had the right to significantly restrict collective bargaining and the right to strike in the public sector.  He was a strong advocate of the [[National Labor Relations Act]], and vehemently condemned the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] as poor public policy and an improper restriction on the right to strike.  In many important labor disputes, however, Taylor often took positions opposed to those advocated by [[trade union|labor unions]] because Taylor believed strikes should serve the public and not a private good.&lt;ref name="Shils2" /&gt; As he once noted:
:There is too much talk about the right to strike and too little about the purpose of strikes and whether they serve their purpose. But what really is thrilling is when representatives of labor and management finally come to an agreement and realize the immense satisfaction of having created order out of conflict. I think that's the essence of democracy.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

==Public service==
In 1933, Taylor was appointed chairman for the Philadelphia regional office of the [[National Labor Board]]. Later that year, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed him assistant deputy administrator of the [[National Recovery Administration]]. Taylor left federal service in 1935, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the [[Fair Labor Standards Administration]] throughout the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

President Roosevelt appointed Taylor vice chairman of the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board]] in 1942. He became the board's chairman in 1945. In July 1942, Taylor wrote the wage decision popularly known as the "Little Steel formula" which gave workers employed by smaller steel companies only modest pay increases for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky and Van Tine, ''John L. Lewis: A Biography,'' 1992, p. 418-420; Atleson, ''Labor and the Wartime State: Labor Relations and Law During World War II,'' 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The board applied the "Little Steel formula" to nearly every American industry during [[World War II]]. The decision was severely criticized by organized labor, but Taylor considered it to be one of the most significant, well-written, and well-founded policy decisions he ever made.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"War Labor Board," ''Time,'' January 19, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Harry S. Truman]] named Taylor secretary of the National Labor-Management Conference in 1946. The same year, Truman appointed Taylor chairman of the Advisory Board of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. Taylor also served as a consultant to the [[Commission on Reorganization of the Executive Branch]] from 1948 to 1949.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

In 1951, Truman appointed Taylor director of the [[Wage Stabilization Board]].&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, "New Englander Is Designated Economic Stabilization Head," ''New York Times,'' November 27, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[steel strike of 1959]], President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] appointed Taylor chairman of the Presidential Board of Inquiry created when Eisenhower invoked the cooling-off provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. Despite Taylor's role in helping Eisenhower win a court injunction stopping the strike for 90s days, Taylor became involved in helping end the strike.  He assisted [[United Steelworkers of America]] counsel [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[Kaiser Steel]] heir [[Edgar Kaiser, Sr|Edgar Kaiser]] negotiate an agreement which later formed the basis for the national collective bargaining agreement which settled the strike.&lt;ref&gt;Shils, "Arthur Goldberg: Proof of the American Dream," ''Monthly Labor Review,'' January 1997; Stebenne, ''Arthur J. Goldberg: New Deal Liberal,'' 1996; Rose, "The Struggle Over Management Rights At US Steel, 1946-1960: A Reassessment of Section 2-B of the Collective Bargaining Contract," ''Business History Review,'' Autumn 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed Taylor to the President's Advisory Committee on Labor Management Policy. During his tenure on the committee, Taylor helped craft a long-term contractual solution to a series of wildcat strikes which had plagued the aerospace industry since World War II. Taylor also resolved railroad disputes in 1964 and 1967, and in 1968 settled the long-running copper mining strike.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

In 1961, Taylor led a commission appointed by [[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] which crafted a settlement that led to collective bargaining for [[teacher]]s in [[New York City]]. The subsequent election led to the founding of the [[United Federation of Teachers]] (UFT).  In 1965, Taylor led a fact-finding board which the UFT used to win its first collective bargaining agreement with the city.&lt;ref&gt;Selden, ''The Teacher Rebellion,'' 1985; Taft, ''United They Teach: The Story of the United Federation of Teachers,'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Taylor's most famous (and, according to New York state labor leaders, notorious) act as a public official was his role in crafting New York's "Taylor Law." In the wake of the formation of the UFT and (more immediately) a [[1966 New York City transit strike]], [[Governor#United States|Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] appointed a Committee on Public Employment Relations to study the state's public employee collective bargaining laws. Taylor led the other five members of the panel in proposing new legislation which gave New York's public employees significantly stronger collective bargaining rights.  On April 25, 1967, Gov. Rockefeller signed the Public Employees Fair Employment Act into law.  Popularly known as the "Taylor Law," the Act is considered a model for public sector labor legislation. The law established collective bargaining rights for state-employed workers, and set up procedures and mechanisms for county and local public workers to establish unions and bargain collectively.&lt;ref name="Donovan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearney"&gt;Kearney, ''Labor Relations in the Public Sector,'' 1984; Marmo, ''More Profile Than Courage: The New York City Transit Strike of 1966,'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two aspects of the law, however, drew harsh criticism from organized labor. Section 210 prohibits public employees from striking, and fines the union double the amount of each striking employee's salary for each day the strike lasts. Section 201, Part 4, of the law prohibits employers from negotiating benefits provided by a public retirement fund or providing income to public sector retirees.&lt;ref name="Donovan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt;

==Personal life and honors==
President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] awarded Taylor the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on December 3, 1963.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

On January 5, 1995, Taylor was inducted into the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] [[Labor Hall of Fame]] for his contributions to industrial relations.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

During his life, Taylor became close friends with many of the most important labor and government officials of his day: [[Frances Perkins]], [[Cyrus Ching]], [[George Meany]], [[Philip Murray]], [[Clark Kerr]], [[Walter Heller]], [[Henry J. Kaiser]], [[John L. Lewis]], [[George Schultz]], [[John Thomas Dunlop|John Dunlop]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]].&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt;

Taylor retired from the Wharton School in 1971.&lt;ref name="Shils1" /&gt; He died at his home in Philadelphia on the evening of December 15, 1972. He was survived by his wife, the former Edith Ayling; he had no children.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

'''Interest group liberalism''' is [[Theodore Lowi]]'s term for the [[clientelism]] resulting from the broad expansion of public programs in the [[United States]], including those programs which were part of the "[[Great Society]]."

Lowi's seminal book, first published in 1969, was titled ''[[The End of Liberalism]]'', and presented a critique of the role of [[Advocacy group|interest groups]] in American government,&lt;ref&gt;Theodore J. Lowi. ''The End of Liberalism: The Second Republic of the United States'', (W. W. Norton &amp; Co Inc.) 2nd edition, 1979. {{ISBN|0-393-09000-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that "any group representing anything at all, is dealt with and judged according to the political resources it brings to the table and not for the moral or rationalist strength of its interest."&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Woolley, Albert Papa. ''American Politics: Core Argument/Current Controversy'', 2nd ed.  (Prentice Hall) 2002. pp. 174. {{ISBN|0-13-087919-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lowi's critique stood out in sharp contrast to theories of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], championed by [[Robert Dahl]] and others, which argued that [[Advocacy group|interest groups]] provide competition and a necessary democratic link between people and government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">The '''International Network of Museums for Peace''' (originally the International Network of Peace Museums) was established following a conference in [[Bradford]] in 1992. At this conference, for the first time, directors and curators of peace and anti-war museums worldwide came together. The loose network which emerged aimed to promote cooperation between [[peace museum]]s and to stimulate the creation of new peace museums across the world.

==Background==
===Early years===
Between 1992 and 2009, the network was very informal, sustained by occasional newsletters between international conferences. As the number of peace museums worldwide increased, however, the network needed to formalise its structures. Steps towards addressing this were taken at the [[Gernika]] conference of 2005, including changing the name of the organisation to the '''International Network of Museums for Peace''' (INMP).

===2009-2014===
In 2009 the INMP was established as a [[foundation (nonprofit)]] in [[The Hague]] and, with the support of the municipality, opened its [[secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] and archive in a modern office near the [[Peace Palace]] in 2010. In 2011, the building in which the office is housed, was renamed to the [[Bertha von Suttner]] Building. Since 2014 the INMP, as an international [[Ngo|NGO]], has been granted special Consultative Status from the [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]], and gained [[Algemeen nut beogende instelling|ANBI]]-status in the Netherlands. The foundation consists of a General Coordinator, ten international [[Executive Board]] members and twelve international members in the Advisory Committee. The secretariat office is managed by a part-time Secretariat Administrator.

===Museums for Peace===
The definition of Museums for Peace according to the INMP is non-profit educational institutions that promote a [[peace|culture of peace]] through interpreting, collecting and displaying peace related material. They inform the public about peace and nonviolence using illustrations from the lives of individuals, the work of organizations, campaigns and historical events. Included are also peace related sites, centers and institutions which are involved in peace education through exhibitions, documentation and other related activities.

===Aims===
Since 1992 the aims of the INMP have been 
#to promote cooperation between [[peace museum]]s and 
#to stimulate the creation of new peace museums across the world. However, with the establishment of the INMP as a [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]], five more aims have been added.
#To the secretariat, to make a mainstay in the daily operation and development of the INMP and 
#to recruit an extensive database of Museums for Peace. As well as 
#organizing international conferences
#educational projects and 
#travelling exhibitions on the promotion and stimulation of peace.

'''Jean-Baptiste Chavannes''' (born 1947 in Haiti), educated as an [[agronomist]].

==Biography==
Chavannes founded the Peasant Movement of Papay (MPP) in 1973 to teach Haitian principles of [[sustainable agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/04/22/nijhuis-jean-baptiste/ Jean Baptiste Chavanne]&lt;/ref&gt; The MPP has become one of the most effective [[peasant movement]]s of Haiti's history, succeeding in terms of economic development, environmental protection and the survival of each.

Chavannes continues his work despite the [[politics of Haiti|political climate in Haiti]], which remains unstable. He has been exposed to several assassination attempts during periods of political destabilization in Haiti.&lt;ref name=goldman-jean-baptiste/&gt; Death threats have forced into exile between 1993 and 1994. He received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 2005 for his work on [[forest protection]].&lt;ref name=goldman-jean-baptiste&gt;{{cite web

She is also an Adjunct Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Sydney]] [[Sydney Law School|Law School]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellis|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Ellis (journalist)|url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/from-bomaderry-to-the-old-bailey/370|title=From Bomaderry to the Old Bailey|work=The Global Mail|date=6 September 2012|archive-url=https://archive.li/20130916204417/http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/from-bomaderry-to-the-old-bailey/370/|archive-date=16 September 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson is best known for her role as a long-standing member of the legal team defending [[Julian Assange]] and [[WikiLeaks]].  She has also provided legal assistance to activists from [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-30/defending-west-papuan-activism/4234616 "Defending West Papuan activism"], [[Australia Network]] News, 18 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2012 profile in ''[[The Global Mail]]'', journalist [[Eric Ellis (journalist)|Eric Ellis]] called her "an eloquent activist for the world's downtrodden and disenfranchised".&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;

==Education==
Robinson grew up in [[Berry, New South Wales]], and attended [[Bomaderry, New South Wales|Bomaderry High School]]. She then attended the [[Australian National University]], where she graduated with a double degree in Law and Asian Studies, specialising in international law, Indonesia and South East Asia. She was awarded the [[University Medal#As award on graduation|University Medal in Law]] and was a Distinguished Scholar in Asian Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://news.anu.edu.au/2013/05/21/just-cause |title=Just cause - News &amp; events - ANU |publisher=News.anu.edu.au |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at the ANU, she also completed studies at the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

She was a [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where she attended [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] with Distinction and a [[Master of Philosophy]] in [[International Public Law]].&lt;ref name=theaustralian&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/julian-assanges-homegrown-hardnosed-lawyer/story-e6frg97x-1226286602968 |title=The Australian 02/03/2012 |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |date=2013-08-29 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Robinson was called to the Bar in 2016 and joined [[Geoffrey Robertson]] QC's Doughty Street Chambers, having known Robertson since her period at Oxford University in the mid-2000s. They outlined the case for an Australian Bill of Rights, as well as a legal opinion on crimes against humanity in Iran. Robertson describes Robinson as "exceptional in being able to understand the practicality of the case as well as being quite brilliant academically. That is why she is such a good lawyer. She is passionate about her clients but sensible enough to keep a certain distance in order to argue their case with power and objectivity".&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;

From 2009, she worked at the London law firm of Finers Stephens Innocent LLP, where her practice was largely media defence, freedom of information and free speech litigation, acting for clients such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[CNN]], [[Associated Press]] and [[Bloomberg News]]. She also provided international human rights advice, including on humanitarian issues in post-conflict Iraq, extraordinary rendition and international criminal law. Robinson has engaged in strategic free speech litigation before the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]], the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. She has challenged obscenity convictions in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/opbp/past_volunteers.php |title=Oxford Law :: OPBP: past volunteers |publisher=Law.ox.ac.uk |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Geoffrey Robertson QC, she acted in the first application before the UK Supreme Court, popularly known as the "alphabet soup" case, where they were successful in overturning reporting restrictions in anti-terrorist asset freezing cases in Mohammed Jabar and Others v HM Treasury [2010] UK SC 1.&lt;ref name="justinian1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.justinian.com.au/featurettes/jennifer-robinson.html |title=Jennifer Robinson - Featurettes - Justinian: Australian legal magazine. News on lawyers and the law |publisher=Justinian |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also acted in the first application, before the UK Supreme Court intervened on behalf of media defence organisations in the [[Max Mosley]] case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/julian-assanges-homegrown-hardnosed-lawyer/story-e6frg97x-1226286602968 | work=The Australian | title=Julian Assange's homegrown hardnosed lawyer Jennifer Robinson | date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instructed by [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Sam Harris]] in 2009, she worked with Robertson on establishing the legal case that the Pope and the Vatican were responsible for crimes against humanity, as a result of widespread child sex abuse within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=nstore&amp;kw=jennifer+robinson&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=5years&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=ILL1009113FLE84HGQ66 |title=News Store |publisher=Newsstore.fairfax.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This case was later submitted to the ICC Prosecutor by the Center for Constitutional Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/icc-vatican-prosecution-0 |title=ICC Vatican Prosecution &amp;#124; Center for Constitutional Rights |publisher=Ccrjustice.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson advised ''The New York Times'' during its phone-hacking investigations in London, including its story about the extent of involvement of [[Andy Coulson]], who became the press adviser to the UK Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]]. The newspaper's stories claimed phone hacking was not isolated to a few rogue journalists and that knowledge and approval of the practice went right up the chain to ''[[News of the World]]'' editors.&lt;ref name="justinian1"/&gt; Robinson began advising [[Julian Assange]] and WikiLeaks in October 2010.&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"/&gt;

In late 2011, she became Director of Legal Advocacy advising the Bertha Foundation, with the task of creating and developing a global human rights and public interest law program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berthafoundation.org/introducing-bertha-justice-initiative-staff/ |title=Introducing Bertha Justice Initiative Staff |website=berthafoundation.org |publisher=Bertha Foundation |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program aims to support organisations practicing public interest law and to promote movement lawyering, and provide a clear career track into public interest and human rights law for young lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berthafoundation.org/justfellows.html |title=Bertha Foundation |publisher=Bertha Foundation |date= |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson said, "I’m really excited about the opportunity to inspire the next generation of human rights lawyers. Why be one human rights lawyer when you can inspire a whole new generation?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://news.anu.edu.au/2013/05/21/just-cause/ |title=Just cause - News &amp; events - ANU |publisher=News.anu.edu.au |date=20 May 2013|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Robinson spoke at [[TEDx]] Sydney. Entitled "Courage is Contagious", her speech to an audience of over 2,500 informed about human rights issues and the political situation in [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] through the lens of exiled leader [[Benny Wenda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Courage-is-Contagious-Jennifer;search%3Atag%3A%22TEDxSydney%22 |title=Jen Robinson TEDx speech |publisher=TEDx |date= |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent cases include acting for the [[BBC World Service]] to take action against Iran for the persecution of BBC Persian staff and their families, the first time in BBC history that BBC journalists have appealed to the UN for their protection,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/human-rights-appeal-un|title=BBC - BBC makes unprecedented human rights appeal to UN  - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acting with French counsel for a group of NGOs from around the world in challenging the cross-jurisdictional impact of the right to be forgotten in Google v CNIL before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]] and the [[European Court of Justice|European Court of Justice .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doughtystreet.co.uk/news/article/18-ngos-file-an-intervention-before-frances-highest-court-on-dangers-of-the|title=18 NGOs file an intervention before France’s highest court on dangers of the ‘right to be forgotten’ {{!}} Doughty Street Chambers|website=www.doughtystreet.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defending Wikileaks and Assange==
Robinson began advising WikiLeaks in October 2010, and she remains a member of his legal team under the direction of Baltasar Garzon. She has defended Assange in extradition proceedings in London, advised WikiLeaks through the publication of secret [[United States diplomatic cables leak|American diplomatic cables]] and the [[Chelsea Manning]] (formerly Bradley Manning) proceedings and has travelled the world "advocating for Assange's rights both at law and in principle, in the process becoming one of the most recognisable faces of WikiLeaks".&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"/&gt;

Lawyers Rights Watch wrote a complaint to the US Government in 2010, "alarmed by actions of US State Department Legal Advisor Harold Hongju Koh" that had put Robinson "in jeopardy and interfere with the right of her client Julian Assange, to be represented". In correspondence with Robinson and Assange that was leaked to the press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/11/28/us-wikileaks-usa-letter-idUSTRE6AR1E420101128 |title=Text of State Department letter to Wikileaks &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=28 November 2010|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] made a number of unsubstantiated claims against both Assange and Robinson, as his lawyer, which were denounced &lt;sup&gt;by whom?&lt;/sup&gt; as being in breach of the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] Defenders and the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]]. Lawyers Rights Watch denounced that "Mr. Koh [had] invited upon Ms Robinson the denunciation and possible violence already directed at her client. The intention to put Ms Robinson’s personal and professional safety at risk and to interfere with Mr. Assange’s right to be legally represented is inescapable."

Robinson said Koh's actions were "inappropriate" and her law firm requested a public retraction. No answer was ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/05/julian-assange-lawyers-being-watched |title=Julian Assange's lawyers say they are being watched &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government contractor [[HBGary]] listed her with journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] as one of the targets of a "strategic plan" designed to undermine WikiLeaks’ operations in a leaked proposal entitled "The WikiLeaks Threat".&lt;ref name="wikileaks1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.ch/IMG/pdf/WikiLeaks_Response_v6.pdf |title=wlr_final.pptx [Lecture seule&amp;#93; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WL Central |url=http://wlcentral.org/node/1250 |title=2011-02-09 Security Contractor HBGary Tries to Protect US from Anonymous, WikiLeaks [UPDATE:1 |publisher=WL Central |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was developed by HBGary Federal, provider of classified cybersecurity services to the Department of Defense and other US Government agencies, at the request of law firm Hunton and Williams acting on behalf of Bank of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/Data-intelligence-firms-proposed-a-systematic-attack-against-WikiLeaks/12751/ |title=Data intelligence firms proposed a systematic attack against WikiLeaks |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan states that without the support of individuals like Robinson, "WikiLeaks would fold" but that "ultimately most of them if pushed will choose professional preservation over cause". This included plans to use disinformation, create messages around actions of sabotage, work to discredit organisations and call out the errors, and to fuel groups feuding around WikiLeaks operations.&lt;ref name="wikileaks1"/&gt; These tactics have been described by some as illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/174741/how-spy-agency-contractors-have-already-abused-their-power# |title=How Spy Agency Contractors Have Already Abused Their Power |publisher=The Nation |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Robinson has continued to be publicly critical of the US Government's handling of the Chelsea Manning case, as well as the investigation into Assange and WikiLeaks and, in particular, the secrecy surrounding both. She worked with the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] in applying for greater public access to the Manning proceedings&lt;ref name="tedxsydney1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxsydney.com/site/speakerProfile.cfm?speaker=277|title=Australian Ideas Worth Spreading|date=2013-05-04|publisher=TEDxSydney|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confronted US Attorney-General [[Eric Holder]] about his legacy and his plans to prosecute Assange in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/01/31/holder_on_assange_prosecution_we_will_see/ |title=When a WikiLeaks lawyer runs into Eric Holder |publisher=Salon.com |date=31 January 2012|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to her article about her encounter with Holder, American journalist [[Michael Hastings (journalist)|Michael Hastings]] was critical of press reporting on Assange's case, said that Robinson "has to do a reporter’s job as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mmhastings/status/164322949107683328 |title=Twitter / mmhastings: Jennifer Robinson, Assange's |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, ''The New York Times'' confirmed the existence of the grand jury investigation into Assange and WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/world/europe/wikileaks-back-in-news-never-left-us-radar.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=David | last1=Carr | first2=Ravi | last2=Somaiya | title=Assange, Back in News, Never Left U.S. Radar | date=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Papua advocacy==
In 2002, Robinson worked as a volunteer at the Institute for Advocacy and Study of Human Rights (Elsham), a human rights organisation in West Papua, Indonesia until her stay was cut short by the first Bali bombings.

Robinson also acts as a lawyer for the West Papuan independence leader [[Benny Wenda]],  having helped him gain political asylum in the UK in 2003, and has toured with him to the US, Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. She is also the co-founder of [https://www.ilwp.org/ International Lawyers for West Papua].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrlc.org.au/conviction-of-west-papuan-independence-activists-breaches-human-rights-16-march-2012 |title=Joint Statement of HRLC and ILWP |publisher=HRLC |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kent E. Hovind''' (born January 15, 1953) is an American [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] evangelist and [[tax protester]]. He is a controversial figure in the [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] movement whose ministry focuses on [[Denialism|denial]] of scientific theories in the fields of biology ([[evolution]]), [[geophysics]], and [[cosmology]] in favor of a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of the [[Genesis creation narrative]] found in the [[Bible]]. Hovind's views, which combine elements of [[creation science]] and [[conspiracy theory]], are dismissed by the scientific community as [[fringe theory]] and [[pseudo-scholarship]]. He has been criticized by Young Earth Creationist organizations like [[Answers in Genesis]] for his continued use of discredited arguments that have been abandoned by others in the movement.

Hovind established Creation Science Evangelism (CSE) in 1989 and Dinosaur Adventure Land in 2001 in [[Pensacola, Florida]]. He frequently spoke on Young Earth creationism in schools, churches, debates, and on radio and television broadcasts. His son Eric Hovind took over operation of CSE after Hovind began serving a ten-year prison sentence in January 2007 for federal convictions for failing to pay taxes, obstructing federal agents, and [[structuring]] cash transactions.

In a separate federal court case in early 2015, a jury found Hovind guilty of [[contempt of court]] in connection with a charge of disobeying a prior court order. The trial court, however, threw out the verdict and rendered a judgment of acquittal, concluding that Hovind could not have disobeyed that order.

In 1971, he graduated from [[East Peoria Community High School]] in [[East Peoria, Illinois]]. He entered the accredited [[Illinois Central College]], then transferred to the unaccredited [[Midwestern Baptist College]] in 1972, attaining a [[bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] of Religious Education in 1974.&lt;ref name="affidavit1998" /&gt; In 1988 and 1991 respectively, Hovind received a master's degree and doctorate in Christian Education through [[correspondence school|correspondence]] from (also unaccredited) [[Patriot Bible University|Patriot University]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;now Patriot Bible University in [[Del Norte, Colorado|Del Norte]], Colorado, which no longer offers this program&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HovindWhereDidYou"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.drdino.com/FAQs/FAQmisc13.jsp | title=Where did you get your degree? | publisher= DrDino.com (archived) |year= 2000 | first=Kent | last=Hovind | accessdate= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20000903025232/http://www.drdino.com/FAQs/FAQmisc13.jsp | archivedate= 2000-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forrest"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/19/5/unmasking-false-prophet-creationism | title=Unmasking the False Prophet of Creationism| publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date=September 1, 1999 | first=Forrest| last=Barbara | accessdate = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having a website called "Dr. Dino" has provoked some academics to look closely at how Hovind presents his education and credentials.

=== Creation Science Evangelism and Creation Today ===
&lt;!-- Eric Hovind redirects to this section.  If the title of this section is changed, please update the redirect page.--&gt;

Hovind established Creation Science Evangelism in 1989 to evangelize and teach [[creationism]].&lt;ref name="TCM2012-281" /&gt; In May 1999, his son Eric joined Creation Science Evangelism as a speaker, and his daughter Marlissa began training to become Hovind's secretary.&lt;ref name="EricJoins1999" /&gt; That year, CSE merged with Faith Baptist Fellowship of Hawthorne, Florida, beginning a relationship that lasted until 2002. In 2003, with the aid of [[Embassy of Heaven|Glenn Stoll]] (a promoter of tax-avoidance schemes), Hovind set up a series of entities starting with "an unincorporated association of pure trust" on May 13, under which a [[corporation sole]] and several ministerial trusts were established starting on May 23. CSE properties were conveyed to the trusts which operated under business licenses from the [[Embassy of Heaven|"Kingdom of Heaven"]].&lt;ref name="OrderonProperty" /&gt; Hovind is associated with the [[Unregistered Baptist Fellowship]] (UBF), a loosely affiliated group of roughly 100 churches which share a "theology of Christian resistance" to civil governments. Because the UBF would consider it an acknowledgement of government authority over the church, they reject the highly favorable [[501(c)3]] status, which makes donations tax deductible and exempts them from income tax, but not FICA taxes or employee income tax withholding.&lt;ref name="SPLC2001"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2001/seizure-indianapolis-baptist-temple-ends-standoff-%E2%80%98unregistered%E2%80%99-church-movement-continues |title=Seizure of Indianapolis Baptist Temple Ends Standoff, But 'Unregistered' Church Movement Continues |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=May 8, 2001 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurst-Swanger2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurst-Swanger|first=Karel|title=Worship and Sin: An Exploration of Religion-related Crime in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9N7nPf_0ePUC&amp;pg=210|accessdate=2016-02-24|year=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-6387-2|pages=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UBF holds that governmental authority stops "at the threshold of the church",&lt;ref name="Kurst-Swanger2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unregisteredbaptistfellowship.org/about/ |title= About UBF |date= March 13, 2015 |website= Unregistered Baptist Fellowship |access-date= 2016-02-24 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151127170532/http://unregisteredbaptistfellowship.org/index.php/content/about-ubf |archive-date= 2015-11-27 |dead-url= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hovind has likened his ministry's status to that of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]].&lt;ref name="DALFight" /&gt; When the federal government obtained a [[search warrant]] in 2004, an [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) criminal investigator made the [[sworn declaration|sworn statement]] that the organization did not have a business license and did not have tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="ParkFinance" /&gt;

To the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] creationist, Hovind's approach relies upon a strict literal reading of the [[King James Version|King James translation]]. Where Jews interpret the Hebrew through [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], Hovind relies on a direct reading of English. For example, Hovind claims that the word ''dinosaur'', which was introduced to English in 1841, refers to what previously had been called ''dragon''. Dragon is used where ''[[Tannin (monster)|tannin]]'' ({{lang-he|{{linktext|תנין}}}}) appears, but it means ''serpent'' or ''crocodile''.&lt;ref name="HeresyNS" /&gt;

=== Anti-evolution claims ===

Hovind contends that [[Darwinism]] produced "[[Communism]], [[Socialism]], [[Nazism]], [[abortion]], [[liberalism]] and the [[New Age Movement]]".&lt;ref name="radicalreligion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JarrettKentState" /&gt; He blamed the forced [[Cherokee]] resettlement on a belief in evolution, although the [[Trail of Tears]] preceded ''[[Origin of Species]]'' by roughly two decades.&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KauffmanYD" /&gt; Hovind maintains that biology textbooks are lying in order to brainwash youth.&lt;ref name="Brainwashed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creationtoday.org/downloads/files/411PDF.pdf |title=Are You Being Brainwashed |publisher=Creation Science Evangelism |year=2007 |first=Kent | last=Hovind |page=6 |accessdate=2016-03-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209112154/http://www.drdino.com/img/brainwashed_low.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rauser2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rauser|first=Randal |authorlink=Randal Rauser|title=You're Not As Crazy As I Think: Dialogue in a World of Loud Voices and Hardened Opinions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7-SYWacongC&amp;pg=PA144|date=January 6, 2012|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-5979-5|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Satan is using evolution theory to make kids go to hell."&lt;ref name="CreationEvolutionMeyer"&gt;{{cite news | first=Zlati | last=Meyer | title=Creation v Evolution Topic of Student Forum: A FLA.

In the [[pseudoscience]] of [[cryptozoology]], Hovind published and co-authored ''Claws, Jaws, and Dinosaurs'' with [[Mokele-mbembe#2000: Gibbons|William Gibbons]], another Creationist who has searched for [[Mokele-mbembe|dinosaurs in the Congo]] under the belief that discovering a [[cryptid]] would somehow undermine evolutionary theory and that dinosaurs were [[dragon]]s.&lt;ref name="LoxtonProthero2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loxton|first1=Daniel |authorlink1=Daniel Loxton|last2=Prothero|first2=Donald R. |authorlink2=Donald Prothero|title=Abominable Science: Origins of the Yeti, Nessie, and other Famous Cryptids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UV2sAgAAQBAJ|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15320-1|pages=293, 308–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dinosaur Adventure Land had displays about the existence of the [[Loch Ness monster]]&lt;ref name="Grant2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John |authorlink=John Grant (author)|title=Denying Science: Conspiracy Theories, Media Distortions, and the War Against Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anPotGg3tcUC|date=October 4, 2011|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-400-5|pages=159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Beowulf]]'' as history rather than legend.&lt;ref name="CSICOP" /&gt;

Prior to his convictions, Hovind was a prolific debater.

In 1993, Hovind announced that he would be debating the renowned evolutionary biologist, [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who had a longstanding opposition to debating Creationists and had turned down numerous challenges. When contacted about the announcement, Gould said he had never heard of Hovind, much less agreed to debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Cole|title=Gould to Debate Creationist—NOT|journal=NCSE Reports|date=Summer 1993|volume=13|number=2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, [[Michael Shermer]] debated Hovind in front of a predominantly [[creationist]] audience. Shermer claimed the exchange was "not an intellectual exercise", but rather "an emotional drama," and concluded, "Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion."&lt;ref name="ShermerHovind"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/04-05-10.html#miracle | title=Then a Miracle Occurs: An Obstreperous Evening with the Insouciant Kent Hovind, Young Earth Creationist and Defender of the Faith | publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|eSkeptic Online]] | date=May 10, 2004 | first=Michael | last=Shermer | accessdate = 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massimo Pigliucci]] also debated Hovind, and expressed surprise at Hovind's ignorance of evolutionary theory.

During a debate with [[Farrell Till]], Hovind said that [[Donald Johanson]] had uncovered the leg bones of [[Australopithecus afarensis|Lucy]] at a different site over a mile away from the reported site, in a deeper [[stratum]], quipping, "I would like to know how fast the train was going that hit that chimpanzee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theskepticalreview.com/tsrmag/1hovin94.html | title=On the Till-Hovind Debate |publisher=The Skeptical Review online | date= January–February 1994 | first=Karen | last=Bartelt | accessdate = 2015-05-19}} reprinted in [http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v02/n03/ The REALL News] 2(2) (March 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This was clearly contrary to the published statements by Johanson.

=== $250,000 offer ===

In 1990, Hovind made a $10,000 offer to anyone who could meet a set of requirements he said would prove evolution, and he later raised the amount to $250,000.&lt;ref name="offer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.drdino.com/read-article.php?id=66 | title=Hovind's $250,000 Offer | publisher=DrDino.com ([[archive.org|Archived]]) | year= 2009 | first=Kent | last=Hovind | accessdate = 2009-04-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090424080647/http://www.drdino.com/read-article.php?id=66 |archivedate = 2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Creation Science Evangelism removed the offer from its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creationtoday.org/teaching-evolution-indoctrination-as-education/ |title=Teaching Evolution|publisher=CreationToday.org |first= |last= |date=2012-10-14|accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;NOTE: When I use the word evolution, I am not referring to the minor variations found in all of the various life forms ([[microevolution]]). I am referring to the general theory of evolution which believes these five major events took place without God:

1. Time, space, and matter came into existence by themselves.

2. Planets and stars formed from space dust.

3. Matter created life by itself.

=== Political activity ===

In 1999, a [[Bradenton, Florida]] pastor asked the school board to consider adding Creationism to the curriculum. The school board chairman's actions raised issues when, in his capacity as a citizen, he helped fund a series of seminars by Hovind, but he was within ethical guidelines. More controversy was raised when a school employee was sent to videotape the lectures, although without intention for rebroadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Ayres|first=Annette|date=December 2, 1999|title=Ethics Question Arises from Creationism|newspaper=Bradenton Herald|page=Local 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, there was no curriculum change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=Brandon |title=Going Ape: Florida's Battles Over Evolution in the Classroom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coRmngEACAAJ|year=2014|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=978-0-8130-4943-4|pages=145–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hovind was criticized for his involvement with [[Arkansas House of Representatives|Arkansas state Representative]] [[Jim Holt (Arkansas politician)|Jim Holt]]'s Anti-Evolution Bill in 2001 (House Bill 2548).&lt;ref name="Hovindconnection"&gt;Don Michael, "The Hovind connection: Check your facts, legislators."

Opponents of the bill worried that it would subject Arkansas to the same type of derision that occurred when the state's balanced-treatment law was struck down in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/159282/ | title='Extremist' Holt?

In 2007, [[David Vitter]] added a $100,000 [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] in a [[U.S. Senate]] appropriations bill, directed towards the [[Louisiana Family Forum]] "to develop a plan to promote better science education". Their website included a document, {{"'}}A Battle Plan—Practical Steps to Combat Evolution' by Kent Hovind". After a reporter's inquiries, the document, which called evolution "not a harmless theory but a dangerous religious belief" and blamed it for atrocities by [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Pol Pot]], was removed from their website. The earmark was withdrawn from the bill.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Rise and Fall of the Vitter Earmark |first=Glenn |last=Branch |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/27/5-6/rise-fall-vitter-earmark |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education (online edition) | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] |date=September–December 2007 | volume=27 | number=5–6 | pages=9–12 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics and conspiracies ==

Hovind has made controversial remarks regarding conspiracies, science, creation, equal rights, religion, and government. His presentations on creationism and evolution are a mix of [[Christian Fundamentalism]] and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name="ShermerHovind" /&gt; His creationist presentations have asserted that [[creationism]] is not taught in public schools due to a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order conspiracy]], established by [[Satan]] and involving [[Ted Turner]] and [[Jane Fonda]], the [[British Royal Family]], the [[State of Israel]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (which he calls "the American Communist Lawyers Union"), U.S. government officials, business leaders, and social activists. In May 1999, he claimed "the implementation of the NWO's world-domination plan was May 5, 2000."&lt;ref name="Holley2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Delphia"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/rncse/19/5/dr-dino-does-delphia | title=Dr Dino Does 'Delphia | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |year= 1999 | accessdate = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|The Hovind Bankruptcy Decision}}

On March 1, 1996, Hovind filed a Chapter 13 [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] petition to avoid paying federal [[Income tax in the United States|income taxes]], claiming he was not a citizen of the United States and that he did not earn income.&lt;ref name="Bankruptcy"&gt;''In re Hovind'', case no. 96-04256, U.S. Bankr.

The court upheld the IRS's determination that his claim "was filed in bad faith for the sole purpose of avoiding payment of federal income taxes" and called Hovind's arguments "patently absurd". It also said that "the IRS has no record of the debtor ever having filed a federal income tax return."&lt;ref name="Bankruptcy" /&gt;

In 1998, the IRS requested account information about Hovind from an internet provider after Hovind made claims on an internet broadcast about his own [[Tax noncompliance|tax law noncompliance]], going back to the 1970s. When the provider initially balked, the courts granted a subpoena on the basis that the IRS could demonstrate that Hovind had received income but had filed no income tax returns going back to 1991.&lt;ref name="Baruh2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baruh | first=Lemi | title=Read at your own risk: shrinkage of privacy and interactive media | journal=New Media &amp; Society | volume=9 | issue=2 | year=2007 | pages=187–211 |issn=1461-4448 |doi=10.1177/1461444807072220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Hovind would tell ''The New York Times'', "I haven't filed a tax return in 30 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/02/technology/your-own-affair-more-vcr-or-less-mp3.html | title=Your Own Affair, More (VCR) or Less (MP3) | publisher=New York Times |date= October 2, 2003 | accessdate = 2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Kent Hovind 2005 Affidavit}}

On May 13, 1998, Hovind and his wife filed a "Power of Attorney and Revocation of Signature" document in [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]] which would nullify any of their promises, debts, or legal agreements made prior to April 15, 1998. The Hovinds claimed they had signed government documents "due to the use of various elements of fraud and misrepresentations, duress, coercion, under perjury, mistake, 'bankruptcy'," and argued that [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] is a "[[Ponzi scheme]]". The document referred to the [[United States Government]] as "the 'bankrupt' corporate government", renounced the Hovinds' [[United States citizenship]] and [[Social Security number]]s to become "a natural citizen of 'America' and a natural sojourner", and referred to their home state of Florida as "the State of Florida Body-Politic Corporation."&lt;ref name="PowerofAttorney"&gt;[http://www.escambiaclerk.com/xml_or_1b.asp?uinstr=1998483189 "Power of attorney and revocation of signature"], May 5, 1998.

At various times, the government alleged that Hovind had not filed personal U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1989 through 1997.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Hovind'', 197 B.R. 157 (Bankr. N.D.

On July 7, 2006, the [[United States Tax Court]] found that Hovind was deficient in paying his federal income taxes in 1995–1997, totaling $520,099. The Tax Court ruled that the IRS had a valid [[lien]] on Hovind's property and said that Hovind's defense was based on "bizarre arguments, some of which constitute [[tax protester arguments]] involving excise taxes and the alleged '100% voluntary' nature of the income tax."&lt;ref name="TCM2006-143" /&gt; With penalties, he owed $3.3 million for tax years 1998–2006 by 2013.&lt;ref name="PayTaxes2013"&gt;{{cite news | title='Dr. Dino' ordered to pay taxes, penalties | last=Heisig | first=Eric | date=May 23, 2013 | periodical=Pensacola News Journal | url=http://www.pnj.com/article/20130523/NEWS01/305230028/-Dr-Dino-ordered-pay-taxes-penalties}} The story can be found in the collection: [http://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/escambia-county/2014/11/11/evolution-dr-dino/18850377/ "The evolution of 'Dr. Dino{{'"}}].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/UstcDockInq/DocumentViewer.aspx?IndexID=6019947 Order and decision], United States Tax Court, Docket 4245-10.

=== Federal criminal tax-related trial and convictions in 2006 ===

On July 11, 2006, Hovind was [[Indictment|indicted]] on 58 counts in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida|District Court in Northern Florida]] in Pensacola. The first 12 counts were charges for willful failure to collect, account for, and pay over federal income taxes and [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]] taxes in connection with the CSE operation, totaling $473,818 for the 12 fiscal quarters of 2001–2003. The next 45 counts were charges for knowingly structuring transactions by making multiple cash withdrawals totaling $430,500 in amounts just under the $10,000 which requires reporting (a technique known as "[[Structuring]]"), for which his wife was also charged. The last count was a charge of corruptly endeavoring to [[Obstructing government administration|obstruct and impede the administration of the internal revenue laws]] by falsely listing the IRS as his only creditor when filing for bankruptcy, filing a false and frivolous lawsuit against the IRS in which he demanded damages for criminal trespass, making threats of harm to those investigating him and to those who might consider cooperating with the investigation, filing a false complaint against IRS agents investigating him, filing a false criminal complaint against IRS special agents (criminal investigators), and destroying records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/HovindIndictment.pdf Indictment, ''United States of America v.

At [[arraignment]], Hovind claimed incomprehension to the charges, telling the court: "I still don't understand what I'm being charged for and who is charging me."&lt;ref name="arrested" /&gt; The presiding [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judge]] asked Hovind if he wrote and spoke English, to which Hovind responded, "To some degree."

At first he attempted to enter a plea of "subornation of false muster," but then entered a not guilty plea "under duress" when the judge offered to enter a plea for him. When asked about his home, Hovind called it a "church parish", and denied any residence except the "church of Jesus Christ", worldwide.&lt;ref name="pleads" /&gt; Hovind's passport and guns were seized. Hovind protested, arguing that he needed his passport to continue his evangelism work, and that "thousands and thousands" were waiting to hear him preach in South Africa the following month. The court refused to reconsider, accepting the argument that "like-minded people" might secret Hovind away if he left the country.&lt;ref name="arrested" /&gt;

The trial began on October 21, 2006. Hovind hoped to convince a jury that his amusement park admission and merchandise sales, over $5 million from 1999 through March 2004, belonged to God and could not be taxed.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; Evidence produced at the trial revealed that Jo Hovind had requested financial assistance from Baptist Healthcare by claiming that the Hovinds had no income.&lt;ref name="PNJdenyincome" /&gt; IRS agents told the court how Hovind had attempted "bullying tactics" and had sued the government three times to pressure them to stop investigating. The lawsuits had been thrown out.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; The prosecution countered attempts to describe workers as missionaries, ministers, and volunteers, introducing memos in which they had been called employees. Workers testified that they had to punch time cards, had vacation and sick days, and did not receive [[Form W-2|W-2 tax forms]]. After the IRS executed the search warrant, employees were required to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s to remain employed.&lt;ref name="employees" /&gt; A lawyer who did work for a non-profit Christian organization testified that Hovind claimed that Hovind had "beat" the tax system and that he favored cash transactions because they were untraceable and, consequently, untaxable.&lt;ref name="detailedactions"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/pnj/access/1748332621.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+21%2C+2006&amp;author=Michael+Stewart&amp;pub=Pensacola+News+Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=Lawyer%3A+Hovind+detailed+actions |title=Lawyer: Hovind detailed actions: Evangelist said he 'beat the system' |first=Michael | last=Stewart |publisher=Pensacola News Journal |date= 21 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2015, the trial began in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida|U.S. District Court for Northern Florida]].

On Monday, May 18, 2015, the U.S. District Court made two decisions.

{{Main|Land reform in Vietnam}}
[[Land reform]] in [[North Vietnam]] (Vietnamese: ''Cải cách ruộng đất tại miền Bắc Việt Nam'') can be understood as an agrarian reform in northern Vietnam throughout different periods, but in many cases it only refers to the one within the regime of Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in the 1950s. Land reform in North Vietnam is one of the most important economic and political programs launched by Viet Minh government during the years 1953-1956.

== Background ==
The project of land reform in North Vietnam was a product of the interplay of complex internal and external factors. On 9 March 1945, several years after occupation in Indochina, Japan instigated a military coup, threw away the French administration in Indochina and established a puppet indigenous government headed by Tran Trong Kim. However, five months later, Japan unconditionally surrendered. Taking the political vacuum, Viet Minh seized power by launching a nationwide revolution, and founded the DRV in Hanoi in September 2.

Soon after that, Vietnam saw an influx of big power. The [[Kuomintang]] Chinese armies accepted the surrender of Japan in Vietnam North of the 17 parallel, with the British in the south. Both of them negotiated and facilitated the French return. After negotiations between Viet Minh and the French broke down, the war between them started from late 1946 until 1954; this is called the First Indochina war (1946-1954).

In the whole of the 1940s, Viet Minh fought solely against the French army. In terms of military capability, Viet Minh was in position of clear-cut disadvantage; this did not change until the establishment and involvement of the [[People's Republic of China]]

During this period of time, the DRV government was dominated by Viet Minh who was popular among the indigenous political force; its domestic policy was to unite all possible forces for resistance war.&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyễn Xuân Minh. Lịch sử việt nam 1945-2000'', Nhà Xuất Bản Giáo Dục 2006, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also embraced peasants, workers, students and some merchants and intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Duiker. ''The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam''. Westview special studies on South and Southeast Asia, 1981, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 1945, the ICP declared its dissolution, aiming at downplaying the role of communist ideology by dissolving and forcing the ICP underground for garnering more support from the masses. &lt;ref&gt;[http://123.30.190.43:8080/tiengviet/tulieuvankien/tulieuvedang/details.asp?topic=168&amp;subtopic=463&amp;leader_topic=981&amp;id=BT19121236285 Vietnamese Communist Party online Newspaper, 18 December 2012.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120174444/http://123.30.190.43:8080/tiengviet/tulieuvankien/tulieuvedang/details.asp?topic=168&amp;subtopic=463&amp;leader_topic=981&amp;id=BT19121236285 |date=20 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the [[People's Republic of China]] by overtaking its political rivalry with the KMT, which had a major impact on the political landscape of the region in general and Vietnam in particular.&lt;ref&gt;郭明. 《中越关系演变四十年》[''Four Decade’ Evolution of Sino-Vietnamese Relations''], 广西人民出版社，1992 年, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the CCP’s perspective, the Chinese revolutionary model was intended to be exported to the Asian countries, Vietnam included.&lt;ref&gt;King C. Chen. ''Vietnam and China, 1938-1954''. Princeton University Press, 1969, pp. 213-214.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the increasing influence in its southern periphery was also for national defense and security.&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Zhai. ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975''. University of North Carolina Press, First Edition, 2000, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the DRV, communist China was a good ally who shared the same ideology and similar approaches to complete communist revolution. They were glad to conduct a binary revolution at the same time: externally anti-colonialism and internally anti-feudalism. Thus [[Ho Chi Minh]] plead proactively for Chinese aid&lt;ref&gt;King C. ''Chen. Vietnam and China, 1938-1954''. Princeton University Press, 1969, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing formal diplomatic relations with the PRC in early 1950, Luo Guibo became the first Chinese ambassador to the DRV, and Chinese aid also flooded into the DRV, the most significant of which was the Chinese advisory group, which was later sent to North Vietnam in the same year.

Basically, Chinese advisory groups had a double mission. The most important one was to provide advice on military affairs. After winning military victories in a series of military campaigns with considerable help from August 1950 onward, the DRV not only gradually turned around the war situation but also expanded its controlling areas. This conducive environment facilitated the DRV to carry out its land reform plan.

As a government dominated by the communists, land reform was an integral part of its revolution. After its first trial failed in the 1930s, Vietnamese communists never had a real chance to carry out it, even during a long time after the foundation of the DRV. For the sake of war, communist slogans were even diminished. Instead, they needed support from landowners and landlords. However, Chinese assistance outweighed domestic support from feudal classes and communism was re-emphasized. The Indochinese party was divided along national lines and the Vietnamese Worker’s party (VWP) was officially formed in early 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher E. Goscha. ''Going Indochinese: Contesting Concepts of Space and Place in French Indochina''. Nordic Inst of Asian Studies; 2nd revised edition, 2012, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, land reform was put on its agenda. More comprehensive and stricter land policies were formulated, and class struggle was emphasized as inseparable from the military struggle for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Alex-Thai D. Vo. ''Nguyễn Thị Năm and the Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953''. Journal of Vietnamese Studies, Vol. 10 No. 1, winter 2015; pp. 1-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the French and American-sponsored Quoc Gia Viet Nam (the State of Vietnam) emerged and was recognized by western powers. Particularly after the Bao Dai solution, the DRV faced a competent rivalry regime which contested its monopolistic representation of the Vietnamese people. In this situation, Truong Chinh in his report to the party Congress in 1951 pointed out that as soon as the Bao Dai regime was set up, the landlord class aligned itself with the State of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Ngoc-luu Nguyen. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', pp. 255-256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except international and domestically political factors, as Bernard B. Fall pointed out, land reform was also necessary for economic reasons. 90 percent of the population lived by agriculture, but the problem was the enormous population pressure put upon the relatively small fertile areas. In the Red River delta, 9 million people were crowded into an area of 5790 square miles.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard B. Fall. ''The Viet-Minh Regime: Government and Administration in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam''. Institute of Pacific Relations, 1956, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of population under  the DRV were peasants but did not have land to till, which was an unjust situation.&lt;ref&gt;Ngoc-luu Nguyen. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', Universiteit van Amsterdam, 1987, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of WWII in Indochina, people suffered a lot from famine and lack of enough food due to continuous conflicr. Improving their welfare can consolidate the Viet Minh’s regime by garnering more support. Collective ownership as a palliative to landlessness has been a century-old practice throughout Vietnam and as for individuals, they were deprived of rice fields and had to turn to support to the communal land.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard B. Fall. ''The Viet-Minh Regime: Government and Administration in the Democratic Republic of Vietna''m. Institute of Pacific Relations, 1956, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, there is a saying called “Phép Vua Thua Lệ Làng”, literally meaning that the emperor is secondary to village customs and implicitly indicating that national rule at the village was given a way to autonomous rule by village itself. This was also true for the DRV government; their influence in the grass roots is relatively weak. Land reform served as a good way to cement its power at the grass roots level.

== Implementation ==
Land reform in North Vietnam was a grand project. At the beginning, it was a relatively mild campaign; later on, it was radicalized and caused serious effects. When the top leaders notices the side effects, they tried to rectify the caused errors.

'''Pre-1953 communist land policy in DRV'''

Social revolution is part of revolution led by the Communist Party. However, for a long time, the regime failed to grasp the essential tasks of Vietnamese national democratic revolution and placed too much emphasis on unity with landlords in the interest of national resistance, and did not pay much attention to the peasant and land issues.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Ngoc-luu. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', pp. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt; What they did was to adopt a middle way: landlords agreed to decrease the land rent and the peasants still needed to pay rent but with a lower rate. The land rent reduction was formulated in July 1949.&lt;ref&gt;J. Price Gittinger. ''Communist Land Policy in North Viet Nam''. Far Eastern Survey, Vol. 28, No. 8 (Aug., 1959), pp. 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, all pre-1953 policy had failed in breaking through the landlord’s economic and political power and in serving the interests of the peasants. According to VWP’s mouthpiece Nhan Dan, even landlords were allowed to join the party, which somehow dominated the party chapters in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Ngoc-luu. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', pp. 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;
DRV gradually abandoned its former policy toward landlords and peasants. From 14 to 23 November 1953, VWP organized a national conference, in this meeting, anti-feudalism was put much emphasis on.The most important change was that a new approach was adopted, which was mass mobilization for class struggle.

Land reform constituted two successive campaigns: land rent reduction campaign (1953-1954) and land reform campaign proper (1954-1956). The first campaign included eights waves and the second had five waves.&lt;ref&gt;Lê Quỳnh Nga. ''Quan điểm tiến hành cải cách ruộng đất ở Việt Nam trong những năm 1945-1956 qua các nghị quyết Trung Ương Đảng'' [The VCP’s Views of the Land Reform Process Seen from the Resolutions of the Party Central Committee 1945-1956]. See: http://www.hids.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=ab315600-73a5-4c2b-b062-f7966e824087&amp;groupId=13025.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hoang Van Chi who was a former member of DRV and fled to South Vietnam in the mid-1950s, these two campaigns had but one purpose, namely the liquidation of the landowning class and the subsequent establishment of a proletarian dictatorship in the countryside. The only notable difference between them was the degree of violence and the nature of the wealth confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Hoàng Văn Chí. ''From Colonialism to Communism: A Case History of North Vietnam''. London: Pall Mall, 1964, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land Rent Reduction Campaign'''

After being trained by Chinese, through the local party-cell, Vietnamese cadres were sent to the village and lived with a few landless peasants. They practiced the “Three Together System”, namely, worked together, ate together and lived together. By doing so for two to three months, they had amassed much information of the peasants and that village, and also arouse awareness of social class by posing questions to the peasants like why they were poor.

After this survey by professionally trained cadres, the reduction campaign officially began, and there were six successive stages. The first stage was to classify population during which peasants were categorized according to their possession, this was followed by classification of landlords. Theoretically speaking, there were three classes of landlords: traitorous; ordinary; resistance and “democratic personalities”. Those landlords, if found not comply with rent reduction decree, would be arrested. In this case, they had to pay back the excess land rent within time limit, this is the third stage of extortion of money and valuables. The fourth stage is crime revelation, the peasants were made to attend a special course and taught how to publicly reveal crimes of landlords, and they would have a role of denouncing crimes in the front of a number of people in the fifth stage, but the problem was that they denounced for appearing faithful and obedient to the party, so they may denounce as much as they can rather than considered the reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hoàng Văn Chí. ''From Colonialism to Communism: A Case History of North Vietnam'', pp. 171-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 1953, a special people’s tribunal court, composed of peasants who knew nothing about law, was formed according to decree 150/SL.&lt;ref&gt;The law is called 233/SL. This document can be found at the official website of Vietnamese government. See: http://www.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=1&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=1104.&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences varied from the death penalty to years’ hard labor, for this point, the most well-known case was Nguyen Thi Nam, a patriotic landlord who joined the resistance war against the French but was sentenced to death.

The label of landlord is dangerous. According to Hoang’s memoir, as soon as a man was defined as landlord, he and his family were isolated from their fellow human beings and nobody was permitted to talk to them or even have any contact with them. This policy of isolation even caused a number of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Hoàng Văn Chí. ''From Colonialism to Communism: A Case History of North Vietnam'', pp. 189-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land Reform Campaign Proper'''

In the year of 1953, a series of decrees and laws on land reform were released. VWP central committee assessed the possibility of moving on to the last phase of land revolution: redistribution of agricultural land,&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Ngoc-luu. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by the most crucial land reform law publicized on 19 December 1953,&lt;ref&gt;The law is called 197/SL. This document can be found at the official website of Vietnamese government. See: http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=1106.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be regarded as the platform for land reform. Very soon after the law was passed in national congress, the experimental wave of land reform took place between December 1953 and March 1954 in Thai Nguyen province.&lt;ref&gt;Vickerman, Andrew. ''The Fate of the Peasantry: Premature "Transition to Socialism" in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam''. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Southeast Asia Studies, Yale Center for International and Area Studies, 1986, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment was fruitful according to the official, and a Central Land Reform Committee was established on 15 March 1954 which was headed by [[Phạm Văn Đồng|Pham Van Dong]].&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Ngoc-luu. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Land reform then expanded to larger areas by five waves (see the table below&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Ngoc-luu. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', pp. 307-308.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Compared to the prior campaign, land reform campaign proper was carried out more violently and in larger areas especially after the Geneva Conference because the VWP leaders realized that the Geneva Agreement was impossible to be implemented; and feared that Diem’s “March North” may start a fire at its backyard.&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Zhai. ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975''. University of North Carolina Press, First Edition, 2000, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Five times the number of landlords than the first campaign was fixed by the party, thus it provoked increased internal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Trần Phương (ed.). ''Cách Mạng Ruộng Đất Ở Việt Nam'' [The Land Revolution in Vietnam]. Hanoi: Khoa Học Xã Hội, 1968, pp. 185-188.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hoang, the DRV authorities never stated the number of dispossessed landlords in any of their official publications. Expropriation was occasional during the first campaign but it was universally practiced during the second.&lt;ref&gt;Hoàng Văn Chí. ''From Colonialism to Communism: A Case History of North Vietnam'', pp. 195-197.&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the confiscation ceremony was over, an exhibition of the confiscated personal belongings of the landlord was organized, and in doing so, class awareness was intentionally provoked by illustrating the sharp contrast in living standards between peasants and landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Hoàng Văn Chí. ''From Colonialism to Communism: A Case History of North Vietnam'', p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not the end, the next big question was the apportionment of land and other properties. Normal practice should distribute them among peasants, however, it lacked accurate information.

== Chinese Involvement ==
Due to the traditionally close connection between China and Vietnam in general, and the enormous tie between Chinese and Vietnamese communists since 1949 in particular, right from the early 1950s onward, communist China’s influence over DRV increased dramatically. There were three kinds of Chinese advisory groups in North Vietnam providing assistance in the aspect of military, politics and logistics. Chinese military advisory group was headed firstly by Wei Guoqing (July 1950- May 1951) providing directly consultation to the top commander of DRV. Chinese political advisory group was headed by Luo Guibo. Land reform was part of political issue, and Luo played a big role in it. Under political advisory group, a financial team was established in early 1951 to help North Vietnam formulate regulations on how to collect tax and rice.&lt;ref&gt;李树泉.《中国共产党口述史料丛书(第4卷)》[''Series of Oral History of CCP'', Vol. 4], 中共党史出版社, 2013, p, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1953, for facilitating mass mobilization and rent reduction campaign, more than 100 North Vietnamese cadres was sent to China to participate training class. Later on in spring 1953, a particular institution exclusively in charge of helping DRV to conduct land reform was called the Land Reform and Party Consolidation Section which was headed by Zhang Dequn.&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Zhai. ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his memoir, more land reform specialists of Chinese cadres was responsible for training. Similar to Chinese experience, social organizations such as peasant, youth, and women’s league were established. Cadres were trained to practice Vietnamese version of Chinese “three together system” (三共,san gong) while peasants were mobilized and encouraged to “pour out grievances suffering from landlords and French collaborators” (诉苦,su ku).

For the case of North Vietnam, some soldier was also affected due to their family background, and among the army, there were some degree of dissatisfaction. Considering this and from Chinese experience, Chinese advisors proposed to carry out a land reform education campaign among DRV’s army. On February 1953, Luo Guibo sent a report to the Chinese leadership proposing a political consolidation campaign (整军,zheng jun) in order to make them aware of class distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Zhai. ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975'', pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 1953, the third National Congress passed land reform law which put forward route of land reform: step by step wipe out feudal system by relying on poor peasants, uniting middle and rich peasants.&lt;ref&gt;李树泉.《中国共产党口述史料丛书(第4卷)》, pp. 384-385.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese pattern of land reform in DRV was successful in meeting the need of the poor peasants for land and thus increased the prestige of the new Communist authorities. However, it also produced significant negative consequences for the party due to that Mao’s pattern of land reform emphasized the excessive class struggle and repression. This was an important reason for the later Vietnamese criticism of the Chinese model.&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Zhai. ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repression ==
Executions and imprisonment of persons classified as "landlords" or enemies of the state were contemplated from the beginning of the land reform program.  A [[Politburo]] document dated 4 May 1953 said that executions were "fixed in principle at the ratio of one per one thousand people of the total population." That ratio would indicate that communist Vietnam contemplated the execution of about 15,000 "reactionaries and evil landlords" in carrying out the program.&lt;ref&gt;"Politburo's Directive Issued on May 4, 1953, on some Special Issues regarding Mass Mobilization," ''Journal of Vietnamese Studies,'' Vol. 5, No. 2 (Summer 2010), p. 243. Downloaded from JSTOR. {{doi|10.1525/vs.2010.5.2.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 1953, the first landlord executed was the woman {{Interlanguage link multi|Nguyễn Thị Năm|vi}}, who had in fact been an active supporter of the Vietnamese Communist resistance.&lt;ref name="Vo"&gt;{{Cite journal|url =  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277659858|title = Nguyễn Thị Năm and the Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953|last = Vo|first = Alex-Thai D.|date = 2015|journal = Journal of Vietnamese Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale of the ensuing repression has proved difficult and controversial to quantify, with estimates of the number of executions ranging from 800&lt;ref name="Vo"/&gt; to 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liem|first=Lam Thanh|url=http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/vietnam/landreform.html|title=Ho Chi Minh's Land Reform: Mistake or Crime?|work=PaulBogdanor.com|date=|accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time.&lt;ref name=Turner_1975_p143/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fall_1967_p156/&gt; A Saigon communique put the figure at 32,000 executions (12,000 party members and 20,000 others), based on the testimony of an ex-party member involved in the campaign.&lt;ref name=Dommen_2001/&gt; However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html |title=Newly released documents on the land reform |work=Vietnam Studies Group |accessdate=2016-07-15 |quote='''Vu Tuong''': There is no reason to expect, and no evidence that I have seen to demonstrate, that the actual executions were less than planned; in fact the executions perhaps exceeded the plan if we consider two following factors. First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954-1956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954-1955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper "Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953-1956" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper Moise (7-9) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however). |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420044800/http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html |archivedate=2011-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955–56|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|number=4|date=November 2005|pages=395–426|doi=10.1080/14682740500284630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vu |first=Tuong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&amp;q=15%2C000#v=snippet&amp;q=15%2C000&amp;f=false |title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9781139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.&amp;nbsp;...

From discussions with party cadres, Vo Nhan Tri concluded that the overall number of deaths was considerably higher than this figure.&lt;ref name=NhanTri_1990_p2-3/&gt; According to the Vietnam Institute for Economics, 172,008 individuals were designated as landlords and rich peasants, of whom 71.66% were mistakenly categorized. Although it is impossible to know how many of them were executed, this suggests that the scale of errors committed "was undeniably dramatic."&lt;ref name="Vo"/&gt;

== "Rectification of errors" ==

As soon as the reform was completed by 1956 and the so-called peasants’ authority well-established in the villages, the party quite unexpectedly admitted to having made many serious mistakes during the reform when the “masses” had been “given a free hand”.&lt;ref&gt;Hoàng Văn Chí. ''From Colonialism to Communism: A Case History of North Vietnam'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; VWP developed a campaign called "Rectification of Errors" from January 1957 till mid-1957. This campaign was divided into three phases. The first phase was a crash operation to survey the damage done and release from prison incorrectly classified peasants and falsely accused cadres. The second phase, more deliberate and the real heart of the campaign, was divided into two steps. Step I was the re-classification of peasants, and step II was the restitution of property erroneously expropriated or else making suitable compensation. The third phase of the mistakes correction was to be a review, inventory and concentrated re-indoctrination of local personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Gittinger, J. Price. ''Communist Land Policy in North Viet Nam''. Far Eastern Survey, Vol. 28, No. 8 (Aug., 1959), pp. 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
As one of the most important events of DRV in the 1950s, as well as the first radical political campaigns of Vietnamese communists as an exclusive power-holder, this program has produced much controversial effect on North Vietnamese society, the regime itself, as well as relations between peasants and the DRV regime.

The reform also reached very considerable ends in terms of economic and social transformation. Economically speaking, collective ownership prevailed and the rural population was more or less equal. From the perspective of social transformation, it radically changed the traditional pattern of village: formerly, the landlords played a leading role in the village affairs but now they were eliminated and replaced by peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Nhu Trang. ''The Transformation of the Peasantry in North Vietnam'', pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt; However, partly due to the land reform and other radical campaigns, nearly one million North Vietnamese moved to the South.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Nhu Trang. ''The Transformation of the Peasantry in North Vietnam'', p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the use of violence and excessive emphasis over class struggle, land reform in the 1950s caused much negative impact. For this reason, it is still a sensitive topic even today.&lt;ref&gt;Alex-Thai D. Vo. ''Nguyễn Thị Năm and the Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953'', pp. 1-62.&lt;/ref&gt; It also constitutes a considerable part of oversea Vietnamese political dissents criticizing today’s communist party of Vietnam and its dependence on China.

The aims of the reform were military, economic, political and social, the most important of which, until the decisive victory at Dien Bien Phu in May 1954, was the military objective. Ho Chi Minh once listed in 1956 achievements of land reform, nearly ten million peasants had received land; tens of thousands of new cadres had been trained in the countryside. The organization of the Party, the administration and peasants’ associations in the communes have been readjusted.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Pelzer White. ''Land reform in North Vietna''. Washington: Agency for International Development, 1970, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viet Minh regime gained its control over the grass village and its ability to influence and mobilize the mass was consolidated. Land reform is an agrarian project but also a political campaign. Through mass mobilization and classification, anti-revolutionary and reactionary enemies were suppressed economically and politically.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Ngoc-luu. ''Peasants, Party and Revolution the Politics of Agrarian Transformation in Northern Vietnam 1930-1975'', p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

This had a nearly profound impact for wars in the latter years. One, this paved the way for the socialist construction in the North, which could provide southern communists with logistical support. Two, the reform can be regarded as a preparatory step for a large-scale war. The regime opened the door to enlightenment by completely altering the existing patterns of production; but also provided the masses with an ideology which would modify their attitude to work even before the economic conditions were fundamentally changed.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Chaliand. ''The Peasants of North Vietnam'', translated from the French by Peter Wiles. Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1969, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Founders and activists of the Pakistan Movement''', also known as '''Founding Fathers of Pakistan''' ([[Urdu]]:بانيڹ پاكستان; [[Roman Urdu|''Romanization lit''.]]:''bəŋɨaɪaɪ-e-Pəkɨstəŋ''), were the political leaders and statespersons who participated in the success of the [[Pakistan Movement|political movement]], following the signing of the [[Lahore Resolution|Pakistan Resolution]], that led the establishment and creation of [[Pakistan]] on [[Fourteenth of August|August 1947]].&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Stephen P.|title=The idea of Pakistan|year=2004|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0815715021|edition=1. paperback }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this large group, a further and extended subset signed the signed the [[Objectives Resolution]] that was [[Annex to the Constitution of Pakistan|annexed]] to the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Tribune. 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Akhtar, PAF|first=Air Marshal Masood|title=Six Suggested Founding Fathers' Vision Documents for Pakistan...

The term was first used by the [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Archaeology|archeologist]] dr. [[Ahmad Hasan Dani]]'s book, the ''Founding Fathers of Pakistan'' (1998), which popularized the term in literary activities of the country.&lt;ref name="Sang-e-Meel Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dani|first=edited by Ahmad Hasan|title=Founding fathers of Pakistan|year=1998|publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications|location=Lahore|isbn=9693508300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pakistan Movement]] was led by a large group of activists and statesmen who played crucial role in the politics of the [[British Indian Empire]] in 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="Sang-e-Meel Publications"/&gt; More recently, the term was used by the [[Government of Pakistan|government]] officially in explaining the [[Foreign policy of Pakistan|foreign policy]] text.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff editors|title=Guiding Principles of Pakistan’s Foreign Policy|url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/content.php?pageID=Foreign%20Policy |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA)|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors and historians of Pakistan more broadly define the term "Founding Fathers" to mean a larger group which also includes all those who, whether as politicians, jurists, statesperson, soldiers, diplomats, academicians, or ordinary citizens, took part in winning the independence of [[Administrative units of Pakistan|four provinces]] in the north-west region of [[British Indian Empire|British India]] from the control of the [[United Kingdom]] and also from the influence of the [[Indian National Congress|Indian Congress]];&lt;ref name="Brookings Institution Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Praeger&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasnat|first=Syed Farooq|title=Pakistan|year=2011|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0-313-34697-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeqwIs_NoTEC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=founding+fathers+of+pakistan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z-fqUuyiK8nroAS5t4GgBg&amp;ved=0CDYQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=founding%20fathers%20of%20pakistan&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A.P.H.

The following is a list of people who played a prominent role in making of Pakistan as independence activists, leaders, [[freedom fighter]]s and revolutionaries.

==Historical background==
[[File:All India Muslim League, 26th Session at Patna, December 1938 (Photo 429-5).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[All-India Muslim League]]'s convention held in 1938.]]
In 1905, the [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] presidency's [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition]] was decided by the [[British Government|English government]] which was supported by the Muslims communities.&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan (Pre-Independence, part-I)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Administrators|title=Partition of Bengal|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/partition-of-bengal/|work=Nazaria-e-Pakistan|publisher=Story of Pakistan (Pre-Independence, part-I)|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=1 June 2003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of the [[Swadeshi movement]] led by Indian activists led the reintegrating the [[Bengal Presidency|presidency]] and it was a catalyst in making the Muslims reformers of India realize the need for a separate homeland.&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan (Pre-Independence, part-I)"/&gt;

During the same year, the political efforts and initiations led by Sir [[Syed Ahmad Khan]] led the establishment of the historic [[All-India Muslim League]] (AIML) to protect the interests and rights of the Muslim regions in the subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Rashid Kahn, "All India Muhammadan Educational Conference and the Foundation of the All India Muslim League," Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society (2007) Vol. 55 Issue 1/2, pp 65–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual distrust among the Hindu leaders and Muslim reformers further grew.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-e-Pakistan (Story of Pakistan, Simla Deputation)"/&gt; A conference held as well as chaired by [[Viceroy of India|Indian Viceroy]], [[The Earl of Minto|Early Minto]], the Hindu-Muslim conflict was raised to the constitutional plane.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-e-Pakistan (Story of Pakistan, Simla Deputation)"&gt;{{cite web|last=staff.|title=Simla Deputation|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/simla-deputation/|work=Nazaria-e-Pakistan|publisher=Nazaria-e-Pakistan (Story of Pakistan, Simla Deputation)|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=1 June 2003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, an annual meeting of Muhammadan Educational Conference was held by Nawab [[Nawab Waqar-ul-Mulk Kamboh|Vikar-ul-Mulk]], [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan|Syed Ahmad Khan]], and 3,000 other delegatesattended the session making it the largest-ever representative gathering of Muslim India.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-e-Pakistan Trust (AIML)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Establishment of All India Muslim League|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/establishment-of-all-india-muslim-league/|publisher=Nazaria-e-Pakistan Trust (AIML)|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim cleric [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar|Ali Johar]] wrote [[All-India Muslim League]]'s first agenda and [[Syed Ameer Ali]] established its European branch in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Nazaria-e-Pakistan Trust (AIML)"/&gt;

For some quiet time, the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] worked on its reputation and credibility against the much influential [[Indian National Congress|Indian Congress]]. It was not until when [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] and his companion [[Rana Liaquat Ali Khan|Shrene Pant]] convinced [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and among others to join the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in 1930s. The philosophical idea, [[Idea of Pakistan|''Pakistan'']] ([[Allama Iqbal|Iqbal]], 1930); the [[Fourteen Points of Jinnah|14 points]] ([[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]], 1929); the [[Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?|''Now or Never'']] ([[Choudhary Rahmat Ali|Ali]], 1933); the [[Two-nation theory]] which was subsequently contributed and worked by many activists and leaders played a crucial role in gaining the creation of Pakistan in 1947.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-Pakistan Trust (Independence timeline)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=The Struggle for Independence|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/the-struggle-for-independence/|publisher=Nazaria-Pakistan Trust (Independence timeline)|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly founded country of [[Pakistan]] had to create a government and legislature to replace the [[British Indian Department|British India government]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Nazaria Pakistan, (Post-Independence, part I)"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Constituent Assembly|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/the-constituent-assembly/|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=Nazaria Pakistan, (Post-Independence, part I)|date=1 January 2007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founding fathers of Pakistan first established the partial [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|Constituent Assembly]] (which was replaced with [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]), and adopted the [[Objectives Resolution]] was [[Annex to the Constitution of Pakistan|annexed]] to the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Nazaria Pakistan, (Post-Independence, part I)"/&gt;

===Occupations and finances===

The founders and activists as well had different occupations and practiced a wide range of [[Occupational prestige|high and middle-status occupations]], and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. However, the more influential founding fathers were trained and professional barristers and lawyers.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Notable activist, Sir Dr. [[Sir Ziauddin Ahmed|Ziauddin Ahmed]], was a mathematician who helped forming in the first educational policy of the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan|Ra'ana Ali Khan]] was an economist; and [[Abu Bakr Ahmad Haleem|Abu Bakr Ahmad]], a political scientist; [[M.M. Sharif]], a philosopher; and [[Shaukat Hayat Khan|Shaukat Hyatt Khan]], an officer in the [[British Army]], are the quiet few notable personalities who played an integrated role in the movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The '''Manchukuo Temporary Government''' is an organisation established in 2004 in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="NOW20091210"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nownews.com/2009/12/10/91-2544538.htm|periodical=NOWNews|date=2009-12-10|accessdate=2011-09-26|title=滿洲國復辟？　金溥聰有個族人自封是皇帝 {{bracket|Manchukuo restored?

==Structure and symbols==
Media summaries of its website state that the Manchukuo Temporary Government includes an emperor, a royal family, a prime minister, and a cabinet. It continues to use the old [[National Anthem of Manchukuo]] and [[Flag of Manchukuo]].&lt;ref name="NOW20091210"/&gt; The website also has accounts of the history of the region and its people, including a claim that the [[Manchu people]] are one of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel; James Leipold of the [[China Policy Institute]] described it as "thick on anti-communist vitriol" while failing to address Japanese hegemony in Manchukuo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://cpianalysis.org/2016/05/19/ethnicity-and-the-chinese-internet-escape-from-reality/|first=James|last=Leipold|title=Ethnicity and the Chinese Internet: Escape from Reality?|work=China Policy Institute Analysis|date=19 May 2016|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manchukuo Temporary Government is a member of the [[International Monarchist League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.southnews.com.tw/polit/polit_00/13/02407.htm|title=愛新覺羅的國仇家恨！|trans-title=Aisin Gioro's national enmity and personal hatred!|periodical=South News|date=2009-12-15|accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also seeks to join the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].&lt;ref name="NOW20091210"/&gt; It claims to have overseas branches in Brazil, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States.&lt;ref name="NOW20110525"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nownews.com/2011/05/25/142-2713390.htm|date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-09-26|title=聲討賤性台獨、賤性滿獨|trans-title=Denounce Taiwanese independence and Manchukuo independence|author=阿修伯|periodical=NOWNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leadership of the Manchukuo Temporary Government is formed by [[elective monarchy|electing an emperor]] and a prime minister. In the 2008 elections, the emperorship was won by "Aisin Gioro Xiaojie" (愛新覺羅‧孝傑), stated to be a student in the [[University of Hong Kong]]'s history department; his actual relation to the [[Aisin Gioro]] clan is suspect, as his [[generation name]] "Xiao" (孝) does not fit with the actual [[zupu|clan genealogy]].&lt;ref name="NOW20091210"/&gt; However, that emperor dropped out of contact with the Manchukuo Temporary Government, so in April 2010, it held another election, won by "Aisin Gioro Chongji" (爱新觉罗‧崇基).&lt;ref name="MingPao20100509"&gt;{{citation|url=http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/news/int/mingpao/20100509/16211427138.html|date=2010-05-09|accessdate=2011-09-26|title=從互聯網「滿洲國皇帝全民直選」談起|trans-title=Regarding the internet "Manchukuo Emperor election"|periodical=[[Ming Pao]]|author=沈旭暉 [Shen Xuhui]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Adam-Tonis was elected as Prime Minister in May 2011. At the time, Adam-Tonis was a [[New York University]] student and also a chairman of the [[Songun]] Politics Study Group, a [[North Korea]]n front group based in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2013/05/white-power-and-apocalyptic-cults-pro-dprk-americans-revealed/|title=White Power and apocalyptic cults: Pro-DPRK Americans revealed; American homegrown terrorist groups are the chosen favorites of Pyongyang|work=NKNews|date=6 May 2013|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial activities==

The Manchukuo Temporary Government's "[[central bank]]", which claims to succeed the old [[Central Bank of Manchou]], declared the old [[Manchukuo yuan]] to have a [[fixed exchange rate]] of 0.8 to the [[United States dollar]], and offers [[bureau de change|currency exchange]] services by post.&lt;ref name="Apple20070703"&gt;{{citation|periodical=[[Apple Daily]]|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/template/apple/art_main.php?iss_id=20070703&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;art_id=7279900|title=騎呢滿洲國護照 8美元一本 {{bracket|Funny Manchukuo passports, US$8 each}}|date=2007-07-03|accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2007, it was issuing identity cards for US$3 each, and [[fantasy passport]]s for US$8 each, with payment to be made by [[PayPal]].&lt;ref name="Apple20070703"/&gt; Its website claimed to sell [[Postage stamps and postal history of Manchukuo|Manchukuo postage stamps]], but when a ''[[Ming Pao]]'' columnist enquired with them about the possibility of purchasing them, a spokesperson stated that the items were sold out.&lt;ref name="MingPao20100509"/&gt; It also issued what it referred to as "loyalty bonds". Its activities led the Hong Kong [[Securities and Futures Commission]], Greece's [[Hellenic Capital Market Commission]], and Spain's [[Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores]] to issue public warnings about it in February 2008 to emphasise that it is not a body permitted to offer investment services.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hcmc.gr/photos/warnings/files/Foreign_warnings.pdf|publisher=Hellenic Capital Market Commission|title=Εταιρειεσ μη εχουσεσ αδεια παροχησ επενδυτικων υπηρεσιων βασει σχετικων προειδοποιησεων (public warnings) ξενων εποπτικων αρχων|accessdate=2011-09-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234223/http://www.hcmc.gr/photos/warnings/files/Foreign_warnings.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.estrategiasdeinversion.com/noticias/cnmv-advierte-tres-companias-hong-kong-podrian-dar-servicios-sin|title=CNMV advierte tres compañías Hong Kong podrían dar servicios sin autorización|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2011-09-26|periodical=Estrategias de inversión}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The Manchukuo Temporary Government received occasional media attention in the context of the [[politics of Taiwan]] around the time of the [[Republic of China local elections, 2009|2009 elections]], as its members may be distant relatives of [[Kuomintang]] general-secretary and [[Manchu people in Taiwan|ethnic Manchu]] [[King Pu-tsung]], and it was jokingly suggested that King himself might be one of its secret agents.&lt;ref name="NOW20091210"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=金溥聰是超極震撼彈 {{bracket|King Pu-tsung's a real shocker}}|periodical=NOWNews|date=2009-12-17|accessdate=2011-09-26|url=http://www.nownews.com/2009/12/17/142-2547247.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some internet users suspected the entire website of being a scam set up for the purpose of raising money.&lt;ref name="NOW20091210"/&gt; Hong Kong political scientist [[Simon Shen]], an expert on [[Chinese nationalism]] and the internet, also expressed suspicion of the website and its attempt to portray the revival of Manchukuo as a movement undertaken on behalf of [[Manchu people|Manchu]] people; he pointed out that the people who ever felt genuine identification with the state of Manchukuo were mostly not Chinese or Manchu but rather Japanese.&lt;ref name="MingPao20100509"/&gt; Another news commentator similarly suggested that [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalists]] were behind the site.&lt;ref name="NOW20090916"/&gt; On the other hand, Shen also suggested that the whole website might simply be a spoof designed by [[troll (internet)|internet trolls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/news/int/mingpao/20100516/14421446747.html|date=2010-05-16|accessdate=2011-09-26|periodical=Ming Pao|author=沈旭暉 [Shen Xuhui]|title=「太平洋滿洲獨立基地」——網絡稻草人的故事 {{bracket|'Pacific Manchuria Independence Base' an internet scarecrow story}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manchukuo Temporary Government also provoked angry reactions from some quarters. A NOWnews guest columnist in May 2011, in the midst of other arguments against [[Taiwan independence]], called the Manchukuo Temporary Government "the shame of the people of Northeast China".&lt;ref name="NOW20110525"/&gt; Its stated political positions, such as support for the [[Dalai Lama]] and the [[Tibetan independence movement]], as well as its calls to [[Concerns and controversies over the 2008 Summer Olympics|disrupt]] the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], earned it the ire of  internet users in mainland China.&lt;ref name="NOW20091210"/&gt; At one point, rumours were spreading in mainland Chinese internet forums that one "Toshiaki Kawashima" (川島志明), whom they alleged to be the nephew of [[Yoshiko Kawashima]] and prime minister of the Manchukuo Temporary Government, was working as a secret agent for [[Chen Shui-bian]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] with the aim of fomenting violence against [[Chinese people in Papua New Guinea|Chinese people there]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/13/1/1/1516338/1.html|author=沈旭暉 [Shen Xuhui]|title=「滿洲國」參與巴布亞新畿內亞排華? {{bracket|"Manchukuo" joined anti-Chinese activities in Papua New Guinea?}}|periodical=Ming Pao|date=2010-05-14|accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2881">'''Mega Purple''' is a [[grape#juice|grape juice]] [[concentrate]] by Canandaigua Concentrates of [[Madera, California|Madera]], [[California]], a division of [[Constellation Brands]]. It is used as a food additive.  The process used for producing the additive is proprietary. Based on the descriptions of effects to wines by winemakers it is likely produced by a series of processes such as [[vacuum distillation]], [[fractional distillation]], and [[solvent extraction]]. The product is one of a series of concentrates marketed as [[kosher]] additives for food with names such as '''Mega "Cherry Shade" Grape Juice Concentrate, Mega Purple Grape Juice Concentrate, Mega Red Grape Juice Concentrate'''

==In winemaking==
There has been some discussion in the industry regarding the use of additives such as Mega Purple to bolster or enhance sensory attributes such as color, taste and mouth feel.  It is reported that as much as 20% of the total production of such additives is related to wines.  According to journal reports, Mega Purple is used by almost every low- to moderate-value wine producer (below $20US per 750&amp;nbsp;ml bottle) to help standardize the bottled product ensuring a more uniform product.&lt;ref name=W&amp;V&gt;Berger, Dan, ''Wines &amp; Vines'' (March 2006). [http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=features&amp;content=51033 Mega Purple]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is produced by concentrating the ''teinturier'' grape [[Rubired]], a cross between [[Alicante Ganzin]] and [[Tinta Cão]], has 68% [[sugar]] and sells for approximately $135 a gallon.&lt;ref name=W&amp;V/&gt;

Mega Purple has raised some controversy within the wine consuming community as its use is considered to be akin to [[wine fraud|adulterating a wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What's really in that wine?|first=Corie|last=Brown, ''Los Angeles Times'' |date=March 28, 2009|accessdate=August 26, 2009 |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-newwine28mar28,3,7229987,full.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What's in a wine?|first=Tara Q.|last=Thomas, ''Gourmet''|date=March 24, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2009|url=http://www.gourmet.com/winespiritsbeer/2008/03/wineingredients|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305070007/http://www.gourmet.com/winespiritsbeer/2008/03/wineingredients|archivedate=March 5, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as John Williams, winemaker for [[Frog's Leap Winery]], has stated that the need for its use is evidence of poor [[viticulture]] and/or [[winemaking]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John, sarep.ucdavis.edu [http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/resources/sus-viticulture/files-images/Williams.pdf Science of Sustainable Viticulture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606104507/http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/resources/sus-viticulture/files-images/Williams.pdf |date=2015-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Monstrous coalition"''' ({{lang-ro|Monstruoasa coaliție}}) is the name that has remained in the collective consciousness of Romania to refer to the alliance between conservatives and radical liberals in order to obtain [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]'s removal from power. This name was promoted in its time by press favorable to Cuza.

== Background ==
Although at the first analysis a coalition between the political left (radicals) and the political right (conservatives) seems unnatural, it was logical within the political context of the time: the personal authoritarian regime introduced by Cuza.

Authoritarian tendencies began to be manifested by the ruler early in 1863, and the personal regime was installed after the [[coup d'etat|coup]] of 2 May 1864. He increased his own power at the expense of other institutions. On 10 May, Cuza amended, through plebiscite, the [[Paris Convention]] which had hitherto functioned as Constitution for the [[United Principalities]], transforming it into Developing Statues of the Paris Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/actualitate/articol/cuza-erou-dictator |title=Cuza, erou sau dictator? |newspaper=Historia.ro |author=Florin Marin, Mihai Voinea |date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important change was the redistribution of state organization so that the ruler should have more powers. From this point, the political scene was divided into two camps: cuzists and opposition. Moreover, the ruler understood to govern over political groups with trustworthy people, of moderate shades, as [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] or [[Nicolae Crețulescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Smeu, Georgeta, ''Dicționar de Istoria Românilor'', Bucharest, Trei Publishing House, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of this coalition were the radical [[C. A. Rosetti]], conservative [[Lascăr Catargiu]] and the moderate [[Ion Ghica]].

== Consequences ==
The "monstrous coalition" was supported by large landowners and businessmen who were not satisfied with the policy of the ruler. Coalition emerged after the National Assembly elections in Romania, second convocation, in 1864, and was chaired by [[Ion C. Brătianu]]. Mihail Kogălniceanu remained loyal to Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In 1866, the coalition gave a coup d'etat. On the morning of 11 February, five o'clock, a group of soldiers entered the Royal Palace and forced the ruler to accept the abdication. Cuza was forced to swear that he will abdicate, after seven years of reign, to leave the throne to a foreign prince, as is required in one of the provisions of ad-hoc divans of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Popescu Lumină, ''Universul'', 17 August 1932&lt;/ref&gt; The unionist press related that ''the argument of this heinous act was the charge that the elected ruler would have betrayed the interests of the country to a foreign power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jurnalul.ro/calendar/cuza-si-monstruoasa-coalitie-636333.html# |title=Cuza și "monstruoasa coaliție" |newspaper=Jurnalul Național |author=Tudor Cireș |date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, on 13 February, Cuza leaves [[Bucharest]], taking the road of [[Vienna]], and, after him, on 10 May 1866, [[Carol I of Romania|Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] is proclaimed ruler of Romania, under the name of Carol I. Subsequently, Carol was asked to allow Cuza return home. The monarch sent the request to the Council of Ministers that rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jurnalul.ro/editorial/istoria-ca-telenovela-o-natie-fara-principii-clare-22506.html |title=Istoria ca telenovela - O nație fără principii clare |newspaper=Jurnalul Național |author=Ion Cristoiu |date=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mouvement de la Paix''''' is an organisation which promotes a culture of peace initiated by the [[United Nations]]. The movement was created in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] by the large resistance movements, particularly those associated with [[communists]], [[Christian]]s and [[free-thinker]]s, and was linked directly to the ''Mouvement mondial des partisans de la paix'' whose aim was to struggle for peace.

== Origins ==
The origin of the Movement was to be found in the creation of "''Combattants de la Liberté''" in the aftermath of the Second World War. It was the communist leader, [[Charles Tillon]] who, at the end of 1947, launched an appeal for the creation of an organisation devoted to "supporting the republican régime and preventing the return of [[fascism]] and [[dictatorship]]".&lt;ref&gt;in ''"Un procès de Moscou à Paris"''&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 1948, about 60 people who had been active in the resistance founded "''les Combattants de la Liberté''" in a meeting at the ''l'Hôtel des 2 Mondes'' in Paris. The leader was to be [[Yves Farge]] whoa had been appointed prefect of the [[Rhône-Alpes]] region by [[Charles de Gaulle]] at the liberation of France. The constitution of this young movement which aimed to preserve the resistance spirit of unity was laid down by [[Raymond Aubrac]].

After the 1948 ''Congrès des peuples pour la paix de Wroclaw'', the ''Mouvement mondial des partisans de la paix'' was formed, and encouraged the creation of national committees. In France, the "''Combattants de la Liberté''", which had become "''les Combattants de la Liberté et de la Paix''", then "''les Combattants de la Paix et de la Liberté''" finally in 1951 became "''le conseil national français du Mouvement de la Paix''", commonly known as the "'''''Mouvement de la Paix'''''".

== The Cold War years ==
The period of the [[Cold War]] was for the Movement the most rich in operations, influence and effect. The Movement participated in the 1949 ''Congrès mondial des Partisans de la Paix'' in Paris, at which the [[World Peace Council]] was created. The leadership was given to the intellectual and scientist [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]]. The Movement organised a massive campaign of support in France for the [[Stockholm appeal]] which gathered millions of [[signatures]], including that of [[Jacques Chirac]]. The Stockholm campaign marked the apogee of the Movement in France. 

The Movement subsequently [[radicalization|became radicalised]]{{what?|date=February 2017}}, and lost some of its popular influence. Several campaigns followed, against the [[Korean War]] (1950, the demonstration against [[Matthew Ridgway]]), or against German rearmament under the [[European Defence Community]] (from 1952 onwards).

==Other campaigns==
The year 1956 marked the beginning of [[destalinization]], which overturned the communist landscape in Europe. The Movement lost some of its energy, particularly after its campaign against the [[Algerian war]].

The flame revived during the [[Vietnam War]] and again with the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] in the 1980s. The Movement also obtained the first disarmament agreement dealing with short and long range missiles in Europe{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. In 1995, the Movement participated in a massive international campaign aimed at closing down the ''Centre d'Expérimentation du Pacifique'' in [[Mururoa]].

Since 2000 the Movement has energised a large anti-war constituency ([[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], [[Iraq war|Iraq]], the near east ''etc''). Very active in the [[alter-globalization]] movement and in international partnerships, the Movement supports [[Mayors for Peace]] in France, and the French PNND (''Parlementaires pour la non-prolifération et le désarmement nucléaire'', [[Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament]]). The Movement is a member of the World Peace Council, of the [[International Peace Bureau]], of Abolition 2000 and of the International Association of Educators for Peace.

== The Movement today ==
The Movement is today the most important pacifist [[non-governmental organization]] in France with almost 150 local committees. It frequently coordinates anti-war coalitions and invests heavily in the young. [[International peace day]] on the 21 September marks one of its annual high points.

The Movement seems to have experienced a rally since the 2003 Iraq war and the development of alter-globalization movements. It plays an important role in organizing European social fora, and has mobilized against the Iraq war, the situations in [[Chechnya]] and [[Israel]], and against nuclear weapons with a campaign for a non-proliferation treaty. The movement is appealing for a reduction in the defense budget. For several years, in response to urban violence, the Movement has promoted the idea of committees for culture and peace in city wards.

==Magazine==
After over 50 years and 500 issues, the Movement's magazine, ''Combat pour la Paix'' (fight for peace) changed its name to ''Planète Paix'' (Planet Peace) in March 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2009">In many countries, a '''municipal commissioner''' is an [[official]] in a [[Municipal corporation|municipal government]] such as that of a [[city]] or a [[town]].

==India==
{{main|Municipal Commissioner (India)}}
In India, every Municipal Corporation in India is administratively headed by a Municipal Commissioner, who is the de facto head of the municipal corporation, the form of government which is usually granted to a city of more one million in population.

==Sri Lanka==
{{main|Municipal Commissioner (Sri Lanka)}}
In Sri Lanka, under the ''Municipal Council Ordinance'' there is a municipal commissioner of each municipal council. He/she would be the chief administrative officer and is the highest ranking non-elected officer of the municipality and in most cases be an officer of the [[Sri Lanka Administrative Service]] on secondment. In the absence of the [[Mayor]], the municipal commissioner serves as the chief executive of the municipality and between the end of term of an mayor and election of a new mayor, the municipal commissioner would serve as the officer implementing the powers and function of the municipal council. The common seal of the council is retained by the  municipal commissioner. The municipal council may appoint a ''Charity Commissioner of the Council''.&lt;ref name="ord"&gt;[http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/consol_act/mc576223.pdf Municipal Council Ordinance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
{{main|List of municipal commissioners for finance of Stockholm}}
In Sweden, the municipal commissioners for finance of [[Stockholm]] (finansborgarråd) is often translated as Mayor of Stockholm, because the municipal commissioner for finance has become the top politician of Stockholm municipality since the Stockholm municipal reform 1940.

The '''National Union of South African Students''' ('''NUSAS''') was an important force for [[liberalism]] and later [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] in [[South African]] student [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid]] politics. Its mottos included [[non-racialism]] and non-sexism.

== Early history ==
NUSAS was founded in 1924 under the guidance of [[Leo Marquard]], at a conference at Grey College by members of the [[Student Representative Council]]s (SRC) of South African Universities. The union was made up mostly of students from English-language South African universities. Afrikaans-speaking leaders walked out between 1933 and 1936. In 1945 the students from "native college" at [[University of Fort Hare|Fort Hare]] were admitted as members confirming the commitment to non-racialism after a period of indecision.

Early presidents of the organisation included [[Phillip Tobias]] elected in 1948, who presided over the organisation's first anti-apartheid campaign. The effort was mounted to resist the racial segregation of  South African universities. Ian Robertson, president in 1966, invited Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] to address South African Students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfksa.org/right.php?main=/documents/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; Other presidents included, [[John Didcott]], [[Jonty Driver]], [[Paul Pretorius]], [[Charles Nupen]], [[Neville Curtis]], [[Glenn Moss]] and [[Auret van Heerden]].

Though the organisation stood for non-violence in its opposition to Apartheid, some former senior members were associated with the first violent anti-apartheid resistance group, the [[African Resistance Movement]].

Despite its liberal resistance to racially separate organisations in the 1960s, its members, and in particular its leadership, supported the breakaway in 1969, of black student leaders, led by [[Steve Biko]] and others, to form the [[South African Students' Organisation]] (SASO), a [[Black Consciousness Movement]] student grouping.

== Turn to radical apartheid opposition politics ==
The SASO break-away instigated a re-examination of NUSAS' political ideology and its role in the struggle against [[apartheid]]. In the early 1970s, NUSAS increasingly became informed by Western Marxist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/moment_of_western_marxism_in_sa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moss |first=Glenn |title=The New Radicals: A Generational Memoir of the 1970s |publisher=Jacana |date=2014 |pages=31-50 |chapter=Chapter 2: Radical Challenges to Liberal Politics |isbn=1431409715 |url=https://www.amazon.com/New-Radicals-Generational-Memoir-1970s/dp/1431409715/ |access-date=August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned to organising workers through its Student Wages Commission programme with an initial mandate to run an "investigation into the wages and working conditions of unskilled black university staff" and later to begin organising workers into trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/wages-commission|title=Wages Commission|first=|last=Leander|date=3 February 2014|website=sahistory.org.za|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work is argued to have sparked the emergence of black trade unionism in South Africa that went on to play a seminal role in opposition to apartheid in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/nusas-wages-commission-timeline-1971-1973|title=NUSAS Wages Commission Timeline 1971-1973|first=|last=sahoboss|date=20 March 2011|website=sahistory.org.za|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this time many students at so-called "white" universities who supported the organisation because of its anti-apartheid campaigns. Most of the English language universities ([[University of the Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand]], [[University of Cape Town|University of Cape Town (UCT)]], [[Rhodes University|Rhodes]] and [[University of Natal]]) remained affiliated to NUSAS, which by the mid 1970s was the strongest body of white resistance to apartheid.

NUSAS backed the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in their campaign against repression, and adopted the [[Freedom Charter]] and involved its members in non-racial political projects in education, the arts and trade union spheres.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} This confronted Apartheid on the streets and in both the local and international media, infuriating the Nationalist Party Government who cracked down on the rising student revolt on several fronts in the mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

By the early 1990s South African students began to see the need to consolidate their efforts to finally rid South Africa of racist controls and to re-focus on education issues. NUSAS was merged with black controlled student movements into a single non-racial progressive student organization, the [[South African Student Congress]] (SASCO), in 1991.

On 2 July, 1991, NUSAS dissolved during with the conclusion of its 67th congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/national-union-south-african-students-nusas|title=National Union of South African Students (NUSAS)|first=|last=Anonymous|date=30 March 2011|website=sahistory.org.za|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amharic nəgus, from Geez nĕgūša nagašt king of kings. First Known Use: 1594] Merriam Webster dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Bahri Negus (Lord of the Seas) of the [[Medri Bahri]] kingdom in pre-1890 [[Eritrea]], and the Negus in pre-1974 [[Ethiopia]]. The Negus is referred to as An-Najashi (النجاشي) in the Islamic tradition.

==Overview==
{{main article|Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles}}
''Negus'' is a noun derived from the Ethiopian [[Semitic root]] {{smallcaps|ngś}}, meaning "to reign". The title has subsequently been used to translate the words "king" or "emperor" in [[Bible|Biblical]] and other literature. In more recent times, it was used as an honorific title bestowed on governors of the most important provinces (kingdoms): [[Gojjam]], [[Welega Province|Welega]] and the seaward kingdom (where the variation '''Bahr Negasi''' "King of the Sea", was the ancient title of the ruler of present-day central Eritrea) and later [[Shewa]].

Both uses and the imperial dignity would meet in the person of a regional prince, Lij Kassa Hailu, the third youngest son of ''Däjazmač'' Hailu Wolde-Giyorgis, Governor of [[Qwara Province]], by his second wife Woizero Attitaggab. He rebelled against Empress Menen and her son, the Viceroy ''Ras'' [[Ali II of Yejju]], in 1845 and spent the next nine years alternating between rebellion and submission until he was proclaimed negus at [[Amba Chera]] on 19 September 1854, and after the [[Battle of Derasge]] proclaimed himself emperor on 8 February 1855 and was crowned as [[Tewodros II]], at Derasge Maryam the next day.

'''''Peace Review''''' is an international research journal in the growing field of [[peace and conflict studies]]. The journal is published quarterly by the [[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]], under the [[Routledge]] imprint, and is a fully peer-reviewed [[academic journal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavriel Salomon and Ed Cairns, ''Handbook on Peace Education''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2011
{{ISBN|1136874526}}.  (p. 285)&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal aims to focus on "current issues and controversies that underlie the promotion of a more peaceful world" (journal website). This is a deliberately wide scope, and thus one can find within the journal a wide range of articles on issues relevant for peace, including articles dealing with peace and conflict, education, development, ecology, discrimination, human rights, and culture and ethnicity.

The journal was commenced in 1992 by John Harris at [[Stanford University]], although the editorship was soon assumed by Robert Elias at the [[University of San Francisco]].  The editorial board of the journal has over the years included eminent peace researchers, such as [[Elise M. Boulding]] and [[Johan Galtung]]. The journal currently receives funding from the Catholic Social Thought Project at the [[University of San Francisco]] and the Jesuit Foundation.

As often is the case with scholarly journals, the journal has undergone name changes. The full name of the journal was previously ''Peace Review: A Transnational Quarterly'', although the full name of the journal is now ''Peace Review: A Journal of Social Justice,'' reflecting the way that social justice concerns are now generally regarded as intrinsic to peace.

In 2000 the journal was awarded the Project Censored Award{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and the journal is currently a [[Utne]] Media Award finalist.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

One of the specific aspects of the journal is the transnational readership, in that the journal is distributed to more than 90 countries.  Thus the journal aims to avoid speaking with the voice of any particular national culture or politics.  Another prominent aspect of the journal is that it aims to reach an informed yet non-specialist readership. Thus the journal attempts to publish accessible and relatively short essays, as free as possible from specialist jargon.  However, being a privatised journal, readers not associated with subscribing universities must pay a fee to access each article, effectively putting the journal beyond the reach of many independent researchers and many students from developing countries.

The journal abstracted in most political and social science abstracts.

'''Pirate Parties International''' ('''PPI''') is a not-for-profit international non-governmental organisation with its headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="www.presseurop.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/234921-pirate-international-born |title = The Pirate International is born |publisher = [[Presseurop]] |date = 2010-04-20 |accessdate = 2010-05-17 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110102054618/http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/234921-pirate-international-born |archive-date = 2011-01-02 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2010, it serves as a worldwide organisation  for [[Pirate Party|Pirate Parties]], currently representing members from 42 countries. The Pirate Parties are political incarnations of the freedom of expression movement, trying to achieve their goals by the means of the established political system rather than through activism. In 2017 PPI had been granted special [[consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/ecosoc6843.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==

The PPI statutes&lt;ref name=PPIStat&gt;{{cite web | title = Pirate Parties International Statutes |url = http://int.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/a/a6/Statutes_of_the_Pirate_Parties_International.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate=2010-10-07 |date=2010-04-18 | publisher = Pirate Parties International}}&lt;/ref&gt; give its purposes as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to help establish, to support and promote, and to maintain communication and co-operation between pirate parties around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The PPI advocate on the international level for the promotion of the goals its Members share such as protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the digital age, consumer and authors rights oriented reform of copyright and related rights, support of information privacy, transparency and free access to information.

The name "Pirates" itself is a reappropriation of the title that was given to internet users by the representatives of the music and film industry, and does not refer to any illegal activity.

== History ==
The first Pirate party was the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Piratpartiet]], founded on 1 January 2006.
Other parties and groups were formed in [[Pirate Party of Austria|Austria]], [[Pirate Party of Canada|Canada]], [[Pirate Party (Denmark)|Denmark]], [[Pirate Party (Finland)|Finland]], [[Pirate Party Germany|Germany]], Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.  In 2007, representatives of these parties met in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to form an alliance and plan for the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirates-gather-at-first-international-pirate-party-conference/ |title=Pirates Gather at First International Pirate Party Conference |author=Ben Jones |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2007-06-09 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further conferences were held in 2008 in [[Berlin]] and [[Uppsala]], the latter leading to the "Uppsala Declaration" of a basic platform for the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 |title=The Uppsala Declaration or European Pirate Parties Declaration of a basic platform for the European Parliamentary Election of 2009 |publisher=Piratpartiet |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908223042/http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 |archivedate=2010-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, [[Andrew Norton (Pirate Party)|Andrew Norton]] (United States) was appointed as coordinator of the PPI collective. In August 2009 he stepped down&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.pirateweb.net/pipermail/pp.international.general/2009-August/003775.html |title=Signing off |date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |mailinglist=pp.int.general |last=Norton |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Norton (Pirate Party)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed the function of coordinator over to the "coreteam" led by [[Patrick Mächler]] and [[Samir Allioui]].&lt;ref name="pp-international.net"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pp-international.net/node/467 | title = Patrick Mächler steps down - Jerry Weyer Steps up!| accessdate = 2010-05-12 | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the original Pirate Party won 7.1% of the vote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8089102.stm 
| title = Swedish pirates capture EU seat | date = 2008-06-08| accessdate = 2011-09-26
| work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in Sweden's [[European Parliament]] elections and won two of Sweden's twenty [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] seats, inspired by a surge in membership following the trial and conviction of three members of the ideologically aligned [[The Pirate Bay|Pirate Bay]] a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 18 April 2010, the Pirate Parties International was formally founded in Brussels at the PPI Conference from April 16 to 18.&lt;ref name="www.presseurop.eu"/&gt;

=== The Uppsala Declaration ===
At the 2009 conference of Pirate Parties International in [[Uppsala]] (Sweden), European Pirate parties agreed on a common declaration of the parties' goals for the upcoming [[European Parliament election, 2009|election of the European Parliament]].&lt;ref name='ppse_uppsala'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 | title = European Pirate Platform 2009 | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | publisher = [[Pirate Party (Sweden)]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100908223042/http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 | archivedate = 2010-09-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ppde_wiki_uppsala'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Uppsala-Deklaration | title = Uppsala-Deklaration | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | date = 2010-07-29 | work = Piratenwiki | publisher = [[Pirate Party Germany]] | language = German, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Central issues of the declaration are:

* reform of [[copyright]], exemption of non-commercial activity from copyright regulation, reduction of the duration of copyright protections; banning of [[Digital rights management|DRM]] technologies, opposition to media or hardware levies;
* reform of [[patent law]], particularly stating that patents on life (including patents on seeds and on genes) and [[software patent debate|software]] should not be allowed;
* strengthening civil rights, transparent government, speedy and fair trial, [[freedom of speech]] and expansion of the right to anonymity in communication.

=== The Prague Declaration ===
At 2012 conference of Pirate Parties International in [[Prague]] (Czech Republic), European Pirate parties agreed to run in the elections to the European Parliament in the year 2014 with a common program as well as establish a [[European political party]]. The declaration&lt;ref name="prague"&gt;[http://ppeu.net/?p=339 The Prague Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; has been followed by conferences in [[Potsdam]] and [[Barcelona]] to work on the structure of the legal body to come and the statutes for it.

=== Resignations ===
In February 2015, [[Pirate Party Australia]] resigned from PPI due to serious disagreement with the direction and management of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://lists.pirateweb.net/pipermail/pp.international.general/2015-February/015834.html | accessdate=2015-02-11 | date=2015-02-11 | title = Pirate Party Australia resigns from PPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, [[Pirate Party UK]] also resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/editor/ppuk-leaves-ppi | accessdate=2015-02-25 | date=2015-02-25 | title =  PPUK leaves PPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March the [[Pirate Party (Belgium)|Belgian Pirate Party]] suspended its membership within PPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://piratetimes.net/ppbe-suspends-their-ppi-membership/ | accessdate=2015-03-08 | date = 2015-03-04 | title = PPBE suspends their PPI membership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2015, the [[Pirate Party of Iceland]] voted overwhelmingly to leave PPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://piratetimes.net/icelandic-pirates-ppis-vote-to-leave-ppi-and-birgitta-only-politician-to-increase-in-trust/ | accessdate=2015-04-20 | date = 2015-04-20 | title = Icelandic Pirates: PPIS Vote to Leave PPI and Birgitta only Politician to increase in Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the executive, Arnaldur Sigurðarson, reported a 96.56% vote in favour of leaving, adding: “PPI has been pretty much useless when it comes to its objectives which should be to encourage international cooperation between Pirate Parties.”

In May 2015, the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]] resolved with a significant majority to leave PPI, cancelling their observer status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mote.piratpartiet.se/showthread.php?t=40246 | accessdate=2015-05-10 | date = 2015-05-10 | title = Motion P01: Proposition ang. att lämna observatörsmedlemskapet i PPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the [[Pirate Party of Canada]] officially withdrew from Pirate Parties International citing ongoing troubles with the organization as well as a failure to adequately provide any accomplishments over its history.

== Structure ==
The PPI is governed by a board, formerly led by two co-chairs,&lt;ref&gt;Pirate Parties International Statutes, Article XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; and since Warsaw conference of 2015 by a chair and a vice-chair. Policy, governance, and applications for membership are the responsibility of the PPI General Assembly which must convene at least once per year.&lt;ref&gt;Pirate Parties International Statutes, Articles IX - XI.&lt;/ref&gt; By the current rules, board members are elected for a two-year term, half of the board being elected every year.

The '''Pontianak incident''' consisted of two massacres which took place in Kalimantan during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]]. One of them is also known as the '''Mandor Affair'''. The victims were from a wide variety of ethnic groups, and the killings devastated the [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]] elite of Kalimantan, with all the Malay Sultans of [[Kalimantan]] executed by the Japanese.

== The massacres ==
In the 1943-1944 Pontianak incident, the Japanese orchestrated a mass arrest of [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]] elites, [[Arab Indonesians|Arabs]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Manado|Menadonese]], [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], [[Bugis people|Bugis]], [[Batak people|Bataks]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], Dutch, [[Indian Indonesians|Indians]], and [[Indo people|Eurasians]] in Kalimantan, including all of the Malay Sultans, accused them of plotting to overthrow Japanese rule, and then massacred them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4WK2s2ogHEAC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=A+list+of+the+condemned+conspirators+followed;+they+included+Malays,+Bugis,+Javanese,+Minangkabaus,+Bataks,+Menadonese,+Chinese,+Eurasians,+and+...+Prominent+on+the+list+were+the+native+rulers,+who+were+entirely+wiped+out+in+this+action.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uStDU5aKFZDlyAHYw4CoCw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20list%20of%20the%20condemned%20conspirators%20followed%3B%20they%20included%20Malays%2C%20Bugis%2C%20Javanese%2C%20Minangkabaus%2C%20Bataks%2C%20Menadonese%2C%20Chinese%2C%20Eurasians%2C%20and%20...%20Prominent%20on%20the%20list%20were%20the%20native%20rulers%2C%20who%20were%20entirely%20wiped%20out%20in%20this%20action.&amp;f=false Heidhues 2003], p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RzVUOidajPAC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Pontianak+incident&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MCBDU6emFsa02AWru4DABA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Pontianak%20incident&amp;f=false Ooi 2013], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese falsely claimed that all of those ethnic groups, and organisations such as the Islamic [[Muhammadiyah|Pemuda Muhammadijah]], were involved in a plot to overthrow the Japanese and create a "People's Republic of West Borneo" (Negara Rakyat Borneo Barat).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4WK2s2ogHEAC&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Heidhues 2003], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese claimed that, "Sultans, Chinese, Indonesian government officials, Indians and Arabs, who had been antagonistic to each other, joined together to massacre Japanese", naming the Sultan of the [[Pontianak Sultanate]] as one of the "ringleaders" in the planned rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZWqvMBu80kC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=October+23+1943+Japanese+Sultan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aSlDU4vMGufS2AWf1IEQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=October%2023%201943%20Japanese%20Sultan&amp;f=false ed.

The Sultans of Pontianak, Sambas, Ketapang, Soekadana, Simbang, Koeboe, Ngabang, Sanggau, Sekadau, Tajan, Singtan, and Mempawa were all executed by the Japanese; respectively, their names were [[Sultan Syarif Muhammad Alkadrie|Sjarif Mohamed Alkadri]], [[Muhammad Ibrahim Shafi ud-din II|Mohamad Ibrahim Tsafidedin]], Goesti Saoenan, Tengkoe Idris, Goesti Mesir, Sjarif Saleh, Goesti Abdoel Hamid, Ade Mohamad Arif, Goesti Mohamad Kelip, Goesti Djapar, Raden Abdul Bahri Danoe Perdana, and Mohammed Ahoufiek.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KnNVw8WjhAoC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=Pontianak+incident+Mohamad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-yBDU4GcM-eD2AWgwoGgCw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pontianak%20incident%20Mohamad&amp;f=false ed.

Among the 29 people of the Sultan of Pontianak's family who were beheaded by the Japanese was the heir to the Pontianak throne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoPontianak.htm Vries 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1944, the Dayaks assassinated a Japanese named Nakatani, who was involved in the incident and who was known for his cruelty.  Sultan of Pontianak Mohamed Alkadri's fourth son, Pengeran Agoen (Pangeran Agung), and another son, Pengeran Adipati (Pangeran Adipati), were both beheaded by the Japanese &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZWqvMBu80kC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=Pontianak+incident+mohammed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TiNDU9DCNKPEyQHCiIGQBw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pontianak%20incident%20mohammed&amp;f=false ed.

The Japanese extermination of the Malay elite of Pontianak paved the way for a new Dayak elite to arise in its place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wpJGooepEMYC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Mandor+affair&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ESlDU-aOCOSw2wXa-4HABw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mandor%20affair&amp;f=false Davidson 2009], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mary F.

Davidson, this rebellion, during which many Dayaks and Japanese were killed, occurred from April through August 1945, and was called the "Majang Desa War".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/docs/wps/wps03_009.pdf Davidson 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518224034/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/docs/wps/wps03_009.pdf |date=18 May 2014 }}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontianak Incidents, or Affairs, are divided into two Pontianak incidents by scholars, variously categorised according to mass killings and arrests, which occurred in several stages on different dates.

'''Propyl benzoate''' is an [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[chemical compound]] used as a [[food additive]]. It is an [[ester]].

==Uses==
Propyl benzoate has a nutty odor and sweet fruity or nut-like taste, and as such, it is used as a synthetic flavoring agent in foods. It also has [[antimicrobial]] properties and is used as a preservative in [[cosmetics]]. It occurs naturally in the [[sweet cherry]] and in [[clove]] [[Plant stem|stems]], as well as in [[butter]].&lt;ref name="BookPreserv"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ash |first=Michael |author2=Ash, Irene  |title=Handbook of Preservatives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ2QB7bu5LwC&amp;pg=PA404 |accessdate=2009-05-04 |year=2004 |publisher=Synapse Information Resources |isbn=1-890595-66-7 |page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7401">'''Psychiatric reform in Italy''' is the reform of psychiatry which started in Italy after the passing of [[Basaglia Law]] in 1978 and terminated with the very end of the Italian state mental hospital system in 1998.&lt;ref name="Burti"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burti L. |title=Italian psychiatric reform 20 plus years after |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]]|volume= 104|issue=410 Supplementum|pages=41–46 |year=2001 |month= |pmc= |doi= 10.1034/j.1600-0447.2001.1040s2041.x|pmid=11863050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among European countries, Italy was the first to publicly declare its repugnance for a mental health care system which led to social exclusion and segregation.&lt;ref name=Ramon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramon|first1=Shulamit|last2=Williams|first2=Janet|title=Mental health at the crossroads: the promise of the psychosocial approach|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=978-0-7546-4191-9|pages=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JQei2bYYAcC&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatric reform was also a consequence of a public debate sparked by [[Giorgio Coda]]'s case and stories collected and analyzed in [[Alberto Papuzzi]]'s book ''Portami su quello che canta''. 

== Aims ==
The reform was directed towards the gradual dismantling of the psychiatric hospitals and required a comprehensive, integrated and responsible community mental health service.&lt;ref name="Tansella"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tansella M. |title=Community psychiatry without mental hospitals — the Italian experience: a review |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]|volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=664–669 |date=November 1986 |pmid=3795212 |pmc=1290535 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|665}} The object of community care is to reverse the long-accepted practice of isolating the mental ill in large institutions, to promote their integration in the community offering them a milieu which is socially stimulating, while avoiding subjecting them to too intense [[social pressure]]s.&lt;ref name="Tansella"/&gt;{{rp|664}}

== Course ==
In August, 1971, [[Franco Basaglia]] became the director of the provincial psychiatric hospital located in [[Trieste]].&lt;ref name="Del Giudice"&gt;{{cite web |author=Del Giudice G. |year=1998 |url=http://www.triestesalutementale.it/english/doc/delgiudice_1998_psychiatric-reform-italy.pdf
|title=Psychiatric Reform in Italy |publisher=Trieste: Mental Health Department |accessdate=5-10-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a group of young physicians not yet influenced by traditional psychiatry, such as [[Giorgio Antonucci]], who worked on the dismantling of two mental hospitals of [[Imola]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dacia Maraini intervista Giorgio Antonucci|trans-title=Dacia Maraini interviews Giorgio Antonucci|url=http://www.nopazzia.it/Antonucci/marainiantonucci.htm|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=26 July, 29 and 30 December 1978|language=Italian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413063207/http://www.nopazzia.it/Antonucci/marainiantonucci.htm|archivedate=13 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as psychologists, volunteers and students, Basaglia started an intense project for the theoretical-practical criticism of the institution of the asylum.&lt;ref name="Del Giudice"/&gt; At that time, there were approximately 1,200 patients in the San Giovanni psychiatric hospital, most of them were under compulsory treatment.&lt;ref name="Del Giudice"/&gt; From 1971 to 1974, the efforts of Franco Basaglia and his equipe were directed at changing the rules and logic which governed the institution, putting the hierarchy in question, changing the relations between patients and operators, inventing new relations, opportunities and spaces, and restoring freedom and rights to the inmates.&lt;ref name="Del Giudice"/&gt;

In the hospital being transformed, guardianship was substituted by care, institutional abandonment by the full assumption of responsibility for the patient and their condition, while the negation of the individual through the concept of illness-danger was replaced by the conferring of importance and value to individual life histories.&lt;ref name="Del Giudice"/&gt; Any form of physical containment and shock therapy was suppressed, the barriers and mesh which had enclosed the wards were removed, doors and gates were opened,
compulsory hospitalizations became voluntary and definitive ones were revoked, thus the patients regained their political and civil rights.&lt;ref name="Del Giudice"/&gt;

== Main characteristics ==
[[Michele Tansella]] specified the main characteristics of the Italian experience:&lt;ref name="Tansella"/&gt;{{rp|668}}
* community care as the principal component of the system;
* a relatively low dose of inpatient care, avoiding treating any new patients in mental hospital;
* a very careful integration between the various facilities within the geographically based system of care, the same team providing outpatient as well as inpatient and community care.

The closure of various hospital settings became possible because of constant reduction of in-patients number which in the course of years had the following dynamics:&lt;ref name="Psichiatria e storia"&gt;{{cite web |author= |date= |url=http://www.psichiatriaestoria.org/Torino%20a%20Collegno/dal%201968%20al%201998.htm |title=Dal 1968 al 1995: la prima fase del "superamento" dell'istituzione psichiatrica  |publisher=Psichiatria e storia |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|post-text=(Are the numbers expressing the number of psychiatric beds nationally?)|date=January 2017}}

== Estimations ==
Giovanna Russo and Francesco Carelli state that back in 1978 the Basaglia reform perhaps could not be fully implemented because society was unprepared for such an avant-garde and innovative concept of mental health.&lt;ref name="Russo"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Russo G., Carelli F. |title=Dismantling asylums: The Italian Job |journal=London Journal of Primary Care |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=May 2009 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.psychodyssey.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Dismantling-asylums-The-Italian-Job.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, it has become more obvious that this reform reflects a concept of modern health and social care for mental patients.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt; The Italian example originated samples of effective and innovative service models and paved the way for deinstitutionalisation of mental patients.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4977">Inspector '''Ray Powell''' is a senior [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British Police]] [[Police officer|Officer]] who held the position of President of the [[National Black Police Association (UK)|National Black Police Association]] from September 2003 to November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polfed.org/1105different_perspective_p.17.pdf A different perspective], ''Police - The Voice of the Service'' (November 2005). Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Powell joined the [[South Yorkshire Police|South Yorkshire Police Service]] in 1984,&lt;ref name="JCI Barnsley Business Lecture 2007"&gt;[http://www.jcibarnsley.org.uk/JCI%20Barnsley%20Business%20Lecture%202007%20v2.pdf JCI Barnsley Business Lecture 2007], JCI. Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and was based at police headquarters in Snigg Hill, [[Sheffield]], serving for eighteen years and rising to the rank of sergeant before being elected as deputy general secretary of the NBPA in November 2002.&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt; Powell subsequently took up the presidency when the previous holder left.&lt;ref name=Barton&gt;Lyn Barton, 'Sergeant takes big role in police', ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' (11 April 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In this post he represented 3,000 black staff across the country and helped to formulate policies affecting police forces nationally.&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt; At the time of his appointment he said:

{{cquote|My priority is to support the black staff working in the police service throughout the country. The aim of the National Black Police Association is to improve the work situation and the work environment of all black staff by protecting their rights. There is still a massive culture change that has to take place and there are still a lot of issues with staff needing support.'&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt;}}

In October 2003, a month after assuming the presidency, and following the failure of talks over the reinstatement of suspended [[Police Superintendent|Superintendent]] [[Ali Dizaei]], Powell called for a boycott of [[Metropolitan Police]] recruitment campaigns, warning that the NBPA could not encourage black and Asian recruits to join a force that practised racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3173200.stm Met faces black police boycott], [[BBC News]], 8 October 2003. Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dizaei was subsequently reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3812101.stm Dizaei probe 'seriously flawed'], [[BBC News]], 16 June 2004. Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Powell also urged that an undercover [[BBC]] reporter who investigated racism among police recruits in [[Cheshire Constabulary|Cheshire]] should not be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3207899.stm Black police praise racism exposé], [[BBC News]], 23 October 2003. Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] decided there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the case against the so-called 'secret policeman'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/archive/2003/132_03.html CPS advises no prosecution in case of undercover BBC reporter], [[Crown Prosecution Service]], 4 November 2003. Retrieved 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2004 Powell described complaints from white officers that they had been rejected for promotion in favour of black or Asian officers as 'the whining of a few unsuccessful white officers trying to test the system'. His remark was prompted by the revelation that nearly half the race discrimination cases outstanding against the Met had been brought by white officers.&lt;ref&gt;'White officers claim racism', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (22 August 2004), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; 'If you ask anybody in the police what positive action is,' Powell argued, 'they would not have a clue: therefore they interpret it as positive action against them.'&lt;ref&gt;'Society: Quotes of the week', ''[[The Guardian]]'' (25 August 2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005 Powell told ''Police Review'' that officers who were 'diversity opportunists' posed as much danger to the service as 'overt' racists. Referring to diversity training, Powell claimed that problem staff in middle management were either 'diversity opportunists' who used diversity training as a 'badge' for their career enhancement, or 'postmodern racists' who would 'use the system' against ethnic minority staff, by only paying lip-service to the diversity agenda.&lt;ref&gt;'Lip service to diversity; Police', ''[[The Times]]'' (22 March 2005), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Powell is currently the Head of Operational Equality Diversity Human Rights for the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]], with the rank of [[Police Inspector|Inspector]].&lt;ref name="JCI Barnsley Business Lecture 2007"/&gt;

At the time of his appointment as NBPA president, Powell lived in Sheffield and was a married father of two.&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt;

'''Revolutionary spontaneity''' (also known as '''spontaneism''') is a tendency to believe that [[social revolution]] can and should occur ''spontaneously'' [[working class|from below]], [[Leaderless resistance|without the aid or guidance]] of a [[vanguard party]], and that it cannot and should not be brought about by the actions of [[cult of personality|individuals]] or [[professional revolutionaries|parties]] who might attempt to foment such a revolution.

In his work ''[[What is to be Done? (pamphlet)|What is to be Done?]]'' (1902), [[Vladimir Lenin]] argued fiercely against revolutionary spontaneity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/ii.htm] What Is To Be Done? Ch. 2:The Spontaneity of the Masses and the [[False Consciousness|Consciousness]] of the [[Social Democrats]]&lt;/ref&gt; as a dangerous "[[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]]" concept that strips away the disciplined nature of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist political thought]] and leaves it [[arbitrary]] and ineffective. [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and the [[Spartacist League]], which had attempted to overturn [[capitalism]] during the 1919 [[German Revolution]], would become main targets of Lenin's attacks after [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1949/spontaneity.htm |title=Spontaneity and Organisation |author=Kurasje Council Communism Site |publisher=Marxist.org |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spontaneism, however, remained a popular theory in opposition to the [[Third International]]'s [[democratic centralism]], and influenced the [[Autonomism|autonomist]] movement in the 1970s. Its influences can be felt in some parts of today's [[alter-globalization]] movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

'''Terry O'Gorman''' is a lawyer in [[Queensland, Australia]] and is the president of the [[Australian Council for Civil Liberties]]. In 1979, O'Gorman was elected President of the [[Queensland Council for Civil Liberties]] and served as president until 1985. He again held presidency from 1990 to 1994. He is currently the Vice President of the QCCL. 

O'Gorman specialises in [[criminal law]], yet it was the area of Aboriginal Aid in which he first commenced his legal career. An influential member of the QCCL, "it was during the days as a university student and under the rule of Joh Bjelke-Petersen that he first became aware of the need to protect civil rights." In 2003 he pleaded guilty to drink driving after the vehicle he was driving rolled in to a police car. In 2008 O'Gorman commented that "civil liberties on the streets have improved, but the battle has moved to a 'law and order auction' being played out in the media, which used to be centred around the political cycle but now appears to be a permanent fixture."&lt;ref name="Criminal Lawyer Terry O 2008"&gt;"Civil Libertarian and Criminal Lawyer Terry O'Gorman" ABC Local conversations with Richard Fidler 7 Aug 2008. Abc.net.au. Web. 7 May. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Raised in Brisbane, he was one of 15 children raised in a Catholic family which included two police officers, another lawyer, and three nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/stories/s1486071.htm |title=Policeman John "Bluey" O'Gorman :: ABC Queensland |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His upbringing could be described as right wing. As a university student during the [[Joh Bjelke Petersen|Bjelke Petersen]] years, O'Gorman became aware of the need to fight for human rights. His early working years were spent with [[Aboriginal Legal Aid]]. It was there that he noticed the brutal treatment of indigenous Australians at the hands of the police. Taking matters into their own hands, O'Gorman and colleagues began secretly taping the police. This resulted in a number of miscarriage of justice cases being proved. 

By cross-examining [[Joh Bjelke Petersen]] during the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]], he was instrumental in changing the thinking and mindset of judges and politicians who refused to believe that the police were abusing their positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;612 ABC Brisbane [http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/08/07/2327794.htm Civil libertarian and Criminal lawyer Terry O'Gorman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In later years O'Gorman became involved in the Australian Council of Civil Liberties. He has also been involved in a number of issues involving racism, treatment of asylum-seekers,&lt;ref&gt;ABC the World today [http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s334626.htm Push for tagging of asylum seekers, Reporter: Joe O'Brien]&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of the [[Smart Card]] &lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald [http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Smartcard-plan-sparks-privacy-fearss/2005/04/21/1114028476868.html Smartcard plan sparks privacy fears 21 April 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Go card]].&lt;ref&gt;goldcoast.com.au News Gold Coast [http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/07/30/243451_gold-coast-news.html Gold Coast go card privacy warning Jessica Johnston | 30 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been critical of the way that Australia's police have dealt with indigenous Australians, and the resulting [[Deaths in custody]].&lt;ref&gt;ABC Stateline [http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2010/07/09/2949831.htm deaths in custody in Qld]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
At present he is a lawyer with Robertson O'Gorman Solicitors. He is President of the [[Australian Council for Civil Liberties]] and also the Vice President of the [[Queensland Council for Civil Liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson O'Gorman Solicitors [http://www.robertsonogorman.com.au/staff.asp?ID=4219 Terry O’Gorman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217094244/http://www.robertsonogorman.com.au/staff.asp?ID=4219 |date=17 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
In July 2010 it was reported in major newspapers around Australia that people have had their movements tracked by using the Go Card. It had turned out that Australian police had been accessing the Go Card records to find out about the movements of certain people.  O'Gorman had commented that he wasn't surprised that the police were accessing Go Card records, stating that previous concerns asserting that Go Cards would be used for surveillance had been justified.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes.com.au"&gt;Brisbane Times [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/police-watching-where-you-go-20100728-10vx2.html Police watching where you Go, Sean Baugmart]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Gorman also stated that he was unsure if his Go Card was registered, as his wife had obtained it for him, but added that he would be de-registering it.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes.com.au"/&gt; As of August 2010, Queensland Police were set to appeal to the state’s privacy commissioner  not to cut their access to the movements of Brisbane's commuters that were recorded on the Go Cards.&lt;ref&gt;Brisbane Times [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/atkinson-to-ask-privacy-commissioner-not-to-cut-access-to-go-cards-20100801-1116i.html Atkinson to ask privacy commissioner not to cut access to Go Cards, Courtney Trnwith]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result, O'Gorman has been watching closely the developments that have been taking place.

[[File:Eton College (2) - August 5, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Eton College]] in England has educated nineteen [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Ministers]].]]
'''The Establishment''' generally denotes a dominant group or [[elite]] that holds [[Power (social and political)|power]] or authority in a nation or organisation. The Establishment may be a closed social group which selects its own members or specific entrenched elite structures, either in government or in specific institutions.

The [[American Sociological Association]] states that the term is often used by those protesting a small group that dominates a larger organization.  For example, in 1968, a group of academics set up the "Sociology Liberation Movement" to repudiate the leadership of the American Sociological Association, which they referred to as the "Establishment in American sociology".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Barcan, ''Sociological theory and educational reality'' (1993) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, any relatively small class or group of people having control can be referred to as ''The Establishment''; and conversely, in the jargon of [[sociology]], anyone who does not belong to ''The Establishment'' may be labelled an "outsider".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Norbert |last1=Elias |authorlink1=Norbert Elias |first2=John L |last2=Scotson |title=The Established and the Outsiders |year=1965 |oclc=655412048}}{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Norbert |last1=Elias |authorlink1=Norbert Elias |first2=Herminio |last2=Martins |first3=Richard |last3=Whitley |title=Scientific Establishments and Hierarchies |year=1982 |publisher=Reidel |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-90-277-1322-3}}{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[anti-authoritarianism|Anti-authoritarian]] and [[antiestablishmentarianism|anti-establishment]] ideologies tend to view establishments as illegitimate.

==United Kingdom==
The term is most often used in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In different contexts it may include leading politicians, senior [[civil servant]]s, senior barristers and judges, aristocrats, [[Oxbridge]] academics, senior clergy in the established [[Church of England]], the most important financiers and industrialists, governors of the [[BBC]], and the members of and top aides to the [[British Royal Family|royal family]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} The term in this sense is sometimes mistakenly believed to have been coined by the British journalist [[Henry Fairlie]], who in September 1955 in the London magazine ''[[The Spectator]]'' defined that network of prominent, well-connected people as "the Establishment", explaining:

{{quote|By ''the Establishment'', I do not only mean the centres of official power—though they are certainly part of it—but rather the whole matrix of official and social relations within which power is exercised. The exercise of power in the United Kingdom (more specifically, in England) cannot be understood unless it is recognized that it is exercised socially.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Fairlie|Fairlie, Henry]], "Political Commentary", ''[[The Spectator]]'', 23 September 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following that, the term ''the Establishment'' was quickly picked up in newspapers and magazines all over London, making Fairlie famous. However, the term had been used by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] in a similar fashion, a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Henry Fairlie |last1=Fairlie |first1=Henry |title=Evolution of a Term |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1968/10/19/1968_10_19_173_TNY_CARDS_000293928 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=19 October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] would cite Fairlie's column as its  ''locus classicus''.

However, author and professor [[Carroll Quigley]] of [[Georgetown University]], in his book ''The Anglo-American Establishment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carrollquigley.net/pdf/The_Anglo-American_Establishment.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Anglo-American Establishment |publisher=Carrollquigley.net |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden''. 1981, New York: Books in Focus, 354 pages, {{ISBN|0-916728-50-1}} (hardcover and paperback). Reprinted by Rancho Palos Verdes: GSG &amp; Associates, date unknown, {{ISBN|0-945001-01-0}} (paperback). Full text.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term much more specifically than did [[Fairlie]]. In that book (copyright date 1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0945001010 |title=Anglo-American Establishment (9780945001010): Quigley Carroll: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to an out-of-print edition):

{{quote|Quigley exposes the secret society's (sic) established in London in 1891, by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Quigley explains how these men worked in union to begin their society to control the world. He explains how all the wars from that time were deliberately created to control the economies of all the nations.}}

That society was established by Cecil Rhodes in 1891 and, following Rhodes' death in 1902, was carried on by [[Alfred Milner]], which society, Quigley refers to as the ''Milner Group'', but sometimes referred to as the [[Round Table movement]]. That group, with significant American input, would, following the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], establish and control the Royal Institute for International Affairs, later to become known as [[Chatham House]].

Much more generally, this use of the word, ''Establishment'', may have been influenced by the British term, ''[[established church]]'', for the official [[Church of England]]. The term was then found useful in discussing the power elites in many other countries. The [[English language|English]] word is now used as a [[loanword]] in many other languages.

== Australia ==
The term, ''establishment'' is often used in Australia to refer both to the main political parties and also to the powers behind those parties. In the book, ''Anti-political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis'' by Amir Abedi (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Anti_political_Establishment_Parties.html?id=B8oPfqRUqOYC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Anti-political Establishment Parties: A Comparative Analysis - Amir Abedi - Google Buku |publisher=Books.google.co.id |date= |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Abedi refers to the Labor Party and the Coalition Parties (the Liberal Party and the National/Country Party) as the establishment parties. It is communally thought{{By whom|date=August 2014}} that the Coalition parties are more closely aligned to the American and particularly the British political ''establishment'' than is the Labor Party. This would seem to be borne out by the fact that many more former members of the Coalition parties have been honoured by the monarchy for services to the Commonwealth.

== Canada ==
The original Canadian Establishment began as a mix between the British and U.S. models, combining political appointments and business acumen. The [[Family Compact]] is the first identifiable Canadian Establishment in Anglophone Canada. In francophone Canada, the local leaders of the Catholic Church also played a major role.

The journalist [[Peter C. Newman]] defined the modern "Canadian Establishment" in his 1975 book [[The Canadian Establishment]]. It catalogued the richest individuals and families living in Canada at the time. All of the specific people he identified were prominent business leaders, especially in the media and in public transit. Newman reports that several of these old families have maintained their importance into the 21st century.

According to Anglo-American journalist Peter Brimelow, Newman's establishment was overshadowed by a new class. His book The Patriot Game "makes a swinging attack on the political, bureaucratic, and academic establishment whose entire well-being rests on the promotion of Canadian nationalism. [He] identifies the federal Liberal party as the selfish and thoughtless inventor of this modern activity of creating a Canadian identity, he argues that it is now a pervasive disease throughout Canada's national political and cultural elite."&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/573245/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==

The term "[[Official Ireland]]" is commonly used in the [[Republic of Ireland]] to denote the media, cultural and religious establishment.

== Hong Kong and Macau ==
The term is also used in [[politics of Hong Kong]] and [[Politics of Macau|Macau]], where political parties, community groups, chambers of commerce, trade unions and individuals who are cooperative with and loyal to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the post-[[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover]] [[Hong Kong Government]] are labelled (most often self-labelled) "[[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing]]" or "[[Pro-Beijing camp (Macau)|pro-establishment]]". The term first appeared in 2004.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Pakistan ==
Deemed the [[Deep state|Deep State]].The terminology is used in [[Pakistan]] to describe the cooperative federation of the powerful military and military led Intelligence agencies .&lt;ref name="Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haqqani|first=Husain|title=Pakistan&amp;nbsp;: between mosque and military|year=2005|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0870032141|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of Establishment is no different from "The Establishment" in the United Kingdom. However establishment in Pakistan is much stronger than anyother entity.

The Establishment's sphere mainly consists of the country's high-ranking military officers particularly military Generals belonging to [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] . Others included are senior civil servants, members of the Judiciary, the most important financiers and industrialists and the media moguls. The Establishment in Pakistan considers the key and elite decision makers in country's public policy, ranging from the use of the intelligence services, national security, foreign and domestic policies. They are believed to be behind the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état]] and are behind the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] government and its current ascension to power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5496">The '''Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001''' was an unenacted [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced by the [[government of the 28th Dáil]] to [[constitutional amendment|amend]] the [[Constitution of Ireland]], to establish a body for the investigation of [[Courts of the Republic of Ireland|judge]]s, and to alter the procedure for the [[impeachment|removal of judges]].&lt;ref name="billpdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2001/1701/b1701.pdf |format=PDF |title=Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001: As initiated|year=2001|publisher=Oireachtas|language=Irish, English|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="djlr2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Minister%20Ahern%20publishes%20scheme%20of%20the%20Judicial%20Council%20Bill%202010|title=Minister Ahern publishes scheme of the Judicial Council Bill 2010|date=23 August 2010|publisher=Department of Justice and Law Reform|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus for the bill was the "[[Philip Sheedy Affair]]".  Sheedy's 1997 prison sentence was remitted in an irregular manner in 1998 by one judge after intervention from another judge acquainted with Sheedy's sister. The media broke the story in 1999 and the government responded to the controversy by asking the [[Chief Justice of Ireland|Chief Justice]] to make a report, which criticised the conduct both judges, who each resigned after initially stating they would not. The ad-hoc nature of the investigation and the voluntary nature of the sanctions were considered unsatisfactory. In 2000, a report into the affair by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure declined to make recommendations regarding practice and procedure in criminal courts, because of "serious issue of a constitutional nature relating to the [[separation of powers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/26thinterimrpt.pdf/Files/26thinterimrpt.pdf |title=Issues of Court Practice and Procedure arising from the Early Release of Philip Sheedy from Prison |date= |publisher=Department of Justice and Equality |series=Interim Reports |number=26 |author=Committee on Court Practice and Procedure |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was published on 27 March 2001, the same day as bills for amendments numbered [[Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|21]], [[Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|23]], and [[Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 (Ireland)|24]].&lt;ref name="bills2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=-1&amp;CatID=59&amp;StartDate=01%20January%202001&amp;OrderAscending=0&amp;mypage=2&amp;OrderAscending=0|title=2001 Bills, page 2|work=Bills 1997 - 2010 by bill number / date|publisher=Oireachtais|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government wanted to expedite passage of all four bills through the [[Oireachtas]] to have simultaneous [[referendum]]s on 7 June, before the summer holidays.  The Twenty-second Amendment bill passed its [[second reading]] on 1 May 2001, and the [[committee stage]] was scheduled for the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0535/D.0535.200105010016.html Dáil debates Vol.535 cc.111–144]&lt;/ref&gt;   Overnight, the [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]] [[John O'Donoghue (politician)|John O'Donoghue]] tabled 14 amendments to the Bill, a procedure which the Opposition condemned as cavalier; in the absence of cross-party support the government withdrew the Bill from the Order Paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0535/D.0535.200105020003.html Dáil debates Vol.535 cc.505–514]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2001/0502/referendum.html|title=Government abandons plan for referendum on judicial misconduct|date=2 May 2001|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lapsed when the 28th Dáil dissolved. The Twenty-third Amendment passed at referendum; there is therefore a gap in the numbering since there is no Twenty-second Amendment to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/Referenda/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad,1894,en.pdf#page=60 |title=Referendum results 1937 – 2009 |publisher=Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government |accessdate=16 November 2010 |format=PDF |page=60 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224084849/http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/Referenda/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad%2C1894%2Cen.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Government announced the Judicial Council Bill 2010, which aims to address the same issues without amending the Constitution.&lt;ref name="djlr2010"/&gt;

}}'''''Two Hundred Years Together''''' ({{lang-ru|Двести лет вместе}}, {{transl|ru|''Dvesti let vmeste''}}) is a two-volume historical essay by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]. It was written as a comprehensive history of [[Jews]] in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Soviet Union]] and modern Russia between the years 1795 and 1995, especially with regard to government attitudes toward Jews.&lt;ref name=Shneidman&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Mns1sF_1bYC&amp;pg=PA46 |pages=46–47 |title=Russian Literature, 1995–2002: On the Threshold of the New Millennium |last=Shneidman |first=S.

Solzhenitsyn published this two-volume work on the history of [[Russians|Russian]]–[[Jewish]] relations in 2001 and 2002. The book stirred controversy, and many historians reported it as unreliable in factual data. Some historians classified it as antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/Society/Xenophobia/Antisemitic/m.21823.html |title= Еще одна книга Александра Исаевича|publisher=Grani.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkovich-zametki.com/Nomer30/Passika1.htm |script-title=ru:КНИГА А.СОЛЖЕНИЦИНА "200 ЛЕТ ВМЕСТЕ" И СОВЕТСКИЕ ЕВРЕИ |publisher=Berkovich-zametki.com |language=ru |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimensional Spaces in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Two Hundred Years Together.

== Summary ==
In the first volume, Solzhenitsyn discusses the history of Russians and the 100,000 Jews that had migrated to Russia between 1772 and the revolution of 1917. He asserts that the [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] were not government-sponsored but spontaneous acts of violence, except for some government culpability in the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Solzhenitsyn says that life for Russian Jews was hard but no harder than life for Russian peasants.&lt;ref name=Shneidman/&gt; The second volume covers the post-revolution era up to 1970 when many Jews left Russia for Israel and other western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mahoney, Daniel J. |author2=Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr Isaevich |author3=Edward L. Beach Jr |title=The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings, 1947–2005 |publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute |location=Lanham, MD |year=2009 |page=486|isbn=1-935191-55-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn says that the Jews who participated in Russian revolutions were effectively apostates splitting from the spirit of tradition.&lt;ref name=Shneidman/&gt; Solzhenitsyn emphatically denies that Jews were responsible for the revolutions of 1905 and 1917. At the end of chapter nine, Solzhenitsyn denounces "the superstitious faith in the historical potency of conspiracies" that leads some  [[Jewish Bolshevism|to blame the Russian revolutions on the Jews]] and to ignore the "Russian failings that determined our sad historical decline."&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

Solzhenitsyn criticizes the "scandalous" weakness and "unpardonable inaction" that prevented the Russian imperial state from adequately protecting the lives and property of its Jewish subjects.  But he claims that the pogroms were in ''almost'' every case organized from "below" and not by the Russian state authorities. He criticizes the "vexing," "scandalous", and "distressing" restrictions on the civil liberties of Jewish subjects during the final decades of the Russian old regime. On that score, in chapter ten of the work he expresses his admiration for the efforts of [[Pyotr Stolypin]] (Prime Minister of Russia from 1906 until 1911) to eliminate all legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] against Jews in Russia.

In the spirit of his 1974 essay "Repentance and Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations",&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', pp. 527–555&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn calls for the Russians and Russian Jews alike to take responsibility for the "renegades" in both communities who supported a totalitarian and terrorist regime after 1917. At the end of chapter 15, he writes that Jews must answer for the "revolutionary cutthroats" in their ranks just as Russians must repent "for the pogroms, for...merciless arsonist peasants, for...crazed revolutionary soldiers." It is not, he adds,  a matter of answering "before other peoples, but to oneself, to one's conscience, and before God."&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

Solzhenitsyn also takes the anti-Communist [[White Movement]] to task for condoning violence against Jews and thus undermining "what would have been the chief benefit of a White victory" in the [[Russian Civil War]]: "a reasonable evolution of the Russian state."

== Reception ==

The reception of ''Two Hundred Years Together'' has been quite varied. Historian [[Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern]] of Northwestern University published a refutation of Solzhenitsyn's claims and has accused him of anti-Semitism. On the other hand, historians such as Geoffrey Hosking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25340-2184898,00.html |title=The Times Literary Supplement &amp;#124; TLS |publisher=Tls.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] have defended Solzhenitsyn against his opponents. Service has argued that from what he has read about the book, Solzhenitsyn is "absolutely right," [[History of the Jews in Russia|Jews were disproportionately represented in the early Soviet bureaucracy]]. Service also notes that Solzhenitsyn is very far from the anti-Semitism of the extreme Russian Right and addresses this issue in a moderate and responsible manner.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/25/russia.books|title=Solzhenitsyn breaks last taboo of the revolution|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|first=Nick Paton|last=Walsh|date=January 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of volume 1 of ''Two Hundred Years Together'' that appeared in ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The New Republic'', November 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics focus on Solzhenitsyn's insistence that Jews were as much perpetrators as victims in the communist repression, and that both Russians and Jews need to acknowledge their share of sin.&lt;ref name=young&gt;Cathy Young: [http://www.reason.com/news/show/29113.html Traditional Prejudices. The anti-Semitism of Alexander Solzhenitsyn] ''[[Reason Magazine]]'' May, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Questions related to Jewish participation in the three Revolutions have been controversial. Vassili Berezhkov, a retired [[KGB]] colonel and historian of the secret services and the [[NKVD]] (the precursor of the KGB), said that: "The question of ethnicity did not have any importance either in the revolution or the story of the NKVD. This was a social revolution and those who served in the NKVD and [[Cheka]] were serving ideas of social change. If Solzhenitsyn writes that there were many Jews in the NKVD, it will increase the passions of anti-semitism, which has deep roots in Russian history. I think it is better not to discuss such a question now."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Others feel that Jews were not implicated enough to warrant a reference to Russian antisemitism, or that any notion of the [[collective responsibility]] should be avoided.&lt;ref name=young /&gt;

Solzhenitsyn asserted that Jews were overrepresented in the early [[Bolshevik]] leadership and the security apparatus, without citing his sources.  He wrote that "from 22 ministers in the first Soviet government three were Russian, one [[Georgian people|Georgian]], one [[Armenians|Armenian]] and 17 Jews".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=-eBiO3w-iwkC&amp;pg=PT138&amp;lpg=PT138&amp;dq=%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BD,+%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D0%B8+17+%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VwQnyg-2XM&amp;sig=L8_7u-pT7eN6rQKdamgyHNzg614&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpz9L55cHcAhVM2IMKHZdPCWEQ6AEwBHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%20%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BD%2C%20%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%20%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%20%D0%B8%2017%20%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion has been deemed inaccurate, with the argument that the number of Commissars in the first Soviet government on 7 November 1917 was 15, not 22, of whom 11 were ethnic Russians ([[Vladimir Milyutin|Milyutin]], [[Mark Yelizarov|Yelizarov]], [[Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov|Skvortsov]], [[Georgy Oppokov|Lomov]], [[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]], [[Lenin]], [[Alexander Shlyapnikov|Shlyapnikov]], [[Viktor Nogin|Nogin]], [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko|Antonov-Ovseenko]], [[Nikolai Krylenko|Krylenko]] and [[Nikolai Glebov-Avilov|Avilov]]), two [[Ukrainians]] ([[Anatoly Lunacharsky|Lunacharsky]] and [[Pavel Dybenko|Dybenko]]), one [[Polish people|Pole]] ([[Ivan Teodorovich|Teodorovich]]), and only one Jew ([[Trotsky]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/Lenin_s_Revolution.html?id=q5ZnLn34UQUC&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

Solzhenitsyn stated: "I had to bury many comrades at the front, but not once did I have to bury a Jew". He also stated that according to his personal experience, Jews had a much easier life in the GULAG camps that he was interned in.&lt;ref&gt;"200 years together":"... в лагерь присылаешься и узнаёшь: если у тебя удачная нация – ты счастливчик, ты обеспечен, ты выжил... В лагерях, где я сидел... евреям, насколько обобщать можно, жилось легче, чем остальным."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"If I would care to generalise, and to say that the life of the Jews in the camps was especially hard, I could, and would not face reproach for an unjust national generalisation. But in the camps where I was kept, it was different. The Jews whose experience I saw – their life was softer than that of others.| Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 2003 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/25/russia.books Solzhenitsyn breaks last taboo of the revolution] by Nick Paton Walsh, ''[[The Guardian]]'', January 25, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Pipes review===
The book has been described by historian [[Richard Pipes]] of [[Harvard University]] as "a conscious effort to show empathy for both sides," and exonerating Jews for responsibility for the revolution: "No, in no way can it be said that Jews 'made' the revolution of 1905 or 1917 as it was not made by another nation taken as a whole". At the same time Pipes notes that Solzhenitsyn is "too eager to exonerate czarist Russia of mistreating its Jewish subjects, and as a consequence is insensitive to the Jews' predicament".&lt;ref name=pipes&gt;Richard Pipes: "Solzhenitsyn and the Jews, revisited: Alone Together" ''The New Republic'' November 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In Richard Pipes' opinion, the book absolves Solzhenitsyn from the taint of antisemitism, although he thinks the author’s nationalism prevents him from being fully impartial, and that Solzhenitsyn is using outdated and inadequate sources. Pipes asserts that Solzhenitsyn failed to consider the "poisonous atmosphere in which Jews lived for generations in the Russian empire (an atmosphere originating in Russian Orthodox and nationalist circles)". In particular, Pipes notes that Solzhenitsyn failed to discuss ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', a Russian  anti-Semitic forgery.&lt;ref name=pipes /&gt;&lt;ref name=pipes2&gt;Richard Pipes: [http://pda.moscowtimes.ru/article.php?aid=186820 Solzhenitsyn's Troubled Prophetic Mission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109083327/http://pda.moscowtimes.ru/article.php?aid=186820 |date=2009-01-09 }} ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' August 7, 2008.

===Petrovsky-Shtern critique===
Solzhenitsyn was accused by the [[Northwestern University]] historian [[Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern]] of using unreliable and manipulated figures, while ignoring evidence unfavorable to his own point of view and, in particular, ignoring numerous publications of reputable authors in Jewish history.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ldn-knigi.lib.ru/JUDAICA/Stern200.htm |title=Stern o knige Solzenizin 200 Let ldn-knigi |publisher=Ldn-knigi.lib.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrovsky says that Solzhenitsyn claims that Jews promoted alcoholism among the peasantry, flooded the retail trade with contraband, and "strangled" the Russian merchant class in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;39–41, 47&lt;/ref&gt; He says that according to Solzhenitsyn, Jews are non-producing people ("непроизводительный народ")&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;52, 59&lt;/ref&gt; and refuse to engage in factory labor.&lt;ref&gt;с. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt; They are averse to agriculture and unwilling to till the land either in Russia, in Argentina, or in Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;73, 76, 157, 256, 258, 267–268&lt;/ref&gt; and the author blames the Jews' own behavior for pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;210, 483, 120&lt;/ref&gt; He says that Solzhenitsyn also claims that Jews used [[Kabbalah]] to tempt Russians into heresy,&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; seduced Russians with rationalism and fashion,&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt; provoked sectarianism and weakened the financial system,&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; committed murders on the orders of [[qahal]] authorities,&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;87&lt;/ref&gt; and exerted undue influence on the prerevolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;57&lt;/ref&gt; Petrovsky summarizes his critique by stating that "''200 Years Together'' is destined to take a place of honor in the canon of russophone antisemitica."

===Semyon Reznik review===
A critical analysis was published by the Russian-American historian [[Semyon Reznik]]. According to Reznikm Solzhenitsyn is careful in his vocabulary, generous in compliments toward Jews and maintains a neutral tone throughout, but at the same time he not only condones repressive measures against Jews, but justifies them as intended for protection of the rights of Russians as the [[titular nation]] that supposedly "greatly suffered from Jewish exploitation, alcohol mongering, usury and corruption of the traditional way of life".&lt;ref name="vestnik.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2002/0415/win/reznik.htm |title=Семен Резник: Вместе Или Врозь? [Win&amp;#93; |publisher=Vestnik.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other critiques===
Historian and demographer Sergey Maksudov referred to ''THYT'' as "a piece of pseudoscientific essayism", which promulgates numerous antisemitic stereotypes of Jews as professional parasites, infiltrators into the Russian culture, and portrays repressive policies toward Jews as being "in Jews' own interests". Maksudov also claims that Solzhenitsyn was insensitive toward Jewish sufferings during [[pogrom]]s in general, and the [[Kishinev pogrom]] in particular, and also accuses Solzhenitsyn of denying many well documented atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guelman.ru/slava/maksud.htm |title=Не свои|author=Сергей Максудов|publisher=Guelman.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Klier]], a historian at [[University College London]], describes the charges of anti-Semitism as "misguided", but at the same time writes that in his account of the pogroms of the early 20th century, Solzhenitsyn is far more concerned with exonerating the good name of the Russian people than he is with the suffering of the Jews, and he accepts the tsarist government's canards blaming the pogroms on provocations by the Jews themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"History Today", November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed analysis of ''THYT'' and an overview of critical opinion thereon was published by the [[University of Waterloo]] professor Zinaida Gimpelevich. According to Gimpelevich, the critical opinion worldwide overwhelmingly tilts against Solzhenitsyn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200609/ai_n18622003?tag=rel.res1] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grigory Baklanov]], a Russian novelist, in his critical study described ''Two Hundred Years''  as "worthless as historical scholarship". Baklanov, himself a [[World War II]] veteran, focuses on Solzhenitsyn's insistence on Jews' supposed wartime cowardice and unwillingness to face the enemy, which he says is contradicted both by the statistics of Jewish frontline casualties and by the high number of Jews decorated for bravery in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.ru/PROZA/BAKLANOW/kumir.txt |title=Григорий Бакланов. Кумир |publisher=Lib.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary historian [[Leonid Katsis]] accuses Solzhenitsyn of numerous manipulated and selective quotations in the first volume of the book, detrimental to its trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exlibris.ng.ru/kafedra/2001-07-12/1_encyclopedia.html |title=Независимая газета |publisher=Exlibris.ng.ru |date=2001-07-12 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707234728/http://exlibris.ng.ru/kafedra/2001-07-12/1_encyclopedia.html |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural historian and comparatist Elisa Kriza discusses THYT in an article about anti-Semitism in Solzhenitsyn's works and explains how Solzhenitsyn's accusations towards Jewish people as a group and his treatment of Russian Jews as "foreign", despite being in Russia for two hundred years, are evidence of anti-Semitic rhetoric in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kriza|first=Elisa|date=2016|title=Der Antisemitismus im Werk von Alexander Solschenizyn und seine Rezeption|url=|journal=Jahrbuch für Antisemitismusforschung|volume=25|pages=193-214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians Leybelman, Levinskaya, and Abramov claim that Solzhenitsyn uncritically used writings of antisemitic pseudo-historian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebed.com/2003/art3563.htm |title=Пособие Для Антисемитоискателя |publisher=Lebed.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Dikiy]] for his inflated statistical data of Jewish participation in the early Soviet government and its security apparatus.&lt;ref name="vestnik.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://base.ijc.ru/new/site.aspx?STID=245090&amp;SECTIONID=244694&amp;IID=535923|title=Трехголовый еврейский Горыныч, парящий над Русью; from ЕВРЕИ И "СОВЕТСКИЙ ПРОЕКТ" ТОМ 2 РУССКИЕ, ЕВРЕИ, РУССКИЕ ЕВРЕИ|author=Израиль Зайдман|publisher=Base.ijc.ru|date=|accessdate=2013-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006192409/http://base.ijc.ru/new/site.aspx?STID=245090&amp;SECTIONID=244694&amp;IID=535923|archive-date=2013-10-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-talk.org/cd-history/gov.htm |title=Андрей Дикий, Евреи в государственных учреждениях СССР |publisher=Russia-talk.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sem40.ru/evroplanet/history/17983/ |title=Чекисты = евреи?

[[Mark Deutch]], in a two-part review titled "A Shameless Classic" ("Бесстыжий классик"),&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.mk.ru/editions/daily/article/2003/09/26/126543-besstyizhiy-klassik.html)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rusk.ru/st.php?idar=1000535&lt;/ref&gt; lists numerous drawbacks, stemming, in his opinion, from biased exposition, ignoring well-known sources, self-contradictions, and factual errors.

'''Tyrannicide''' is the killing or [[assassination]] of a [[tyrant]] or unjust ruler, usually for the [[common good]],&lt;ref&gt;Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de. "Tyrannicide."

and usually by one of the tyrant's subjects.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Tyrannicide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originally denoted the action of [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], who are often called the '''Tyrannicides''', in killing [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus of Athens]] in 514 BC.&lt;ref name=harmodius&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brynmawr.edu/archaeology/guesswho/webb.html |title= The Athenian Tyrannicides: Icons of a Democratic Society |first= E.

Various Christian philosophers and theologians also wrote about tyrannicide. In [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], Aquinas gave a defense not only of disobedience to an unjust authority, using as an example Christian martyrs in the Roman Empire, but also of "one who liberates his country by killing a tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;For Aquinas, "when what is ordered by an authority is opposed to the object for which that authority was constituted ... not only is there no obligation to obey the authority, but one is obliged to disobey it, as did the holy martyrs who suffered death rather than obey the impious commands of tyrants." One may even be "praised and rewarded" for being the "one who liberates his country by killing a tyrant." Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, trans. J.G. Dawson (Oxford, 1959), 44, 2 in O’Donovan, p. 329-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monarchomachs]] in particular developed a theory of tyrannicide, with [[Juan de Mariana]] describing their views in the 1598 work ''De rege et regis institutione,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uOrg3lNOTbkC&amp;pg=PA313 |title= Power and Secret of the Jesuits |first= René |last= Fülöp-Miller |authorlink=René Fülöp-Miller |publisher= Kessinger Publishing |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-7661-0056-1 |accessdate= October 30, 2008 |pages= 313–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he wrote, {{nobreak|"[B]oth}} the philosophers and theologians agree, that the prince who seizes the state with force and arms, and with no legal right, no public, civic approval, may be killed by anyone and deprived of his life..."&lt;ref name=Saddam/&gt;

[[File:FirstCommitteeGreatSealReverseLossingDrawing.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s suggestion for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] included the phrase "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God."]]
The [[Jesuit|Jesuistic]] [[casuistry]] developed a similar theory, criticized by [[Blaise Pascal]] in the ''[[Provincial Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ganns, H. G. [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic27philuoft#page/334/mode/2up ''"The Jesuits and Tyrannicide,"''] The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XXVII, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Before them, the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher [[John of Salisbury]] also legitimised tyrannicide, under specific conditions, in the ''[[Policraticus]]'', circa 1159.{{sfn|Voegelin|1989|pp=122–123}} His theory was derived from his idea of the state as a political organism in which all the members cooperate actively in the realization of the common utility and justice. He held that when the ruler of this [[body politic]] behaves tyrannically, failing to perform his characteristic responsibilities, the other limbs and organs are bound by their duty to the public welfare and God to correct and, ultimately, to slay the tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=1988|volume=50|pages=365–389|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/S0034670500036305|title=A Duty to Kill: John of Salisbury's Theory of Tyrannicide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1408 the theologian [[Jean Petit (theologian)|Jean Petit]] used biblical examples to justify tyrannicide following the murder of [[Louis I, Duke of Orleans]] by Petit's patron [[John the Fearless]], Duke of Burgundy. Petit's thesis was extensively discussed and eventually condemned by the church. ''A Shone Treatise of Politike Power'', written by [[John Ponet]] in 1556, argued that the people are custodians of natural and divine law, and that if governors and kings violated their trust, then they forfeited their power, whether they relinquished their positions voluntarily or whether they had to be removed forcefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Oh, Ye Are For Anarchy!": Consent Theory in the Radical Libertarian Tradition|author=C Watner|publisher=Journal of Libertarian Studies|year=1986|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/8_1/8_1_9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' by [[John Milton]] in 1649 also described the history of tyrannicide, and a defense of it when appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/tenure/ |title= Milton: The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates |last= Luxon |first= Thomas H., ed. |work= The Milton Reading Room |publisher= [[Dartmouth College]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate= 2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
Throughout history, many leaders have died under the pretext of tyrannicide. [[Hipparchus (tyrant)|Hipparchus]], one of the last Greek leaders to use the title of "[[list of ancient Greek tyrants|tyrant]]," was assassinated in 514 BC by [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], the original tyrannicides.{{sfn|Law|2009|p=18}}&lt;ref name=harmodius/&gt; Since then "tyrant" has been a pejorative term, lacking objective criteria. Many rulers and heads of state have been considered as such by their enemies but not by their adherents and supporters. For example, when [[John Wilkes Booth]] [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, he wrote how he considered [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] a tyrant while comparing himself to [[Marcus Junius Brutus]],{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=17}} who stabbed the [[Roman dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC.{{sfn|Law|2009|p=23}}

Tyrannicides have a poor record of achieving their intended outcome. Caesar's death, for example, failed to bring a return to republican power, and instead led to the [[Roman Empire]], but it galvanized later assassins like Booth. Several of Caesar's successors (as Roman Emperors) were also killed for their tyrannical actions, including [[Caligula]], who was stabbed in 41 by [[Cassius Chaerea]] and other [[Praetorian Guard]]s,&lt;ref name=montefiore/&gt; and [[Domitian]], stabbed in 96 by a steward of [[Flavia Domitilla (saint)|Flavia Domitilla]] named Stephanus.{{sfn|Law|2009|p=26}} Many attempts on [[Commodus]]'s life in the late 2nd century failed, including the one instigated by his own sister [[Lucilla]], but he ultimately fell victim to his own excess by a successful murderous coup.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/71*.html Roman History], 71.1, 3; 73.4.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], tyrannicide continued in the [[Byzantine Empire]] when Emperor [[Andronikos I Komnenos]], was tied to a pillar, beaten, and dismembered by a mob in 1185.&lt;ref name=montefiore/&gt;

Tyrannicide has also been connected to revolution, with many taking place during successful revolutions, and others sparking revolutionary upheavals. In the midst of the [[French Revolution]], [[Maximilien Robespierre]], took power as the [[List of Presidents of the National Convention|President of the National Convention]], but after leading the [[Reign of Terror]] from 1793 to 1794, he was executed by beheading by the [[National Convention]]. The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], one of the [[Revolutions of 1989]], enabled a group of defected soldiers to capture [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], the country's communist leader, and to stage a trial after which he was executed by a firing squad of paratroopers Ionel Boeru, Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian Cirlan.{{sfn|Graubard|1999|pp=72–73}}

Many assassins have been killed in the act, such as [[Rigoberto López Pérez]], who shot [[Nicaragua]]n dictator [[Anastasio Somoza García]] in 1956.{{sfn|Borge|1992|p=54}} Others were prosecuted for the killing: [[Antonio de la Maza]] and his conspirators were executed after their shooting of [[Rafael Trujillo]], dictator of the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1961,{{sfn|Diederich|1990|p=20}} as was [[Kim Jaegyu]], who [[Assassination of Park Chung-hee|shot]] [[South Korea]]n dictator [[Park Chung-hee]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hearts and Minds; Without Kim Jae-kyu? The Morality of Tyrannicide |work= [[Korea Times]] |date= July 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of the members of [[Young Bosnia]] who were involved with the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo]] were sentenced to death by hanging, while eleven were sentenced to various years in prison, including [[Gavrilo Princip]] who fired the fatal shot. [[Khalid Islambouli]] was one of three members of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] executed for the [[assassination of Anwar Sadat]], the autocratic [[President of Egypt]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Sorrows of Egypt: A Tale of Two Men |journal= [[Foreign Affairs]] |publisher= [[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=September–October 1995 |first= Fouad |last= Ajami}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even both Hipparchus's assassins were themselves killed, Harmodius on the spot and Aristogeiton after being tortured, and the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|major conspirators]] in the plot to kill Caesar were likewise killed or forced to commit suicide.

Outright revolt was the context for other tyrannicides, and allowed individual killers to escape or remain anonymous. During [[World War II]] and the [[Italian resistance movement]], [[Walter Audisio]] claimed to have led his team of partisans in the abduction and execution by firing squad of [[Benito Mussolini]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=montefiore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804084,00.html |title= What Price Brutus? |work= [[Time Magazine]] |date= April 7, 1947 |accessdate= October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances remain clouded, though Audisio was later elected to both the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Italian Senate]]. In 1990, [[Samuel Doe]], the [[President of Liberia]] was tortured to his death. In 1996, during their takeover of Afghanistan, [[Taliban]] soldiers captured [[Mohammad Najibullah]], the President of the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], and dragged him to death. [[Saddam Hussein]], [[President of Iraq]] [[Execution of Saddam Hussein|was executed]] in 2006. During the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], the self-titled "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution," was killed in the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|Battle of Sirte]], in unclear circumstances.&lt;ref name=montefiore&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/qaddafi-and-the-lives-of-tyrants.html |title= Dictators Get the Deaths They Deserve |first= Simon Sebag |last= Montefiore |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= October 26, 2011 |accessdate= October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Tyrannicide is a popular [[Trope (literature)|literary trope]]. Many works of fiction deal with the struggle of an individual or group of individuals to overthrow and kill an unjust tyrant. Often the tyranny is caused by an usurper to a royal throne, where the conclusion restores the proper heir. [[Children's literature]] frequently deals with the subject. [[Folklore|Folk tales]] like [[The Nutcracker]] include the act, as do some video games series, like [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]] and [[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]. Examples in Disney animation include ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' which both involve the tyrannical takeover of a monarchy and its overhaul. Fantasy works like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', ''[[The Brothers Lionheart]]'', ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and science-fiction series like ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' all deal with the killing of tyrants. Besides ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', a number of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays deal with the subject, including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', and ''[[Richard III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rmmla.wsu.edu/ereview/60.2/reviews/rasmussen.asp |title= Tyranny in Shakespeare |first= Mary Ann |last= McGrail |work= Utah Valley State College |year= 2001 |accessdate= 2008-09-18 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120802123506/http://rmmla.wsu.edu/ereview/60.2/reviews/rasmussen.asp |archivedate= 2012-08-02 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also the [[Italy|Italian]] dramatist, poet and philosopher [[Vittorio Alfieri]] has devoted much of his work on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Chalian, Arnaud Blin, ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda'', p.82, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Cities and Local Governments''' ('''UCLG'''); French: Cités et Gouvernements Locaux Unis (CGLU); Spanish: Ciudades y Gobiernos Locales Unidos (CGLU); is an umbrella organisation for cities, local and regional governments, and municipal associations throughout the world.  United Cities and Local Governments was founded in 2004, when the existing local government organisations - the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA) and the United Towns Organisations (UTO) – united their respective global networks of cities and national associations of local governments in a single organisation. United Cities and Local Governments' headquarters, the World Secretariat, is based in Barcelona, Spain. UCLG is the largest organization of sub-national governments in the world, with over 240,000 members in over 140 UN Member States&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uclg.org/sites/default/files/uclg_who_we_are_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and understands itself as the united voice and world advocate of democratic local self-government, de facto representing over half the world's population, the cities and association members of UCLG are present in over 120 UN Member States across seven world regions:
The organization’s activities include hosting meetings of mayors and other local and regional leaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uclg.org/en/events/past-meetings|title=Past meetings|website=UCLG - United Cities and Local Governments}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocacy for the interests of local and regional governments at the UN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uclg.org/en/action/international-agenda|title=Advocacy and Partnerships|website=UCLG - United Cities and Local Governments}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international peer-to-peer training on local policies and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.learning.uclg.org/|title=Frontpage - Learning UCLG|website=www.learning.uclg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCLG’s origins go back to 1913, when the Union Internationale des Villes (UIV) was set up at the International Congress of the Art of Building Cities and Organising Community Life in [[Ghent]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00002762/document&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the UIV, a permanent office for communication and documentation on municipal issues, marked the birth of the international municipal movement. The association had a Provisional Council of 30 members and its first seat was in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabat2013.uclg.org/news/ever-young-centenary-global-municipal-movement|title=An ever-young centenary: the global municipal movement - Rabat 2013. IMAGINE SOCIETY, BUILD DEMOCRACY|website=www.rabat2013.uclg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, the UIV changed its name to the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA).&lt;ref name="uclg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabat2013.uclg.org/about-us/centenary-international-municipal-movement#uclg2|title=Centenary of the International Municipal Movement|website=www.rabat2013.uclg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, IULA’s secretariat moved from Ghent to [[The Hague]] in the Netherlands,&lt;ref name="uclg.org"/&gt; where it remained until 2004. 
The United Towns Organisation (UTO) (French: Fédération mondiale des cités unies (FMCU)) was set up in 1957 in Aix-les-Bains, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montpellier.fr/48-federation-mondiale-des-cites-unies.htm|title=Fédération mondiale des cités unies - Ville de Montpellier|first=Ville de|last=Montpellier|website=www.montpellier.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially known as the World Federation of Twin Cities (French: Fédération mondiale des villes jumelées).

In 1984, then President of the Regional Council of Ile-de-France, Michel Giraud, convened the first Metropolis Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metropolis.org/timeline|title=Timeline|date=9 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constituent Congress of Metropolis was held in Montreal in April 1985, and was attended by 14 founding member cities: Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Colombo, Ile-de-France, London, Los Angeles, Mexico, Montreal, New York, Tokyo and Turin. The Metropolis secretariat was initially established in Montreal, moving to Barcelona under the presidency of then Mayor of Barcelona, Joan Clos, in 2000. In 2004, three international associations of local and regional governments – the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA), United Towns Organisation (UTO), and Metropolis – agreed to come together to form a single organization at UCLG’s founding congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/uclgcglu/docs/the_int_municipal_movement_complete|title=The international municipal movement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and membership ==
UCLG is a membership organization with a democratic, federal structure. Its members include individual local and regional governments and their national associations. UCLG’s governing bodies are made up of locally elected leaders, chosen by their peers in elections by UCLG members. UCLG’s President for the 2016-2019 mandate is [[Parks Tau]], President of the South African Local Government Association (SALGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sapeople.com/2016/10/16/former-joburg-mayor-parks-tau-elected-president-top-world-body/|title=Former Joburg Mayor Parks Tau Elected President of Top World Body - SAPeople - Your Worldwide South African Community|date=16 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
