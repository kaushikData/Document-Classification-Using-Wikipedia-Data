== Early life ==
Agnivesh was born as Vepa Shyam Rao on 21st of September, 1939 in an orthodox [[Hindu]] family at Srikakulam in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. He lost his father at the age of four. He was brought up by his maternal grandfather who was the  Diwan of a princely state called [[Sakti State|Shakti]], now in [[Chhattisgarh]]. He gained degrees in Law and Commerce, became a lecturer in management at the reputed [[St Xavier's College in Kolkata]] and for a while practiced law as a junior to [[Sabyasachi Mukharji|Sabyasachi Mukherji]] who later would become [[Chief Justice of India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swamiagnivesh.com/life-journey.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
In 1970, Agnivesh founded Arya Sabha, a political party based on [[Arya Samaj]] principles as he himself formulated in his 1974 book, ''Vaidik Samajvad''.&lt;ref name=right&gt;[http://www.rightlivelihood.org/swami-agnivesh.html Swami Agnivesh (India), Joint Honorary Award with Asghar Ali Engineer (2004)- Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145432/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/swami-agnivesh.html |date=2 December 2008 }} ''[[Right Livelihood Award]] Official website.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnivesh became a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|member of the Legislative Assembly]] of [[Haryana]] in 1977, and served as a cabinet Minister for Education in 1979 .&lt;ref name=sl&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Cw6EsO59aYC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Swami+Agnivesh&amp;as_brr=0#PPA72,M1 Swami Agnivesh – Profile] in ''New Slavery: A Reference Handbook'', by [[Kevin Bales]], ABC-CLIO, 2004. {{ISBN|1-85109-815-1}}.''Page 71-72''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, while still a minister, he founded the [[Bonded Labour Liberation Front]], which continues to raise issues surrounding [[debt bondage in India|bonded labour in India]], especially in the quarries in and around Delhi; he remains the chairperson of the organisation.&lt;ref name=sl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rdoOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Swami+Agnivesh&amp;as_brr=0#PPA56,M1 Children in Debt Bondage] ''Children Enslaved'', by Roger Sawyer. Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988. {{ISBN|0-415-00273-7}}. ''Page 55-57''.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the Ministry, he was arrested twice, spending a total of 14 months in jail on charges of subversion and murder, of which he was later acquitted.&lt;ref name=sl /&gt;&lt;ref name=lnl&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swami Agnivesh| work=[[Late Night Live]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/the-swami-agnivesh/3500644|publisher=[[Radio National]], part of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=23 January 2002|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Feb 2011, Agnivesh with  Kavita Srivastava, [[Rajinder Sachar]], [[Gautam Navlakha]], [[Manu Singh]] &amp; Harish Dhawan helped in having negotiations with Maoists to free 5 abducted policemen in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Naxals-set-to-release-5-abducted-cops-in-Chhattisgarh-on-Feb-11/articleshow/7455222.cms|title=Naxals set to release 5 abducted cops in Chhattisgarh on Feb 11 - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Maoists-free-police-hostages-in-the-presence-of-Swami-Agnivesh/article15411852.ece|title=Maoists free police hostages in the presence of Swami Agnivesh|last=Sethi|first=Aman|date=2011-02-12|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, [[Maoist]] forces killed three members of the [[Chhattisgarh]] security and police forces; subsequently, the security forces allegedly attacked and burned an alleged Maoist village.  When Swami Agnivesh and his organisation attempted to bring relief aid to families in the affected village, they were met by a large group of demonstrators who attacked their cars with stones, claiming that the Maoists were responsible for the deaths of many security force personnel over the last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=John |first=Joseph |title=Dantewada mob attacks Agnivesh; SSP, DM shifted |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Dantewada-mob-attacks-Agnivesh-SSP-DM-shifted/767849/ |accessdate=14 June 2011 |newspaper=[[India Express]] |date=27 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228170702/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Dantewada-mob-attacks-Agnivesh-SSP-DM-shifted/767849/ |archivedate=28 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swami Agnivesh took part in the [[2011 Indian anti-corruption movement|2011 anti-corruption protests in India]] in August of that year. He would later break away from the main group of protesters, claiming that certain protesters had humiliated and conspired against him for political reasons. A video purporting to show Swami Agnivesh speaking to one "Kapil" (ostensibly [[Kapil Sibal]], who was then a minister), suggesting that the government should deal more firmly with "adamant" protesters, was circulated in the Indian media and via the internet. Swami Agnivesh at first claimed another "Kapil" was being referred to in the footage but would later assert that the video itself was doctored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=PTI|title=Team Anna conspired against me: Agnivesh|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-team-anna-conspired-against-me-agnivesh/20110902.htm|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerji|first=Annie|title=Swami Agnivesh turns to Bigg Boss in publicity quest|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2011/11/08/swami-agnivesh-turns-to-bigg-boss-in-publicity-quest/|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnivesh urged the prime minister [[Manmohan Singh]] in 2013 to initiate a dialogue with the Naxalites. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/swami-agnivesh-urges-pm-to-hold-peace-talks-with-naxals/articleshow/20862375.cms|title=Swami Agnivesh urges PM to hold peace talks with Naxals|date=2013-07-01|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social activism ==

Swami Agnivesh testified before the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of [[Slavery]] at the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Doing: An Illustrated Account of Movements for Women's Rights and Feminism in India, 1800–1990'', by Radha Kumar, [[Kali for Women]] Organization, Published by Zubaan, 1993. {{ISBN|81-85107-76-9}}. ''Page 180''.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he created a new task for emancipation of womanhood, which was a helpful factor in the [[Commission of Sati (prevention) Act of 1987]].

In 2005, Agnivesh was part of a two-week campaign against [[female foeticide]] that travelled across India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pandey|first=Geeta|title=Religions target female foeticide|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4427712.stm|accessdate=14 June 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=12 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnivesh also argued at a conference on economic development and religion sponsored by the [[World Bank]] that people should be allowed full freedom of movement across borders through the elimination of all [[passports]] and [[immigration laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malhotra|first=Rajiv|title=Language Hegemony and the Construction of Identity|url=http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/h_es/h_es_malho_hegemon.htm|publisher=[[Infinity Foundation]]|accessdate=14 June 2011|year = 2001| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20110615175248/http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/h_es/h_es_malho_hegemon.htm| archivedate= 15 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Agnivesh went to [[Haryana]] to join the [[Arya Samaj]] and on 25 March 1970, Agnivesh took the [[sanyas]] vows.&lt;ref name=holypeople /&gt; He was expelled from the organisation in August 2008, after 17 of the 19 Arya Samaj Pratinidhi Sabhas in India expressed opposition to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/9613/Madhya-Bharat-Arya-Pratinidhi-Sabha-takes-a-strong-stand-on-Swami-Agnivesh.html Madhya Bharat Arya Pratinidhi Sabha takes a strong stand on Swami Agnivesh] The Daily Pioneer – 26 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he addressed a large gathering at the Anti-Terrorism Global Peace Conference, at [[Ramlila Maidan|Ramlila Grounds]], organised by [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]] and several Islamic organisations, where he stated, "It is wrong to attribute the wrongdoings of a few individuals to the whole community." He also supported the demand by [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind]] that banned the singing of [[Vande Mataram]] by Muslim citizens of India. "I would not mince words to say that the United States is the terrorist number one. To defame the Koran and Islam is the worst form of terrorism. Islam stands for peace and brotherhood and there cannot be a bigger lie than saying that Muslims are terrorists." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jamat fatwa against terrorism|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/01/stories/2008060159940800.htm|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnivesh is also a proponent of [[interfaith dialogue]] and is a member of the Board of World Leaders for [[the Elijah Interfaith Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/programs/board-of-world-religious-leaders/leaders-of-religions-of-india.html |title=The Elijah Interfaith Institute – Hindu Members of the Board of World Religious Leaders |access-date=15 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426151115/http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/programs/board-of-world-religious-leaders/leaders-of-religions-of-india.html |archive-date=26 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a board member of the [[KAICIID Dialogue Centre]] established in [[Vienna]] in 2012 by [[King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]], together with the governments of [[Austria]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaiciid.org/governance Governance | KAICIID]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he opposed Government's plan of separate settlement for [[Kashmiri Pandits]] as part of their rehabilitation in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arya Samaj Leader Agnivesh opposes Separate Settlement for Kashmiri Pundits|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/04/arya-samaj-leader-agnivesh-opposes-separate-settlement-for-kashmiri-pundits/|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnivesh advocated rights of marginalised people in society and went to [[Pakur]] district of [[Jharkhand]] to address a rally of farmers and tribal. During this, allegedly a right wing mob attacked upon him and he escaped from lynching somehow with help of local people. Activists of all over the country in India and even of other countries condemned the incident. Many believe that his efforts is to reform the society and to bring facts based on logic about superstition and false agendas of all religions. &lt;ref&gt;http://risingkashmir.com/news/swami-agnivesh-the-spirited-monk&lt;/ref&gt;

He also led the march 'Raj Bhawan Chalo' on the death anniversary of journalist [[Gauri Lankesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/updates-swami-agnivesh-leads-raj-bhavan-chalo-march-on-gauri-lankeshs-death-anniversary/article24870455.ece|title=Swami Agnivesh leads 'Raj Bhavan chalo' march on Gauri Lankesh's death anniversary|last=Desk|first=The Hindu Net|date=2018-09-05|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism from Hindu groups ==

Agnivesh has been severely criticised by some Hindu groups for statements they view as [[anti-Hindu]].  In 2005, Agnivesh stated that the [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Puri Jagannath Temple]] should be opened to non-Hindus; this led to the priests of the temple condemning his remarks as "purely anti-Hindu in nature" and burning his effigy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/news/12-07/news1734.htm Agnivesh Kicks off Storm at Puri] Vaisnava News – December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, hundreds of Hindu priests protested against Agnivesh's claim that ice stalagmite in [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]] that they believe resembles Lord Shiva is just a piece of ice; during the protest the priests burnt his effigy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyindia.com/show/441120.php |title=Hindu priests protest against Swami Agnivesh’s statement over Amarnath shrine |newspaper=[[DailyIndia]] |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523234900/http://www.dailyindia.com/show/441120.php |archivedate=23 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Kashmir Observer'', the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]], a Hindu nationalist political party, offered a 2&amp;nbsp;million bounty for killing Agnivesh, for negative statements he made about Kashmir and [[Amarnath Temple |Baba Amarnath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindu Group Puts Bounty on Agnivesh's Head |url=http://www.kashmirobserver.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7707:hindu-group-puts-bounty-on-agniveshs-head&amp;catid=15:top-news&amp;Itemid=2 |accessdate=14 June 2011 |newspaper=The Kashmir Observer |date=23 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095920/http://www.kashmirobserver.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7707%3Ahindu-group-puts-bounty-on-agniveshs-head&amp;catid=15%3Atop-news&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November 2011, the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] condemned Agnivesh for hurting the sentiments of Hindu People by commenting on the [[Amarnath Pilgrimage]]. The apex court bench of Justice [[H.L. Dattu]] and Justice [[C.K. Prasad]] told Agnivesh that he should weigh his words "many a time before uttering them lest it hurts the sentiments of the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/swami-agnivesh-should-weigh-his-words-supreme-court/articleshow/10653145.cms | title=Swami Agnivesh should weigh his words: Supreme Court |accessdate=8 October 2011 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}

'''Anthropological linguistics''' is the subfield of [[linguistics]] and [[anthropology]], which deals with the place of language in its wider social and cultural context, and its role in making and maintaining cultural practices and societal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|last=Foley|first=William A.|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781405198431|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal0031|chapter = Anthropological Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many linguists believe that a true field of anthropological linguistics is nonexistent, preferring the term [[linguistic anthropology]] to cover this subfield, many others regard the two as interchangeable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==

Anthropological linguistics is one of many disciplines which studies the role of languages in the social lives of individuals and within communities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ptk9xUamLeUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Duranti,+Alessandro.+%22Linguistic+anthropology:+History,+ideas,+and+issues.%22%C2%A0Linguistic+anthropology:+A+reader%C2%A0(2001):+1-38.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Linguistic Anthropology: A Reader|last=Duranti|first=Alessandro|date=2009-05-04|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405126335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, experts have had to understand not only the logic behind [[Linguistic Systems|linguistic systems]] – such as their [[grammar]]s – but also record the activities in which those systems are used.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, [[sociolinguistics]] and anthropological linguistics were often viewed as one single field of study, but they have since become more separate as more academic distance has been put between them. Though there are many similarities and a definite sharing of topics – such as [[Language and gender|gender and language]] – they are two related but separate entities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anthropological linguistics came about in the United States as a subfield of anthropology, when anthropologists were beginning to study the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous cultures]], and the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]] could no longer be ignored, and quickly morphed into the subfield of linguistics that it is known as today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521339193|title=Language Socialization across Cultures - Cambridge University Press|website=www.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropological linguistics has had a major impact in the studies of such areas as [[visual perception]] (especially [[colour]]) and [[bioregional democracy]], both of which are concerned with distinctions that are made in languages about perceptions of the surroundings.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Conventional linguistic anthropology also has implications for [[sociology]] and [[self-organization]] of peoples. Study of the [[Penan]] people, for instance, reveals that their language employs six different and distinct words whose best English translation is "[[we]]".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Anthropological linguistics studies these distinctions, and relates them to [[types of societies]] and to actual bodily adaptation to the senses, much as it studies distinctions made in languages regarding the colours of the rainbow: seeing the tendency to increase the diversity of terms, as evidence that there are distinctions that bodies in this environment ''must'' make, leading to [[situated knowledge]] and perhaps a [[situated ethics]], whose final evidence is the differentiated set of terms used to denote "we".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Structures ==

=== Phonology ===
A common variation of linguistics that focuses on the sounds within speech of any given language. Phonology puts a large focus on the systematic structure of the sounds being observed.

=== Morphology ===
Morphology in linguistics commonly looks at the structure of words within a language to develop a better understanding for the word form being used. Morphology looks broadly at the connection of word forms within a specific language in relation to the culture or environment it is rooted within.

=== Methodology ===
There are two major trends in the theoretical and methodological study of attitudes in the [[social science]]s - [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalist]] and [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agheyisi|first=Rebecca|last2=Fishman|first2=Joshua A.|date=1970-01-01|title=Language Attitude Studies: A Brief Survey of Methodological Approaches|jstor=30029244|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=137–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mentalist trend treats attitude as a mediating concept while the behaviorist trend operationally defines it as a probability concept, though in research practice both derive their attitude measures from response variation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh59S6WIS98C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Rethinking Context: Language as an Interactive Phenomenon|last=Duranti|first=Alessandro|date=1992-05-21|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521422888|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many different views concerning the structure and components of attitudes, there is, however, an overwhelming agreement that attitudes are learned, lasting, and positively related to behavior. Methodology in attitude studies includes direct and indirect measures of all kinds, but [[Language ideology|language attitude]] studies have tended to make more use of questionnaires than of other methods. The [[matched guise technique]] - a sociolinguistic experimental technique used to determine the true feelings of an individual or community towards a specific language, dialect, or accent - has been extensively used for studies relating to the social significance of languages and language varieties. A special adaptation of this technique, called [[Mirror image technique|mirror image]], appears promising for measuring consensual evaluations of language switching at the situational level.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Robert L.|last2=Greenfield|first2=Lawrence|date=1969-03-01|title=Language Use in a Bilingual Community*|journal=The Modern Language Journal|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=166–172|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1969.tb04584.x|issn=1540-4781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situational based self-report instruments such as those used by Greenfield and Fishman&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; also promise to be very effective instruments for studies pertaining to normative views concerning the situational use of languages and language varieties. The commitment measure has been found to be particularly suited for collecting data on behavioral tendencies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Data obtained through interviewing may be difficult to process and score – and may provide [[bias]] from those being interviewed – but the research interview can be particularly effective for attitude assessment, especially when used to complement the [[Observational methods in psychology|observational method]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Data collected through the observational method can be formally processed like data obtained through more formalized instruments if attempts are made to record the data in more public forms instead of only through the approach most characteristic for this kind of data have used so far.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many linguists believe that comparisons of linguistic and [[social behavior]] have been blocked by the fact that linguistic and anthropological studies are rarely based on comparable sets of data.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gumperz|first=John J.|date=1962-01-01|title=Types of Linguistic Communities|jstor=30022343|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=4|issue=1|pages=28–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an anthropologist's description refers to specific communities, [[Linguistic description|linguistic analysis]] refers to a single language or dialect, and the behaviors formed through verbal signs and structural similarities. The process of linguistic analysis is oriented towards the discovery of unitary, structurally similar wholes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The effect of these procedures is the selection of one single variety out of the many varieties that characterize everyday speech and behavior. [[English language|English]] is often thought of as one single language, as though people forget the many dialects and accents that come with it. English spoken in the [[United States|United States of America]] will not be the same English spoken in [[Australia]], or in the [[Africa|countries of Africa]]. Even [[American English]] spoken in [[New York (state)|New York]] will not be exactly the same as American English spoken in [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Code-switching ==
While [[code-switching]], a situation in which a speaker alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation, is not the only form of linguistic variability to carry a social, or referential meaning, it does provide a particularly clear approach to understanding the relationship between social processes and linguistic forms, because both the social and the linguistic boundaries in question tend to be most evident than in other [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] settings.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=John S.|date=2016-03-02|title=Language Contact, Inherited Similarity and Social Difference: The Story of Linguistic Interaction in the Maya Lowlands by Danny Law (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/610753|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=57|issue=1|pages=104–107|doi=10.1353/anl.2015.0002|issn=1944-6527}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anthropological linguistics, code-switching has been approached as a structurally unified phenomenon whose significance comes from a universal pattern of relationships between form, function, and context.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many linguists are approaching code-switching as a form of verbal strategy, which represents the ways in which the linguistic resources available to individuals may vary according to the nature of their social boundaries within their communities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZChqa7p4drcC&amp;pg=PP6&amp;dq=Heller,+Monica,+ed.%C2%A0Codeswitching:+Anthropological+and+sociolinguistic+perspectives.+Vol.+48.+Walter+de+Gruyter,+1988.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Codeswitching: Anthropological and Sociolinguistic Perspectives|last=Heller|first=Monica|date=1988-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110849615|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the emphasis is on language use in social interaction as the preferred focus for examining exactly how those processes work, it is clear that future research must take into account the situation of that interaction within the specific community, or across communities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The study of code-switching will increasingly be able to contribute to an understanding of the nature of [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In [[biology]], a '''biofact''' is dead material of a once-living organism.

In 1943, the [[protozoologist]] Bruno M. Klein of Vienna (1891–1968) coined the term in his article ''Biofakt und Artefakt'' in the microscopy journal ''Mikrokosmos'', though at that time it was not adopted by the scientific community. Klein's concept of biofact stressed the dead materials produced by living organisms as sheaths, such as shells.

The word "biofact" is now widely used in the zoo/aquarium world, but was first used in 1993 in the Education Department at the [[New England Aquarium]], Boston, to refer to preserved items such as animal bones, skins, molts and eggs. The Accreditation Standards and Related Policies of the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] states that biofacts can be useful education tools, and are preferable to live animals because of potential ethical considerations.

==Classification==

The Commonwealth of the [[Northern Marianas]] occupies a chain of 14 islands in the [[Pacific]] around 1,300 miles southeast of [[Japan]]. The total land areas are only 183.5 square miles and some of the islands are unpopulated. The [[population]] is approximately 15,000 are [[Chamorros]] and 1,000 are [[Chamorros]] and 4,000 are [[Carolinians]], total are 20,000 people.  Most [[Carolinians]] live on [[Saipan]], the largest island, though a very small island. [[Agrigan]], is reported to be populated solely by Carolinians speaking Carolinian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elameto|first1=Jesus Mareham|title=Linguistic Dimensions of Vernacular Education for Saipan Carolinians|date=1977|publisher=University of Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carolinian language''' is more usually known as [[Saipan]] Carolinian, it was born from several languages in the Carolinian [[language continuum]], due to a century of migration from the west Carolinian atolls to the Northern Marianas island of Saipan in 1815. Spoken mostly by the [[Carolinian people]], Carolinian is the most closely related dialect to [[Satawalese language|Satawalese]], [[Woleaian language|Woleaian]], and [[Puluwatese language|Puluwatese]] languages. Nowadays, Carolinian is still changing quickly in the face of [[English language|English]], which has dominated [[Micronesia]] since World War II. There are only a small percentage of Carolinian children left on Saipan, who can confidently speak the traditional form of the Carolinian.&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S.

==History==

===Early history===
Carolinian language comes from closely related languages and dialects. It is a member of the family of [[Austronesian language]]. The first residents were the [[Austronesians]], who came from [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwan]], not [[Chinese people]]. In 1952, [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] started to live in [[Caroline Islands|Carolinian]] islands and spoke the language. Later, the people had communicated with the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] in the main linguistic areas of the Carolinian language at the end of the 1600s. Between 1795 and 1797, a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] official, who was Don Luis de Torres on [[Guam]], began to study the Carolinian and discovered its [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]]. During the 1700s, there were more than two Carolinian drift voyages to the [[Philippines]] and more than four drift voyages to [[Guam]]. The voyages spread a lot of information on Carolinian culture and language from outside islands during the same period.&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S. James |title=Saipan Carolinian, One Chuukic Language Blended From Many |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JimEllisFinal.pdf |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, all contribute to the idea that there was a range of reasons for the maintenance of inter-island travel, and therefore supporting the Carolinian language continuum. Besides the necessity to survive, it also had many benefits to communicate, trade, and family relations. The evolution of Carolinian language would someway have been different that the Carolinian people moved to [[Saipan]] when the [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]] occupied them. However,  [[Saipan]] had been abandoned in about 1815. Thanks to the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], Carolinians had a beautiful undisturbed frontier all to themselves. The original Carolinian speaking group to live on [[Saipan]] would be the first speaker of Saipan Carolinian. Also, every migration from additional atolls would have added many complex languages through that time. It would be good to tell the stages of speaking evolution on Saipan, based on the continued layers of “blending” from the beginning period until today.&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S. James |title=Saipan Carolinian, One Chuukic Language Blended From Many |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JimEllisFinal.pdf |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For that to happen, it would require among other things, which were detailed information on all migrations from 1815 until modern times. Nonetheless, the historical records of movements to [[Saipan incident|Saipan conflict]] with each other at certain points along the way, and it is sometimes hard to know which group preceded which one. One thing that is the certainty is that the form of speaking on Saipan did not have an opportunity to specify during the 19th century. Some speakers coming and going between Saipan and the atolls indicated that the language was in a constant state of changing.&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S. James |title=Saipan Carolinian, One Chuukic Language Blended From Many |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JimEllisFinal.pdf |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late history ===
When immigrations came from atolls east of [[Satawal]], the population of Carolinians in the [[Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Marianas]] began to have a huge change after the 1850s. From 1865 to 1868, an [[English people|English]] entrepreneur, who was H. G. Johnson, moved about 1,500 Carolinians to the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], to help running his plantations on [[Guam]], [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and [[Tinian]]. This number population included Carolinians from Pollan is uncertain. Following the pathway of those 1,500 Carolinians from their first islands to the island of the first assignment in 1865 to 1869, and then on to their last destination by the end of the 1900s century, had so many challengings. The Spanish stone-walled until the [[Tinian]] Carolinian moved to [[Saipan]].&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S. James |title=Saipan Carolinian, One Chuukic Language Blended From Many |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JimEllisFinal.pdf |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Americans]] took over [[Guam]] in 1898, the Carolinians of the Maria Cristina village were still there. Also, the [[Americans]] tried to require the Carolinians in [[Guam]] to give their customary dress up. That was not going too well, and the Carolinians still wore their dress. Almost all of the migrations that led to populating the Carolinian community on [[Saipan]] had happened in 1911. Additionally, any voyages had no memory existing after about 1905. Specifically, it was the biggest influx of outer island Carolinians to Saipan during 1905 and 1907. Especially when [[Germans|German]] ships using moved hundreds of [[Mortlockese language|Mortlockese]] and other atoll dwellers to [[Saipan]] because of the typhoon devastation on the outer islands in 1907. There was not any huge impact on the language traits that Carolinian language was utilized. This stems from the fact that the migrations were directed into areas of [[Saipan]] away from the established villages. Many islanders returned to their original island homes as soon as the crop on the outer islands could recover from the 1907 typhoon, which was a crucial movement for the Carolinian history to influence the language changes.  Only a few people who shared from these forced migrations remained on [[Saipan]].&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S. James |title=Saipan Carolinian, One Chuukic Language Blended From Many |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JimEllisFinal.pdf |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, both northern and southern Saipan Carolinians have spread throughout populated areas of [[Saipan]], include the new Kagman homestead areas, which built by the government on the eastern shore. Two events began the process on [[Saipan]] whereby the Saipan Carolinians began to reconnect with their outer-island roots in the 1970s. The first one was that a navigator made a voyage from the outer islands to [[Saipan]] in 1969 when after a lapse of 60 or 70 years. Saipan Carolinians were in the overpowering current of [[United States|U.S]]., and global influence in a new political reality meant for them. The impact of radio, printed matter, and the addition of TVs, video players, video games to virtually every Carolinian home would ensure that nowadays would never subside. While it is true to say that a certain amount of authentic and entrenched aspects of Carolinian language and culture would persist far in the future, the new arrangement would have an enormous impact on the language. There was still genuine interest in preserving the native languages. However,  the reality is different from what people plan.&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S. James |title=Saipan Carolinian, One Chuukic Language Blended From Many |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JimEllisFinal.pdf |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultures==

According to the history of the language, it is critical to show respect to the Carolinian culture, in particular for older people. First, Carolinian women must use precise words when they are speaking to their brothers and other male relatives. In addition, another way that a woman should show respect to her brothers or male relatives is when the brothers are sitting, and she needs to get up to do something, she must bend her back while walking past him, and her head should not be higher than the man. This is the norm in the Carolinian culture. Also, it is not good to go to the front of the brothers when the sisters pass; she should go around the back of them.

Second, in the Carolinian culture, dishes cannot be shared between sister and brother. Dishes used by males must not be used by females except by the mother of the man. This is their custom. Additionally, female's bedrooms are restricted. For example, brothers and male relatives must not enter their sister's or female relative's bedroom. Girls should be careful about their personal things, like underwear, which should not be seen by their brothers, after washing clothes they should hang them to dry in a separate place. Females cannot slap her brother, comb his hair, scratch his back and touch his face.

Third, there is a certain age when a girl must be doing these things. As soon as she gets her menstrual period, this is the starting age. In the outer island of the Carolines, when a girl reaches her period, she is placed in a particular house, where she is taken care of by the grandmother or old women. Her face is colored with orange coloring, and the whole community knows that she has got out of age. In [[Saipan]], people stopped the practice of a special house and coloring the face during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Many of Carolinians still practice all of the ways to show respect even today.

Last, there is respect shown between older men and younger men. For instance, the younger men must not give their opinion in a meeting unless they are invited to do so by the older men. Younger men should respect the older men and keep quiet before they do. Usually there is a world leader, who must be respected and his decision followed. Also, a husband must respect his wife's brothers and male relatives. When they need something, if the husband should have sex with his wife, he should in return help her brothers. He should make his plans fit into their plans. For instance, when they go to his car he should let them use. He should bring local food to the family party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warakal|first1=Rosa Roppul|last2=Limes|first2=Jose T.|title=Respect in the Carolinian Culture on Saipan|date=1980|publisher=Department of Education, Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands|location=Saipan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the consonants may appear initially, medially, and finally. In the final position, all the obstruents are obligatorily released. All consonants except / Ç / are unaspirated, and all stops and  / x / are lenis. The consonants  / bw / and / mw / have coarticulated labial closure and rounding with a raising of the back of the tongue toward the velum. the / bw / is usually spirantized to / βw/ medially. The / r / is a trill, which is voiceless word-finally. Moreover, all of the following single consonants may also be geminate initially, medially and in their abstract representation, finally: / p, t, bw, f, s, m, mw, ŋ, l /. Geminate / bw / is devoiced. in addition, Carolinian has geminate but not single / kk /. There are the five consonants / ş, x, r, w, y /, which may be geminated medially in productive reduplication. Geminate obstruents are tense and often give the impression of aspiration.

In addition to its native vocabulary, Carolinian has borrowed considerable vocabulary from Chamorro, English, and Japanese. Understandably, this has led to the borrowing of some phonemes from these languages as well. Although these phonemes appear only in borrowed words, many of these words undergo regular Carolinian phonological rules, and the international segments are assigned in the same way as native speakers. For example, the Japanese word / dzori / means slipper is borrowed into Carolinian and may be reduplicated. So / dzodzdzoori / means to be wearing slippers.&lt;ref name="Elameto" /&gt;

===Syllable structure===
The classic form of Carolinian syllables is either CV, CVC, CVVC, or CCVC.&lt;ref name="Elameto" /&gt;

===Simple sentence structure===
Carolinian simple sentences contain two major constituents, which are  the Subject Noun Phrase and the Predicate Phrase. The word order of Carolinian language is [[Subject–verb–object|Subject-Verb-Object]]. The following are some example simple sentences.&lt;ref name="Elameto" /&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Some researchers indicate that Carolinian language with the western half of the continuum. In either case, the next sister of Carolinian is invariably described as [[Satawalese language|Satawalese]]. Carolinian gets a little more in common with [[Woleaian language|Woleaian-]] [[Mortlockese language|Mortlockese]] than it does either [[Puluwat language|Polowat]]-[[Pulusuk]] or [[Satawalese language|Satawalese]], but with Polowat-Pulusuk showing slightly more influence than Satawalese. The lexical stock is one domain in [[Chuukic languages|Chuukic]] languages that can contribute substantially to the quest to find how Carolinian is put in order to its source languages since there is a significant amount of diversity among the languages’ lexicons. That is quite true even though each [[Chuukic languages|Chuukic]] language has close to a very high 50% lexical similarity with all the other members of the Continuum. Nonetheless, that still leaves the remaining 50% in which to find differences among languages, and this will prove to be enough to refine in on Carolinian lines of lexical inheritance.&lt;ref name="Ellis Final"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=S. James |title=Saipan Carolinian, One Chuukic Language Blended From Many |url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JimEllisFinal.pdf |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Past orthographies===

'''1'''. Most [[Saipan]] Carolinians are bilingual or trilingual. Their writing has reflected many foreign language orthographic systems. Despite the perfection of Carolinian writing, the following generalizations can be made. First, the vulgarized consonants / bw, mw, pw / were often written as digraphs when the following vowels are unrounded. However, / w / or / u / was virtually never indicated before rounded vowels or word finally. This phenomenon can be traced to [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] writing, there is a rounded velar glide that occurs only after consonants and only before unrounded vowels. The Carolinians seem to have interpreted their vulgarized consonants as plain consonants followed by glides, like the [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] phones. For instance, libual means hole of for / libwal /, but lib means hole for / liibw / the form imual for / imwal / means his house, but imom / imwɔmw/ means your house, puel for / pwpwel / means dirt, but po for / pwo / means pound.

'''2'''. The geminate consonants were not represented as it initially and finally, though some people wrote geminate consonants medially. This is almost surely a result of [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] influence. The only geminates in [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] are medial and as a consequence only these geminates are reflected in writing. For example, '''pi''' / ppii / means sand, '''lepi''', '''leppi''' for / leppi /  means beach, sand, '''mile''', '''mille''' for / mille / means this one. '''lol''' for / llɔl / means in it.

'''3'''. Carolinian are used to the 5 vowel symbols of the [[Roman Alphabet|Roman alphabet]]. These were used to identify the 9 distinctive vowels of the Carolinian language.

'''4'''. Long vowels were not represented maybe due to [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] impact, as there are no distinctive long vowels in that language. For example, '''fi''' / fii / means star, '''set''' / sææt / means sea, '''il''' for / iil / means mother.

'''5'''. In writing morphophonemic regularities such as the predictable vowel qualities before possessive suffixes, the Carolinian paid no attention to the underlying regulations. On the order hand, they focus totally on the surface phones. This is the same as Chamorro practice as well as to most of other [[Micronesia]]n orthographies.

'''6'''. Directional suffixes were usually attached to the preceding verbs. For instance, '''muatiu''' / mɔɔttiu / means sit down, '''mela''' / mæællɔ / means die, '''touo''' / towou / means get out.

'''7'''. The subject pronoun was almost invariably attached to whichever part of the verb phrase immediately was following. For example, the negative marker, the aspect marker, an aspectual adverb, or the verb itself. '''ese''' / e se / means he not, '''ebue''' / e bwe / means he will, '''eke''', '''eghal''' / e kke, e ghal / means he progressive, and '''emuel''' / e mwmwel / means he can.

'''8'''. When the determines were singular, they were usually connected to the preceding noun. For example, '''mualue''' /mwææl-we/ means that man, '''mualie''' /mwææl-ie/ means this man. Plural determiners, which were generally written separated. For example, '''mual kal''' /mwææl + kkaal/ means these men, '''mual kelal''' /mwææl kke + laal/ means those men, '''mual keue''' /mwææl kke + we/ means those men in the past.

'''9'''. The longer object pronouns were sometimes separated from the preceding verb stem, while the shorter pronouns are identical attached. For example, '''e weriei''' means he sees me, versus '''e uri ghisch''' means he sees us.

'''10'''. Sometimes morphemes were not written if they were phonologically assimilated to other morphemes. For example, '''ito''' for / i + itto / means I come.&lt;ref name="Elameto" /&gt;

===Saipan Carolinian Orthography Committee===

A preliminary meeting was called at the Headquarters Education Department conference room on July 21, 1976. The site was decided on in part since it was about equidistant from both the northern and southern Carolinian communities. The meeting was to review the initial steps for setting up an orthography acceptable to both communities and to select the members of the orthography committee. The official orthography conference was held from July 26 to August 4, 1976. The meeting opened with an address by the Director of Education for the Marianas. Mr. Jesus M. Conception, representatives from the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] Education Department and the [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] Orthography Committee also attacked the convention on an irregular basis. This is the first decided that no dialect would be chosen as the official dialect for school and government documents, In other words, the committee agreed to pick a standard system of presenting the pronunciations of all three dialects, and Carolinians should use that system to reflect the specific dialect pronunciations. So school teachers would not enforce the unique forms of one dialect but instead, allow students to use the spelling correctly for the dialect they speak.&lt;ref name="Elameto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elameto|first=Jesus Mareham|title=Linguistic Dimensions of Vernacular Education for Saipan Carolinians|date=1977|publisher=University of Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==

The Carolinians use a wide range of experiences in selecting the alphabetic system they use. For example, many of the older Carolinians are at least familiar with German from the German occupation. Depending on these, people would often use umlaut diacritics for the writing some vowels. A German influence could also be detected in the writing of the coronal spirant /s/ as /sch/. However, other speakers use their knowledge of [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] orthography to write Carolinian. As Chamorro has three fewer phonemic vowels than Carolinian and does not include Carolinians distinctive vowel length, initial consonant gemination, or velarized labials, individual systems based on Chamorro contained many double meanings. However, other Carolinians based their spelling in English, no individual writer could make use of the system.&lt;ref name="Elameto" /&gt;

The '''Chungcheong dialects''' of the [[Korean language]] are spoken in the [[Chungcheong-do|Chungcheong]] ([[Hoseo]]) region of South Korea, including the metropolitan city of [[Daejeon]].

Chungcheong dialect can be divided into two categories: the Northern Chungcheong dialect, notable for its similarity capital [[Gyeonggi]] region speech and the Southern dialect, closer to the [[Jeolla dialect]]. Chungcheong dialect is notable for its slow enunciations and unique jargon. It usually replaces the standard ~겠다 (gettda) at the end of sentences with '~것다' (geotda) and uses phrases such as '기여' (giyeo) (yes) instead of the standard '맞다' (matda) or '근디' (geunji) (but) instead of '그런데' (geureonde). Chungcheong people may occasionally pronounce the ending form '~이니까' (inikka) with '~이니께' (inikke). Similar to the Jeolla dialect, Chungcheong dialect often transforms the vowel ㅐ with ㅕ instead of ㅑ, which may be more common in other dialects. However, due to the proliferation of Seoul standardization in cities such as Daejon, Chungcheong dialect is difficult to hear outside of the rural regions of the province.

Climax species, also called '''late [[Sere (ecology)|seral]]''', '''late-successional''', '''[[K-selected]]''' or '''equilibrium''' species, are [[plant]] [[species]] that will remain essentially unchanged in terms of species composition for as long as a site remains undisturbed.  They are the most [[Shade tolerance|shade-tolerant]] species of [[tree]] to establish in the process of [[Ecological succession|forest succession]].  The [[seedling]]s of climax species can grow in the shade of the parent trees, ensuring their dominance indefinitely.  A [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], such as fire, may kill the climax species, allowing [[pioneer species|pioneer]] or earlier successional species to re-establish for a time.  They are the opposite of [[pioneer species]], also known as [[ruderal species|ruderal]], fugitive, opportunistic or [[R-selected]] species, in the sense that climax species are good competitors but poor colonizers, whereas pioneer species are good colonizers but poor competitors.  Climax species dominate the [[climax community]], when the pace of succession slows down, the result of [[ecological homeostasis]], which features maximum permitted [[biodiversity]], given the prevailing [[ecology|ecological]] conditions.  Their reproductive strategies and other adaptive characteristics can be considered more sophisticated than those of opportunistic species.  Through [[negative feedback]], they adapt themselves to specific environmental conditions. Climax species are mostly found in forests. Climax species, closely controlled by [[carrying capacity]], follow [[K strategy|K strategies]], wherein species produce fewer numbers of potential offspring, but invest more heavily in securing the reproductive success of each one to the micro-environmental conditions of its specific [[ecological niche]].  Climax species might be [[Semelparity and Iteroparity|iteroparous]], [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption efficient]] and [[Biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html Relationships Among Species] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616010027/http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html |date=June 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed term==
The idea of a climax species has been criticized in recent ecological literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/doaklab/timberland/timberland/results.htm Results, Analysis of Timberland Owned by San Jose Water Company] 2007-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;  Any assessment of successional states depends on assumptions about the natural fire regime.  But the idea of a dominant species is still widely used in [[Silviculture|silvicultural]] programs and [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|California Department of Forestry]] literature.

==Examples==

[[Picea glauca|White spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') is an example of a climax species in the northern forests of North America.

Other examples:
*[[Tsuga canadensis|Canadian Hemlock]]
*[[Abies amabilis|Pacific Silver Fir]]
*[[Abies concolor|White Fir]]
*[[Sloanea woollsii|Yellow Carabeen]]

{{Sound change}}

'''Debuccalization''' is a [[sound change]] in which an oral [[consonant]] loses its original [[place of articulation]] and moves it to the [[glottis]] (usually {{IPAblink|h}}, {{IPAblink|ɦ}}, or {{IPAblink|ʔ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|O'Brien|2012|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation of a consonant as {{IPA|[h]}} is sometimes called aspiration but in [[phonetics]], [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] is the burst of air accompanying a [[stop consonant|stop]]. The word comes from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|bucca}}, meaning "cheek" or "mouth".

Debuccalization is usually seen as a sub-type of [[lenition]], often defined as a consonant mutation involving the weakening of a consonant by progressive shifts in pronunciation.

Debuccalization processes occur in many different types of environments such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|O'Brien|2012|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* word-initially, as in [[Kannada language|Kannada]]
* word-finally, as in [[Burmese language|Burmese]]
* intervocalically, as in a number of [[English language|English]] varieties (e.g. ''litter'' {{IPA|[ˈlɪʔə]}})

==Glottal stop==
===Arabic===
{{IPA|/q/}} is debuccalized to {{IPA|/ʔ/}} in several Arabic varieties, such as [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]], [[Syrian Arabic|Syrian]], Urban [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] and [[Jordanian Arabic|Jordanian]] (partially and especially by females) Arabic dialects.
===British and American English===
Most English-speakers in England and many speakers of [[American English]] debuccalize {{IPA|/t/}} to a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in two environments: in word-final position before another consonant (American English IPA)
*''get ready'' {{IPA|[ˈɡɛʔˈɹɛɾi]}}
*''not much'' {{IPA|[ˈnɑʔˈmʌtʃ]}}
*''not good'' {{IPA|[ˈnɑʔˈɡʊd̚]}}
*''it says'' {{IPA|[ɪʔˈsɛz]}}

and before a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] {{IPA|[n̩]}} following {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, or a vowel. Here the {{IPA|/t/}} may also be [[nasal release|nasally released]]. (American English IPA)
*''Milton'' {{IPA|[ˈmɪlʔn̩]}}
*''Martin'' {{IPA|[ˈmɑɹʔn̩]}}
*''mountain'' {{IPA|[ˈmæʊnʔn̩]}}
*''cotton'' {{IPA|[ˈkʰɑʔn̩]}}
*''Latin'' {{IPA|[ˈlæʔn̩]}}

===Cockney English===
In [[Cockney#Typical features|Cockney English]], {{IPA|/t/}} is often realized as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} between vowels, liquids and nasals (notably in the word ''bottle''), a process called [[t-glottalization]].

===German===
In [[German language|German]], voiceless stops are commonly debuccalized before syllabic nasals in the following clusters: {{IPA|/mpm̩, ltn̩, ntn̩, ŋkŋ̍/}}, which thus become {{IPA|[mʔm̩, lʔn̩, nʔn̩, ŋʔŋ̍]}}. For example, {{lang|de|Lumpen}} (“rags, tatters”) is pronounced {{IPA|[lʊmʔm̩]}}. In some dialects, debuccalization may also occur before syllabic {{IPA|[l̩]}}, though this is less common.

Voiced stops are not usually debuccalized. However, many [[Upper German]] and [[East Central German]] dialects merge voiced and unvoiced stops at least word-internally  and these merged consonants will be debuccalized. Thus in [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]], {{lang|bar|Anten}} (“ducks”) and {{lang|bar|Anden}} (“Andes”) are both pronounced {{IPA|[ˈɑnʔn̩]}}. Speakers are often unaware of this.

==Glottal fricative==
===Slavey===
All coda consonants in [[Slavey language|Slavey]] must be glottal. When a non-glottal consonant would otherwise be positioned in a syllable coda, it debuccalizes to {{IPA|[h]}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Smith|2008|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPA|/ts’ad/}} → {{IPA|[ts’ah]}} ('hat')
*{{IPA|/xaz/}} → {{IPA|[xah]}} ('scar')
*{{IPA|/tl’uɮ/}} → {{IPA|[tl’uh]}} ('rope')

===Scots/Scottish English===
In some varieties of [[Scots language|Scots]] (and [[Scottish English]]), particularly on the West coast, a non word-final {{IPA|/θ/}} ''th'' shifted to {{IPA|[h]}}, a process called [[th-debuccalization]]. For example, {{IPA|/θɪn/}} is realised as {{IPA|[hɪn]}}.

===Proto-Greek===
In [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], {{IPA|/s/}} shifted to {{IPA|[h]}} initially and between [[sonorant]]s ([[vowel]]s, [[liquid consonant|liquids]] and [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s).
* [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*septḿ̥}} → [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|heptá}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἑπτά}}) "seven" (vs. [[Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|septem}})

Intervocalic {{IPA|/h/}} was lost by the time of [[Ancient Greek]], and vowels in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] were [[synaeresis|contracted]] in the [[Attic Greek|Attic]] dialect.
* post-PIE ''*ǵénesos'' → Proto-Greek {{lang|grk-x-proto|*génehos}} → [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{transl|grc|géneos}} ({{lang|grc|γένεος}}) : [[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{transl|grc|génous}} ({{lang|grc|γένους}}) "of a race"

Before a liquid or nasal, an {{IPA|/h/}} was assimilated to the preceding vowel in Attic-Ionic and [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and to the following nasal in [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]. The process is also described as loss of {{IPA|/h/}} and subsequent lengthening of a vowel or consonant to keep the syllable the same [[syllable weight|length]] ([[compensatory lengthening]]).
* PIE {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*h₁ésmi}} → Proto-Greek {{lang|grk-x-proto|*ehmi}} → Attic-Ionic {{transl|grc|ēmí}} ({{lang|grc|εἰμί}}) : Aeolic {{transl|grc|émmi}} ({{lang|grc|ἔμμι}}) "I am"

===Sanskrit===
In [[Sanskrit]], {{IPA|/s/}} becomes {{IPA|[h]}} (written {{transl|sa|ḥ}} in transliteration) when [[pausa|utterance-final]], e.g., {{transl|sa|kā́mas}} "erotic love" becomes {{transl|sa|kā́maḥ}}.

===West Iberian===
====Spanish====
{{main|Spanish dialects and varieties#Debuccalization of coda /s/|l1=Spanish dialects and varieties: Debuccalization of coda /s/}}
A number of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Spanish dialects and varieties|dialects]] debuccalize {{IPA|/s/}} at the [[syllable coda|end]] of a [[syllable]] to {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPAblink|ɦ}}.

====Galician====
In many varieties of [[Galician language|Galician]] as well as in [[Castrapo|Galician-influenced Spanish]], the phoneme {{IPA|/g/}} may debuccalize ({{lang|gl|[[gheada]]}}) to {{IPAblink|h}} in most or all instances, though {{IPAblink|x}} and {{IPAblink|ħ}} are also possible realizations. There is also an inverse [[hypercorrection]] process of older or less educated Galician speakers replacing the phoneme {{IPAslink|x}} of the Spanish language by {{IPA|[g]}}, what is called {{lang|gl|gueada}}.

====Portuguese====
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is much less affected by debuccalization, but it is especially notorious in its [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian variety]].

All over Brazil, the phoneme {{IPA|/ʁ/}} (historically an alveolar trill {{IPA|/r/}} that moved to an uvular position by both French and Arab-Berber influence){{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} has a rather long inventory of allophones:{{IPA|[{{IPA link|r}} {{IPAlink|ʂ|ɻ̝̊}} {{IPA link|ç}} {{IPA link|x}} {{IPA link|ɣ}} {{IPA link|χ}} {{IPA link|ʁ}} {{IPA link|ʀ}} {{IPA link|ħ}} {{IPA link|h}} {{IPA link|ɦ}}]}}. Only [{{IPA link|ɣ}}] is uncommon. Few dialects, such as {{lang|pt|[[South Region, Brazil|sulista]]}} and {{lang|pt|[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|fluminense]]}}, give preference to voiced allophones; elsewhere, they are common only as coda, before voiced consonants.

In such dialects, especially among people speaking an educated variety of Portuguese, it is usual for the rhotic coda in the [[Syllable#Rime|syllable rhyme]] to be an alveolar tap, as in European Portuguese and many registers of Spanish, or to be realized as {{IPAblink|χ}} or {{IPAblink|x}}. In the rest of the country, it is generally realized as {{IPAblink|h}}, even among speakers not normally using this allophone or deleting it entirely, as is common in the vernacular.

However, in some {{lang|pt|[[Minas Gerais|mineiro]]}}- and {{lang|pt|mineiro}}-influenced {{lang|pt|fluminense}} rural registers, {{IPA|[h]}} is used but as an allophone of {{IPAslink|l}} (rhotic consonants are most often deletede), a {{lang|pt|mar-mal}} merger, instead of the much more common and less stigmatized [[L-vocalization#Portuguese|{{lang|pt|mau-mal|nocat=yes}} merger]] characteristic of all Brazilian urban centers except for those bordering [[Mercosur]] countries, where coda {{IPAblink|ɫ}} was preserved, and the entire [[North Region, Brazil|North]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] regions. Its origin is the replacement of indigineous languages and {{lang|pt|[[língua geral|línguas gerais]]}} by Portuguese,{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} which created {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, {{IPAblink|ɻ}} and [[r-colored vowel]] as allophones of both {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (now mostly {{IPA|/ʁ/}}) and {{IPA|/l/}} (now mostly {{IPA|[{{IPA link|w|u̯}} ~ {{IPA link|ʊ|ʊ̯}}]}}) phonemes in the coda since Natives could not easily pronounce them ([[caipira dialect]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The later Portuguese influence from other regions made those allophones become rarer in some areas, but the {{lang|pt|mar-mal}} merger did not disappear in a few isolated villages and towns.

Finally, many {{lang|pt|fluminense}} registers, especially those of the poor and of the youth, most northern and northeastern dialects, and, to a much minor degree, all other Brazilian dialects, debuccalize {{IPA|/s/}} (that is, {{IPA|[ɕ ~ ʑ]}}) but less so than in Spanish. However, a {{lang|pt|mar-mas}} merger or even a {{lang|pt|mar-mais}} merger occurs: {{lang|pt|mas mesmo assim}} "but even so" or {{lang|pt|mas mesma, sim}} "though, right, the same (f) one" {{IPA|[mɐɦ ˈmeɦmə ˈsĩ]}}; {{lang|pt|mais}} light "lighter, more slim", or also "less caloric/fatty" {{IPA|[ˈmaɦ ˈlajtɕ]}}; {{lang|pt|mas de mim, não}} "but from me, no" or {{lang|pt|mais de mim, não}} "not more from me" {{IPA|[ˈmaɦ dʑi ˈmĩ ˈnɜ̃w]}}. A coda rhotic in the Brazilian dialects in the [[Centro-Sul]] area is hardly ever glottal, and the debuccalized {{IPA|/s/}} is unlikely to be confused with it.

===Romanian===
In the Moldavian dialect of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{IPAslink|f}} is realsied {{IPA|[h]}} and so, for example, {{lang|ro|să fie}} is realised{{lang|ro|să hie}}. The same occurred in [[Old Spanish]], Old [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Old Japanese]].

===Goidelic Languages===
{{main|Scottish Gaelic phonology#Lenition and spelling|Irish initial mutations|l1=Scottish Gaelic phonology: Lenition and spelling}}
In [[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]], ''s'' and ''t'' changed by [[lenition]] to {{IPA|[h]}}, spelled ''sh'' and ''th''.

==Loanwords==
Debuccalization can be a feature of loanword phonology. For example, while [[Korean language|Korean]] allows certain coda obstruents, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] does not. Those consonants realized in Korean as unreleased voiceless stops ({{IPA|[p˺ t˺ k˺]}}) may be realized in Japanese as glottal stops:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Whang|2012|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPA|[tɕuk˺]}} → {{IPA|[tɕuʔ]}} ('porridge')
*{{IPA|[mok˺]}} → {{IPA|[moʔ]}} ('neck')
*{{IPA|[mat˺]}} → {{IPA|[maʔ]}} ('flavor')
*{{IPA|[tap˺]}}→ {{IPA|[taʔ]}} ('tower')

Similarly, debuccalization can be seen in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] loans into [[Selayar language|Selayar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|O'Brien|2012|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital stamp''' in crafting, stamping, card making and scrapbooking is a digital image printed onto paper from the user's printer. Digital stamps come in a variety of formats, including PNG, JPG, and TIFF. Digital stamps offer many advantages over traditional rubber stamps because of their ability to be flipped, resized, rotated and easily stored.

In addition, digital stamps can be printed on a variety of papers and cardstocks, and when properly heat sealed can be used with a variety of coloring mediums including colored pencil, copic markers, even watercolors.

There are many digital stamping companies today.

A '''digital stamp''', in [[mail]] or [[philately]], is similar to a conventional [[postage stamp]] except it is resident on or in a [[computer]]. A digital stamp can typically be downloaded and printed onto [[envelope]]s or [[Mail|packages]] by authorized individuals.

Some [[artistamp]]-issuing entities have issued "digital stamps", which have usually remained only pictures on a computer.

A digital stamp can also be an encoded way of "approving" or "remarking on" a digital copy of a document.  Paper/hard copies of documents continue to be popular because they can be signed/initialed/remarked on in a manner that is unique and traceable to the reviewer.  A digital stamp seeks to duplicate or replace this and enable a paperless exchange of information that still manages to have a verifiable comment and review.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3731">'''Dose area product''' (DAP) is a quantity used in assessing the radiation risk from diagnostic X-ray examinations and interventional procedures. It is defined as the [[absorbed dose]] multiplied by the area irradiated, expressed in [[Gray (unit)|gray]]-[[Square metre|centimetres squared]] (Gy&amp;middot;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=kim/&gt; &amp;ndash; sometimes the [[SI prefixes|prefixed]] units mGy&amp;middot;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or cGy&amp;middot;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are also used). Manufacturers of DAP meters usually calibrate them in terms of absorbed dose to air. DAP reflects not only the dose within the radiation field but also the area of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] irradiated. Therefore, it may be a better indicator of the overall risk of inducing cancer than the dose within the field. It also has the advantages of being easily measured, with the permanent installation of a DAP meter on the X-ray set.
Due to the divergence of a beam emitted from a "point source", the area irradiated (A) increases with the square of distance from the source (A ∝ d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while radiation intensity (I) decreases according to the inverse square of distance (I ∝ 1/d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Consequently, the product of intensity and area, and therefore DAP, is independent of distance from the source.

==How DAP is measured==

An ionization chamber is placed beyond the X-ray collimators and must intercept the entire X-ray field for an accurate reading. Different parameters of the X-ray set, such as peak voltage (kVp), tube current (mA), exposure time, or the area of the field, can also be changed. 
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, a 5&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;cm X-ray field with an entrance dose of 1&amp;nbsp;mGy will yield a 25&amp;nbsp;mGy&amp;middot;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; DAP value. When the field is increased to 10&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;cm with the same entrance dose, the DAP increases to 100&amp;nbsp;mGy&amp;middot;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is four times the previous value.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orau.org/ptp/PTP%20Library/library/CRCPD/10-01_QA_DAP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1804">The German Feldpost number (FPN) (German: ''Feldpostnummer'') was a sort of postcode used for items sent by either [[military mail]] or [[airmail]]. Every unit had its own code. {{Main|Feldpost}}

== Structure ==

During World War II, the FPN usually consisted of five digits. The system began with 00 001 and ended with the 80 000 numbers. Six digit codes were used prior to the beginning of the war as exercise post numbers (German: ''Übungspostnummern''), and during it as collective post numbers (German: ''Sammel-Feldpostnummern'') for places with a higher concentration of troops, such as 123 321 for Festung Posen. 

Letters following the digits indicated under which command the recipient was, for instance operation headquarters or companies, while letters preceding the numbers stood for the following:
* L for units of the [[Luftwaffe]]
* M for units of the navy (German: [[Kriegsmarine]]) 
* SCH for units involved in the coastal protection 
The letter A generally signified headquarters company, the others stood for line companies. The sequence of a Feldpost number did not necessarily mean that the location of the units were at the same area.  It was not unusual for the same feldpost number to be used for different units throughout the war. As one unit would be destroyed, then the number might have been reallocated at a later date.

The reason behind the FPN was to keep the location of troops and certain divisions secret. Relatives received the respective FPN of the soldier through messaging cards (German: ''Benachrichtigungskarten'') which allowed for their mail to reach the soldier in the reasonable time of about two weeks.

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}
The '''Free World''' is a term primarily used during the [[Cold War]] to refer to the [[Western Bloc]]. More broadly, it has also been used to refer to all non-[[Communist state|communist]] countries. It has traditionally primarily been used to refer to the countries allied and aligned with the United States and those affiliated with international organizations such as the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and the [[European Union]] (EU). Critics pointed out the contradiction between the use of the term and the fact of its being applied to all NATO members even at times when some of them were ruled by military dictatorships ([[Turkish coup d'état|Turkey]], [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greece]], [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]]) as well as to various anti-Communist dictatorial regimes closely allied to the US.

==Origins==
{{See also|Allies of World War II|Participants in World War II}}
During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] viewed themselves as opposing the oppression and [[fascism]] of the [[Axis powers]], thus making them "free". Following the end of World War II, the [[Cold War]] conception of the "Free World" included only anti-communist states as being "free", particularly capitalist states which were said to have [[free speech]], a [[freedom of the press|free press]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]].

In World War II, the term ''free world'' was used to refer to the nations fighting against the Axis Powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Masur |first=Salim |title=Churchill's lessons for a modern world |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=29 May 2010 |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/salim_mansur/2010/05/28/14176341.html |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II the term ''free countries'' was used to identify the western allies. During the Cold War, the term referred to the allies of the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In both cases, the term was used for propaganda purposes.

During the Cold War, many neutral countries, either those in what is considered the [[Third World]], or those having no formal alliance with either the United States or the [[Soviet Union]], viewed the claim of "Free World" leadership by the United States as grandiose and illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wills |first=Garry |title=Bully of the Free World |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |date=March–April 1999 |pages=50–59 |doi=10.2307/20049208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has also been used in an ironically negative manner, usually in an anti-US context, by those who do not approve of either [[United States foreign policy]] or despise the United States as a whole.

One of the earliest uses of the term ''Free World'' as a politically significant term occurs in [[Frank Capra|Frank Capra's]] World War II [[propaganda film]] series ''[[Why We Fight]]''. In ''[[Prelude to War]]'', the first film of that series, the "free world" is portrayed as a white planet, directly contrasted with the black planet called the "slave world". The film depicts the free world as the Western Hemisphere, led by the United States and Western Europe, and the slave world as the Eastern Hemisphere, dominated by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].

==21st century usage==
"Free World" had its origins in the [[Cold War]], the phrase is still occasionally used after the end of the Cold War and during the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Left Alone by Its Owner, Reddit Soars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/business/media/reddit-thrives-after-advance-publications-let-it-sink-or-swim.html | work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-09-02 |quote=If the leader of the free world stops by to answer questions from your users, you're probably doing O.K. |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel P. Huntington]] says the term has been replaced by the concept of the [[international community]], which, he argues, "has become the euphemistic collective noun (replacing "the Free World") to give global legitimacy to actions reflecting the interests of the United States and other Western powers."&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel P. The Clash of Civilizations, 72 Foreign Aff. 22 (1992–1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership of the Free World==

===United States===
[[File:George_H._W._Bush,_President_of_the_United_States,_1989_official_portrait_cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[George H. W. Bush]], the [[President of the United States]] during the [[Fall of Communism]], was widely described in American media as the "Leader of the Free World." 
After Bush's presidency the term largely fell out of use.]]
The "Leader of the Free World" was a [[colloquialism]], first used during the Cold War, to describe either the [[United States]] or, more commonly, the [[President of the United States]]. The term when used in this context suggested that the United States was the principal democratic [[superpower]], and the US President was by extension the leader of the world's democratic states, i.e. the "Free World".

{{quote box
 |quote  = But remember, we have differences with our allies all over the world. They are family differences, and sometimes they are acute, but, by and large, the reason we call in the "free world" is because each nation in it wants to remain independent under its own government and not under some dictatorial form of government.

}}

The phrase has its origin in the 1940s during the [[Second World War]], especially through the [[anti-fascist]] [[Free World (magazine)|''Free World'' magazine]] and the US [[propaganda film]] series ''[[Why We Fight]]''. At this time, the term was criticized for including the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), which critics saw as a totalitarian dictatorship. However, the term became more widely used against the USSR and its allies during the 1950s in the [[Cold War]] era, when the US depicted a foreign policy based on a struggle between "a democratic alliance and a communist realm set on world domination", according to ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic Trump"&gt;Tierney, Dominic (January 24, 2017). [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/01/trump-free-world-leader/514232/ "What Does It Mean That Trump Is 'Leader of the Free World'?"]. ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The term here was criticised again for including right-wing dictatorships such as [[Francoist Spain]], and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] said in the [[21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|21st Congress of the Soviet Communist Party]] that "the so-called free world constitutes the kingdom of the dollar".&lt;ref name="The Atlantic Trump" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Safire2008"&gt;William Safire. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&amp;pg=PA265 Safire's Political Dictionary]''. Oxford University Press; 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-534334-2}}. p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in decline after the mid-1970s,&lt;ref name="The Atlantic Trump" /&gt; the term was heavily referenced in US foreign policy up until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991. After the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]] the term has largely fallen out of use, in part due to its usage in rhetoric critical of US policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=To Lead the Free World |author=John Fousek |year=2000 |publisher=UNC Press Books |page=130 |isbn=0-8078-2525-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGGGt-ui9sgC&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms implying a leadership role in the "free world" later came to be used for other persons, places, or nations.

===European Union=== 
In 2010, upon an address to the [[plenary chamber]] of the [[European Parliament]], US Vice President [[Joe Biden]], stated that [[Brussels]] had a "legitimate claim" to the title of "capital of the free world", normally a title reserved for Washington. He added that Brussels is a "great city which boasts 1,000 years of history and serves as capital of Belgium, the home of the [[European Union]] and the headquarters of [[NATO]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/justice/30025|title=Biden sweet-talks MEPs on anti-terrorism deal|access-date=2017-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/washdc_20100506.html|title=2010 News from Washington|agency=Embassy of the United States Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina|website=sarajevo.usembassy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany=== 
[[File:Angela Merkel Juli 2010 - 3zu4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Angela Merkel]]]]
When [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] declared the [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]  [[Time Person of the Year]] for 2015, they referred to her as "Europe's most powerful leader", and  the cover bore the title "Chancellor of the Free World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2015-angela-merkel-choice/ |title=Why Angela Merkel is TIME's Person of the Year |first=Nancy |last=Gibbs |date=9 December 2015 |access-date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following the election of [[Donald Trump]] to the US presidency in November 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Merkel "the Liberal West's Last Defender",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/world/europe/germany-merkel-trump-election.html |title=As Obama Exits World Stage, Angela Merkel May Be the Liberal West's Last Defender |last1=Smale |first1=Alison |first2=Steven |last2=Erlanger |date=12 November 2016 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some called her "the next leader of the free world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |website=The Washington Post|access-date=29 November 2017|date=21 November 2016  |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/21/how-angela-merkel-a-conservative-became-the-leader-of-the-liberal-free-world/ |title=How Angela Merkel, a conservative, became the 'leader of the free world |quote= Now, she is being hailed as the 'leader of the free world' on social media and by some commentators as the Obama era nears its end, Britain is beset by upheavals over plans to leave the European Union and France faces its own break-the-mold populist surge.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico 17 November 2016"&gt;{{cite web|work=Politico |url= http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-angela-merkel-the-last-leader-of-the-free-world/ |title=Angela Merkel's new job: global savior |date=17 November 2016  |quote=The fear of a xenophobic populist in the White House has liberals everywhere looking to Berlin for moral guidance.

Increasingly, however, the term "leader of the free world" was used in connection with Angela Merkel by commentators in the English-language media. An article by [[James Rubin]] in [[Politico]] about a White House meeting between Merkel and Trump was, ironically&lt;ref name="Zeit March 2017"/&gt; titled "The Leader of the Free World Meets Donald Trump".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=James P. |last=Rubin |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/the-leader-of-the-free-world-meets-donald-trump-214924|title=The Leader of the Free World Meets Donald Trump |work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German commentators agreed with Merkel's assessment,&lt;ref name="Zeit March 2017"&gt;{{Cite web |date=22 March 2017|access-date= 29 November 2017 |work=Zeit Online |publisher=Die Zeit |title=Nein, die Führerin der freien Welt ist Merkel nicht |trans-title=No, Merkel is not the leader of the free world |first= Matthias |last=Naß |url= http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2017-03/angela-merkel-besuch-donald-trump-usa-europaeische-union |quote=Als 'absurd und grotesk' hat sie den Gedanken zurückgewiesen, die Führung des Westens könne vom amerikanischen Präsidenten auf den deutschen Regierungschef übergehen.

['Absurd and grotesque' is how she rejected the idea that leadership of the West could be transferred from the American president to the German head of government. Which goes without saying, really, but others might have been more receptive to such flattery.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Merz]], a [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] politician, said  that a German chancellor could never be "leader of the free world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date= 29 November 2017 |publisher=WeltN24  |date=12 June 2017 |title="Ein Bundeskanzler kann nie 'Führer der freien Welt' sein"|trans-title= A German chancellor can never be 'leader of the free world  |first= Torsten |last=Krauel |url= https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article165426400/Ein-Bundeskanzler-kann-nie-Fuehrer-der-freien-Welt-sein.html|quote='Ein deutscher Bundeskanzlerkann nie "der Führer der freien Welt" sein' ...  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2017, columnist [[James Kirchick]] stressed the importance of the [[German federal election, 2017|German elections]] (on  which "the future of the free world" depended) since America had "abdicated its traditional role as leader of the free world  by electing Trump, the United Kingdom was turning inward after the referendum  decision to leave the European Union and France was also traditionally unilateralist and now had an inexperienced president"; he called Merkel "something less than leader of the free world ... but something greater than the leader of just another random country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date= 6 April 2017  |access-date= 29 November 2017 |publisher=LA Times |title=Op-Ed: Germans need to recognize that the future of the free world depends on their election|first= James  |last= Kirchick  |url= http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kirchick-merkel-20170406-story.html |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
References to America's abdication of its role as leader of the free world continued or increased after [[Donald Trump]] questioned the unconditional defence of [[NATO]] partners and the [[Paris climate accord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/is-this-angela-merkels-moment-to-lead-trumps-move-to-pull-out-of-paris-accord-is-further-riling-europe|title=Matthew Fisher: Merkel's moment to lead?

Jagoda Marinić, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', noted that "Barack Obama all but literally passed on the mantle of 'leader of the free world' to Ms. Merkel (and not Mr. Trump), and most Germans feel empowered by that new responsibility" and that Germany "is coming to understand its role in standing up for liberal democracy in a world turning more and more authoritarian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/opinion/trump-is-saving-germanys-liberals.html|title=Opinion - Trump Is Saving Germany's Liberals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SS Africa Küche.jpg|thumb|Galley of the Austrian passenger ship SS ''Africa'' in the Mediterranean Sea about 1905]]

The '''galley''' is the compartment of a [[ship]], [[train]], or [[aircraft]] where food is cooked and prepared. It can also refer to a land-based kitchen on a naval base, or from a kitchen design point of view to a straight design of the kitchen layout.

==Ship's kitchen==
A galley is the kitchen aboard a vessel, usually laid out in an efficient typical style with longitudinal units and overhead cabinets. This makes the best use of the usually limited space aboard ships. It also caters for the rolling and heaving nature of ships, making them more resistant to the effects of the movement of the ship. For this reason galley stoves are often [[gimbal]]led, so that the liquid in pans does not spill out. They are also commonly equipped with bars, preventing the cook from falling against the hot stove.

A small kitchen on deck was called a [[Caboose (ship's galley)|caboose]] or ''camboose'', originating from the {{lang-nl|kombuis}}, which is still in use today. In English it is a defunct term used only for a cooking area that is abovedecks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O225-caboose.html Caboose]. Retrieved 27 December 2009. {{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation kitchen==
[[File:Air Canada AirbusA340 Kitchen.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A340]]-300 galley]]
The [[Douglas Aircraft]] [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]] was the first airplane with a planned galley for food service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deltamuseum.org/M_Education_DeltaHistory_Aircraft_DC3.htm |title=Douglas DC-3 |accessdate=27 December 2009 |website=Delta Flight Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004222652/http://www.deltamuseum.org/M_Education_DeltaHistory_Aircraft_DC3.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galleys on commercial airlines typically include not only facilities to serve and store food and beverages, but also contain [[flight attendant]] [[jumpseat]]s, emergency equipment storage, as well as anything else flight attendants may need during the flight. Aircraft in operation today mainly use the familiar [[airline service trolley]] system.

Airbus has developed a new galley concept called SPICE, presented 2010, which they publicise as a potential new worldwide standard with significant advantages over the current 40-year-old trolley technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/spice Airbus' SPICE Galley Concept.] Retrieved 27 December 2009.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610105144/http://www.airbus.com/spice/ |date=10 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Werner Sell===
The first airplane kitchen was invented (patented) by Werner Sell (Georg Robert Werner Sell) of Germany in 1930; the first fitted kitchens were delivered 1954, by 1955 [[Lufthansa]] had all their commercial planes fitted with a Sell galley.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1955 Sell also began fitting train coaches with kitchens, from 1960 on with the newly developed [[convection oven]]. 

==Household kitchen==
[[File:Kitchen Fitting (6).JPG|thumb|Example of a galley kitchen that has been hand fitted by a carpenter]]
The term ''galley kitchen'' is also used to refer to the design of household kitchen wherein the units are fitted into a continuous array with no kitchen table, allowing maximum use of a restricted space, and work with the minimum of required movement between units. Such kitchens increase storage space by working vertically, with hanging pots, dish racks, and ceiling-hung cabinets common. Strictly, the term refers to a kitchen with the units in two facing lines, but is often used to refer to U-shaped kitchens as well.

The first mass-produced galley kitchen design was known as the [[Frankfurt kitchen]], designed by [[Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky]], working under the direction of [[Ernst May]] in 1926 for a [[Frankfurt]] housing estate. 10,000 units were installed in Frankfurt, and it was the most successful and influential kitchen of the period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1838">Several [[pope]]s are regarded by historians as [[illiterate]], including:
* [[Pope Zephyrinus]] (199–217); St. [[Hippolytus of Rome]] wrote "Pope Zephyrinus was illiterate" (Hippol. p. 284, ed. Miller).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wordsworth. 1887. ''A Church History, Volume 1''. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope Adrian IV]] (1154–1159); George Washington Dean writes: "Adrian IV., the only English Pope, had been an illiterate servant in a monastery at Avignon."&lt;ref&gt;George Washington Dean. 1890. ''Lectures on the Evidences of Revealed Religion''. p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope Celestine V]] (1294); Sir Maxwell Herbert writes of Celestine V: "On the commemoration day of S. Paul, Celestinus the Fifth was created Pope, who, albeit illiterate, was the priest and confessor of his predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell Herbert. 2009. ''The Chronicle of Lanercost, 1272–1346: Translated, with Notes''. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope Innocent VI]] (1352–1362); It was written of Innocent VI that "the new pope was so illiterate that he looked upon [[Petrarch]] as a magician, and this disfavor is supposed to have caused the poet's return to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. 1871. ''The Poets and Poetry of Europe, with Intr. and Biogr. Notices''. p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Conway Felton. 1871. ''The Poets and Poetry of Europe, with Intr. and Biogr. Notices''. p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wrongly regarded as illiterate==
[[Ludwig von Pastor]] has shown that [[Pope Julius II]] (1503–1513) was not illiterate, although he is poetically referred to as such by [[Desiderius Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Association Amici Thomae Mori. 1971. ''Moreana''. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip C. Dust. 1987. ''Three Renaissance Pacifists: Essays in the Theories of Erasmus''. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In biblical studies, '''inclusio''' is a [[literary device]] based on a concentric principle, also known as '''bracketing''' or an '''envelope structure''', which consists of creating a frame by placing similar material at the beginning and end of a section, although whether this material should consist of a word or a phrase, or whether greater amounts of text also qualify, and of what length the frames section should be, are matters of some debate. Inclusio is found in various sources, both antique and new.  The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself.  An important case of this occurs in the Gospel of Mark's treatment of the "Cursing of the Fig Tree" and the "Cleansing of the Temple" (Chapter 11).  By giving the first half of the story before the Cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion after, Mark creates a "frame" that effectively highlights that he wants the Cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the Cursing of the Fig Tree - i.e. Jesus' actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it.

==In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)==

While this may not be evident to many of the Bible's modern day readers, the [[Hebrew Bible]] is full of literary devices, some of which, having fallen out of favor over the years, are lost on most modern readers. ''Inclusio'', of which many instances can be found in the Bible, is one of these, although many instances of its usage are not apparent to those reading translations of the Bible rather than the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] source.

Particularly noteworthy are the many instances of ''inclusio'' in the [[Book of Jeremiah]]. A rather far-flung example of ''inclusio'' in the Book of Jeremiah can be found in its first section, chapters 1–24, which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11, 24:3), and by similar imagery—that of almond rods and baskets of figs. ''Inclusio'' may also be found between chapters 36 and 45, both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya, to whom Jeremiah's prophecies were entrusted. ''Bracketing'' can also be seen in The Lord's sayings in 1:10 and 24:6. Indeed, the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter—which some claim was appended to it—can be thought of as inside the ''inclusio'' formed by 1:1 and 51:64, both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (דברי ירמיה), thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader. None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio—those in which the section enframed is quite shorter—are not found in the Book of Jeremiah. An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22, which reads:

{| align="center" dir="rtl"
|כי אויל עמי אותי לא ידעו בנים סכלים המה ולא נבונים המה חכמים המה להרע ולהיטיב לא ידעו.
|}

{| align="center"
([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]]: ''For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.'')
|}

The phrase "לא ידעו" (''did not know'') is found at the beginning and the end of The Lord's analysis of his people. English translations do not preserve this structure.

Inclusio also abounds in other books of the Bible. An obvious example of inclusio is found in the first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118 "הודו לה' כי-טוב כי לעולם חסדו.". Another, more disputed, example may be found in the [[Book of Ruth]], where one finds a certain resemblance, if somewhat [[chiastic]], between 1:1 and 1:22—in the former Elimelekh leaves [[Bethlehem]] in favor of [[Moab]], and in the latter Ruth and [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] leave [[Moab]] in favor of Bethlehem.  Finally, it has been suggested that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2 contains inclusio, for the male is created at the start of the passage and the female at the end, providing textual evidence for the parallels between the two.

==In Rabbinic Literature==

The rabbis of the Talmud were aware of occurrences of inclusio in the Bible, as shown by R. Yohanan's comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that "Any psalm dear to David he opened with "אשרי" ('happy is he') and closed with "אשרי" ('happy is he'). Redactors of rabbinic document frequently made use of inclusio to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At the end of the Mishnah tractate Kelim, R. Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: "Happy are you, Kelim, in that you opened with [statements regarding] impurity and departed with [statements regarding] purity." Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the שמע (Hear O Israel) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate's opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate's end. Tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (M. Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (M. Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.

Many chapters of Mishnah are also framed by inclusio. In the opening mishnah of Taanit Chapter 1, R. Joshua notes that rain on the festival of Sukkot is "not a sign of blessing", and the closing mishnah of the chapter notes that rainfall after the month of Nisan is "a sign of curse". This characterization of rainfall as God's way of communicating His blessings and curses is a central theme of the chapter. Sometimes the inclusio is based on a wordplay. Ohalot Chapter 7 opens with a discussion of corpse impurity in a "נפש אטומה" ('solid monument')and closes with the statement that a baby whose head has emerged from the womb may not be killed to save the mother because "אין דוחין נפש מפני נפש" ('one soul may not be set aside in favor of another'). The use of the word נפש (nefesh) at the beginning and the end of the chapter in opposite meanings, symbolizing respectively death and life, emphasize the interconnection between the mysteries of birth and of death.

Examples of inclusio may be found in later rabbinic literature as well. Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge. Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear at the beginning and end of BT Bava Kamma Chapter 1. The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date, and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew. Rabbinic redactors, following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors, continued to employ inclusio as a literary marker and tool.

==In the New Testament==

The [[New Testament]] also uses inclusio. The main teaching part in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] starts and ends with the expression “the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew 5:17 + 7:12). [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]’s account of the first part of [[Jesus]]’ public ministry is framed by an account on his teaching and his miracles (Matthew 4:23 +9:35).
Also, Matthew’s Gospel begins with the prophecy that Jesus' name would be “Emmanuel, that is, ‘God with us,’” (1:23, in which the author has linked Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with the promise, "I am with you always, to the end of the age". This forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity. 
The [[letter to the Hebrews]] uses [[Jeremiah]]’s prophecy as an inclusio in 8:8-12 and 10:16-18.
There are many more examples of this literary device in the New Testament.

A '''joist''' is a horizontal structural member used in [[Framing (construction)|framing]] to span an open space, often between [[Beam (structure)|beams]] that subsequently transfer loads to vertical members. When incorporated into a [[floor]] framing system, joists serve to provide stiffness to the subfloor sheathing, allowing it to function as a horizontal [[Diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragm]]. Joists are often doubled or tripled, placed side by side, where conditions warrant, such as where wall partitions require support.

Joists are either made of wood, [[engineered wood]], or steel, each of which have unique characteristics. Typically, wood joists have the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a [[Plank (wood)|plank]] with the longer faces positioned vertically. However, engineered wood joists may have a cross section resembling the Roman capital letter "I"; these joists are referred to as [[I-joist|I-joists]]. Steel joists can take on various shapes, resembling the Roman capital letters "C", "I", "L" and "S".

Wood joists were also used in old-style [[timber framing]]. The invention of the circular saw for use in modern [[Sawmill|sawmills]] has made it possible to fabricate wood joists as [[Lumber|dimensional lumber]].

==Strength characteristics==
[[Image:Joist (PSF).png|thumbnail|300px|A ''single floor'' or simple set of joists. If the joists land directly above the [[Wall stud|studs]] they are ''stacked''.]]

Joists must exhibit the strength to support the anticipated load over a long period of time. In many countries, the fabrication and installation of all framing members including joists must meet [[building code]] standards. Considering the cross section of a typical joist, the overall depth of the joist is critical in establishing a safe and stable floor or ceiling system. The wider the spacing between the joists, the deeper the joist will need to be to limit stress and [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] under load. Lateral support called [[dwang]],&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Eric. ''Construction technology: an illustrated introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell, 2005. 105. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; blocking,&lt;ref name="Barry" &gt;Emmitt, Stephen, R. Barry, and Christopher A. Gorse. ''Barry's advanced construction of buildings''. 2nd ed. Chichester, U.K.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010. 3-94. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or strutting&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; increases its stability, preventing the joist from buckling under load. There are approved [[Euler-Bernoulli beam equation|formulas]] for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden floor joist for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the joist depth required for a 14‑foot span is 9&amp;nbsp;inches. Many steel joist manufacturers supply load tables in order to allow designers to select the proper joist sizes for their projects.

Standard dimensional lumber joists have their limitations due to the limits of what farmed lumber can provide. Engineered wood products such as [[I-joist]]s gain strength from expanding the overall depth of the joist, as well as by providing high-quality engineered wood for both the bottom and the top chords of the joist. A common saying regarding structural design is that "deeper is cheaper", referring to the more cost-effective design of a given structure by using deeper but more expensive joists, because fewer joists are needed and longer spans are achieved, which more than makes up for the added cost of deeper joists.

==Types==
[[File:Lipman Wolfe Warehouse-2.jpg|thumb|A ''double floor'' is a floor framed with joists supported by larger timbers.]]
In [[Timber framing|traditional timber framing]] there may be a single set of joists which carry both a floor and ceiling called a single floor (single joist floor, single framed floor) or two sets of joists, one carrying the floor and another carrying the ceiling called a double floor (double framed floor). The term binding joist is sometimes used to describe beams at floor level running perpendicular to the ridge of a gable roof and joined to the intermediate [[Post (structural)|posts]]. Joists which land on a binding joist are called bridging joists.&lt;ref&gt;John Henry Parker [https://books.google.ca/books?id=weoDAAAAQAAJ A Glossary of Terms used in the Grecian, Roman, Italian and Gothic Architecture] (1840)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"joist" def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) Oxford University Press (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; A large beam in the ceiling of a room carrying joists is a [[Bressumer|summer beam]]. A ceiling joist may be installed flush with the bottom of the beam or sometimes below the beam. Joists left exposed and visible from below are called "naked flooring" or "articulated" (a modern U.S. term) and were typically planed smooth (wrought) and sometimes [[chamfer]]ed or [[Bead (woodworking)|beaded]].

==Connections to supporting beams==
[[File:LUS28 Strong-Tie.PNG|thumb|A joist hanger.]]
Joists may join to their supporting beams in many ways: joists resting on top of the supporting beams are said to be "lodged"; dropped in using a butt cog joint (a type of lap joint), half-dovetail butt cog, or a half-dovetail lap joint. Joists may also be tenoned in during the raising with a soffit tenon or a tusk tenon (possibly with a housing). Joists can also be joined by being slipped into mortises after the beams are in place such as a chase mortise (pulley mortise), L-mortise, or "short joist". Also, in some Dutch-American work, ground level joists are placed on a foundation and then a sill placed on top of the joists such as what timber frame builder Jack Sobon called an "inverted sill" or with a "plank sill". 

[[File:Interieur stal, overzicht balklaag - Bocholtz - 20399966 - RCE.jpg|thumb|These joists land on a beam. Between some of the joists is a form of ''pugging'' used for insulation and air sealing. Image: [[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed]]]]
Joists can have different joints on either ends such as being tenoned on one end and lodged on the other end.
A reduction in the under-side of cogged joist-ends may be square, sloped or curved. Typically joists do not tie the beams together, but sometimes they are pinned or designed to hold under tension. Joists on the ground floor were sometimes a pole (pole joist, half-round joist, log joist. A round timber with one flat surface) and in barns long joists were sometimes supported on a sleeper (a timber not joined to but supporting other beams). 
Joists left out of an area form an opening called a "well" as in a stairwell or chimney-well. The joists forming the well are the heading joist (header) and trimming joist (trimmer). Trimmers take the name of the feature such as hearth trimmer, stair trimmer, etc. 

Shortened joists are said to be ''crippled''. The term rim joist is rare before the 1940s in America; it forms the edge of a floor. The outermost joist in half timber construction may be of a more durable species than the interior joists. In a barn, loose poles above the drive floor are called a [[Scaffold (barn)|scaffold]]. Between the joists, the area called a joist-bay, and above the ceiling in some old houses is material called [[pugging]], which was used to deaden sound, insulate, and resist the spread of fire.

'''Joseph Opatoshu''' (יוסף אָפּאַטאָשו in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], {{lang-pl|Józef Opatoszu}}) (1886&amp;ndash;1954) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born Yiddish [[novelist]] and [[short story]] writer.&lt;ref name="Keenoy"&gt;Keenoy, Ray (2003). "Opatoshu, Joseph (Yoysef)." In: Sorrel Kerbel (Ed.), ''Jewish Writers of the Twentieth Century''. New York: Fitzroy Dearborn. p. 747-749.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Opatoshu was born in 1886 as '''Yosef Meir Opatowski'''&lt;ref&gt;Mohrer, Fruma, and Marek Web (1998). ''Guide to the YIVO Archives''. New York: YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Jews|Jewish]] parents, Dovid and Nantshe, near [[Mława]], [[Congress Poland]].&lt;ref name="Keenoy"/&gt;

His father, a wood merchant, came from a  [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] family and had become a [[Haskalah|''Maskil'']].&lt;ref name="Keenoy"/&gt; He sent Yosef to the best Polish schools in the country. At the age of 19 Yosef went to study [[engineering]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France. However, privation sent him to the United States in 1907, where he settled in New York City, where his name became '''Joseph Opatovsky''', and he later took the professional name of '''Joseph Opatoshu'''.

'''Kazys Binkis''' (1893–1942) was a Lithuanian poet, journalist, and playwright. He used the pseudonyms K.Alijošius, K. Papilietis, Kazys, Kazys Roviejietis, Nedarbininkas, Neklaipėdietis, Nelatvis, Nepartyvis, Ras Desta, Riza Chanas and others.

==Biography==
Kazys Binkis was born on November 16, 1893 in the village of Gudeliai in the district of Biržai. He attended primary school at [[Papilys]], graduating in 1908; he studied at the ''Saulė'' (The Sun), taking courses for teachers and at [[Biržai progymnasium]]. In 1910 he entered the school of agriculture in Voronec (near [[Švenčionys]]), but for the lack of funds moved to [[Vilnius]] in 1913 and began to prepare himself privately for matriculation examinations. In 1909 K.Binkis began to publish prose and verse in ''[[Viltis (newspaper)|Viltis]]'' (The Hope), ''Vaivorykštė'' (The Rainbow), and ''Pirmasis baras'' (The First Field). In 1915 he graduated from the teachers' courses of the [[Lithuanian Committee]] in Vilnius and became a teacher at Papilys. In 1918 Binkis was elected a chairman of the [[Biržai District Council]]. In 1919 he was appointed a secretary of editorial board of the journal ''Liepsna'' (The Flame) in Vilnius. In the same year he moved to [[Kaunas]]. There he worked at the press bureau, volunteered for the ''Geležinis Vilkas'' (The Iron Wolf) regiment and participated in concerts. In 1920-1923 he studied, with interruptions, literature and philosophy at [[Berlin University]]. At the same time he took part in the literary movement ''[[Keturi vėjai]]'' (The Four Winds), being the leader of the budding Lithuanian [[Futurism (art)|futurism]] (1922–1928).&lt;ref name="antologija.lt"&gt;[http://antologija.lt/texts/43/autor.html LMS IC: Classic Lithuanian Literature Anthology: Kazys Binkis (about the author)&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at antologija.lt&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his living from literary work. In 1922, together with other authors, he published an almanac ''The Prophet of the Four Winds''; in 1924 he organized a journal ''Keturi vėjai''. He edited anthologies of Lithuanian folk poetry and songs. He also worked at the [[Society of Lithuanian Writers]]; for some years was a member of its board. He was a contributor to ''[[Literatūros naujienos]]'' (The News of Literature) and worked as a journalist.&lt;ref name="antologija.lt"/&gt;

Binkis died on April 27, 1942 in Kaunas, and is buried at [[Petrašiūnai Cemetery]].

==Literary works==

The heritage of Binkis's works is not large, but in all fields he achieved significant results. He wrote humorous and satirical poems, rhymed feuilletons, and published poetry books for children.&lt;ref name="antologija.lt"/&gt;

In 1920 his first collection of poems ''Eilėraščiai'' (The Poems) was published. This collection of lyrical poems is one of the best works of Lithuanian poetry of this era. During his studies in Berlin Binkis was influenced by modernist poetry; this led him to found the modernist ''Keturi vėjai'' (Four Winds) literary movement. ''Keturi vėjai'' did not leave great literary works but broke the routine, brought new literary forms, and this way made big impact on Lithuanian poetry. In 1923 (second edition in 1926) he published his second, futurist, collection of poems ''100 Pavasarių'' (One Hundred Springs).  From 1927 to 1931 Binkis published humorous poems in various periodicals; some of them were published as separate books - ''Tamošius Bekepuris ir kitos Alijošiaus dainuškos'' was published in 1928, ''Kriaučius Motiejus'' (Tailor Motiejus) was published in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tekstai.lt/tekstai/4vejai/apie/binkis.htm Ostrauskas, Kostas. ''Žodžiai ir žmonės: Straipsniai, atsiminimai, laiškai.'' – Vilnius: Vaga 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He debuted as a play writer in 1938 with a piece ''Atžalynas'' (The Undergrowth). Encouraged by the success of his debut, he started writing a new play ''Generalinė repeticija'' (Dress Rehearsal) which he did not complete. ''Generalinė repeticija'' had bigger ambitions, a different form, and composition. ''Generalinė repeticija'' was first time staged abroad, in [[Hanau]] camp in 1948, and was published in 1958 in ''[[Pergalė]]'' journal. In Lithuania it was staged for the first time in 1959 (Ostrauskas:1997).

== Righteous Among the Nations ==

During the [[Occupation of the Baltic states#German occupation 1941–1944|Nazi occupation]] Binkis hid [[Lithuanian Jews]] in his home. At the [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust memorial in [[Jerusalem]], there is a tree planted, commemorating Sofia and Kazys Binkis as among the "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]" (number 660).&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4013948 Kazys Binkis] – his activity to save Jews' lives during the [[Holocaust]], at [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lule''' is an indigenous language of northern [[Argentina]].

Lule may be [[extinct language|extinct]] today. Campbell (1997) writes that in 1981 there was an unconfirmed report that Lule is still spoken by 5 families in [[Resistencia, Chaco|Resistencia]] in east-central [[Chaco Province]].

It is unclear if it is the same language as ''Tonocoté''.

==Genetic relations==
Lule appears to be distantly related to the still-spoken [[Vilela language]], together forming a small [[Lule–Vilela languages|Lule–Vilela]] family. Kaufman (1990) finds this relationship likely and with general agreement among the major classifiers of South American languages. Viegas Barros published additional evidence 1996–2006. Zamponi (2008) and other authors consider Lule and Vilela two linguistic isolates.

There were three distinct groups known as ''Lulé'':
*The nomadic Lule of the plains, who in addition to their own language, spoke Tonocote, the local lingua franca and the language of Spanish catechism.
*The sedentary Lule of the foothills, who were trilingual in Lule, Tonocote, and Quechua in addition to their original language, [[Cacán language|Cacán]].
*The Lule-Tonocote, whose language was recorded by Machoni.

==Data==
In 1586 Father Alonson Bárzana (Bárcena) wrote a grammar of Tonocote, which is now lost. In 1732 Antonio Maccioni (Machoni), who was not aware of Bárzana's grammar, wrote one of his own, ''Arte y vocabulario de la lengua lule y tonocoté'' ('Art and vocabulary of the language of the Lule and Tonocote') of the Lule-Tonocote language at the mission San Esteban de Miraflores. This is our primary data on the language. Métraux (1946) concluded that Lule and Tonocote were distinct, and perhaps unrelated, languages, and that the Tonocote at the Miraflores mission had shifted to the Lule language by the time of Machoni.

Machoni records a language with vowels {{IPA|/a e i o u/}} and few consonants. Final syllables are stressed. There are consonant clusters in initial and final position: ''quelpç'' {{IPA|[kelpts]}} 'I split', ''slimst'' {{IPA|[slimst]}} 'I blow my nose', ''oalécst'' {{IPA|[walekst]}} 'I know', ''stuç'' {{IPA|[stuts]}} 'I throw'.

'''Lázaro Francisco y Angeles''', also known as '''Lazaro A. Francisco''' (February 22, 1898 – June 17, 1980) was a [[Filipino People|Filipino]] [[novelist]], [[List of essayists|essayist]] and [[playwright]]. Francisco is the recipient of the [[National Artist of the Philippines]] for Literature, posthumously, in [[2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy|2009]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2009/08/05/492914/national-artist-selection-scored|title=National artist selection scored {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Francisco was born on February 22, 1898 to Eulogio Francisco and Clara Angeles, in [[Orani, Bataan]]. He spent his childhood years in [[Cabanatuan]], [[Nueva Ecija]]. He took his college education at the Central Luzon Agricultural College (now [[Central Luzon State University]]), but was not able to finish due to poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/filipino/20090830/idealistang_nangarap_ng_magandang_daigdig|title=‘Idealistang nangarap ng magandang daigdig’ {{!}} The Varsitarian|last=Santos|first=Tomas U.|website=varsitarian.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a messenger of the Provincial Treasurer's Office of Nueva Ecija.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/4393/my-father-lazaro-francisco/|title=My father, Lazaro Francisco|last=Francisco|first=Floriño A.|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he took third degree civil service examination where he qualified to become an assessor of the provincial government of Nueva Ecija.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/manila-times/20090818/281771330209625|title=Lazaro Francisco's family take pride in National Artist honors|last=Galang|first=Armand|date=August 18, 2009|work=[[The Manila Times]]|access-date=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started writing in 1925, with five of his novels took him to fame. Being an assessor in an agricultural province, most of his writings were focused on small farmers and their current conditions with foreign businessmen.

[[File:Melker Garay 2015.jpg|thumb|Melker Garay 2015]]'''Melker Bent-Inge Garay''' (born 11 April 1966, in [[Tocopilla]], [[Chile]]), is a Swedish author. Born to a Swedish father and Chilean mother, the family moved from Chile to Sweden in 1970, just prior to the Chilean Revolution in 1973. He was raised in [[Norrköping]], on the east coast of Sweden, where he currently resides with his family.

His writing revolves around theological, existential and philosophical topics. Garay debuted in 2008 with his novel ''The Verger'' (published by Norlén &amp; Slottner). ''The Verger'' has been translated into several languages.

In 2009, he became a member of the Swedish Writers' Union, and in 2012, he was elected as member of Svenska PEN, the Swedish link to the International [[PEN International|PEN]] literary organisation. In 2014, Garay was elected to the Chilean Writers' Society.

Garay has pursued extensive university studies in both the Humanities and Social Sciences. While studying at [[Uppsala University]], he was one of the founding members of the 'Sine qua non' society, a culturally oriented society which published a journal entitled Kaos (translation: Chaos).

[[Image:Nova planta Catalunya 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cover of the Nueva Planta decrees of Catalonia]]

The '''Nueva Planta decrees''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Decretos de Nueva Planta}}, {{lang-ca|Decrets de Nova Planta}}) were a number of [[decree]]s signed between 1707 and 1716 by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]—the first [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[King of Spain]]—during and shortly after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]].

Angered by what he saw as [[sedition]] by the Aragonese and taking his native [[Kingdom of France|France]] as a model of a centralised state, King Felipe V suppressed the institutions, privileges, and the ancient [[fuero|charters]] (Spanish: ''fueros'', Catalan: ''furs'') of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the [[Crown of Aragon]] ([[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and the [[Kingdom of Majorca|Balearic Islands]]). The decrees ruled that all the territories in the Crown of Aragon except the [[Aran Valley]] were to be ruled by the laws of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] ("the most praiseworthy in all the Universe" according to the 1707 decree), embedding these regions in a new, and nearly uniformly administered, centralised Spain.

The other historic territories&amp;mdash;[[Navarre]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|other Basque territories]]&amp;mdash;supported Felipe V initially, whom they saw as belonging to the lineage of [[Henry III of Navarre]], but after Felipe V's military [[History of the Basques#A Basque trade area|campaign to crush the Basque uprising]], he backed down on his intent to suppress [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|home rule]].

The acts abolishing the charters were promulgated in 1707 in Valencia and Aragon,&lt;ref name="payne_bourbon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne16.htm|work=A History of Spain and Portugal - Vol. 2|title=Chapter 16, The Eighteenth-Century Bourbon Regime in Spain|author=Stanley G. Payne|accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1715 in [[Majorca]] and the other Balearic Islands (with the exception of [[Menorca]], a possession of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] at the time), and finally in Catalonia on 16 January 1716.&lt;ref name="payne_bourbon" /&gt;

The decrees effectively created a Spanish citizenship or nationality, that judicially did not distinguish between Castilian and Aragonese anymore, both with respect to rights and law. They abolished internal borders and customs except for the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque territory]], giving grant to all Spaniards to trade with American colonies (not only Castilians, as before).

[[Felipe V of Spain|Felipe of Bourbon]] won the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and imposed unification policies over the [[Crown of Aragon]], which had supported the claim of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Karl of Austria]]. These acts constituted the first successful realisation of Spain as a centralised state and were meant both as a modernising element, in line with other European countries where their monarchs were increasing their powers, and also as a punishment on these territories which had fought against Felipe V in the War of Succession. Henceforth, top civil servants were appointed directly from [[Madrid]], the King's court city, and  most institutions in these territories were abolished. Court cases could only be presented and argued in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], which became the sole language of government, displacing [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and other [[Spanish languages]].

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

'''Psychological resistance''' is the phenomenon often encountered in clinical practice in which patients either directly or indirectly exhibits paradoxical opposing behaviors in presumably a clinically initiated push and pull of a change process. It impedes the development of authentic, reciprocally nurturing experiences in a clinical setting. It is established that the common source of resistances and defenses is [[shame]], further its pervasive nature in trans diagnostic roles are identified.&lt;ref name="TeyberIPTPro"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Teyber|author2=Faith Teyber|title=Interpersonal Process in Therapy: An Integrative Model|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usHRQnMvD_oC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-60420-8|pages=136-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=October 2017}}

Examples of psychological resistance are perfectionism, criticizing, contemptuous attitude, being self-critical, preoccupation with appearance, social withdrawal, need to be seen as independent and invulnerable, or an inability to accept compliments or constructive criticism.&lt;ref name="TeyberIPTPro"/&gt; 

== Psychoanalytic origins ==
{{main|Resistance (psychoanalysis)}}
The discovery of resistance ({{lang-de|Widerstand}}) was central to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]]: for Freud, the theory of repression is the corner-stone on which the whole structure of psychoanalysis rests, and all his accounts of its discovery "are alike in emphasizing the fact that the concept of repression was inevitably suggested by the clinical phenomenon of resistance".&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", in Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early exposition of his new technique, Freud wrote that "There is, however, another point of view which you may take up in order to understand the psychoanalytic method. The discovery of the unconscious and the introduction of it into consciousness is performed in the face of a continuous resistance on the part of the patient. The process of bringing this unconscious material to light is associated with pain, and because of this pain the patient again and again rejects it".&lt;ref name="procedure"&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "Freud's psycho-analytic procedure". In J. Strachey (Ed. &amp; Trans.) ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud'' (Vol. 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;249–270). London: Hogarth Press. (Original work published in 1904.)&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to add that "It is for you then to interpose in this conflict in the patient's mental life. If you succeed in persuading him to accept, by virtue of a better understanding, something that up to now, in consequence of this automatic regulation by pain, he has rejected ([[repression (psychological)|repressed]]), you will then have accomplished something towards his education...Psychoanalytic treatment may in general be conceived of as such a re-education in overcoming internal resistances".&lt;ref name="procedure"/&gt;

===Primary/secondary gains from illness in resistance===
Although the term resistance as it is known today in [[psychotherapy]] is largely associated with Sigmund Freud, the idea that some patients "cling to their disease"&lt;ref name="procedure"/&gt; was a popular one in medicine in the nineteenth century, and referred to patients whose maladies were presumed to persist due to the [[secondary gain]]s of social, physical, and financial benefits associated with illness.&lt;ref name="leahy"&gt;Leahy, R. L. (2001). ''Overcoming resistance in cognitive therapy''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Freud was trained in what is known as the (secondary) gain from illness that follows a [[neurosis]],&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; he was more interested in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious processes]] through which he could explain the [[primary gain]]s that patients derive from their [[psychiatric symptoms]].&lt;ref name="fenichel"&gt;Fenichel, O. (1945). ''The psychoanalytic theory of neurosis''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolitzky, D. L. (2003). "The theory and practice of traditional psychoanalytic treatment". In A. S. Gurman &amp; S. B. Messer (Eds.) ''Essential psychotherapies'' (2nd ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;24–68). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model he devised to do so suggests that the symptoms represent an unconscious tradeoff in exchange for the sufferer being spared other, experientially worse, psychological displeasures, by way of what Freud labeled a compromise formation; "settling the conflict by constructing a symptom is the most convenient way out and the one most agreeable to the pleasure principle".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, contrasting the primary gain (internal benefits) and secondary gain (external benefits) from illness, Freud wrote: "In civil life illness can be used as a screen to gloss over incompetence in one's profession or in competition with other people; while in the family it can serve as a means for the other members and extorting proofs of their love or for imposing one's will upon them… we sum it up in the term 'gain from illness'… But there are other motives, that lie still deeper, for holding on to being ill… [b]ut these cannot be understood without a fresh journey into psychological theory".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "The question of lay analysis". In J. Strachey (Ed. &amp; Trans.) ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud''. (Vol. 20, pp.&amp;nbsp;183–250). London: Hogarth Press. (Original work published in 1926.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance as the product of conflicting agencies===
To Freud, the primary gains that stood behind the patient's resistance were the result of an [[intrapsychic]] compromise, reached between two or more conflicting agencies: "psychoanalysis...maintains that the isolation and unconsciousness of this [one] group of ideas have been caused by an active opposition on the part of other groups".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud called the one psychic agency the "repressing" consciousness,&lt;ref name="ninetysix"&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "Further remarks on the defense neuro-psychoses". In E. Jones (Ed.) &amp; J. Riviere (Trans.) ''Collected Papers'' (Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–182). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1896.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the other agency, the unconscious, he eventually referred to as the "id".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "Analysis terminable and interminable". In E. Jones (Ed.) &amp; J. Riviere (Trans.) ''Collected Papers'' (Vol. 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;316–357). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1937.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wyss, D. (1973). ''Psychoanalytic schools from the beginning to the present'' (G. Onn Trans.). New York: Aronson. (Original work published in 1961.)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The compromise the two competing parties strive for is to achieve maximum drive satisfaction with minimum resultant pain (negative reactions from within and without). Freud theorized that [[psychopathology]] was due to unsuccessful compromises – "We have long observed that every neurosis has the result, and therefore probably the purpose, of forcing the patient out of real life, of alienating him from actuality"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "Formulations regarding the two principles in mental functioning". In E. Jones (Ed.) &amp; J. Riviere (Trans.) ''Collected Papers'' (Vol. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–21). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1911.)&lt;/ref&gt; – as opposed to "successful defense" which resulted in "apparent health".&lt;ref name="ninetysix"/&gt;

Key players in the Kompromisslösung theory of symptom production, at the core of Freud's theory of resistance, were: [[repression (psychological)|Repression]] (often used interchangeably with the term [[anticathexis]]), [[defense mechanism|defense]], displeasure, anxiety, danger, compromise, and symptom.  As Freud wrote, "The action undertaken to protect repression is observable in analytic treatment as resistance. Resistance presupposes the existence of what I have called anticathexis."&lt;ref name="inhibitions"&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "Inhibitions, symptoms, and anxiety". In J. Strachey (Ed. &amp; Trans.) ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud'' (Vol. 20, pp.&amp;nbsp;75–175). London: Hogarth Press. (Original work published in 1926.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud's late view of resistance: the five types===
In 1926, Freud was to alter his view of anxiety, with implications for his view of resistance. "Whereas the old view made it natural to suppose that anxiety arose from the [[libido]] belonging to the repressed [[instinct|instinctual]] impulses, the new one, on the contrary, made the ego the source of anxiety".&lt;ref name="Freud, Psychopathology p. 320"&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'', p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Freud still understood resistance to be intimately bound up with the fact of [[transference]]: "It may thus be said that the theory of psycho-analysis is an attempt to account for two observed facts that strike one conspicuously and unexpectedly whenever an attempt is made to trace the symptoms of a neurotic back to their source in his past life: the facts of transference and resistance. Any line of investigation, no matter what its direction, which recognizes these two facts and takes them as the starting-point of its work may call itself psychoanalysis, though it arrives at results other than my own".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "On the history of the psycho-analytic movement". In E. Jones (Ed.) &amp; J. Riviere (Trans.) ''Collected Papers'' (Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;287–359). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1914.)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, to this day most major schools of psychotherapeutic thought continue to at least recognize, if not "take as the starting-point", the two phenomena of transference and resistance.&lt;ref name="leahy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beutler, L. E., Moleiro, C. M., &amp; Talebi, H. (2002). "Resistance". In J. C. Norcross (Ed.), ''Psychotherapy relationships that work: Therapist contributions and responsiveness to patient needs'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;129–144). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. M. &amp; Stewart, S. (1983). ''Mastering resistance: A practical guide to family therapy''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachtel, P. L. (1982). ''Resistance: Psychodynamic and behavioral approaches''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless his new conceptualisation of the role of anxiety caused him to reframe the phenomena of resistance, to embrace how "The analyst has to combat no less than five kinds of resistance, emanating from three directions – the [[id, ego and super-ego|ego, the id and the superego]]".&lt;ref name="Freud, Psychopathology p. 319"&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the ego to be the source of three types of resistance: repression, transference and gain from illness, i.e., secondary gain.&lt;ref name="Freud, Psychopathology p. 319"/&gt; Freud defined a fourth variety, arising from the ''id'', as resistance that requires "working-through"&lt;ref name="Freud, Psychopathology p. 320"/&gt; the product of the [[repetition compulsion]]. A fifth, coming from the ''superego'' and the last to be discovered, "...seems to originate from the sense of guilt or the need for punishment"&lt;ref name="Freud, Psychopathology p. 320"/&gt; – i.e., self-sabotage.

All these serve the explicit purpose of defending the ego against feelings of discomfort, for, as Freud wrote: "It is hard for the ego to direct its attention to perceptions and ideas which it has up till now made a rule of avoiding, or to acknowledge as belonging to itself impulses that are the complete opposite of those which it knows as its own."&lt;ref name="inhibitions"/&gt;

=== Freud's treatment of resistance ===
Freud viewed all five categories of resistance as requiring more than just intellectual insight or understanding to overcome.  Instead he favored a slow process of working through.

'''''Working through''''' allows patients "...to get to know this resistance" and "...discover the repressed instinctual trends which are feeding the resistance" and it is this experientially convincing process that "distinguishes analytic treatment from every kind of suggestive treatment".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "Further recommendations in the technique of psychoanalysis: Recollection, repetition, and working through". In E. Jones (Ed.) &amp; J. Riviere (Trans.) ''Collected Papers'' (Vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;366–376). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1914.)&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Freud insisted that therapists remain neutral, saying only as much as "is absolutely necessary to keep him [the patient] talking", so that resistance could be seen as clearly as possible in patients' transference, and become obvious to the patients themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "Further recommendations in the technique of psychoanalysis". In E. Jones (Ed.) &amp; J. Riviere (Trans.) ''Collected Papers'' (Vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;342–365). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1913.)&lt;/ref&gt; The inextricable link suggested by Freud between transference and resistance&lt;ref name="fenichel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1959). "The dynamics of the transference". In E. Jones (Ed.) &amp; J. Riviere (Trans.) ''Collected Papers'' (Vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;312–322). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1912.)&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps encapsulates his legacy to psychotherapy.

== Contemporary understandings of resistance in psychotherapy ==

===Interpersonal resistance===
Resistance is based on our instinctively autonomous ways of reacting in which clients both reveal and keep hidden aspects of themselves from the therapist or another person. These behaviors occur mostly during therapy, in interaction with the therapist. It is a way of avoiding and yet expressing unacceptable drives, feelings, [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]], and behavior patterns.

Examples of causes of resistance include: resistance to the recognition of feelings, fantasies, and motives; resistance to revealing feelings toward the therapist; resistance as a way of demonstrating [[self-sufficiency]]; resistance as clients' reluctance to change their behavior outside the therapy room; resistance as a consequence of failure of [[empathy]] on the part of the therapist.&lt;ref name="msb2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jclp.1139 | last1 = Messer | first1 = S.B. | year = 2002 | title = A Psychodynamic Perspective on Resistance in Psychotherapy: Vive la Résistance | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 157–163 | pmid = 11793328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the expression of resistance are canceling or rescheduling appointments, avoiding consideration of identified themes, forgetting to complete [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework assignments]] and the like. This will make it more difficult for the therapist to work with the client, but it will also provide him with information about the client.

===State and trait resistance (situational and characteristic)===
Resistance is an automatic and unconscious process. According to Van Denburg and Kiesler,&lt;ref name="vdtfkdj2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jclp.1143 | last1 = Van Denburg | first1 = T.F. | last2 = Kiesler | first2 = D.J. | year = 2002 | title = An Interpersonal Communication Perspective on Resistance in Psychotherapy | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 195–205 | pmid = 11793332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be either for a certain period of time (state resistance) but it can also be a manifestation of more longstanding traits or character (trait resistance).

In [[psychotherapy]], state resistance can occur at a certain moment, when an anxiety provoking experience is triggered. Trait resistance, on the other hand, occurs repeatedly during sessions and interferes with the task of therapy. The client shows a pattern of off-task behaviors that makes the therapist experience some level of negative emotion and cognition against the client. Therefore the maladaptive pattern of interpersonal behavior and the therapist's response interfere with the task or process of therapy. This ‘state resistance' is cumulative during sessions and its development can best be prevented by empathic interventions on the therapist's part.&lt;ref name="vdtfkdj2002" /&gt;

Outside therapy, trait resistance in a client is demonstrated by distinctive patterns of [[interpersonal]] behavior which are often caused by typical patterns of communication with significant others, like family, friends and partners.

===Handling resistance in psychotherapy===
Nowadays many therapists work with resistance as a way to understand the client better. They emphasize the importance to work with the resistance and not against it.&lt;ref name="msb2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vdtfkdj2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bmt2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jclp.1144 | last1 = Beutler | first1 = L.E. | last2 = Moleiro | first2 = C. | last3 = Talebi | first3 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Resistance in psychotherapy: What conclusions are supported by research | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 207–217 | pmid = 11793333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because working against the resistance of a client can result in a counterproductive relationship with the therapist; the more attention is drawn to the resistance, the less productive the therapy. Working with the resistance provides a positive working relationship and gives the therapist information about the unconscious of the client.&lt;ref name="bmt2002" /&gt;

A therapist can use [[countertransference]] as a tool to understand the client's resistance. The feelings the client evokes in the therapist with his/her resistance will give you a hint what the resistance is about.&lt;ref name="msb2002" /&gt; For example, a very directive client can make the therapist feel very passive. When the therapist pays attention to their passive feelings, it can make him/her understand this behavior of the client as resistance coming from fear of losing control.

It can also be useful to identify resistance with the client.  This can not only work towards addressing the issue, but can also allow the client to think about and discuss their resistance and the cognitive processes that underlie it. In this way, the client takes an active involvement in their therapy, which may reduce resistance in future.  It also helps the client's ability to identify their resistance in the future and respond to it.

Important to the question of treatment planning are research studies that have looked at resistance traits as indicators and contra-indicators for different types of interventions. Beutler, Moleiro and Talebi reviewed 20 studies that inspected the differential effects of therapist directiveness as moderated by client resistance and found that 80% (n=16) of the studies demonstrated that directive interventions were most productive among clients who had relatively low levels of state or trait-like resistance, while nondirective interventions worked best among clients who had relatively high levels of resistance. These findings provide strong support for the value of resistance level as a predictor of treatment outcome, as well as treatment-planning.&lt;ref name="bmt2002" /&gt; In these studies [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] has been used as a prototype for directive therapy and [[psychodynamic]], self-directed, or other relation oriented therapy have been used as a prototype for non-directive therapy.

== Behavioral models of resistance ==

[[Applied behavior analysis|Behavior analytic]] and [[observational learning|social learning]] models of resistance focus on the setting events, antecedents, and consequences for resistant behavior with the goal to understand the function of the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J. D., &amp; Santilli-Connor, L. (2000) "Assisting the Client/Consultee to Do What is Needed: A Functional Analysis of Resistance and other Forms of Avoidance". [http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/BAT-Journals-2009.html ''The Behavior Analyst Today''], 1(3), pp. 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt; At least five behavioral models of resistance exist.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D., Riley-Tillman, T.C., Axelrod, S., &amp; Hineline, P.N. (2005). "Current Behavioral Models of Client and Consultee Resistance: A Critical Review". ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy, 1 (2),'' 147 –154.&lt;/ref&gt; These models share many common features.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D., Riley-Tillman, T.C., Axelrod, S., &amp; Hineline, P.N. (2005). "Current Behavioral Models of Client and Consultee Resistance: A Critical Review". [http://www.baojournal.com/IJBCT/IJBCT-index.html ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200153/http://www.baojournal.com/IJBCT/IJBCT-index.html |date=2013-09-27 }}, 1 (2), pp. 147–154.&lt;/ref&gt; The most explored research model, with more than 10 years of support, is the model created by Gerald Patterson for resistance in parent training.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. &amp; Chamberlain, P. (1994). "A functional analysis of resistance during parent training". ''Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 1''(1), pp. 53-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. &amp; Forgatch, M.S. (1985). "Therapist behavior as a determinant for client noncompliance: A paradox for the behavior modifier". ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 53(6),'' pp. 846-851.&lt;/ref&gt; With supporting research, this model has even been extended to consultation.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cautilli, T. Chris Tillman, Saul Axelrod and Phil Hineline (2006). "Brief Report: An Experimental Analogue of Consultee “Resistance” Effects on the Consultant’s Therapeutic Behavior". [http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/BAT-Journals-2009.html ''The Behavior Analyst Today''], 7 (3), pp. 351-365.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cautilli, T. Chris Tillman, Saul Axelrod, Halina Dziewolska, Philip Hineline (2006). "Resistance Is Not Futile: An experimental analogue of the effects of consultee “resistance” on the consultant’s therapeutic behavior in the consultation process: A replication and extension". [http://www.baojournal.com/IJBCT/IJBCT-index.html ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200153/http://www.baojournal.com/IJBCT/IJBCT-index.html |date=2013-09-27 }}, 2 (3), pp. 362-374.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Patterson's suggested intervention of struggle with and work through is often contrasted as an intervention with [[motivational interviewing]]. In motivational interviewing the therapist makes no attempt to prompt the client back to the problem area but reinforces the occurrence when it comes up as opposed to struggle with and working through where the therapist directly guides the client back to the problem. Behavior analytic models can accommodate both interventions as pointed out by Cautilli and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J. D., &amp; Santilli-Connor, L. (2000). "Assisting the Client/Consultee to Do What is Needed: A Functional Analysis of Resistance and other Forms of Avoidance". [http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/BAT-Journals-2009.html ''The Behavior Analyst Today''], 1 (3), pp. 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on function and what needs to be accomplished in the treatment.

'''Qedrîcan''' or '''Qedrîcan, Abdulkadir Can''' (1911–1972) was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] poet, writer and translator. He was born in [[Derik]], a small village (present-day [[Mardin Province]], south-eastern [[Turkey]]).  At a time when schooling was the subject of jokes and when few people studied Qedrîcan's father, known as "Cano" (hence the last name) sent him to school.  He was a very successful student, especially in the areas of science and mathematics. Seeing that his son was a successful student Cano decided to send his son to [[Konya]] to study at the teachers' college there.  During his days as a student there Qedrî Can was blacklisted for cultivating "political strife"; he was made a target for writing poetry in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and was forced to escape Turkey.  At a time after the defeat of the [[Sheikh Said Rebellion]], he escaped to [[Syria]] and lived in [[Damascus]] until his death in 1972.

Qedrîcan is remembered for openly teaching the Kurdish Language to students in Northeastern Syria.  Among his circle of friends are the well known names of renowned Kurdish intellectuals: [[Celadet Bedir Khan]], [[Kamuran Bedir Khan]], Dr. [[Nurettin Zaza]], Dr. [[Nuri Dersimi]], [[Ekrem Cemilpaşa]], [[Kadri Cemilpaşa]], Dr. [[Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou]], and more.

==Works==
Qedrîcan was one of the first Kurdish poets to write poetry in the modern [[Free verse]] style. His poetry is similar to that of [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]] and [[Nazim Hikmet]] and he promoted [[socialism]] through his poetry. In addition to poetry, he also wrote short stories and biographies. Most of his works were published in the Kurdish journals ''Hawar'', ''Ronahî'' and ''Roja Nû''.

The '''seven dirty words''' are seven [[English language|English-language]] words that American comedian [[George Carlin]] first listed in 1972 in his [[monologue]] "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".&lt;ref name=umkc&gt;{{cite web|first=George|last=Carlin|editor=Linder, Doug|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html|title=Filthy Words by George Carlin|publisher=[[University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law]]|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2017-03-11|website=Exploring Constitutional Conflicts|quote=The following is a verbatim transcript of "Filthy Words" (the George Carlin monologue at issue in the Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation) prepared by the Federal Communications Commission...|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123114427/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html|archivedate=2011-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words are: [[shit]], [[wikt:piss|piss]], [[fuck]], [[cunt]], [[wikt:cocksucker|cocksucker]], [[motherfucker]], and [[wikt:tits|tits]].&lt;ref&gt;James Sullivan: [https://books.google.com/books?id=IWYmZd1T3HkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=seven+dirty+words&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=22lBVYvhJIffOOXAgdAE&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=seven%20dirty%20words%20piss&amp;f=false ''Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin'']. {{ISBN|9780786745920}}. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=umkc/&gt;

At the time, the words were considered highly inappropriate and unsuitable for broadcast on the public airwaves in the [[United States]], whether radio or television. As such, they were avoided in scripted material, and [[bleep censor]]ed in the rare cases in which they were used. Broadcast standards differ in different parts of the world, then and now, although most of the words on Carlin's original list remain [[taboo]] on American [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]]. The list was not an official enumeration of forbidden words, but compiled by Carlin to flow in a comedy routine. Nonetheless, a radio broadcast featuring these words led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[FCC v. Pacifica Foundation]]'' that helped define the extent to which the federal government could regulate speech on broadcast television and radio in the United States.

==Background==
During one of [[Lenny Bruce]]'s performances in 1966, he said he was arrested for saying nine words, and says them in alphabetical order: ''ass'', ''balls'', ''cocksucker'', ''cunt'', ''fuck'', ''motherfucker'', ''piss'', ''shit'', ''tits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070302/ |title=The Lenny Bruce Performance Film |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last seven words are the same as George Carlin's.

In 1972, [[George Carlin]] released an album of [[stand-up comedy]] entitled ''[[Class Clown]]''. One track on the album was "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television," a monologue in which he identified these words, expressing amazement that these particular words could not be used, regardless of context.

{{Quote|text=I don't know that there was a 'Eureka!' moment or anything like that. [...] On these other things, we get into the field of hypocrisy. Where you really cannot pin down what these rules they want to enforce are. It's just impossible to say 'this is a blanket rule:'. You'll see some newspapers print 'f ''blank blank'' k'. Some print 'f ''asterisk asterisk'' k'. Some blank-- Some put 'f ''blank blank blank'''. Some put the word 'bleep'. Some put, um... 'expletive deleted'. So there's no... there's no real consistent standard. It's not a science. It's a notion that they have and it's superstitious. These words have no power. We give them this power by refusing to be free and easy with them. We give them great power over us. They really, in themselves, have no power. It's the thrust of the sentence that makes them either good or bad. |author=George Carlin |source=''Comedian and Actor George Carlin'', [[NPR]] (2004)&lt;ref Name="NPR-2004"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Carlin |first=George |author-link=George Carlin |interviewer=[[Terry Gross]] |title=Comedian and Actor George Carlin |work=[[National Public Radio]] |date=November 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was arrested for [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] when he performed the routine at a show at [[Summerfest]] in [[Milwaukee]] in 1972.

On his next album, 1973's ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'', Carlin performed a similar routine titled "Filthy Words," dealing with the same list and many of the same themes. [[Pacifica Radio|Pacifica]] station [[WBAI]] broadcast this version of the routine uncensored on October 30 that year.

==''Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation''==
{{main|FCC v. Pacifica Foundation}}
John Douglas, an active member of [[Morality in Media]], claimed that he heard the WBAI broadcast while driving with his then 15-year-old son and complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) that the material was inappropriate for the time of day (approximately 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs12.com/news/douglas_4708282___article.html/one_radio.html |title=Boca Man Forever Linked To George Carlin |publisher=[[WPEC]] |date=June 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628153847/http://www.cbs12.com/news/douglas_4708282___article.html/one_radio.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Samaha |first=Adam |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/314-as-story.pdf |title=The Story of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation (and Its Second Life) |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419133818/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/314-as-story.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the lodging of the complaint, the FCC proceeded to ask Pacifica for a response, then issued a declaratory order upholding the complaint. No specific sanctions were included in the order, but WBAI was put on notice that "in the event subsequent complaints are received, the Commission will then decide whether it should utilize any of the available sanctions it has been granted by Congress." WBAI appealed against this decision, which was overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in a 2–1 decision on the grounds that the FCC's definition of "indecency" was overbroad and vague and thus violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The FCC in turn appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. As an independent federal agency, the FCC filed the appeal in its own name. The [[United States Department of Justice]] intervened in the case, supporting Pacifica's argument that the FCC's [[declaratory ruling]] violated the First Amendment and that it also violated the Fifth Amendment in that the FCC's definition of "indecency" was too vague to support criminal penalties.

In 1978 the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled that the FCC's declaratory ruling did not violate either the First or Fifth Amendments, but in so ruling it limited the scope of its ruling to the specific broadcast that gave rise to the declaratory ruling and declined to consider whether the FCC's definition of indecency would survive a First Amendment challenge if applied to the broadcast of other material containing the same or similar words which had been cited in Pacifica's brief (e.g., works of Shakespeare&amp;nbsp;– "pissing conduits," "bawdy hand of the dial on the prick of noon"; the Bible&amp;nbsp;– "he who pisseth against the wall"; the Watergate Tapes). It noted that while the declaratory ruling pertained to the meaning of the term indecency as used in a criminal statute (18 USC 1464), since the FCC had not imposed any penalty on Pacifica for the broadcast of words that came within the FCC's definition of "indecent", it did not need to reach the question as to whether the definition was too vague to satisfy the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/faclibrary/case.aspx?case=Federal_Communications_Commission_v_Pacifica |title=First Amendment Library entry on the case |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040517031200/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/faclibrary/case.aspx?case=Federal_Communications_Commission_v_Pacifica |archivedate=2004-05-17 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision formally established indecency regulation in American broadcasting. In follow-up rulings, the Supreme Court established the [[Watershed (broadcasting)|safe harbor]] provision that grants broadcasters the right to broadcast [[decency|indecent]] (but not [[Obscenity|obscene]]) material between the hours of 10 pm and 6 am, when it is presumed few children would be watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erenkrantz.com/Humor/SevenDirtyWords.shtml |title=Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say on TV – script |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsbuckit.blogspot.com/2007/02/seven-words-you-can-never-say-on.html |title=Seven words you can never say on television"... but which are said on the Internet.

The seven dirty words have been assumed to be likely to elicit indecency-related action by the FCC if uttered on a TV or radio broadcast, and thus the broadcast networks generally censor themselves with regard to many of the seven dirty words. The FCC regulations regarding [[Fleeting expletive|"fleeting" use of expletives]] were ruled unconstitutionally vague by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on July 13, 2010, as they violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] due to their possible effects regarding free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puzzanghera |first=Jim |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/49922038-68/court-fcc-indecency-expletives.html.csp |title="FCC indecency rule struck down by appeals court", Los Angeles Times, July 13, 2010 |publisher=Sltrib.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-fcc-indecency-20100714,0,5995911.story |title=FCC indecency rule struck down by appeals court – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-08-01 |first1=Jim |last1=Puzzanghera |first2=Meg |last2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/media/14indecent.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=court%2520ruling%2520on%2520language&amp;st=cse |date=July 13, 2010 |author=Edward Wyatt |title=F.C.C.

==The words==
&lt;!-- NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN OBJECTIVE LIST OF DIRTY WORDS, IT IS AN ARTICLE ABOUT A ROUTINE BY THE COMEDIAN GEORGE CARLIN. PLEASE DO NOT ADD WORDS TO THE LIST BECAUSE YOU FEEL THEY BELONG, THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS LIST OR THIS ARTICLE. --&gt;
The original seven words are:
* ''[[shit]]''
* ''[[Urine|piss]]''
* ''[[fuck]]''
* ''[[cunt]]''
* ''[[Fellatio|cocksucker]]''
* ''[[motherfucker]]''
* ''[[Breast|tits]]''
&lt;!-- NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN OBJECTIVE LIST OF DIRTY WORDS, IT IS AN HISTORICAL ARTICLE ABOUT A ROUTINE BY THE COMEDIAN GEORGE CARLIN THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTED POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES. PLEASE DO NOT ADD WORDS TO THE LIST BECAUSE YOU FEEL THEY BELONG, THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS LIST OR THIS ARTICLE. The ORIGINAL seven words are 1. shit 2. piss 3. fuck 4. cunt 5. cocksucker 6. motherfucker 7. tits. This is the ORIGINAL seven in the ORIGINAL order. They are referenced in the rest of the article in this order. --&gt;

In subsequent routines, Carlin would frequently deconstruct the list, proposing additions or deletions based on audience feedback, or sometimes on his own whims. For example, a man asked him to remove ''motherfucker'' because, as a derivative of ''fuck'', it constituted a duplication:

"He says ''motherfucker'' is a duplication of the word ''fuck'', technically, because ''fuck'' is the root form, ''motherfucker'' being derivative; therefore, it constitutes duplication. And I said, 'Hey, ''motherfucker'', how did you get my phone number, anyway?'"&lt;ref name="Again"&gt;{{cite video
 | people = Carlin, George
 | title = On Location: George Carlin at Phoenix
 | medium = DVD
 | publisher = HBO Home Video
 | location =
 | date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later added it back, claiming the bit's rhythm does not work without it.&lt;ref name="Again"/&gt; In his comedy routine, Carlin would make fun of each word; for example, he would say that ''tits'' should not be on the list because it sounds like a nickname of a snack ("New [[Nabisco]] Tits! ...corn tits, [[Cheese Nips|cheese]] tits, [[Tater tots|tater]] tits!").

==Availability==
Carlin performed the routine many times and included it, in whole or in part on several of his records and HBO specials. Parts or all of the performance appear on the following releases:
* 1972 – ''[[Class Clown]]'' – Audio recording – "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television"
* 1973 – ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'' – Audio recording – "Filthy Words"
* 1977 – ''[[George Carlin at USC]]'' – HBO special – "Forbidden Words"
* 1978 – ''[[George Carlin: Again!]]'' – HBO special – "Dirty Words"
* 1983 – ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' – HBO special – "Filthy Words"

The ''Carlin at Carnegie'' version can be heard as "An Incomplete List of Impolite Words" on the 1984 album ''[[Carlin on Campus]]'' (but not in the HBO special, ''Carlin on Campus''). That version of the list features over 300 dirty words and phrases in an effort to stop people telling him that he left something off the list. Four days after Carlin's original ''Class Clown'' recording, the routine was performed again for students at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. This would be months before its first official release. The recording was restored in December, 2013 and uploaded to YouTube by archivists at UCLA and could be accessed free of charge, but is no longer available due to a claim of copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | hcjJToF6U3o | George Carlin at UCLA 5/31/1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC ruling is referenced in "Offensive Language" from the album ''[[Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics]]'' and HBO special ''[[Doin' It Again]]'', both 1990 recordings of the same performance; however, the routine that follows is entirely different.

The ''Class Clown'' version can also be heard on the vinyl/cassette only release ''[[Indecent Exposure (album)|Indecent Exposure]]'' (1978). The ''Occupation: Foole'' version can also be heard on ''[[Classic Gold (George Carlin album)|Classic Gold]]'' (1992). Both versions were re-released again as part of ''[[The Little David Years (1971–1977)]]''.

==H.R. 3687==
Singer [[Bono#U2|Bono]] said on live television that his [[60th Golden Globe Awards#Best Original Song|2003 Golden Globe award]] was "really, really fucking brilliant!" Despite complaints, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) did not fine the network. In apparent reaction,&lt;ref name="bono"/&gt; on December 8, 2003, Rep. [[Doug Ose]] (R-California) introduced House Resolution 3687, the "Clean Airwaves Act",&lt;ref name=bono&gt;{{cite web |title = Congressmen introduces bill to curb profanity in broadcasting |url = http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/congressmen-introduces-bill-curb-profanity-broadcasting |date = 8 January 2004 |publisher = [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Congress to designate a derivative list of Carlin's offensive words as profane in the U.S. Code. The stated purpose of the bill was "To amend [[s:United States Code/Title 18/Part I/Chapter 71/Section 1464|section 1464 of title 18 of the United States Code]], to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcasts." In the text of the bill, the words 'shit', 'piss', 'fuck', 'cunt', 'asshole', and the phrases 'cock sucker', 'mother fucker', and 'ass hole' are specifically listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/3687/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr3687%22%5D%7D&amp;r=7|title=Text – H.R.3687|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was not enacted.

==Subscription services==
The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] obscenity guidelines have never been applied to non-broadcast media such as [[cable television]] or [[satellite radio]]. It is widely held that the FCC's authorizing legislation (particularly the [[Communications Act of 1934]] and the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]) does not enable the FCC to regulate content on [[subscription]]-based services, which include [[cable television]], [[satellite television]], and [[pay-per-view]] television. Whether the FCC or the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] could be empowered by the [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] to restrict indecent content on cable television without such legislation violating the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] has never been settled by a court of law. Since cable television must be subscribed to in order to receive it legally, it has long been thought that since subscribers who object to the content being delivered may cancel their subscription, an incentive is created for the cable operators to self-regulate (unlike broadcast television, cable television is not legally considered to be "[[pervasiveness doctrine|pervasive]]", nor does it depend on a scarce, government-allocated [[electromagnetic spectrum]]; as such, neither of the arguments buttressing the case for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] regulation particularly apply to cable television).

[[Industry self-regulation|Self-regulation]] by many [[basic cable]] networks is undertaken by [[Standards and Practices]] (S&amp;P) departments that [[self-censorship|self-censor]] their [[broadcast programming|programming]] because of the pressure put on them by [[advertiser]]s&amp;nbsp;– also meaning that any basic cable network willing to ignore such pressure could use any of the Seven Dirty Words. All of the words on Carlin's list have come into common usage in many made-for-cable series and film productions.

[[File:Surf &amp; Turf.jpg|thumb|The expression "[[surf and turf]]" is a Siamese twin. The order of the two keywords of this familiar expression cannot be reversed [[idiom (language structure)|idiomatically]].]]
'''Siamese twins''' (also '''irreversible binomials''',&lt;ref name="modern2"/&gt; '''binomials''',&lt;ref name="modern2"/&gt; '''binomial pairs''', '''nonreversible word pairs''',&lt;ref name="pairs"/&gt; or '''freezes''') in the context of the [[English language]] refer to a pair or group of words used together as an [[idiom]]atic expression or [[collocation]], usually conjoined by the words ''and'' or ''or''. The order of elements cannot be reversed.&lt;ref name="modern2"/&gt; The expressions ''milk and honey'' (two nouns), ''short and sweet'' (two adjectives), and ''do or die'' (two verbs) are various examples of Siamese twins.

Many Siamese twins are "catchy" (and thus [[cliché]]s and [[catchphrase]]s) due to [[alliteration]], [[rhyming]], or their ubiquity in society and culture. Word combinations like ''rock and roll'', ''the birds and the bees'', ''mix and match'', and ''wear and tear'' have become so widely used that their meanings surpass the meaning of the constituent words and are thus inseparable and permanent parts of the [[English lexicon]]; the former two are idioms, whilst the latter two are collocations. Ubiquitous collocations like ''loud and clear'' and ''life or death'' are [[fixed expression]]s, making them a standard part of the [[vocabulary]] of native English speakers.

Some English words are known to have become [[Archaism|obsolete]] in general but are still found exclusively in an irreversible binomial. In the passage of time since ''spick and span'' was coined, the origin and meaning of the word ''spick'' has been utterly forgotten; it has become a [[fossil word]] that never &lt;!-- NOTE to editors: this word is unrelated to the modern epithet "spic" from "no spiggoty English," so do not change this sentence to mention "spic" as a racial slur. --&gt; appears outside the familiar phrase.&lt;ref name="phrases"/&gt; In other cases an English word, like ''vim'' in ''vim and vigor'' or ''abet'' in ''aid and abet'', will be found more often in such phrases than on its own; such a word may be [[Archaism|archaic]] apart from the collocation.

Certain Siamese twins are known for their use in [[legalese]]. Due to the use of [[precedent]] in [[common law]], many lawyers use the same collocations found in documents centuries old, many of which are [[legal doublet]]s. So rather than a person "enunciating" a "narrative" or recollecting about a situation, a legal brief will instead declare that a person ''deposes and says'' something pertinent. Likewise, a person who bequeaths property habitually writes of their ''heirs and successors'' and not some alternative construct.

While many Siamese twins are literal expressions (like ''washer and dryer, rest and relaxation, rich and famous, savings and loan''), some are entirely figurative (like ''come hell or high water, nip and tuck, surf and turf'') or mostly figurative (like ''between a rock and a hard place, five and dime''). Others are somewhat in between these extremes because they are more subtle [[figures of speech]], [[synecdoche]]s, [[metaphor]]s, or [[hyperbole]]s (like ''cat and mouse, sick and tired, barefoot and pregnant, rags to riches'').

A few Siamese twins have variations, based on the usage of the phrase. One time-worn expression is ''time and time again'': it is frequently shortened to ''time and again''. A person who is covered in ''tar and feathers'' (noun) usually gets that way by the action of a mob that ''tars and feathers'' (verb) undesirable people.

Similarly, some Siamese twins mean something different depending on the conjunction between the words. For example, a ''give and take'' refers to two-way or mutual flexibility, whereas ''give or take'' means a numerical approximation. Another example: a person can do something whether it is ''right or wrong'' in contrast to knowing the difference between ''right and wrong''; each word pair has a subtly differing meaning. And while a ''five and dime'' may seem to be identical to a ''nickel and dime'', their usage in common speech, and even their [[part of speech]], is dramatically different.

== Origin ==
The term ''Siamese twins'' originates with [[Chang and Eng Bunker]], the [[conjoined twins]] from [[Siam]]. In the context of the English language, this word was first used and popularised by [[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W. Fowler]], a renowned [[lexicographer]].

== Conjunction ==

The most common conjunctions used in a phrase that constitutes Siamese twins are ''and'' or ''or.''

== Legal terminology ==
Known as [[legal doublet]]s, there are many collocations and [[merism]]s which are repetitively used in a legal or official context. Many of these can be found in legal documents dating back centuries; their habitual use has been decried by some legal scholars as superfluous in modern legal briefs.&lt;ref name="Espenschied"/&gt; There are also legal triplets, which are listed below in their own section.

== Variants ==
Siamese twins occurring as a pair (that is, having two words occurring together) are also known as [[Binomial pair|binomials]]. If the variant has three words occurring together, it is also known as a trinomial. Another name for this collocation is [[Isocolon|tricolon]] when the three parts are of the same or consistent grammatical form. Many of these could be considered triplets and satisfy the [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]] in writing.

[[File:Holding a cruzer 8gb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[USB flash drive]] allows the transfer of data between individuals without use of the Internet.]]
[[File:Memory-card-comparison.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Memory card]]s are a popular physical medium for transferring files and have become smaller in size as technology has advanced]]
'''Sneakernet''' is an informal term for the transfer of electronic information by physically moving media such as [[magnetic tape]], [[floppy disk]]s, [[compact disc]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s or external [[hard drive]]s from one [[computer]] to another; rather than transmitting the information over a [[computer network]].  

The term, a [[tongue-in-cheek]] play on ''net(work)'' as in ''[[Internet]]'' or ''[[Ethernet]]'', refers to walking in [[sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]] as the transport mechanism for the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sneakernet |title=Oxford Dictionary| accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary and background==

Sneakernets, also known as trainnets or pigeonets, are in use throughout the computer world. Sneakernet may be used when computer networks are prohibitively expensive for the owner to maintain, in high-security environments where manual inspection (for re-classification of information) is necessary, where information needs to be shared between networks with different levels of security clearance, when data transfer is impractical due to [[List of device bandwidths|bandwidth limitations]], when a particular system is simply incompatible with the local network, unable to be connected, or when two systems are not on the same network at the same time. Because Sneakernets take advantage of physical media, security measures used for the transfer of sensitive information are respectively physical.

This form of data transfer is also used for [[peer-to-peer]] (or [[friend-to-friend]]) file sharing and has grown in popularity in [[metropolitan area]]s and [[college]] communities. The ease of this system has been facilitated by the availability of [[USB]] external hard drives, [[USB flash drive]]s and portable music players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/08/54739 |title=Sneakernet Redux: Walk Your Data |last=Boutin |first=Paul |date=2002-08-26 |work=[[Wired News]] |accessdate=8 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119134710/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/08/54739 |archivedate=November 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Postal Service]] offers a [[United States Postal Service#General domestic services|Media Mail]] service for [[compact disc]]s, among other items. This provides a viable mode of transport for long distance Sneakernet use. In fact, when mailing media with sufficiently high data density such as high capacity hard drives, the throughput (data transferred per unit of time) as well as the cost per unit of data transferred may compete favorably with networked methods of data transfer. &lt;ref&gt;https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
From an [[information theory]] standpoint, sneakernets can achieve tremendous throughput, but they suffer from high latency (''see [[Network performance]]''). The [[throughput]] of the network is directly proportional to the size of the transmitted file(s). [[Latency (engineering)|Latency]] is based on the amount of time it takes to fully process the request for information. Latency would include the time it takes to write the storage media and the time to travel from point A to point B.

For example: Alice requests Bob to send her a [[DVD]] (4.7&amp;nbsp;GB) worth of information. Over the Internet, the latency for the file request may be milliseconds—Alice starts receiving the information nearly immediately—but at a modest [[broadband]] download speed of 50&amp;nbsp;kB/s it may take up to a day to complete the transfer. On the other hand, Bob could burn a DVD and deliver it to Alice in an hour. The latency was an hour, but the throughput of the transfer is roughly equal to a transfer rate of 1305&amp;nbsp;kB/s.

If an [[Airbus A380]] were filled with [[microSD]] cards each holding 512 gigabytes of storage capacity, the theoretical total storage space onboard would be approximately 91&amp;nbsp;[[exabyte]]s. A 4h47m flight from New York to Los Angeles would work out to a data transport rate of well over 5 [[petabytes]] per second, although this does not account for the time required to write to and read from the cards, which would almost certainly be much longer than the duration of the flight.

Similarly, {{As of|2016|lc=on}} the highest capacity backup tape format available is [[Linear Tape-Open#LTO-7|LTO-7]], with a capacity of 6&amp;nbsp;TB. If a tape of this capacity were sent by overnight mail and were to arrive around 20 hours after it was sent, the effective data rate would be 664&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. With networking technology, this magnitude of speed over this distance would be very difficult to attain without a costly dedicated connection as one would likely need to use several [[Hop (networking)|hops]] and have a connection that is not [[Resource contention|oversubscribed]].

Sneakernets may also be used in tandem with computer network data transfer to increase data security. For example, a file or collection of files may be encrypted and sent over the [[Internet]] while the encryption key is printed and hand delivered or mailed. This method greatly reduces the possibility of an individual intercepting both the key and encrypted data.

Another way sneakernets are used together with network transfers is to provide an initial full backup as a base for incremental backups.  In the case of a large (several [[terabyte]]) dataset that grows by just a few megabytes a day, the initial seeding of the data to be backed up would require an excessively long time upload over a network. One solution is to make a local copy of the data which is then physically relocated to the remote location and topped up with daily incremental backups over a network.

==Usage examples==
When [[Australia]] joined [[Usenet]] in 1983, it received articles via tapes sent from the United States to the [[University of Sydney]], which disseminated data to dozens of other computers on the country's Unix network.&lt;ref name="marquis19830329"&gt;{{cite newsgroup | url=http://article.olduse.net/467@sdchema.UUCP | title=Australia joins USENET | date=1983-03-29 | accessdate=14 February 2016 | last=Marquis | first=Bret | newsgroup=net.news.newsite | id=467@sdchema.UUCP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Death of Osama bin Laden|May 2011 raid]] of [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad]], [[Pakistan]] revealed that he used a series of USB thumb drives to store his email drafts.  A courier of his would then take the saved emails to a nearby Internet cafe and send them out to the desired recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Apuzzo, Matt &amp; Goldman, Adam |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/13/how-bin-laden-emailed-without-being-detected-us/ |title=How bin Laden emailed without being detected by US |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[The Washington Times]] |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Declan |last=McCullagh |authorlink=Declan McCullagh |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20062755-281.html |title=How bin Laden evaded the NSA: Sneakernet |work=Privacy Inc |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Durban company Unlimited IT reportedly pitted a [[Homing pigeon|messenger pigeon]] against South African ISP [[Telkom SA|Telkom]] to transfer 4&amp;nbsp;GB of data {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Howick, KwaZulu-Natal|Howick]] to [[Durban]]. The pigeon, carrying the data on a [[USB flash drive|memory stick]], arrived in one hour eight minutes, with the data taking another hour to read from the memory stick. During the same two-hour period, only about 4.2% of the data had been transferred over the [[ADSL]] link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8248056.stm |title=SA Pigeon 'Faster than broadband' |publisher=BBC News |date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar experiment was conducted in England in September 2010; the "pigeonnet" also proved superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/17/bt_bird/|title=BT feathers ruffled over pigeon-based file transfer caper |work=[[The Register]] |date=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11325452 |title=Pigeon flies past broadband in data speed race |publisher=BBC News Technology |date=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 the Australian comedy/current-affairs television program [[Hungry Beast]] repeated this experiment. The experiment had the team transfer a 700&amp;nbsp;MB file via three delivery methods to determine which was the fastest; A carrier pigeon with a [[microSD]] card, a car carrying a [[USB Stick]], or a [[Telstra]] ADSL line. The data was to be transferred a distance of 132&amp;nbsp;km by road. The pigeon won the race with a time of approximately 1 hour 5 minutes, the car came in second at 2 hours 10 minutes, while the internet transfer did not finish, having dropped out a second time and not coming back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci2bFFGM8T8 | work=ABC Television/Hungry Beast | title=The Great Australian Internet Challenge | date=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google]] has used a sneakernet to transport large datasets, such as the 120 [[terabyte|TB]] of data from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6425975.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Google helps terabyte data swaps |date=March 7, 2007 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FedExNet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/73007|title=Google's Next-Gen of Sneakernet|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=20 March 2007|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of [[Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud]] can import their data into [[Google Cloud Storage]] through sneakernet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offline Media Import / Export|url=https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/offline-media-import-export|publisher=Google|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SETI@home]] project uses a sneakernet to overcome bandwidth limitations: data recorded by the [[Arecibo Observatory|radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico]] is stored on magnetic tapes which are then shipped to [[Berkeley, California]] for processing.  In 2005, [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] reported sending hard drives and even "metal boxes with processors" to transport large amounts of data by postal mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=864078 |title=A Conversation with Jim Gray |quote=Who would ever, in this time of the greatest interconnectivity in human history, go back to shipping bytes around via snail mail as a preferred means of data transfer? |magazine=[[ACM Queue]] |volume=1 |issue=4 |date=July 31, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205080459/http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=864078 |archivedate=December 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wizzy Digital Courier provided Internet access to schools in South Africa with poor or no network connectivity by implementing [[UUCP]] on USB memory sticks. This allowed offline cached email transport and scoops of web pages to back-fill a web cache.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/04/63131?currentPage=all "Seeking Riches From the Poor"], Megan Lindow, 04.23.04, Wired.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analytics teams in the financial services sector often use sneakernets to transfer sensitive corporate information and information obtained from [[data mining]], such as ledger entries, customer data and financial statistics.  There are several reasons for this: firstly, sneakernets can generally provide very high security (and possibly more importantly, they are ''perceived'' to be secure) due to the impossibility of a [[Man-in-the-middle attack]] or [[packet sniffing]]; secondly, the volumes of data concerned are often extremely high; and thirdly, setting up secure network links between the client business and the analytics team's facilities is often either impossible or an extremely convoluted process.

[[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] performed using the [[Very Long Baseline Array]] ships hard drives to a data reduction site in Socorro, New Mexico.  They refer to their data transfer mechanism as "HDOA" (Hard Drives On Airplane).

The Rigsum Sherig Collection project&lt;ref&gt;[http://sherig.rigsum-it.com/ Rigsum Sherig Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; uses a sneakernet to distribute offline educational resources, including [[Kiwix]] and [[Khan Academy]] on a Stick,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mujica.org/khan/ Khan Academy on a Stick]&lt;/ref&gt; to hundreds of schools and other educational institutional in the Kingdom of [[Bhutan]].

'''''Thus have I heard''''' ({{lang-pi|Evaṃ me suttaṃ|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Evaṃ mayā śrūtaṃ|italic=yes}}) is the common translation of the first line of the standard introduction (Pāli and {{lang-sa|nidāna|italic=yes |link=no}}) of Buddhist [[sutra|discourses]]. This phrase serves to confirm that the discourse is coming from the Buddha himself, as a "seal of authenticity".{{sfn |Tola |Dragonetti |1999 |p=54}}{{sfn |Brough |1950 |p=424}} Tradition relates that the disciple [[Ānanda]] used the formula for the first time, as a form of personal testimony. It is disputed how the phrase relates to the words that follow, as several theories have been developed with regard to how the text was originally punctuated. The formula has also been used in later [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] discourses.

Tradition has it, based on the [[atthakatha|commentary]] to the [[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]],{{sfn |Nanayakkara |1990 |p=174}} that the formula was first used by the disciple [[Ānanda]] during the [[First Buddhist Council]] held at Rājagṛha (present-day [[Rajgir]]). This was when the [[Tripitaka|Buddhist Canon]] was established,{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Evaṃ mayā śrutaṃ ekasmin samaye}} as Ānanda was given the role of '[[saṃgītakāra|rapporteur]]'  ({{lang-sa|saṃgītakāra|italic=yes |link=no}}) of the Buddha's teachings, being the personal attendant of the Buddha.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Saṃgītakāra}} The formula is usually followed by the place where the discourse is given, as well as the names and numbers of those it is given to.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=89}} In the Chinese [[exegesis|exegetical]]  tradition, the formula is known as the ''generic preface'' ({{zh |p=tongxu}}), as opposed to the subsequent part that differs between discourses, introducing the specifics, known as the ''specific preface'' ({{zh |p=biexu}}).{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xu}} In some [[Early Buddhist Texts]], other similar constructions are used, such as 'This was said by the Blessed One' ({{lang-pi|Vutaṃ hetaṃ bhagavatā |italic=yes |link=no}}) in the [[Itivuttaka]].{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Itivuttaka}}{{sfn |Anālayo |2007 |p=19}}

== Interpretation and translation ==
The formula is glossed by the 5th-century Indian commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] as "received in the Buddha's presence".{{sfn |Przyluski |1940 |p=247, n.2}} However, Indologist [[Jean Filliozat]] (1906{{en dash}}82) disagreed with the traditional explanation that Ānanda was the one who invented the formula, arguing that the formula is an odd way to describe a first-hand witness account, as it sounds as though what follows is hearsay. He argued instead that it was a later compiler who added it.{{sfn |Nanayakkara |1990 |pp=174{{en dash}}5}} However, comparing Buddhist with [[Jain]] texts, Sanskrit scholar John Brough (1917{{en dash}}84) concluded the formula indicates personal testimony as opposed to hearsay.{{sfn |Brough |1950 |p=424}}{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |p=316}}

Indologist [[Jean Przyluski]] (1885{{en dash}}1944) argued that the formula originally may also have meant that the Buddhist discourses were presented as part of sacred revelation (''[[śruti]]''). This was  intended to prove that the Buddhist texts were on the same level with, or superior than, the [[Vedas]] in the [[Brahmanical]] tradition.{{sfn |Przyluski |1940 |p=247, n.2}} Brough concurred with Przyluski that this may have played some role in the development of the phrase, but concluded that the motivation of declaring oneself a witness of the Buddha's teaching "could by itself quite adequately explain it". Brough relates a traditional account in which the [[disciples of the Buddha|Buddha's disciples]] weep when they hear Ānanda say the words ''Thus have I heard'' for the first time, "marvelling that they should hear again the very words of their dead master".{{sfn |Brough |1950 |p=425}}

Indologist {{ill|Konrad Klaus|de}} disagrees with Brough, however, citing two discourses from the Dīgha Nikāya and [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima Nikāya]] in which the formula refers to what "... was acquired through communication by others", as opposed to personal experience.{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |p=319 |ps=, "... durch Mitteilung durch andere erworbenen wurde."}} Klaus also points at another expression which {{em|does mean}} that a discourse has been directly received from someone, that is ''samukkhā me taṃ ... samukkhā paṭiggahitaṃ'', meaning 'I heard and learned this from ...'s own lips': an expression also used with regard to the Buddha.{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |pp=319{{en dash}}20}} He proposes that the formula ''Thus have I heard'' does mark a discourse as the [[buddhavacana|Buddha's word]], but not because the discourse has been heard from the Buddha's own lips by the speaker.&lt;!--320--&gt; He does admit that the early Sanskrit texts contain a later interpretation of the formula, which does refer to personal experience.&lt;!--320-1--&gt;{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |p=320{{en dash}}1}}

Indologist [[Étienne Lamotte]] (1903{{en dash}}83) argued it was the Buddha who had the formula placed at the beginning of the Buddhist discourses, conveying this through Ānanda.{{sfn |Lamotte |2005 |p=190}} In addition, the formula may have been used by editors to standardize the discourses, as it is even used in discourses given by Ānanda himself.{{sfn |Nanayakkara |1990 |pp=174{{en dash}}5}}

== Punctuation ==
There has been considerable debate how the first sentences of the preface should be translated, especially with regard to punctuation. There are three main opinions.{{sfn |Nattier|2014 |p=39}} The first possible and most common translation is ''Thus have I heard. At one time the [[Gautama Buddha|Blessed One]] was at ... in ...''{{sfn |Nattier|2014 |p=39}}{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Evaṃ mayā śrutaṃ}} Buddhist studies scholar Mark Allon has defended this translation based on metrical and rhyme patterns.{{sfn |Tola |Dragonetti |1999 |p=53}} The words of the Pāli formula indicate the oral tradition through which the discourses were passed down.&lt;!--5--&gt; As with many parts of the discourses, the preface consist of rhymes to help memorization of the text, such as repetition of initial consonant sounds ([[alliteration]]; ''evaṃ'', ''ekaṃ'') and final sounds ([[homoioteleuton]]; ''evaṃ'', ''suttaṃ'', ''ekaṃ'' and ''samayaṃ'').&lt;!--5-6--&gt;{{sfn |Anālayo |2007 |pp=5{{en dash}}6}}{{sfn |Allon |1997 |p=195}} These rhyme patterns show that the two phrases, the first phrase starting with 'thus' (''evaṃ me suttaṃ'') and the second phrase, ''ekaṃ samayaṃ'' (Pāli; {{lang-sa|ekasmin samaye|italic=yes |link=no}}), 'at one time', were seen as two units.{{sfn |Allon |1997 |p=195}} On a similar note, the first phrase has a ''vedha'' type metrical pattern, which is repeated by the second phrase, ''ekaṃ samayaṃ'', 'at one time'.{{sfn |Allon |1997 |pp=195, 246}} Buddhist studies scholars Fernando Tola and Carmen Dragonetti have also argued for this translation with a three-word pre-amble (the three words being ''evaṃ me suttaṃ''), on the grounds that it gives the best meaning to the context.{{sfn |Tola |Dragonetti |1999 |pp=54{{en dash}}5}}

However, numerous scholars read the words 'at one time' ({{lang-pi|ekaṃ samayaṃ|italic=yes |link=no}}; {{lang-sa|ekasmin samaye|italic=yes |link=no}}) as part of the same first sentence, making for a five-word preamble. In their opinion, the first lines should be translated to '''''Thus have i heard at one time'''. The Blessed One was staying at ... in ...''{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Evaṃ mayā śrutaṃ}}{{sfn |Nattier |2014 |p=39}} This translation is often attributed to Brough, but was first proposed by orientalist [[Alexander von Staël-Holstein]] (1877{{en dash}}1937).{{sfn |Nattier |2014 |p=39 n.4}} Von Staël-Holstein preferred this translation, basing himself on Indian commentaries,{{sfn |Chen |Montoneri |2011 |pp=286{{en dash}}7}} and Brough based himself on Tibetan translations, common usage in [[Avadana|Avadānas]] and Early Buddhist Texts, as well as [[atthakatha|Pāli]] and Sanskrit commentators.{{sfn |Brough |1950 |pp=418, 423}}{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |pp=310{{en dash}}1}} Indologist [[Oskar von Hinüber]] rejects Holstein and Broughs interpretation, however. He argues that although in Sanskrit it may be possible to connect the two phrases in one sentence, in Pāli this is highly unusual. Von Hinüber further states that in the early Pāli texts,&lt;!--311-2--&gt; as well as the Pāli commentaries, separating the two phrases is actually quite common.&lt;!--312--&gt;{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |pp=311{{en dash}}2}} Konrad Klaus agrees with Von Hinüber's arguments.{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |pp=311{{en dash}}6}} Buddhist studies scholar Brian Galloway further states that many Tibetan and Indian commentators such as [[Vimalamitra]] (8th century) did not support a five-word but rather a three-word pre-amble, reading ''at one time'' with the text following it.{{sfn |Galloway |1991 |p=101}}{{sfn |Galloway |1997 |p=367}} Religious Studies scholar Mark Tatz disagrees with Galloway's interpretation, however,{{sfn |Tatz |1993 |pp=335{{en dash}}6}} though Galloway rejects most of Tatz' arguments.{{sfn |Galloway |1997 |loc=passim}}

A third group of scholars believe that the details of the place should also be mentioned within the same sentence, with no punctuation: ''Thus have I heard at the one time when the Blessed one was staying at ... in ...'' This type of translation, called the "double-jointed construction", has been proposed by Religious Studies scholar [[Paul Harrison (scholar)|Paul Harrison]] and Buddhologist {{ill|Tilmann Vetter|nl}}.{{sfn |Nattier |2014 |p=39, n.5}}{{sfn |Tola |Dragonetti |1999 |p=53}} Harrison bases himself on Tibetan translations&lt;!--314--&gt; and discussion in Sanskrit commentaries.&lt;!--315--&gt;{{sfn |Klaus |2007 |pp=314{{en dash}}5}}

Prior to the 5th century, Chinese translations of Buddhist texts would often translate the standard formula as ''Heard like this'', leaving out the ''I'' for stylistic reasons.&lt;!--53-4--&gt; During the 5th century, translator [[Kumarajiva|Kumārajīva]] (344{{en dash}}413 CE) started rendering the formula as ''Rushi wowen'' ({{zh|c=如是我聞 |l=Like this I hear}}), which became the standard Chinese translation, despite its unnatural construction.&lt;!--40-1--&gt;{{sfn |Nattier |2014 |pp=40{{en dash}}1, 53{{en dash}}4}}

[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] traditions considered many later discourses the Buddha's word, and also included the formula at the beginning of those.{{sfn |Skilton |2004 |pp=745{{en dash}}6}} Indeed, the 5th-century Chinese commentary [[Dazhidulun]] recommends to do so.{{sfn |Walser |2005 |p=154}}  Often, Mahāyāna commentaries state that the formula can not only refer to Ānanda, but also to certain ''[[bodhisattvas]]'', such as [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]].{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Evaṃ mayā śrutaṃ}} Modern scholarship has drawn into question the historical value of most of these introductions of Mahāyāna discourses, though some scholars do not exclude the possibility that some of the content of the discourses themselves goes back to the Buddha.{{sfn |Williams |2009 |p=39}}

{{Linguistic typology topics}}
In [[linguistic typology]], '''time–manner–place''' is a general order of [[adpositional phrase]]s in a language's sentences: "yesterday", "by car", "to the store". [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]] belong to this category.

An example of this appositional ordering in [[German language|German]] is:

{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" style="margin-left: 1em;"
| ''{{lang|de|Ich}}'' || ''{{lang|de|fahre}}'' || ''{{lang|de|heute}}'' || ''{{lang|de|mit}}'' || ''{{lang|de|dem}}'' || ''{{lang|de|Auto}}'' || ''{{lang|de|nach}}'' || ''{{lang|de|München.}}''
|- style="font-size:80%"
| I || drive || today || with || the || car || to || Munich.
|-
| colspan="7"| ''I'm travelling to Munich by car today.''
|}

The temporal phrase – ''{{lang|de|heute}}'' ("today") – comes first, the manner – ''{{lang|de|mit dem Auto}}'' ("by car") – is second, and the place – ''{{lang|de|nach München}}'' ("to Munich") – is third.

One way to remember the order in German is the [[mnemonic]] acronym '''ZAP''': '''{{lang|de|Zeit}}''' (time), '''{{lang|de|Art}}''' (manner), '''{{lang|de|Platz}}''' (place). Another, in English, is the "acronym" '''T'''e'''MP'''o. It is a subset of the system called ''{{lang|de|TeKaMoLo}}'' in German, from Latin: ''{{lang|de|Temporal}}'', ''{{lang|de|Kausal}}'', ''{{lang|de|Modal}}'', ''{{lang|de|Local}}'', or time-cause-manner-place

English and French use this order only when the time is mentioned before the verb, which is commonly the case when time, manner, and place are all mentioned.

'''Ulithian''' is the name of the language spoken on [[Ulithi Atoll]] and neighboring islands. Ulithian is one of the six official languages of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. There are some 3,000 speakers, although only 700 of these live on Ulithi Atoll.

In 2010, a Ulithian{{endash}}English and English{{endash}}Ulithian dictionary was published by [[Habele]], a US-based charity.&lt;ref&gt;"Charity Publishes Dictionary For Remote Micronesian Islanders " COM-FSM, May 10, 2010.[http://www.comfsm.fm/news/releases/habele4.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors' stated aim was to create a consistent and intuitive pattern of Roman alphabet spelling useful for both native Ulithian and native English speakers.

==Introduction==

===History===
Ulithian is a language spoken in [[Micronesia]]. The specific islands that Ulithian is spoken in are Ulithi, Ngulu, Sorol, Fais Islands and Eastern Caroline Islands. There are also a few speakers that can be found in the United States. Ulithian has about 3039 speakers, 700 of which reside in Ulithi itself. Many of the other Pacific languages spoken in the surrounding islands are similar to Ulithian which makes it easier for others to understand. In a way, it is a universal language for the area.&lt;ref&gt;THE ARMED FORCES RADIO STATION, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt; The people who live in and around Ulithi are classified as Micronesian. Their appearances greatly vary because of all the different people who passed through the area over time.&lt;ref&gt;THE ARMED FORCES RADIO STATION, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; Ulithi has a strong democracy with a king by name voted by the people.&lt;ref&gt;THE ARMED FORCES RADIO STATION, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Ulithian language is so widely recognized, it holds a good status in the islands. It is also one of the six official languages in the Federated States of Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;People and the language. Retrieved from http://ulithiadventurelodge.com/?page_id=57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loanwords===
At one point in time, Spain, Germany, Japan, and the United States had control over the islands of Ulithi. Each one of these groups left behind words that have been evolved and are now used in the Ulithian language. Linguists have used these words to trace back what items each group introduced to Ulithi.

Spain has had an influence in Ulithi since the early 1500s. They left behind things like foods, religious terms, and animals. Some examples of words from Spain are ‘’gato’’ which Ulithian changed to ‘’hatu’’which means cat and ‘’flores’’ which was changed to ‘’floras’’ which means flowers. For example, Spain introduced ‘’cajon’’, which was turned into ‘’kahol’’ which is a crate or box.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh &amp; Walsh, 1979, p. 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Spain passed through Ulithi for such a long period of time, the words they left were used because they actually left behind those things. Foods like the potato and squash were brought by the Spanish, so Ulithian uses words based on the Spanish word for them. Spain was also Catholic, so Catholic terms were left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh &amp; Walsh, 1979, p. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan occupied Ulithi during the time of World War I and left during or after World War II. Before the World Wars, Japan traded with Ulithi. Since the two countries were trade partners, they needed to know how to communicate. Every so often, young boys would learn the basics of Japanese and because of this, "it is not at all difficult today to find Ulithians who speak and write a bit of Japanese".&lt;ref&gt;Walsh &amp; Walsh, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;155-156&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a word from Japan ''denwa'' which Ulithian changed to ''dengwa'' which means telephone. Japan had such a big impact that the word for battery, ''denchi'', remained the same in Ulithian.

Germany did not occupy Ulithi for long, so they left the least influence and there are almost no words that were left behind and still used. One of the few words that got carried over is ''mark'', a German coin which turned into ''mak'', what Ulithians call the U.S. half dollar.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh &amp; Walsh, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;155&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the U.S. task force arrived in Ulithi and there have been an abundance of English [[loan words]] since then. The most impact English is having on Ulithian is through the school systems. Words such as homework and campus which in Ulithian are ‘’homwork’’ and ‘’kampus’’ are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh &amp; Walsh, 1979, p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some loan words that have become the official word in Ulithian, but others are used in place of another word. The Spanish word ‘’flores’’ which means flower was taken and used by Ulithian speakers as ‘’floras’’.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh &amp; Walsh, 1979, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ulithian-English Dictionary written by Neil Mellen and John Hancock, the general word for flowers is ‘’floraas’’ which is close to what is stated in the journal. While the word for flower was similar, the Spanish word for table, “mesa” was directly taken to use in Ulithian. The Ulithian-English Dictionary says that the translation of table is ‘’tiis’’ which is not at all the same as “mesa.” This is totally comparable to speaking pidgin in Hawaii. There are a lot of Japanese words that the majority of people, even if they do not speak Japanese, use such as ‘’shoyu’’ for soy sauce and ‘’bocha’’ for a bath.

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
As far as [[social media]] such as radio and television, there does not seem to be any in specifically Ulithian but there are some in other surrounding languages. Esikiel Lippwe states in a letter that radio and television stations are very important because they effectively educate and bring awareness to the people about things like health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Lippwe, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitality===
According to Ethnologue, Ulithian is ranked at a EGIDS level of 5 which means that the language is being used vigorously, but not as a main language. It is most likely being used more by the older generation. There is a possibility of the language dying out, but it is still in a good standing  (Ethnologue).

'''Walter Augusto Francini''' (3 June 1926 &amp;ndash; 3 May 1996) was a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[journalist]] and [[Esperantist]]. He wrote original books, translated a lot of books to [[Esperanto]] and informed and propagandized about the international language. He was active in the "Goodwill" organization.

Francini was born in [[São Paulo]]. Until the age of 33, he rejected Esperanto, because of advice from a teacher. However, in 1959, he learned Esperanto with Erlind Salzan in [[Portoferraio]], where Francini was working as a [[gymnastics]] teacher. Later he lived and propagandized Esperanto in São Paulo, where he died aged 69.
