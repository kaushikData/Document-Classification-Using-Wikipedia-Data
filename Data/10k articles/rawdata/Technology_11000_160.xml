'''Asymmetric hydrogenation''' is a [[chemical reaction]] that adds two atoms of [[Hydrogen atom|hydrogen]] preferentially to one of two faces of an [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] substrate molecule, such as an alkene or ketone.  The selectivity derives from the manner that the substrate binds to the chiral [[catalysts]].  In jargon, this binding transmits spatial information (what chemists refer to as [[chirality]]) from the catalyst to the target, favoring the product as a single [[enantiomer]].  This [[enzyme]]-like selectivity is particularly applied to bioactive products such as [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical agents]] and [[agrochemicals]].

== History ==
In 1956 a [[heterogeneous]] catalyst made of [[palladium]] deposited on silk was shown to effect asymmetric hydrogenation.&lt;ref name="PdSilk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akabori | first1 = S. | last2 = Sakurai | first2 = S. | last3 = Izumi | first3 = Y. | last4 = Fujii | first4 = Y. | title = An Asymmetric Catalyst | doi = 10.1038/178323b0 | journal = Nature | volume = 178 | issue = 4528 | pages = 323 | year = 1956 | pmid = 13358737| pmc = | bibcode = 1956Natur.178..323A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, in 1968, the groups of [[William Standish Knowles|William Knowles]] and [[Leopold Horner]] independently published the examples of asymmetric hydrogenation using a [[homogeneous catalyst]]s. While exhibiting only modest [[enantiomeric excess]]es, these early reactions demonstrated feasibility. By 1972, enantiomeric excess of 90% was achieved, and the first industrial synthesis of the [[Parkinson's]] drug [[L-DOPA]] commenced using this technology.&lt;ref name="NoyoriNobel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KnowlesNobel" /&gt;[[File:3,4-Dihydroxy-L-phenylalanin (Levodopa).svg|thumb|150px|L-DOPA]]

The field of asymmetric hydrogenation continued to experience a number of notable advances.  [[Henri Kagan]] developed [[DIOP]], an easily prepared C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric diphosphine that gave high ee's in certain reactions.  [[Ryōji Noyori]] introduced the [[ruthenium]]-based catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenated polar substrates, such as ketones and aldehydes.  The introduction of [[Asymmetric hydrogenation#P,N and P,O ligands|P,N ligands]] then further expanded the scope of the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric ligands, although they are not fundamentally superior to chiral ligands lacking [[Molecular Symmetry|rotational symmetry]].&lt;ref name="LigandDevelopment"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pfaltz | first1 = A. | title = Asymmetric Catalysis Special Feature Part II: Design of chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis: From C2-symmetric P,P- and N,N-ligands to sterically and electronically nonsymmetrical P,N-ligands | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0307152101 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 101 | issue = 16 | pages = 5723–5726 | year = 2004 | pmid = | pmc = 395974| bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.5723P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, asymmetric hydrogenation is a routine methodology in laboratory and industrial scale organic chemistry.

The importance of '''asymmetric hydrogenation''' was recognized by the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] awarded to [[William Standish Knowles]] and [[Ryōji Noyori]].

== Mechanism ==
Two major [[reaction mechanism|mechanisms]] have been proposed for catalytic hydrogenation with [[rhodium]] complexes: the '''unsaturated mechanism''' and the '''dihydride mechanism'''.  While distinguishing between the two mechanisms is difficult, the difference between the two for asymmetric hydrogenation is relatively unimportant since both converge to a common intermediate before any stereochemical information is transferred to the product molecule.&lt;ref name ="MechanismofStereoselection"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gridnev | first1 = I. D. | last2 = Imamoto | first2 = T. | doi = 10.1021/ar030156e | title = On the Mechanism of Stereoselection in Rh-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation: A General Approach for Predicting the Sense of Enantioselectivity | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 633–644 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15379579| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The preference for producing one enantiomer instead of another in these reactions is often explained in terms of [[steric hindrance|steric]] interactions between the [[ligand]] and the [[prochiral]] substrate.  Consideration of these interactions has led to the development of quadrant diagrams where "blocked" areas are denoted with a shaded box, while "open" areas are left unfilled.  In the modeled reaction, large groups on an incoming [[olefin]] will tend to orient to fill the open areas of the diagram, while smaller groups will be directed to the blocked areas and hydrogen delivery will then occur to the back face of the olefin, fixing the [[stereochemistry]].  Note that only part of the chiral phosphine ligand is shown for the sake of clarity.

Chiral [[Phosphine#Phosphines|phosphine]] ligands, especially [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric ligand]]s, are the source of chirality in most asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts. Of these the [[BINAP]] ligand is well-known, as a result of its Nobel Prize-winning application in the [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]].&lt;ref name ="NoyoriNobel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noyori | first1 = R. | title = Asymmetric Catalysis: Science and Opportunities (Nobel Lecture 2001) | doi = 10.1002/adsc.200390002 | journal = Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis | volume = 345 | issue = 12 | pages = 15–41 | year = 2003 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiral phosphine ligands can be generally classified as [[Denticity|mono- or bidentate]].  They can be further classified according to the location of the stereogenic centre – phosphorus vs the organic substituents.  Ligands with a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry element have been particularly popular, in part because the presence of such an element reduces the possible binding conformations of a substrate to a metal-ligand complex dramatically (often resulting in exceptional enantioselectivity).&lt;ref name="C2Symmetry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitesell | first1 = J.

Acyclic unsaturated substrates ([[olefins]], [[ketones]], [[enamine]]s [[imines]]) represents the most common prochiral substrates. Substrates that are particularly amenable to asymmetric hydrogenation often feature a polar functional group adjacent to the site to be hydrogenates.  In the absence of this functional) group, catalysis often results in low ee's.  For unfunctionalized olefins, iridium with P,N-based ligands) have proven successful catalysts. Catalyst utility within this category is unusually narrow; consequently, many different categories of solved and unsolved catalytic problems have developed. 1,1-disubstituted, 1,2-diaryl trisubstituted, 1,1,2-trialkyl and tetrasubstituted olefins represent classes that have been investigated separately,&lt;ref name="TerminalOlefins"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pàmies | first1 = O. | last2 = Andersson | first2 = P.

Conversely to the case of olefins, asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines has favoured diphosphine-type ligands; excellent results have been achieved with both iridium- and rhodium-based systems. However, even the best systems often suffer from low ee's and a lack of generality. Certain [[pyrrolidine]]-derived enamines of aromatic ketones are amenable to asymmetrically hydrogenation with cationic rhodium(I) phosphonite systems, and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acetic acid system with ee values usually above 90% and potentially as high as 99.9%.&lt;ref name="Enamine1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hou | first1 = G.

The asymmetric hydrogenation of [[aromaticity|aromatic]] (especially [[heteroaromatic]]), substrates is a very active field of ongoing research. Catalysts in this field must contend with a number of complicating factors, including the tendency of highly stable aromatic compounds to resist hydrogenation, the potential coordinating (and therefore catalyst-poisoning) abilities of both substrate and product, and the great diversity in substitution patterns that may be present on any one aromatic ring.&lt;ref name="HeteroaromaticsRev"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = Y.

Such strategies are less applicable to oxygen- and sulfur-containing heterocycles, since they are both less basic and less nucleophilic; this additional difficulty may help to explain why few effective methods exist for their asymmetric hydrogenation.

=== Pyridines ===
[[Pyridines]] are highly variable substrates for asymmetric reduction (even compared to other heteroaromatics), in that five carbon centers are available for differential substitution on the initial ring.  As of October 2012 no method seems to exist that can control all five, although at least one reasonably general method exists.

The most-general method of asymmetric pyridine hydrogenation is actually a heterogeneous method, where asymmetry is generated from a chiral oxazolidinone bound to the C2 position of the pyridine. Hydrogenating such functionalized pyridines over a number of different heterogeneous metal catalysts gave the corresponding piperidine with the substituents at C3, C4, and C5 positions in an all-''cis'' geometry, in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. The oxazolidinone auxiliary is also conveniently cleaved under the hydrogenation conditions.&lt;ref name="PyridinesOxazolidinone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glorius | first1 = F. | last2 = Spielkamp | first2 = N. | last3 = Holle | first3 = S. | last4 = Goddard | first4 = R. | last5 = Lehmann | first5 = C.

Methods designed specifically for 2-substituted pyridine hydrogenation can involve asymmetric systems developed for related substrates like 2-substituted quinolines and quinoxalines.

=== Indoles ===
The asymmetric hydrogenation of [[indole]]s initially focused on N-protected indoles, where the protecting group could serve both to activate the heterocycle to hydrogenation and as a secondary coordination site for the metal. Later work allowed unprotected indoles to be targeted through Brønsted acid activation of the indole.

In the initial report on asymmetric indole hydrogenation, N-acetyl 2-substituted indoles could be protected with high yields and ee of 87-95%.  3-substituted indoles were less successful, with hydrolysis of the protecting group outcompeting the hydrogenation of the indole.&lt;ref name="Indole"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuwano | first1 = R. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Kurokawa | first3 = T. | last4 = Karube | first4 = D. | last5 = Ito | first5 = Y. | title = Catalytic Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Heteroaromatic Compounds, Indoles | doi = 10.1021/ja001271c | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 122 | issue = 31 | pages = 7614 | year = 2000 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Switching to an N-tosyl protecting group inhibited the hydrolysis reaction and allowed both 2- and 3-substituted indoles to be hydrogenated in high yield and ee.&lt;ref name="Indoles2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuwano | first1 = R. | last2 = Kaneda | first2 = K. | last3 = Ito | first3 = T. | last4 = Sato | first4 = K. | last5 = Kurokawa | first5 = T. | last6 = Ito | first6 = Y. | doi = 10.1021/ol049317k | title = Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral 3-Substituted Indolines by Catalytic Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Indoles | journal = Organic Letters | volume = 6 | issue = 13 | pages = 2213–2215 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15200323| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indoles3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuwano | first1 = R. | last2 = Kashiwabara | first2 = M. | last3 = Sato | first3 = K. | last4 = Ito | first4 = T. | last5 = Kaneda | first5 = K. | last6 = Ito | first6 = Y. | doi = 10.1016/j.tetasy.2006.01.016 | title = Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of indoles using a rhodium complex with a chiral bisphosphine ligand PhTRAP | journal = Tetrahedron: Asymmetry | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 521 | year = 2006 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with both methods, however, is that N-acetyl and N-tosyl groups require harsh cleavage conditions that might be incompatible with complex substrates.

Despite these advances in the asymmetric hydrogenation of protected indoles, considerable operational simplicity can be gained by removing the protecting group altogether. This has been achieved with catalytic systems utilizing Brønsted acids to activate the indole. The initial system used a Pd(TFA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H8-BINAP system to achieve the enantioselective ''cis''-hydrogenation of 2,3- and 2-substituted indoles with high yield and excellent ee. A similar process, where sequential [[Friedel-Crafts reaction|Friedel-Crafts alkylation]] and asymmetric hydrogenation occur in one pot, allow asymmetric 2,3-substituted indolines to be selectively prepared from 2-substituted indoles in similarly high yields and ee.&lt;ref name="OrganocatalyticIndoles"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xiao | first1 = Y.

The asymmetric hydrogenation of 2,3,5-substituted pyrroles was achieved by the recognition that such substrates bear the same substitution pattern as 2-substituted indoles, and an asymmetric hydrogenation system that is effective for one of these substrates might be effective for both. Such an analysis led to the development of a ruthenium(I)/phosphine/amine base system for 2,3,5-substituted N-Boc pyrroles that can give either dihydro or tetrahydropyrroles (pyrrolidines), depending on the nature of the pyrrole substituents. An all-phenyl substitution pattern leads to dihydropyrroles in very high yield (&gt;96%) and essentially perfect enantioselectivity. Access to the fully hydrogenated, all-''cis'' dihydropyrrole may then be accessible through diastereoselective heterogeneous hydrogenation. Alkyl substitution may lead to either the dihydro or tetrahydropyrrole, although the yields (&gt;70%) and enantioselectivities (often &gt;90%) generally remain high. The [[regioselectivity]] in both cases appears to be governed by sterics, with the less-substituted double being preferentially hydrogenated.&lt;ref name="PyrrolesTrap" /&gt;

Unprotected 2,5-pyrroles may also be hydrogenated asymmetrically by a Brønsted acid/Pd(II)/chiral phosphine-catalyzed method, to give the corresponding 2,5-disubstituted 1-[[pyrrolines]] in roughly 70-80% yield and 80-90% ee.&lt;ref name ="PyrrolesBronsted" /&gt;

== Heterogeneous catalysis ==
Research into asymmetric hydrogenation with heterogeneous catalysts has generally focused on three areas.  The oldest, dating back to the first asymmetric hydrogenation with palladium deposited on a silk support, involves modifying a metal surface with a chiral molecule, usually one that can be harvested from nature. Alternatively, researchers have used various techniques to attempt to immobilize what would otherwise be homogeneous catalysts on heterogeneous supports or have used synthetic organic ligands and metal sources to build chiral [[metal-organic framework]]s (MOFs).

[[File:Cinchonidine2d.png|thumb|100px|[[Cinchonidine]], one of the cinchona alkaloids]]
The greatest successes in chiral modification of metal surfaces have come from the use of [[cinchona]] [[alkaloids]], though numerous other classes of natural products have been evaluated.  These alkaloids have been shown to enhance the rate of substrate hydrogenation by 10–100 times, such that less than one molecule of cinchona alkaloid is needed for every reactive site on the metal and, in fact, the presence of too much of the chiral modifier can cause a decrease in the enantioselectivity of the reaction.&lt;ref name="HeterogeneousRev"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heitbaum | first1 = M. | last2 = Glorius | first2 = F. | last3 = Escher | first3 = I. | doi = 10.1002/anie.200504212 | title = Asymmetric Heterogeneous Catalysis | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 45 | issue = 29 | pages = 4732–62 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16802397| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative technique and one that allows more control over the structural and electronic properties of active catalytic sites is the immobilization of catalysts that have been developed for homogeneous catalyis on a heterogeneous support.  Covalent bonding of the catalyst to a polymer or other solid support is perhaps most common, though immobilization of the catalyst may also be achieved by [[adsorption]] onto a surface, [[ion exchange]], or even physical encapsulation.  One drawback of this approach is the potential for the proximity of the support to change the behaviour of the catalyst, lowering the enantioselectivity of the reaction.  To avoid this, the catalyst is often bound to the support by a long linker though cases are known where the proximity of the support can actually enhance the performance of the catalyst.&lt;ref name="HeterogeneousRev" /&gt;

The final approach involves the construction of MOFs that incorporate chiral reaction sites from a number of different components, potentially including chiral and achiral organic ligands, structural metal ions, catalytically active metal ions, and/or preassembled catalytically active organometallic cores.&lt;ref name="MOFRev"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yoon | first1 = M. | last2 = Srirambalaji | first2 = R. | last3 = Kim | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1021/cr2003147 | title = Homochiral Metal–Organic Frameworks for Asymmetric Heterogeneous Catalysis | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 1196–1231 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22084838| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This field is relatively new, and few examples exist of chiral asymmetric hydrogenation using these frameworks.

Knowles' research into asymmetric hydrogenation and its application to the production scale synthesis of L-Dopa&lt;ref name="KnowlesNobel" /&gt; gave asymmetric hydrogenation a strong start in the industrial world.

The success of asymmetric hydrogenation in industry can be seen in a number of specific cases where the replacement of kinetic resolution based methods has resulted in substantial improvements in the process's efficiency.  For example, Roche's Catalysis Group was able to achieve the synthesis of (S,S)-Ro 67-8867 in 53% overall yield, a dramatic increase above the 3.5% that was achieved in the resolution based synthesis.&lt;ref name="AsymmetricIndustrial2"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Barsanti-Matteucci engine''' was the first [[internal combustion engine]]. In late 1851 or early 1852 [[Eugenio Barsanti]], a professor of [[mathematics]], and [[Felice Matteucci]], an [[engineer]] and expert in [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], joined forces on a project to exploit the [[explosion]] and [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of a gaseous mix of [[hydrogen]] and atmospheric air to transform part of the energy of such explosions into [[mechanical energy]].

==Origin==
The idea originated almost ten years earlier with Barsanti when, as a young man, he was teaching at St. Michael's College in [[Volterra]], Italy. An engineer from [[Milan]] Italy, Luigi de Cristoforis, described in a paper published in the acts of the Lombard Royal Institute of Science, Literature and Art, a pneumatic machine (later built and shown to work) that ran on [[naphtha]] and an air mixture, and which constituted the first liquid fuel engine.

==Prototypes==
During the twelve years of collaboration between Barsanti and Matteucci several prototypes of [[internal combustion engine]]s were realized. It was the first real internal combustion engine,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; constituted in its simplest realization by a vertical cylinder in which an explosion of a mixture of [[air]] and [[hydrogen]] or an [[illuminating gas]] shot a [[piston]] upwards thereby creating a [[vacuum]] in the space underneath. When the piston returned to its original position, due to the action of the [[atmospheric pressure]], it turned a toothed rod connected to a [[sprocket]] wheel and transmitted movement to the driving shaft.
  
==Patents==
Numerous [[patent]]s were obtained by the two [[inventor]]s: the 1854 English&lt;ref&gt;http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=185701655A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=18571201&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&lt;/ref&gt; and Piedmont patents, the 1861 Piedmont patent of Barsanti, Matteucci and Babacci which was then used as a base to construct the engine of the [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.|Escher Wyss]] company of [[Zurich]] and put on exhibit during the first National Expo of Florence in 1861, and the 1861 English patent.

[[Image:SAO 09 2008 Fiat Siena TetraFuel 2 views v1.jpg|thumb|225px|right| The Brazilian [[Fiat Siena|Fiat Siena Tetrafuel]] 1.4 is the first bi-fuel car that runs with [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas (CNG)]] alternating automatically with any of the typical fuel blends used in [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, pure [[gasoline]], or gasohol [[w:Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20, E25|E25]], or just [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] ([[w:Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|E100]]).

The most common technology and alternate fuel available in the market for bi-fuel gasoline cars is [[Liquefied petroleum gas|Autogas (LPG)]], followed by [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas (CNG)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html | title=Natural Gas Vehicles | author=Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center | publisher=US Department of Energy | date= | accessdate=2008-09-01 |language= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080901201306/http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html| archivedate= 1 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is used mainly in Europe. The Netherlands and the Baltic states have a large number of cars running with LPG. [[Italy]] currently has the largest number of CNG vehicles, followed by Sweden.  They are also used in [[South America]], where these vehicles are mainly used as [[taxicab]]s in main cities of [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the [[gas cylinder]] in the trunk and the LPG or CNG injection system and electronics.

==Diesel conversions==
Diesel engine is compression ignition engine and does not have spark plug. To operate a diesel engine with an alternate combustible fuel source such as [[Natural gas]], '''Dual-Fuel''' system used. Natural gas as the main fuel while [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] fuel is used for the ignition of the gas/air mixture inside the cylinder (a portion of diesel is injected at the end of the compression stroke, thereby maintaining the original diesel operation principle)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.uthm.edu.my/8473/|title=Conversion method of a diesel engine to a CNG-diesel dual fuel engine and its financial savings|last=Mukhsin|first=Ismail, Muammar|last2=Hakim|first2=Zulkifli, Abd Fathul|date=April 2016|website=eprints.uthm.edu.my|access-date=2018-08-20|last3=Fawzi|first3=Mohd Ali, Mas|last4=Azmir|first4=Osman, Shahrul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual fuel operation means the engine uses two fuels (gas and diesel)  at the same time, as opposed to Bi Fuel which would mean the engine could have the option of using either fuel separately.

There usually two type of conversions - low speed (below 1000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and high speed (between 1200 and 1800 RPM).

[[Image:Low speed conversion.jpg|thumb|Low Speed Conversion]]

===Low and middle speed conversion===
Gas is injected into the cylinder inlet manifold by individual gas electromagnetic valves installed as close to the suction valves as possible. The valves are separately timed and controlled by injection control unit. This system interrupts the gas supply to the cylinder during the long overlap of the suction and exhaust valves (just typical for slow-speed and medium-speed engines – within the valve overlap cylinder scavenging is performed). This avoids substantial gas losses and prevents dangerous gas flow to the exhaust manifold.

* This conversion is adjusted for low speed engines up to 1000 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 70-90% natural gas for diesel or HFO.
* Gas is injected directly before intake valve by high speed electromagnetic injector, one or two injector per each cylinder.

=== High speed conversion===
[[Image:High speed conversion.jpg|thumb|High Speed Conversion]]

Gas is mixed with air by a common mixer installed before turbocharger(s). Gas flow is controlled by a throttle valve, which is electronically operated by the special control system according to the required engine output and speed. In order to avoid knocking of the engine, knocking detector/controller is installed, thus enabling engine operation at the most efficient gas/diesel ratio.

* Suitable for all High Speed engines, 1200-1800 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 50-80% natural gas for diesel.
* Gas and air are blended behind air filter before turbocharger by central mixer.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRwH9BF0h1w&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common conversion features==
{{prose|section|date=March 2017}}
* Substantial savings on operation costs
* Practically no engine modification required
* Non-derated output power
* Fuel flexibility: Possibility of bi-fuel or original pure diesel operations
* Safe operations.
* Lower emissions
* Longer engine life span, longer service and maintenance intervals

==Gas types used==
It is common to use [[Compressed Natural Gas|CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)]] or [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG (Liquid Natural Gas)]] for bi-fuel operations. Both are also mostly used for [[Electrical generator|Generator sets]] conversions, because the engine does not lose the output power.

In recent years [[biogas]] is being used. The [[biogas]] composition and calorific value must be known in order to evaluate if the particular biogas type is suitable. Calorific value may be an issue as biogas is derived from different sources and there is low calorific value in many cases. You can imagine you have to inject sufficient volume of gas into the cylinder to substitute [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] oil (or, better to say, substitute energy delivered by diesel oil). If the calorific value (energy) of the biogas was very low, there is a need to inject really big volume of biogas into the cylinder, which might be technically impossible. Additionally, the composition of the biogas has to lean towards ignitable gases and be filtered as much as possible of non-combustible compounds such as carbon dioxide.

Associated gas is the last type of gas which is commonly used for bi-fuel conversions of generator sets. Associated gas is a natural gas found in association with oil, either dissolved in the oil or as a cap of free gas above the oil. It means it has almost the same quality as CNG or LNG.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/halliburton-leads-effort-_n_3342119.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diesel/gas ratio==
It depends on the technical state of the engine, especially of the injection system. The typical Diesel / Gas ratio is 40/60% for the high-speed engines. If the operating output of the engine is constant and between 70-80% of nominal output, than it is possible to reach up to 30/70% ratio.&lt;ref&gt;http://hhpinsight.com/epoperations/2013/02/cummins-for-pge-universal-fracking/&lt;/ref&gt; If the operating output is lower (for example 50% of the nominal output) or if there are variations, the rate is about 45/55% (more of diesel is used).For Low Speed conversions it is possible to reach the Diesel/gas ratio up to 10/90%. Generally, it is not possible to guarantee an exact diesel/gas ratio without a test being done after the conversion.

== Vehicles ==
[[Aftermarket (automotive)|Aftermarket]] 'bi-fuel' and even 'tri-fuel' conversions are also available.

'''Crystal Decisions''' (previously known as ''[[Seagate Software]] Information Management Group'') was a company that was known for its [[business intelligence]] products.

The company was formed when [[hard disk drive]] manufacturer [[Seagate Technology]] acquired [[Holos#Company|Holistic Systems]] and [[Crystal Services]] with the intention of pursuing better profit margins in the [[software]] market. Holistic Systems had a wide range of sales offices, infrastructure and the [[Holos]] [[OLAP]] product, whilst Crystal Services had good [[OEM]] deals for the [[Crystal Reports]] database reporting product that they had written. The first new product from the combined company was Seagate Info, which later evolved to become known as [[Crystal Enterprise]]. [[Crystal Analysis]] followed as an OLAP client.

The company's structure reflected its heritage, with OLAP technologies being developed out of the former Holistic Systems R&amp;D site in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]] and Relational Database technologies being developed out of the former Crystal Services R&amp;D centre in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

Crystal Decisions was acquired by [[Business Objects (company)|Business Objects]] in December 2003. As part of this acquisition, the former research and development site in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]], was closed with a loss of about 80 jobs in order to centralize development in [[Vancouver]] and [[Paris]], with the support for the [[Holos]] product being outsourced to [[Raspberry Software]] based near Ipswich.

The Holos product line has now{{When|date=October 2016}} ceased.

Business Objects was purchased by [[SAP AG|SAP]] in March 2008.

== History{{anchor|Council of Industrial Design}} ==
The Design Council began on 19 December 1944 as the ''Council of Industrial Design'' (COID), founded by [[Hugh Dalton]], [[President of the Board of Trade]] in the wartime Government.&lt;ref name=McDermott1992&gt;{{cite book |last=McDermott |first=Catherine |date=1992 |title=Essential Design |location=London, UK |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc |page=81 |isbn=0-7475-1936-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objective was 'to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry'.

S. C. Leslie, the Council's first director, played an important part in the ''[[Britain Can Make It]]'' exhibition of 1946. His 1947 successor Sir Gordon Russell established the organisational model for the next 40 years. Under [[Paul Reilly, Baron Reilly|Sir Paul Reilly]] the organisation changed its name to the ''Design Council'' in 1972.&lt;ref name="designcouncil history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/Our-History/ | title=Our history | publisher=Design Council | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815135436/http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/Our-History/ |archivedate=August 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/learning/dcsc/centre.html | title=The Design Centre | publisher=[[VADS (organisation)|VADS]] | accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHonline/2005/whitworth.pdf |title=Inscribing Design on the Nation: The Creators of the British Council of Industrial Design |first=Lesley  |last=Whitworth |authorlink= |date= 2006 |conference=Business History Conference (2005) |conferenceurl=http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHonline/2005/BEHOLprog05.html |editor-first=William J.|editor-last=Hausman |others= |volume=3 |publisher= |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |issn=1941-7349|accessdate=May 31, 2014 |quote=The Council was re-named the Design Council in 1972 and is still in existence, albeit with a redefined mission statement and a greatly altered modus operandi |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DesignCouncilArchive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/archives/design-council2|title=Design Council Archive|publisher=University of Brighton|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Design Council was incorporated as a registered charity by Royal Charter in 1976,&lt;ref name="CharityCommission2014-Framework" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Temple2010 /&gt;{{rp|12}} although it continued to operate as a [[non-departmental public body]].&lt;ref name=Temple2010 /&gt;{{rp|50}}

In December 1994 it was restructured,&lt;ref name=DesignCouncilArchive /&gt; resulting in a functional change from being both an advisory body and a provider of goods and services to a primarily strategic mission “to inspire the best use of design by the United Kingdom in the world context, in order to improve prosperity and wellbeing”.&lt;ref name="designcouncil history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On 1 April 2010 it incorporated a subsidiary trading company called Design Council Enterprises Limited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/07211046|title=Design Council Enterprises Limited 07211046|publisher=[[Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills]]|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to transact “fundraising activities that are not primary-purpose charitable activity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/Design%20Council%20Annual%20Report%202011-12.pdf|title=Annual Report and Accounts For the year ended 31 March 2012|date=September 2012|author=Design Council|page=5|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2011, it ceased to be a non-departmental public body of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and became an independent registered charity, although it continued to receive grants from the Department.&lt;ref name="CharityCommission2014-SIR" /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name=Temple2010&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/32441/10-1178-design-council-review.pdf | title=The Design Council | first=Martin | last=Temple | authorlink=Martin Temple|publisher=[[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] | date=October 2010 | accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/corporate-information/our-finances/ | title=Our finances | publisher=Design Council | accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also officially merged with the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]] (CABE) on the same day&lt;ref name="CABE merger"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/1054518/design-council-cabe-confirm-merger | title=Design Council and CABE confirm merger | publisher=Planning magazine | accessdate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Design Council CABE was incorporated four days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/07580913 |title=Design Council Commission For Architecture And The Built Environment 07580913 |publisher=[[Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills]]|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Design Centre===
Sir Gordon Russell, who was heavily involved in the 1951 ''[[Festival of Britain]]'', examined ways to reform the education and training of new [[industrial designers]]. The Design Centre, in London's [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]], was officially opened on 26 April 1956.&lt;ref name="VADS-DesignCentre" /&gt;

The Council under Russell combined exhibitions with product endorsements, direct services to industry, commercial publishing and retail.&lt;ref name="designcouncil history" /&gt;

After the Design Council’s restructuring in 1994, the Design Centre was closed to the public. The Design Council continued to operate from the Design Centre until 1998.&lt;ref name="VADS-DesignCentre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/learning/dcsc/centre.html|title=Design Council Slide Collection: an online guide to the resource|first=Simon|last=Ford|first2=John|last2=Davis|publisher=[[VADS (organisation)|VADS]]|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diacetyl peroxide''' is the [[organic peroxide]] with the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a white solid or oily liquid with a sharp odor.&lt;ref name=nj/&gt; Since the pure material poses an explosion hazard, it is often used as a solution, e.g., in [[dimethyl phthalate]] as a solvent.&lt;ref name = hawley/&gt;

==Preparation==
Diacetyl peroxide forms upon combining [[hydrogen peroxide]] and excess [[acetic anhydride]]. [[Peracetic acid]] is an intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/89/i2/Chemical-Safety-Synthesis-Procedure.html|title=Chemical Safety: Synthesis Procedure|journal=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|volume=89|issue=2|page=2|date=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety ==
Organic peroxides are typically explosive since they contain both the oxidizer, the O-O bond, and reducing agents, the C-C and C-H bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sax|first=N. I.|title=Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials|edition=4th|location=New York, NY|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|date=1975|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is shock sensitive and explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://cen.acs.org/articles/89/i2/Chemical-Safety-Synthesis-Procedure.html| title = Chemical Safety: Synthesis Procedure | journal = [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 2 | date = 2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NFP&gt;{{cite book|author=National Fire Protection Association|title=Fire Protection Guide on Hazardous Materials|edition=7th|location=Boston, MA|publisher=National Fire Protection Association|date=1978|pages=49–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hawley/&gt;

The threshold quantity for [[Process Safety Management]] per [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] 1910.119 is {{convert|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} if the concentration of the diacetyl peroxide solution is greater than 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9761]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been reports of detonation of the pure material. The 25% solution also has explosive potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=National Research Council|title=Prudent Practices for Handling Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories|location=Washington, DC|publisher=National Academy Press|date=1981|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystalline peroxide is especially shock sensitive and a high explosion risk.&lt;ref name = bretherick&gt;{{cite book|last=Bretherick|first=L.|title=[[Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards]]|edition=4th|location=Boston, MA|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|date=1990|pages=453, 1104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = bretherick/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFP/&gt;

[[File:Exit intent popup at buecher.de.png|thumb|right]]
An '''exit intent popup''' is a technique used in [[online shop]]s and [[website]]s to retain visitors that are going to leave the site.

With an exit intent popup, a visitor's [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] movements are tracked, and when the [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] moves outside the upper page boundary (because the tab bar is usually there), a [[popup window]] is shown. The ad is triggered by using a [[Javascript]] snippet that measures the speed and direction of the mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.useproof.com/exit-intent-popup/|title=19 Exit Intent Popup Examples to Increase Conversion and Grow Revenue|website=blog.useproof.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the popup contains a [[discount code]] to convince the user to finish the sale. Exit intent [[advertisement]]s can also be used to offer a discount, push to a demo, collect [[email]]s, or segment to a [[newsletter]] list.

== Exit intent technology on mobile devices ==
The exit-intent [[technology]] works differently on [[mobile device]]s than on a [[desktop computer|desktop]]. There is no mouse movement to track, so advanced [https://www.poptin.com/blog/exit-intent-technology-can-grow-business/ exit intent] popup [[software]] will show a popup once a visitor tries to click "back" or close the [[Mobile browser|mobile]] [[browser tab]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.muz.li/l28-highly-converting-designed-popup-examples-to-use-explanations-included-ca2dd1ceaec1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">[[Image:ExtensionTube5733.jpg|right|thumb|A set of extension tubes with a pen illustrating the lack of internal lenses]]
An '''extension tube''' - also called extension ring -  is used with [[lens mount|interchangeable lenses]] to [[focus (optics)|focus]] closer, useful in [[macro photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/macro-extension-tubes-closeup.htm MACRO EXTENSION TUBES &amp; CLOSE-UP LENSES]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The tube contains no optical elements; its sole purpose is to move the lens farther from the image plane. The farther away the lens is, the closer the focus, the greater the magnification, and also the greater the loss of light (requiring a longer exposure time). Lenses classically focus closer than infinity by moving all optical elements farther from the film or sensor; an extension tube simply enables this movement. 

Extension tubes without electrical contacts will not allow an electronic automatic camera to control the lens, thus disabling [[autofocus]] and in some cases forcing a user to shoot [[Aperture|wide open]] unless the lens offers manual aperture control. More expensive extension tubes contain electrical contacts allowing the user to use [[autofocus]] and electronically control the aperture of the attached lens. An advantage to the non-electrical tubes is their lower price.

Other items like lens adapters may unintentionally have an effect similar to an extension tube. A lens designed for a small [[flange focal distance]] may not be able to focus to infinity when a lens adapter places the sensor too far away.

==Versus teleconverters and close-up lens==
Extension tubes are sometimes confused with [[teleconverter]]s, an optical component (i.e., containing lenses) designed to increase effective focal length.

A [[close-up lens]] also enables focusing closer for macro photography but, unlike an extension tube, a close-up lens actually is an optical element.

[[File:Crop of patent 636492.png|thumb|Crop of patent number 636,492]]

The electric '''flash-lamp''' uses electric current to start [[flash powder]] burning, to provide a brief sudden burst of bright light. It was principally used for [[flash (photography)|flash photography]] in the early 20th century but had other uses as well. Previously, photographers' flash powder, introduced in 1887 by [[Adolf Miethe]] and Johannes Gaedicke, had to be ignited manually, exposing the user to greater risk.

== Invention ==

The electric flash-lamp was invented by [[Joshua Lionel Cowen|Joshua Cohen]] (a.k.a. Joshua Lionel Cowen of the [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel toy train]] fame) in 1899, and by [[Paul Boyer (photographer)|Paul Boyer]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5554099z/f244.image ''Panthéon de la Légion d'honneur'', vol. 2, by T. Lamathière]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was granted U.S. patent number 636,492.&lt;ref name ="patent636492"&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=ctJ1AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=description&amp;zoom=4 Patent No. 636,492]&lt;/ref&gt;  This flash of bright light from the flash-lamp was used for indoor photography in the late nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century.

Joshua Lionel Cowen's flash-lamp patent 636,492 reads in part, {{cquote|
My appliance comprises a tubular casing A, to be held in the hand, an upright detachable post B, and a horizontal through part C to receive the flash-light powder. The casing A is adapted to contain cells of dry battery, which can be introduced into or removed from the lower end through an opening closed by the sheet-metal screw-cap c. The walls of the casing may be of metal and covered with leather or imitation leather or any other suitable material. At the upper end one pole of the uppermost cell will be in contact with the insulated pin a', Fig. 2, while opposite the opposing pole of the lowermost cell lies a push-button contact D, on pressing which the circuit can be closed at that point to the metal casing.&lt;ref name ="patent636492"/&gt;}}

The principle of operation of the electrical flash-lamp is linked to the shutter of an early [[box camera]]: tripping the shutter ignites the [[flash powder]] and releases the [[potential energy]] of the exploding powder causing a bright flash for indoor photography.

== Uses of flash-lamp ==
The main purpose of Cowen's invention was as a fuse to ignite explosive powder to get a photographer's flash.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, p. 129 ''The navy thought it would make a great fuse for mines - which wasn't what Cowen had in mind - but he liked it fine when the government bought ten thousand of them.''&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first practical applications, however, for Cowen's flash-lamp was as underwater [[Fuse (explosives)|mine detonator fuses]] for the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref name ="about.com"&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blflashlight.htm?once=true&amp;iam=dpile&amp;terms=+invention++of++flashlights Aboutdotcom] ''Cowen was an inventor of sorts; he developed a fuse to ignite photographic flash powder. Though the invention failed in its intent, the U.S. Navy bought up the fuses to use with underwater explosives.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/cowen.htm Joshua Lionel Cowen at a glance]
''In 1899, he patented a device for igniting photographers’ flash powder by using dry cell batteries to heat a wire fuse. Cowen than parlayed this into a defense contract to equip 24,000 Navy mines with detonators.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2007/4/2007_4_4.shtml Invention &amp; Technology Magazine] ''In the 1890s Cowen invented several devices that could be powered by the newly available dry-cell batteries. One was a fuse for igniting photographic flash powder. The Navy ordered 24,000 of them to use as detonators for underwater mines.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonestarhirailers.com/history.html The Lionel Story] ''In 1899, he patented a device for igniting photographers’ flash powder by using dry cell batteries to heat a wire fuse. Cowen than parlayed this into a defense contract to equip 24,000 Navy mines with detonators.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunaccessoriesusa.com/flashlights/flashlighthistory.htm The History of the Flashlight] ''Cowen was an inventor of sorts; he developed a fuse to ignite photographic flash powder. Though the invention failed in its intent, the U.S. Navy bought up the fuses to use with underwater explosives.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisdayinjewishhistory.blogspot.com/2008_09_01_archive.html This day in Jewish History] ''Joshua Lionel Cowen passed away. Born in 1880, he was the American inventor of electric model trains who founded the Lionel Corporation (1901), which became the largest U.S. toy train manufacturer. At age 18, he had invented a fuse to ignite the magnesium powder for flash photography, which the Navy Department bought from him to be a fuse to detonate submarine mines.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the year the invention was patented, the government awarded Cowen a $12,000 contract for 24,000&lt;ref&gt;The New Yorker magazine, Dec 13, 1947, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[naval mine]] detonator fuses.&lt;ref name ="ideafinder"&gt;[http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/cowen.htm Joshua Lionel Cowen at a glance]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the flash for photography was dangerous, and photographers could get burned hands from the flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kobre|first=Kenneth|title=Photojounalism: The Professionals' Approach|publisher=Litton Educational Publishing, Inc.|isbn=0-930764-15-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electric apparatus applications ==
[[File:1910 flash-lamp detail.png|thumb|Nesbit highspeed flashlight apparatus]]
A 1910 brochure for the Nesbit High Speed Flashlight Apparatus says,
{{cquote| 
"Raise up the movable plunger and spread the powder also over the bottom of the plunger chamber, under the head of plunger.

[[File:Yellow cards.jpg|thumb|A fuel card valid in Belgium]]
A  '''fuel card''' or '''fleet card''' is used as a payment card most commonly for gasoline, diesel, and other fuels at [[gas station]]s.  Fleet cards can also be used to pay for vehicle maintenance and expenses at the discretion of the fleet owner or manager.

Fleet cards are unique due to the convenient and comprehensive reporting that accompanies their use. Fleet cards enable fleet owners/ managers to receive real time reports and set purchase controls with their cards helping them to stay informed of all business related expenses. 

Fleet cards can be provided not only by oil brands like [[Shell Oil Company |Shell]], [[Chevron Corporation |Chevron]], [[ExxonMobil]], but also by companies that only specialize in providing fuel cards such as [[Edenred]], [[Fleetcor]], Petrol Plus Region, Fuelman, Fleetcard and others. Additionally, rideshare companies like [[Uber]] have fleet cards for their drivers, which allow the drivers to have gas money deducted from their earnings.

==Origins==
===United Kingdom===
In its infancy, fuel cards were only printed with the company name, vehicle registration and a signature strip on the reverse. No electronic data was stored. Fuelling sites would verify the company, vehicle registration (on the forecourt) against the card and also the signature written on the back. The site would allow access to the fuel once the retailer's receipt had been signed for and cross checked against the signature written on the back of the card.

Initially, fuel card networks were very small and based around truck roads and main haulage routes. For example, in 1983, the Keyfuels site network consisted of only seven stations. Therefore, they were initially targeted at haulage or delivery companies. A few years later, cards became embossed rather than printed. This was due to provide the cards with a greater longevity — frequent use would rub off the printed information.

Due to the lack of electronic data on the fuel cards at this stage, transactions would be recorded by the card being 'stamped' onto a manual transaction sheet. Further details detailing date, time, volume, grade of fuel and registration would be hand-written.

During the mid to late 1980s, fuel cards began to use [[magnetic strip]] technology. This meant fuel cards could be processed by a retailer electronically and reduced the risk of human error when recording transaction details.

Magnetic strips also enabled fuel card providers to increase fuel card security by ensuring [[Personal identification number|PIN]]s were encoded into the card. Although it should be noted that when the magnetic strip is swiped though a fuel card reader, the transaction is still only verified by checking signatories to this day.

In the advent of outdoor terminals, these PINs became compulsory in order to re-fuel.

The reasoning behind moving from the magnetic strip to [[smartchip]] technology was down to the fact that the magnetic strip could be cloned and the data written onto a dummy card. Also, the use of fuel cards was far heavier than that of debit or credit cards, and therefore it became apparent that the magnetic strip began to wear out far quicker.

Smartchip technology (similar to [[Chip and PIN]]) is the largest development in the fuel card industry in recent years. (See [[Fuel card#Smartchip benefits|Smartchip benefits]])

Increasingly, supermarkets are exploring opportunities in fuel cards. While Tesco &amp; Sainsbury's have the ability to collect loyalty points (Clubcard &amp; Nectar points) and pay with credit, Morrisons has a dedicated fuel card offering. Asda has none at all, In spite of being the cheapest seller of fuel on average in 2012.

During 2008, market maturity has led to users increasingly expecting more from fuel cards than discount pricing, with the demand for service, savings and security leading to the appearance of dedicated account management. While most fuel card suppliers handle customer queries via random-operator call centres, customer preference is increasingly for a named individual to handle their business. Respected publication ''Fleet News'' reported in July 2008 that more than a quarter of fleet managers are unhappy with the level of service offered by their fuel card supplier.

===United States===
The advent of fleet cards can be traced back to the 1960s and 70s when key stops/key locks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staroilco.net/old-school-fleet-fueling-key-lock-system/|title=Old School Fleet Fueling Key Lock System {{!}} Star Oilco|last=|first=|date=|website=www.staroilco.net|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stand alone card locks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staroilco.net/cardlock/|title=Pacific Pride Cardlock, Fuel Security, Prevent Fuel Theft,  Star Oilco|last=Olga|first=Mendez|date=July 31, 2017|website=www.staroilco.net|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; were used by independent marketers and [[filling station]] owners. A Key Stop or Key Lock fuel control system was a system where a group of commercial fleets could access a fuel pump with a unique key that tracked solely their gallons through that pump.  This technology is obsolete and no longer available commercially.  A card lock control system uses a punch card or magnetic stripe card to uniquely identify a fuel buyer on a private server. This was done to avoid a credit card interchange fee which raised the cost of fuel considerably.  The first commercial fuel cards resembled a [[credit card]] with a name and a company logo on them.  When a customer entered a [[fueling station]], the cashier would take down the customer’s name and company information to authenticate ownership of the card.  This process was time consuming and was vulnerable to fraudulent transactions.  With the advent of [[computers]] and [[computer software]] in the 1980s, the development of the fleet card industry quickly expanded.  The invention of the [[magnetic stripe]] and magnetic card reader allowed petroleum marketers to control fuel pump transactions, leading to today’s wide range of fleet card security features and state of the art reporting systems to track all fleet expenses.  These “intelligent” systems make fleet management convenient and secure, as fleet card owners are able to track fleet fuel use with increased accuracy, receiving reports in real time on the fueling habits.  Business owners are able to limit employee fueling by time-of-day and day-of-week.

===India===

Indian consumers saw their first fuel card during 2001 from Bharat Petroleum, the card was mainly aimed at retail customers for personal vehicles. Subsequently various products aimed at various customer segments were launched by all Oil Companies - Smart fleet by Bharat Petroleum, XTRAPOWER by Indian Oil, Drive Track by Hindustan Petroleum, Transconnect by Reliance Industries. While Transconnect found favours during its launch, the same withered away once Reliance shut its outlets due to huge price difference. Indian Oil's XTRAPOWER Fleet Card Program has grown to be the largest fuel card in India, followed by Smart Fleet of Bharat Petroleum and revived Drivetrack Plus of Hindustan Petroleum.

==Misconceptions==
Although fuel cards effectively 'look' like [[credit card]]s and use very similar technology, their use and implementation is significantly dissimilar, enough to differentiate them as an alternative payment method. The main differences from credit cards are:

*Payment terms often get shorter (NOTE: But can be negotiated direct with card issuer much easier than credit card terms)
*No rolling-balance is cleared (or partially cleared) each month
*Can be cheaper due to a system designed to bypass credit card interchanges and their mark ups.
*Transactions can be customized allowing only certain grades of fuel e.g. petrol, petrol &amp; diesel, petrol &amp; [[gas oil]], etc.
*Fuelling transaction limits can be applied using Smartchip technology
*Liability for fraudulent transactions usually remains with user (depending upon agreement with card provider)
*Fraud prevention systems exist to block service areas by nation, state, or postage codes to stop theft.
*Card 'hotlists' (a.k.a. 'authorisation' or 'onstop' lists) received via different providers
*Interim period after stop/hotlist request and card denied at fuelling station can be longer (although [[Online Authorisation]] networks are increasing)
*Payment terminals separate to those used for credit/debit cards (bunkered cards only)
*Fuel not technically paid at point of sale - simply allocated on account for payment at later date (bunkered only)
*Some cards allow the purchase of such non-fuel fleet related items as lubricants, hotels, and Diesel Exhaust Fluid.

==Security==
Depending upon the individual fuel card and the supplier, security benefits of fuel cards can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staroilco.net/stop-fuel-theft/|title=Fleet Fueling Best Practices|last=|first=|date=Star Oilco|website=www.StarOilco.net|archive-date=January 20, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*available local businesses that can work with you on the program and keeping your business safe
*cashless transactions
*chip-and-PIN protection
*current odometer reports with every fuel purchase 
*detailed invoicing – fully itemising transactions for individual cards
*on-line account administration to stop cards 24/7
*transactions restricted to fuel-related products
*reporting of unusual transactions
*restrictions available by postal code to limit the cards function in a specific area of service.
*daily transaction limits.
*daily gallon limits to limit a would be thief. 
*decrease in occurrences of credit card 'skimming'
*real time email or text message "e-Receipts" of transactions
*evidence that can be connected with internal Human Resource policies that enable clear responsibility to terminate employees for stealing fuel

===Smartchip benefits===
Fuel card providers realised there were many benefits from moving over to the smartcard from the magnetic strip:

*Smartchips are difficult to clone
*Fuelling limits can be enforced (''see [[Fuel card#Added features of smartchip technology|Smartchip technology]]'')
*Far more durable than magnetic strips, therefore cards last longer
*Need for cards to be re-created reduced due to longevity
*Smartchip cannot be damaged by electro-magnetic radiation e.g. mobile phones, magnets, speakers, etc.

As of 2007, only 50% or so of fuel cards on offer utilise the smartchip technology.

====Added features of smartchip technology====
Fuelling limits can also be programmed into a fuel card using smartchip technology to specify the following:

*Volume allowed per transaction
*Volume allowed per day
*Volume allowed per week
*Number of transactions allowed per day
*Number of transactions allowed per week
*Days of the week card can be used
*Times of the day card can be used
*Number of incorrect PIN entries allowed
*Card lock-out period after incorrect PINs

==Commercial use in business==
Commercial fuel cards are designed with fleets in mind and seek to avoid both the percentage up-charges of credit card companies as well as the theft risk retail credit cards expose a business to due to their focus on convenience over financial security&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.staroilco.net/upgrade-your-fleet-cards-security-features/|title=Fleet Fuel Card Security Best Practices|last=|first=|date=November 12, 2017|website=www.StarOilco.net/Cardlock/|access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Typically, the majority of businesses using fuel cards are those which heavily rely on motor vehicles on a day-to-day basis e.g. [[transport]], [[Logistics|haulage]], [[courier]] services. One of the primary reasons a business will use a fuel card is to obtain (potentially) significant savings both on the current price of fuel and on administrative costs. It would be normal for the business to receive a single weekly invoice, payable by direct debit; this replaces the manual reconciliation of individual paper receipts which could, for larger organizations, number in the hundreds each week. A number of additional benefits are available for users of fuel cards from a supplier offering an e-business capability.

In most cases, fuel cards can provide fuel at a wholesale price as opposed to standard retail. This way, discount fuel can be purchased without needing to buy in bulk.

Furthermore, the management and security concerning fuel purchases is greatly improved via the use of fuel cards. These features often prove themselves attractive to businesses, especially with those operating large fleets which can sometimes be in the thousands of vehicles.

For example, a business may obtain anything from a one to four pence per litre reduction (PPL) on diesel, which in real terms can be translated into the following (UK based) example:

===Potential cost-saving example (for small fleet)===
{| class="wikitable"
!Fleet Vehicle Size
|35
|-
!Volume Per Fill (litres)
|60

|-
!Re-fuelling (p/week)
|2
|-
!Fuel Card Saving (PPL)
|2.5
|-
!VAT (UK)
|10%
|-
!Total Saving (p/week)
|'''£13.21'''
|-
!Total Saving (p/year)
|'''£687.37'''

Obviously this will never compare to the savings of having bulk fuel on site, but it is a good start over paying full pump prices.
|}

==International fuel cards==
While most fuel cards are for use in a particular country, there are some companies who offer international fuel cards themselves and some via a third party. International site networks often use fully automatic fuel pumps to avoid possible language difficulties and are specially designed to account for different taxation regimes e.g. producing separate invoices for each country which fuel was purchased in a particular month to account for different rates of VAT charged. These site networks sometimes offer the ability to reclaim VAT paid in each country, for a small percentage of the amount reclaimed. Some international fuel card providers solely offer fuel cards for business fleets, others also for individuals. However, the system of fuel cards has meanwhile spread throughout Europe, where they are either called cartões de combustivel, cartecarburanti, tankpas zakelijk tankkaart or fleetpass, cartes de carburants, and Tankkarten.

===Bunkered fuel cards===
Fuel card providers which operate on a bunkering basis aim to achieve a fuel reserve on a particular network in order to achieve a discounted price, therefore taking advantage of economies of scale.

For example, a company may purchase one million litres of diesel at 72.50 and aim to sell this on to the customer with a mark up of 2.5 pence per litre — 75.00 PPL.

Bunkered fuel card companies sometimes also offer customers their own fuel bunker to under the premise of further benefiting from a discounted price. Furthermore, a customer can also hope to achieve a saving by way of avoiding any market increases in the standard market price for that particular fuel. In short, customer fuel bunkering has many pros &amp; cons:

Pros:
* new-start businesses given a vital boost by using fuel cards if credit insurance cannot be obtained (due to lack of company history)
* if the market for that particular fuel rises immediately after a purchase — the customer has potentially made a saving

Cons:
* a healthy cash flow is required to sustain the lump sum payment for their fuel purchase — often difficult for new businesses
* if the market for that particular fuel falls immediately after a purchase — the customer has potentially lost out on a saving opportunity

===Retail fuel cards===
In contrast to bunkered, retail fuel cards operate by way of allowing the customer to draw fuel at almost any [[fuelling station]] (in same method as [[credit card]]). Often providers will levy a surcharge in addition to the retail price as advertised at the fuelling station. The retail price given is often considerably higher than that of the bunkered. The majority of fuel cards provide weekly (advance) notification of fuel price generally applicable nationwide.

Although retail is generally more expensive, there are a number of exceptions depending on the region, particular brand/site and timing of fuel purchased. Retail fuel can be cheaper in certain regions, particularly those near to a major port. Further reasons for the difference in price may be due to local economy (e.g. north / south of England) and whether the site is close to any main transport links i.e. the fuel costs more to deliver into the site. As for timing, the supermarkets or large providers often have a great deal of fuel in their stock reserves, so if the market increases rapidly, they would generally take longer than smaller providers to reflect this change.

Fuel cards are not all the same and 'shopping around' is advised. Typically, a supplier will offer just one or two cards. The user should seek an independent supplier offering a range of cards from major brands, so that the most appropriate fuel card for their individual needs can be chosen. A fuel card with little or no motorway coverage but extensive coverage of metropolitan areas, for example, could be of limited use to a national haulier but ideal for a taxi company. A supplier offering only diesel cards will be of minimal appeal to a fleet manager responsible for a petrol-only or mixed-fuel company car fleet.

Furthermore, retail fuel prices have decreased over the past 15 or so years largely due to supermarkets providing fuel at their superstores at hugely discounted prices in order to entice users to the store. Supermarket prices are an irrelevance to many diesel users, as very few supermarket forecourts are accessible by heavy goods vehicles or coaches.

'''Grouptime''' is a technology start-up based in Munich, Germany, and focused on mobile messaging apps. The core product is Teamwire, an encrypted [[instant messaging]] app for enterprises and the public sector. In addition to text messaging, users can send photos, videos, locations, voice messages and files with Teamwire.

== History ==

The company was founded in August 2010 in Munich (Germany) by Tobias Stepan. In September 2011 the grouptime app was officially launched for devices with Apple`s iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleview.de/grouptime-neue-kostenlose-messenger-app-fuer-iphone-und-ipod/|title=Grouptime: Neue kostenlose Messenger App für iPhone und iPod (German Article)|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/9/prweb8787493.htm|title=Grouptime iPhone App Offers Instant Group Messaging, Sharing and Status Updates|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 several updates of the app were released to improve group messaging and sharing of digital content.

In March 2014 grouptime launched a secure enterprise messaging app called [http://www.teamwire.eu/ Teamwire] to simplify and improve the internal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressebox.de/pressemitteilung/mobileiron/MobileIron-AppConnect-Partner-Teamwire-Sicheres-Messaging-fuer-Unternehmen-nach-deutschen-Datenschutzanforderungen/boxid/662967.htm|title=Secure Enterprise Messaging with German Data Protection (German article)|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to provide a messenger for businesses, to replace the email as the dominant channel for team communication. By mid of 2014 grouptime abandoned its consumer product and completely focussed on the enterprise messaging market. In January 2015 in addition to the German cloud Teamwire became also available as an on-premise and private cloud deployment in order to fulfill the strong data protection requirements of enterprises, large corporations and the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamwire.eu/on-premise-deployment-of-teamwire/|title=Teamwire offers on-premises solution for enterprise messaging|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 Teamwire became a cross-platform enterprise messaging app with the release of apps for desktop devices like Windows, Mac and Linux in addition to the existing iOS and Android apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/03/prweb13250528.htm|title=Teamwire Releases Secure Enterprise Messaging App for Desktop Devices|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 the largest German financial services group deployed Teamwire as a secure messenger for the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.f-i.de/content/download/18469/233338/file/itm_0117_gesamt.pdf|title=My Mobile Office of the Sparkassen Financial Services Group (German Article)|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017 it became public that the police in the state of Bavaria in Germany uses Teamwire as a secure alternative to [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Bayern-Neuer-Polizei-Messenger-fuer-Streifenbeamte-3725791.html|title=New Messenger for the Police (German Article)|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/bayern/article167101993/Die-bayerische-Polizei-wird-aufgeruestet-mit-iPhones.html|title=Bavarian Police Is Equipped with Own Messenger (German Article)|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heating pad''' is a pad used for warming of parts of the body in order to manage [[pain]]. Localized application of heat causes the blood vessels in that area to [[vasodilator|dilate]], enhancing [[perfusion]] to the targeted tissue. Types of heating pads include [[#Electric|electrical]], [[#Chemical|chemical]] and [[hot water bottle]]s.

Specialized heating pads (mats) are also used in other settings. Heat mats in [[plant propagation]] stimulates seed germination and root development; they operate at cooler temperatures.  Heat mats also are available in the [[pet]] trade, especially as warming spots for reptiles such as lizards and snakes.

==Types==
[[File:Electric heating pad.jpg|thumb|An electric heating pad]]

===Electrical===
[[Electric]] pads usually operate from household current and must have protection against overheating.

A '''moist heating pad''' is used dry on the user's skin. These pads register temperatures from {{convert|76|to|82|°C}} and are intended for deep tissue treatment and can be dangerous if left on unattended. Moist heating pads are used mainly by physical therapists but can be found for home use. A moist cloth can be added with a stupe cover to add more moisture to the treatment.

===Chemical===
[[Image:Hand warmer.jpg|thumb|A [[sodium acetate]] heat pad]]

Disposable chemical pads employ a one-time [[exothermic]] [[chemical reaction]]. One type, frequently used for [[hand warmers]], is triggered by unwrapping an air-tight packet containing slightly moist [[iron]] powder and salt or [[catalyst]]s which [[rust]]s over a period of hours after being exposed to [[oxygen]] in the air.  Another type contains separate compartments within the pad; when the user squeezes the pad, a barrier ruptures and the compartments mix, producing heat such as the [[enthalpy change of solution]] of [[calcium chloride]] dissolving.

The most common reusable heat pads contain a [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] solution of [[sodium acetate]] in water. [[Crystallization]] is triggered by flexing a small flat disc of notched [[ferrous]] metal embedded in the liquid. Pressing the disc releases very tiny adhered crystals of sodium acetate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/aic.690490222 | volume=49 | title=Solidification in heat packs: III. Metallic trigger | year=2003 | journal=AIChE Journal | pages=522–529 | author=Rogerson Mansel A}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the solution which then act as [[nucleation]] sites for the crystallization of the sodium acetate into the hydrated salt (sodium acetate trihydrate, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COONa·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).  Because the liquid is supersaturated, this makes the solution crystallize suddenly, thereby releasing the energy of the crystal lattice. The use of the metal disc was invented in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=unU7AAAAEBAJ Reusable heat pack containing supercooled solution and means for activating same]. US Patent 4,077,390 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The pad can be reused by placing it in boiling water for 10–15 minutes, which redissolves the sodium acetate trihydrate in the contained water and recreates a supersaturated solution.  Once the pad has returned to room temperature it can be triggered again.  Triggering the pad before it has reached room temperature results in the pad reaching a lower peak temperature, as compared to waiting until it had completely cooled.

==High specific-heat capacity materials==
Heating packs can also be made by filling a container with a material that has a high [[specific heat capacity]], which then gradually releases the heat over time.  A hot water bottle is the most familiar example of this type of heating pad.

A '''microwavable heating pad''' is a heating pad that is warmed by placing it in a [[microwave oven]] before use.  Microwavable heating pads are typically made out of a thick insulative fabric such as flannel and filled with grains such as [[wheat]], [[buckwheat]] or [[flax seed]].  Due to their relative simplicity to make, they are frequently sewn by hand, often with a custom shape to fit the intended area of use.

Often, [[aroma compound|aromatic compound]]s will also be added to the filler mixture to create a pleasant or soothing smell when heated.  The source of these can vary significantly, ranging from adding [[essential oil]]s to ground up [[spices]] such as [[clove]]s and [[nutmeg]], or even dried [[rose]] petals.

===Phase-change materials===
{{Main|Phase-change material}}
[[Phase change material]]s can be used for heating pads intended to operate at a fixed temperature. The [[heat of fusion]] is used to release the thermal energy. This results in the pad heating up.

== Function ==
Many episodes of pain come from [[muscle]] exertion or strain, which creates tension in the muscles and [[soft tissue]]s.  This tension can constrict [[circulatory system|circulation]], sending pain signals to the [[brain]].  Heat application eases pain by:

* dilating the [[blood vessel]]s surrounding the painful area.  Increased [[blood]] flow provides additional [[oxygen]] and nutrients to help heal the damaged muscle tissue.

'''Impedance cardiography''' (ICG) is a noninvasive technology measuring total electrical conductivity of the thorax and its changes in time to process continuously a number of cardiodynamic parameters, such as Stroke Volume, SV, Heart Rate, HR, Cardiac Output, CO, Ventricular Ejection Time, VET, Pre-ejection Period and used to detect the impedance changes caused by a high-frequency, low magnitude current flowing through the thorax between additional two pairs of electrodes located outside of the measured segment. The sensing electrodes also detect the ECG signal, which is used as a timing clock of the system.&lt;ref name="What is TEB and how it works"&gt;[http://bomed.us/teb.html What is TEB and how it works]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Impedance cardiography (ICG), also referred to as electrical impedance plethysmography (EIP) or Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance (TEB) has been researched since the 1940s.  NASA helped develop the technology in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Kubicek W.G., Witsoe, D.A., Patterson, R.P., Mosharrata, M.A., Karnegis, J.N., From, A.H.L. (1967). Significant improvements of its clinical accuracy took place in the '80s at BoMed Medical Manufacturing LTD under B. Bo Sramek with the product NCCOM3. in 1992 the company was renamed to CDIC and product renamed to BioZ. Development and evaluation of an impedance cardiographic system to measure cardiac output and development of an oxygen consumption rate computing system utilizing a quadrupole mass spectrometer.  NASA-CR-92220, N68-32973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2001/hm1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of impedance cardiography in psychophysiological research was pioneered by the publication of an article by Miller and Horvath in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. C., &amp; Horvath, S. M. (1978). Impedance cardiography. ''Psychophysiology'', 15(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the recommendations of Miller and Horvath were confirmed by a standards group in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, A., Allen, M. T., Fahrenberg, J., Kelsey, R. M., Lovallo, W. R., &amp; van Doornen, L. J. (1990). Methodological guidelines for impedance cardiography. ''Psychophysiology'', 27(1), 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of references is available at [http://impedancecardiography.com/icgpub20.html ICG Publications].  With ICG, the placement of four dual disposable sensors on the neck and chest are used to transmit and detect electrical and impedance changes in the thorax, which are used to measure and calculate cardiodynamic parameters.

==How ICG Works==
* Four pairs of electrodes are placed at the neck and the diaphragm level, delineating the thorax
* High frequency, low magnitude current is transmitted through the chest in a direction parallel with the spine from the set of outside pairs&lt;ref name="What is TEB and how it works"/&gt;
* Current seeks path of least resistance: the blood filled [[aorta]] (the systolic phase signal) and both vena cava superior and inferior (the diastolic phase signal, mostly related to respiration)
* The inside pairs, placed at the anatomic landmarks delineating thorax, sense the impedance signals and the ECG signal
* ICG measures the baseline impedance (resistance) to this current
* With each [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]], blood volume and velocity in the aorta change
* ICG measures the corresponding change in impedance and its timing
* ICG attributes the changes in impedance to (a) the volumetric expansion of the aorta (this is the main difference between ICG and [[Electrical Cardiometry]]) and (b) to the blood velocity-caused alignment of erythrocytes as a function of blood velocity
* ICG uses the baseline and changes in impedance to measure and calculate [[hemodynamic]] parameters

==Hemodynamics==
{{Main|Hemodynamics}}

Hemodynamics is a subchapter of cardiovascular physiology, which is concerned with the forces generated by the heart and the resulting motion of blood through the cardiovascular system.&lt;ref name="milnor"&gt;WR Milnor: Hemodynamics, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; These forces demonstrate themselves to the clinician as '''paired''' values of '''blood flow and blood pressure''' measured '''simultaneously''' at the output node of the left heart. 
''Hemodynamics is a fluidic counterpart to the Ohm's Law in electronics: pressure is equivalent to voltage, flow to current, vascular resistance to electrical resistance and myocardial work to power.''

[[File:Relationship between Aortic Blood Pressure and Aortic Blood flow.png|thumbnail|Fig.1: Aortic blood pressure and aortic blood flow over one heartbeat interval: S = Systolic blood pressure; D = Diastolic blood pressure; MAP = Mean Arterial Pressure; SV = Stroke Volume; DN = dicrotic notch (aortic valve closure)]]
 
The relationship between the instantaneous values of aortic blood pressure and blood flow through the aortic valve over one heartbeat interval and their mean values are depicted in Fig.1. Their instantaneous values may be used in research; in clinical practice, their mean values, MAP and SV, are adequate.

=== Blood Flow Parameters ===

Systemic (global) '''blood flow parameters''' are '''(a)''' the blood flow per heartbeat, the '''Stroke Volume, SV''' [ml/beat], and '''(b)''' the blood flow per minute, the '''Cardiac Output, CO''' [l/min]. 
There is clear relationship between these blood flow parameters:
 '''CO'''&lt;sub&gt;[l/min]&lt;/sub&gt; '''= (SV'''&lt;sub&gt;[ml]&lt;/sub&gt; '''× HR'''&lt;sub&gt;[bpm]&lt;/sub&gt;''')/1000'''    {Eq.1}
where HR is the Heart Rate frequency (beats per minute, bpm).

Since the normal value of CO is proportional to body mass it has to perfuse, one "normal" value of SV and CO for all adults cannot exist. All blood flow parameters have to be indexed. The accepted convention is to index them by the '''Body Surface Area''', BSA [m²], by DuBois &amp; DuBois Formula, a function of height and weight:

 '''BSA'''&lt;sub&gt;[m²]&lt;/sub&gt; '''=''' '''W'''&lt;sup&gt;0.425&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[kg]&lt;/sub&gt; '''×''' '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;0.725&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[cm]&lt;/sub&gt; '''×''' '''0.007184'''     {Eq.2}

The resulting indexed parameters are '''Stroke Index, SI''' (ml/beat/m²) defined as
 '''SI'''&lt;sub&gt;[ml/beat/m²]&lt;/sub&gt; '''= SV'''&lt;sub&gt;[ml]&lt;/sub&gt;'''/BSA'''&lt;sub&gt;[m²]&lt;/sub&gt;         {Eq.3}

and '''Cardiac Index, CI''' (l/min/m²), defined as     
 '''CI'''&lt;sub&gt;[l/min/m²]&lt;/sub&gt; '''= CO'''&lt;sub&gt;[l/min]&lt;/sub&gt;'''/BSA'''&lt;sub&gt;[m²]&lt;/sub&gt;         {Eq.4}

These indexed blood flow parameters exhibit '''typical ranges''':

For the '''Stroke Index:'''  ''' 35 &lt; SI&lt;sub&gt;typical&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 65''' ml/beat/m²; for the '''Cardiac Index:''' '''2.8 &lt; CI&lt;sub&gt;typical&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 4.2 ''' l/min/m².

Eq.1 for indexed parameters then changes to
 '''CI'''&lt;sub&gt;[l/min/m²]&lt;/sub&gt; '''= (SI'''&lt;sub&gt;[ml/beat/m²]&lt;/sub&gt; '''× HR'''&lt;sub&gt;[bpm]&lt;/sub&gt;''')/1000'''       {Eq.1a}

=== Hemodynamics: The Dynamic Modulator of Oxygen Transport ===

The primary function of the cardiovascular system is transport of oxygen: blood is the vehicle, oxygen is the cargo. The task of the healthy cardiovascular system is to provide adequate perfusion to all organs and to maintain a dynamic equilibrium between oxygen demand and oxygen delivery. In a healthy patient, his or her cardiovascular system always increases blood flow in response to increased oxygen demand. However, in a hemodynamically compromised patient, when the system is unable to satisfy increased oxygen demand, the blood flow to organs lower on the oxygen delivery priority list is reduced and these organs may, eventually, fail. Digestive disorders, male impotence, tiredness, sleepwalking, environmental temperature intolerance, etc. are classical examples of a low-flow-state, resulting in reduced blood flow to the gut, sexual organs, skeletal muscles, skin, etc.

=== Hemodynamic Modulators ===

SI variability and MAP variability are accomplished through activity of '''hemodynamic modulators'''.

[[File:Frank-Starling Law and Inotropy.png|thumb|Fig.5: The Frank-Starling Law and Inotropy: Three Frank-Starling curves shown for normoinotropy, hyperinotropy and hypoinotropy. A patient, who is normovolemic and normoinotropic, exhibits normal level of Ejection Phase Contractility (EPC). However, a patient who is hypovolemic can exhibit the same normal level of EPC if given positive inotropes, and a patient who is volume overloaded (hypervolemic) can also have normal level of EPC if given negative inotropes]]
The conventional cardiovascular physiology terms for the hemodynamic modulators are '''preload, contractility and afterload'''. They deal with '''(a)''' the inertial filling forces of blood return into the atrium ('''preload'''), which stretch the myocardial fibers, thus storing energy in them, '''(b)''' the force by which the heart muscle fibers shorten thus releasing the energy stored in them in order to expel part of blood in the ventricle into the vasculature ('''contractility'''), and '''(c)''' the forces the pump has to overcome in order to deliver a bolus of blood into the aorta per each contraction ('''afterload'''). 
The level of preload is currently assessed either from the PAOP (pulmonary artery occluded pressure) in a catheterized patient, or from EDI (end-diastolic index) by use of ultrasound. Contractility is not routinely assessed; quite often inotropy and contractility are interchanged as equal terms. Afterload is assessed from the SVRI value.
[[File:Timing considerations of hemodynamic modulation.png|thumb|Fig.6: Timing considerations of working effects of preload, contractility (pharmacological = inotropes, and mechanical = Frank-Starling mechanism, i.e., effects of intravascular volume) and afterload in respect to Systolic and Diastolic Time Intervals: Diastole =&gt; Starts at S2-time, ends at Q-time. Systole =&gt; Isovolumic phase starts at Q-time, ends at AVO-time; Ejection phase starts at AVO-time, ends at S2-time. (S2 = 2nd heart sound = aortic valve closure; AVO = aortic valve opening)]]

Rather than using the terms preload, contractility and afterload, the '''preferential terminology and methodology in per-beat hemodynamics''' is to use the terms for actual hemodynamic modulating tools, which either the body utilizes or the clinician has in his toolbox to control the hemodynamic state:

The '''preload''' and the Frank-Starling '''(mechanically)-induced level of contractility''' is modulated by variation of '''intravascular volume''' (volume expansion or volume reduction/diuresis).

'''Pharmacological modulation of contractility''' is performed with cardioactive '''inotropic agents''' (positive or negative inotropes) being present in the blood stream and affecting the rate of contraction of myocardial fibers.

The '''afterload''' is modulated by varying the caliber of sphincters at the input and output of each organ, thus the '''vascular resistance''', with the '''vasoactive pharmacological agents''' (vasoconstrictors or vasodilators and/or ACE Inhibitors and/or ARBs)(ACE = Angiotensin-converting-enzyme; ARB = Angiotensin-receptor-blocker). ''Afterload also increases with increasing '''blood viscosity''', however, with the exception of extremely hemodiluted or hemoconcentrated patients, this parameter is not routinely considered in clinical practice.''

''Please note that with the exception of volume expansion, which can be accomplished only by physical means (intravenous or oral intake of fluids), all other hemodynamic modulating tools are pharmacological, cardioactive or vasoactive agents.''

The measurement of CI and its derivatives allow clinicians to make timely patient assessment, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions.  It has been well established that both trained and untrained physicians alike are unable to estimate cardiac output through physical assessment alone.

===Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring===
Clinical measurement of cardiac output has been available since the 1970s.  However, this blood flow measurement is highly invasive, utilizing a flow-directed, thermodilution catheter (also known as the Swan-Ganz catheter), which represents significant risks to the patient.  In addition, this technique is costly (several hundred dollars per procedure) and requires a skilled physician and a sterile environment for catheter insertion.  As a result, it has been used only in very narrow strata (less than 2%) of critically ill and high-risk patients in whom the knowledge of blood flow and oxygen transport outweighed the risks of the method. In the United States, it is estimated that at least two million pulmonary artery catheter monitoring procedures are performed annually, most often in peri-operative cardiac and vascular surgical patients, decompensated heart failure, multi-organ failure, and trauma.

===Noninvasive Hemodynamic Monitoring===
In theory, a noninvasive way to monitor hemodynamics would provide exceptional clinical value because data similar to invasive hemodynamic monitoring methods could be obtained with much lower cost and no risk.  While noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring can be used in patients who previously required an invasive procedure, the largest impact can be made in patients and care environments where invasive hemodynamic monitoring was neither possible nor worth the risk or cost.  Because of its safety and low cost, the applicability of vital hemodynamic measurements could be extended to significantly more patients, including outpatients with chronic diseases.  ICG has even been used in extreme conditions such as outer space and a Mt. Everest expedition.&lt;ref&gt;http://sdbj.com/news/2000/jan/10/local-biomed-device-aiding-nasa/&lt;/ref&gt; Heart failure, hypertension, pacemaker, and dyspnea patients are four conditions in which outpatient noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring can play an important role in the assessment, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.  Some studies have shown ICG cardiac output is accurate,&lt;ref&gt;http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/123/6/2028.short&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/13/6/469.full&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies have shown it is inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2720805 | pmid=19619697 | doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2009.06.002 | volume=158 | issue=2 | title=Correlation of impedance cardiography with invasive hemodynamic measurements in patients with advanced heart failure: the BioImpedance CardioGraphy (BIG) substudy of the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) Trial |date=August 2009 |vauthors=Kamath SA, Drazner MH, Tasissa G, Rogers JG, Stevenson LW, Yancy CW | journal=Am. Heart J. | pages=217–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of ICG has been shown to improve blood pressure control in resistant hypertension when used by both specialists &lt;ref&gt;http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/short/39/5/982&lt;/ref&gt; and general practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/short/47/4/771&lt;/ref&gt;  ICG has also been shown to predict worsening status in heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/47/11/2245&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICG Parameters==
The electrical and impedance signals are processed to determine fiducial points, which are then utilized to measure and calculate hemodynamic parameters, such as cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, thoracic fluid content, acceleration index, and systolic time ratio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4400">'''Individual Quick Freezing''' usually abbreviated '''IQF''' is a freezing method used in food processing industry. Products commonly frozen with IQF technologies are typically smaller pieces of food products and can range from all types of berries, fruits and vegetables diced or sliced, seafood such as shrimps and small fish, meat, poultry and even pasta, cheese and grains.&lt;ref&gt;Alfaro, Danilo. [http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/glossary/g/IQF.htm "IQF (Individually Quick Frozen)"], ''[[Culinary Arts]]''. August 26, 2016 Retrieved on July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Products that have been subjected to IQF are referred to as '''Individually Quick Frozen''' or '''IQF'd'''
 
==Benefits==
One of the main advantages of this method of preparing [[frozen food]] is that the freezing process takes only a few minutes. The exact time depends on the type of IQF freezer and the product. The short freezing prevents formation of large ice crystals in the product’s cells, which destroys the membrane structures at the molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica [https://global.britannica.com/topic/individually-quick-frozen-method "Individually quick-frozen method"],''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved on July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Pruthi, J. S. (1995). "Quick Freezing Preservation of Foods: Foods of animal origin", p.14. Allied Publishers Limited. {{ISBN|81-7023-962-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the product keep its shape, colour, smell and taste after defrost, at a far greater extent. 

Another significant advantage of IQF technology is its ability to separate units of the products during freezing, which produces higher quality product compared to block freezing. This advantage is also important for food sustainability, as the consumer can defrost and use the exact needed quantity.  
There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer with the help of a processing line belt or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer, the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. Product transportation inside the freezer is by different technologies. Some freezers use transportation belts similar to a conveyor belt. Others use bed plates that hold the product, and an asymmetrical movement makes the plate advance by itself through the freezer.&lt;ref name=Heldman1997&gt;Heldman, Dennis R. Hartel, Richard W (1997). "Principles of Food Processing", p. 123. Food Science Texts Series. {{ISBN|978-0-8342-1269-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Methods==
There are 2 main IQF technologies: mechanical IQF freezers and cryogenic IQF freezers. 

Mechanical IQF freezers work on the principle of cold air circulation, which flows from underneath the bed plate or transportation belt with the help of fans.&lt;ref name=Heldman1997 /&gt; The cold airflow keeps passing through the pieces of product in circular motions while the product is also advancing through the freezer towards the exit end. The design and efficiency of this type of IQF freezers varies among manufacturers who are trying to find the perfect balance of aerodynamics for an optimal freezing result. This technology has seen impressive improvements and developments during the past 20 years, being suited for an increasing range of products.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Randy [http://stellarfoodforthought.net/cryogenic-vs-mechanical-freezers-the-best-uses-for-each-method/ "Cryogenic vs. Mechanical Freezers: The Best Uses for Each Method"], ''[[Stellar Food For Thought]]''. February 18, 2016. Retrieved on July 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryogenic IQF freezers immerse the product in liquid nitrogen at very low temperatures, freezing it very rapidly while continuously moving the product to avoid block or lump formation.&lt;ref name=Peterson /&gt; Even though this method shows good freezing results, it might lead to higher processing costs per kg of product due to the large amount of higher cost [[liquid nitrogen]] required. 

A growing demand and interest in IQF products is registered at global level due to the higher quality of these products and to the practical benefits of having separately frozen pieces. IQF is also a common pre-treatment for [[freeze-drying]] food because both processes preserve the size, taste and cell structure of the food better than methods like traditional block freezing or air drying respectively.

'''Instron'''  (an [[ITW]] company) is a manufacturer of test equipment designed to evaluate the mechanical properties of materials and components, such as [[universal testing machine]]s.

In 1946, Harold Hindman and George Burr, who worked together at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), teamed up to determine the properties of new [[Textile|materials]] to be used in parachutes. Together, they designed a material testing machine based on [[strain gauge]] [[load cell]]s and servo-control systems. This led to the formation of '''Instron Engineering Corporation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GEORGE BURR, 86 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FEF6B04C79159EE&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=2003-11-20 |accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CEAST''' (Now operating within Instron) was founded in 1953 by Dr. Mario Grosso and focused initially on refurbishing instruments shipped from America through the [[Marshall plan]][http://www.instron.co.uk/wa/product/CEAST-Materials-Testing-Solutions.aspx?ref=http://www.google.co.uk/url]. Later, the company used its experience to develop polymer testing instruments. Today the company is based in Pianezza, [[Turin]], and specializes in [[Impact (mechanics)|impact]], [[rheology]] and [[Heat deflection temperature|HDT]]/[[Vicat softening point|Vicat]] testing of polymers, typically [[thermoplastics]]. In 2008 CEAST was acquired by Instron but continues to operate semi-autonomously.

'''Joint application design''' ('''JAD''') is a process used in the  life cycle area of the [[dynamic systems development method]] (DSDM) to collect business requirements while developing new [[information systems]] for a company.  "The JAD process also includes approaches for enhancing user participation, expediting development, and improving the quality of specifications."  It consists of a workshop where "[[knowledge workers]] and IT specialists meet, sometimes for several days, to define and review the business requirements for the system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haag |first1=Stephen |last2=Cummings |first2=Maeve |last3=McCubbrey |first3=Donald J. |year=2006 |title=Information Management Systems for the Information Age |chapter=Phase 2: Analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson |isbn=978-0-07-281947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attendees include high level management officials who will ensure the product provides the needed reports and information at the end. This acts as "a management process which allows Corporate Information Services (IS) departments to work more effectively with users in a shorter time frame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jennerich |first=Bill |title=Joint Application Design: Business Requirements Analysis for Successful Re-Engineering |date=November 1990 |accessdate=2009-02-06 |url=http://www.bee.net/bluebird/jaddoc.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221042620/http://www.bee.net/bluebird/jaddoc.htm |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through JAD workshops the knowledge workers and IT specialists are able to resolve any difficulties or differences between the two parties regarding the new information system.  The workshop follows a detailed agenda in order to guarantee that all uncertainties between parties are covered and to help prevent any miscommunications.  Miscommunications can carry far more serious repercussions if not addressed until later on in the process. (See below for Key Participants and Key Steps to an Effective JAD).  In the end, this process will result in a new information system that is feasible and appealing to both the designers and end users.  

"Although the JAD design is widely acclaimed, little is actually known about its effectiveness in practice."  According to the ''Journal of Systems and Software'', a field study was done at three organizations using JAD practices to determine how JAD influenced system development outcomes.  The results of the study suggest that organizations realized modest improvement in systems development outcomes by using the JAD method.  JAD use was most effective in small, clearly focused projects and less effective in large complex projects.    Since 2010, the International Association of Facilitators (IAF) has measured the significance of facilitated workshops, a la JAD, and found significant value.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Rush, 2013, "How Significant is the Value of Facilitation?"[http://mgrconsulting.com/index.php/facilitator-enewsletters/177-how-significant-is-the-value-of-facilitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Joint application is term originally used to describe a software development process pioneered and successfully deployed during the mid-1970s by the [[New York Telephone Company]]'s Systems Development Center under the direction of Dan Gielan. Following a series of remarkably successful implementations of this methodology, Gielan lectured extensively in various forums on the methodology, its benefits and best practices. of IBM Canada created and named JAD in 1974, or joint application design, as it is currently used in software development.  While working at IBM in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], Arnie Lind, a Senior Systems Engineer at the time, was searching for a better way to implement applications at IBM's customers.  The existing method entailed application developers spending months learning the specifics of a particular department or job function, and then developing an application for the function or department.  In addition to significant development backlog delays, this process resulted in applications taking years to develop, and often not being fully accepted by the application users.

Arnie Lind's idea was simple: rather than have application developers learn about people's jobs, why not teach the people doing the work how to write an application?  Arnie pitched the concept to IBM Canada's Vice President Carl Corcoran (later President of IBM Canada), and Carl approved a pilot project.  Arnie and Carl together named the methodology JAD, an acronym for joint application design, after Carl Corcoran rejected the acronym JAL, or joint application logistics, upon realizing that Arnie Lind's initials were JAL (John Arnold Lind).

The pilot project was an emergency room project for the Saskatchewan Government.  Arnie developed the JAD methodology, and put together a one-week seminar, involving primarily nurses and administrators from the emergency room, but also including some application development personnel.  The project was a huge success, as the one-week seminar produced a detailed application framework, which was then coded and implemented in less than one month, versus an average of 18 months for traditional application development.  And because the users themselves designed the system, they immediately adopted and liked the application.  After the pilot project, IBM was very supportive of the JAD methodology, as they saw it as a way to more quickly implement computing applications, running on IBM hardware.

Arnie Lind spent the next 13 years at IBM Canada continuing to develop the JAD methodology, and traveling around the world performing JAD seminars, and training IBM employees in the methods and techniques of JAD.  JADs were performed extensively throughout IBM Canada, and the technique also spread to IBM in the United States.  Arnie Lind trained several people at IBM Canada to perform JADs, including Tony Crawford and Chuck Morris.  Arnie Lind retired from IBM in 1987, and continued to teach and perform JADs on a consulting basis, throughout Canada, the United States, and Asia.

The JAD process was formalized by Tony Crawford and Chuck Morris of IBM in the late 1970s. It was then deployed at Canadian International Paper.  JAD was used in IBM Canada for a while before being brought back to the US. Initially, IBM used JAD to help sell and implement a software program they sold, called COPICS.  It was widely adapted to many uses (system requirements, grain elevator design, problem-solving, etc.).  Tony Crawford later developed JAD-Plan and then JAR (joint application requirements).  In 1985, Gary Rush wrote about JAD and its derivations – Facilitated Application Specification Techniques (FAST) –  in Computerworld.&lt;ref&gt;"A FAST Way to Define System Requirements", by Gary Rush, Computerworld, Volume 19 Number 40, In Depth pages ID/11 to ID/16 (pages 47 to 52), October 7, 1985. Transcript [http://www.mgrconsulting.com/index.php/gary-rush-mgr-consulting-facilitator-training-facilitation/fast-way-to-define here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, JAD was designed to bring system developers and users of varying backgrounds and opinions together in a productive as well as creative environment. The meetings were a way of obtaining quality requirements and specifications. The structured approach provides a good alternative to traditional serial interviews by system analysts.  JAD has since expanded to cover broader IT work as well as non-IT work (read about Facilitated Application Specification Techniques – FAST – created by Gary Rush in 1985 to expand JAD applicability.&lt;ref&gt;JAD | FAST | FoCuSeD™ Structured Facilitation Technique[http://mgrconsulting.com/index.php/gary-rush-mgr-consulting-facilitator-training-facilitation].)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key participants==
'''Executive Sponsor''': The executive who charters the project, the system owner. They must be high enough in the organization to be able to make decisions and provide the necessary strategy, planning, and direction.

'''Subject Matter Experts''': These are the business users, the IS professionals, and the outside experts that will be needed for a successful workshop. This group is the backbone of the meeting; they will drive the changes.

'''Facilitator/Session Leader''': meeting and directs traffic by keeping the group on the meeting agenda. The facilitator is responsible for identifying those issues that can be solved as part of the meeting and those which need to be assigned at the end of the meeting for follow-up investigation and resolution. The facilitator serves the participants and does not contribute information to the meeting.

'''Scribe/Modeller/Recorder/Documentation Expert''': Records and publish the proceedings of the meeting and does not contribute information to the meeting. 

'''Observers''': Generally members of the application development team assigned to the project. They are to sit behind the participants and are to silently observe the proceedings.

==9 key steps==
#'''Identify project objectives and limitations''': It is vital to have clear objectives for the workshop and for the project as a whole. The pre-workshop activities, the planning and scoping, set the expectations of the workshop sponsors and participants. Scoping identifies the business functions that are within the scope of the project. It also tries to assess both the project design and implementation complexity. The political sensitivity of the project should be assessed. Has this been tried in the past? How many false starts were there? How many implementation failures were there? Sizing is important. For best results, systems projects should be sized so that a complete design – right down to screens and menus – can be designed in 8 to 10 workshop days.
#'''Identify critical success factors''': It is important to identify the critical success factors for both the development project and the business function being studied. How will we know that the planned changes have been effective? How will success be measured? Planning for outcomes assessment helps to judge the effectiveness and the quality of the implemented system over its entire operational life.
#'''Define project deliverables''': In general, the deliverables from a workshop are documentation and a design. It is important to define the form and level of detail of the workshop documentation. What types of diagrams will be provided? What type or form of narrative will be supplied? It is a good idea to start using a [[Computer-aided_software_engineering |CASE]] tool for diagramming support right from the start. Most of the available tools have good to great diagramming capabilities but their narrative support is generally weak. The narrative is best produced with your standard word processing software.
#'''Define the schedule of workshop activities''': Workshops vary in length from one to five days. The initial workshop for a project should not be less than three days. It takes the participants most of the first day to get comfortable with their roles, with each other, and with the environment. The second day is spent learning to understand each other and developing a common language with which to communicate issues and concerns. By the third day, everyone is working together on the problem and real productivity is achieved. After the initial workshop, the team-building has been done. Shorter workshops can be scheduled for subsequent phases of the project, for instance, to verify a prototype. However, it will take the participants from one to three hours to re-establish the team psychology of the initial workshop.
#'''Select the participants''': These are the business users, the IT professionals, and the outside experts that will be needed for a successful workshop. These are the true "back bones" of the meeting who will drive the changes.
#'''Prepare the workshop material''': Before the workshop, the project manager and the facilitator perform an analysis and build a preliminary design or straw man to focus the workshop. The workshop material consists of documentation, worksheets, diagrams, and even props that will help the participants understand the business function under investigation.
#'''Organize workshop activities and exercises''': The facilitator must design workshop exercises and activities to provide interim deliverables that build towards the final output of the workshop. The pre-workshop activities help design those workshop exercises. For example, for a Business Area Analysis, what's in it? A decomposition diagram? A high-level entity-relationship diagram? A normalized data model? A state transition diagram? A dependency diagram? All of the above? None of the above? It is important to define the level of technical diagramming that is appropriate to the environment. The most important thing about a diagram is that it must be understood by the users. Once the diagram choice is made, the facilitator designs exercises into the workshop agenda to get the group to develop those diagrams. A workshop combines exercises that are serially oriented to build on one another, and parallel exercises, with each sub-team working on a piece of the problem or working on the same thing for a different functional area. High-intensity exercises led by the facilitator energize the group and direct it towards a specific goal. Low-intensity exercises allow for detailed discussions before decisions. The discussions can involve the total group or teams can work out the issues and present a limited number of suggestions for the whole group to consider. To integrate the participants, the facilitator can match people with similar expertise from different departments. To help participants learn from each other, the facilitator can mix the expertise. It's up to the facilitator to mix and match the sub-team members to accomplish the organizational, cultural, and political objectives of the workshop. A workshop operates on both the technical level and the political level. It is the facilitator's job to build consensus and communications, to force issues out early in the process. There is no need to worry about the technical implementation of a system if the underlying business issues cannot be resolved.
#'''Prepare, inform, educate the workshop participants''': All of the participants in the workshop must be made aware of the objectives and limitations of the project and the expected deliverables of the workshop. Briefing of participants should take place 1 to 5 days before the workshop. This briefing may be teleconferenced if participants are widely dispersed. The briefing document might be called the Familiarization Guide, Briefing Guide, Project Scope Definition, or the Management Definition Guide – or anything else that seems appropriate. It is a document of eight to twelve pages, and it provides a clear definition of the scope of the project for the participants. The briefing itself lasts two to four hours. It provides the psychological preparation everyone needs to move forward into the workshop.
#'''Coordinate workshop logistics''': Workshops should be held off-site to avoid interruptions. Projectors, screens, PCs, tables, markers, masking tape, Post-It notes, and lots of other props should be prepared. What specific facilities and props are needed is up to the facilitator. They can vary from simple flip charts to electronic white boards. In any case, the layout of the room must promote the communication and interaction of the participants.

==Advantages==
* JAD decreases time and costs associated with requirements elicitation process. During 2-4 weeks information not only is collected, but requirements, agreed upon by various system users, are identified. Experience with JAD allows companies to customize their systems analysis process into even more dynamic ones like [[Double Helix Methodology|Double Helix]], a methodology for mission-critical work.
* JAD sessions help bring experts together giving them a chance to share their views, understand views of others, and develop the sense of project ownership.
* The methods of JAD implementation are well-known, as it is "the first accelerated design technique available on the market and probably best known", and can easily be applied by any organization.
* Easy integration of CASE tools into JAD workshops improves session productivity and provides systems analysts with discussed and ready to use models.

==Challenges==

* Without multifaceted preparation for a JAD session, professionals' valuable time can be easily wasted. If JAD session organizers do not study the elements of the system being evaluated, an incorrect problem could be addressed, incorrect people could be invited to participate, and inadequate problem-solving resources could be used.
* JAD workshop participants should include employees able to provide input on most, if not all, of the pertinent areas of the problem. This is why particular attention should be paid during participant selection. The group should consist not only of employees from various departments who will interact with the new system, but from different hierarchies of the organizational ladder. The participants may have conflicting points of view, but meeting will allow participants to see issues from different viewpoints. JAD brings to light a better model outline with better understanding of underlying processes.
* The facilitator has an obligation to ensure all participants{{snd}} not only the most vocal ones{{snd}} have a chance to offer their opinions, ideas, and thoughts.

The '''League of Professional System Administrators''' ('''LOPSA'''), founded in 2004, is a professional association for [[system administrators|IT Administrators]].

==History and Formation==
Originally, the corporation was created as "The System Administrators Guild, Inc" in July 2004 by volunteers of the [[USENIX Association]] as part of a plan to spin off its [[SAGE (organization)|SAGE]] Special Technical Group into a separate organization. After the spin-off from the USENIX Association was halted in November 2005, the volunteers involved in the spin-off opted to move forward as a new organization which was renamed LOPSA, and began reorganizing itself into an independent entity.

==Scope and Operations==
The organization's mission is "to advance the practice of system administration; to support, recognize, educate, and encourage its practitioners; and to serve the public through education and outreach on system administration issues".

LOPSA has several ongoing programs that it uses to further its mission.

===Mentorship===
The LOPSA [https://mentor.lopsa.org/ mentorship program] was conceived in 2010 as a way to network inexperienced system administrators with senior members of the organization who could help them on project-related topics. As of January 2013, the mentorship program accepts ongoing, rather than project-based, projects.&lt;ref&gt;https://lopsa.org/content/january-2013-lopsagram{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protege status is open to any system administrator irrespective of membership in LOPSA, while mentor status requires an active membership in the organization.

===WiAC Scholarship===
There is a well-recognized disparity between men and women in [[STEM fields]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/67YOr88gp?url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html&lt;/ref&gt; LOPSA provides an annual stipend for one woman to attend the USENIX [https://www.usenix.org/conference/wiac13 Women in Advanced Computing] (WiAC) Summit. The recipient is chosen through an essay contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lopsa.org/content/wiac13-announce |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130624183122/https://lopsa.org/content/wiac13-announce |archivedate=2013-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional Conferences===
LOPSA has formed multiple local chapters in cities in throughout the United States. Two LOPSA chapters have formed regionally-targeted system administration conferences.
* [http://www.casitconf.org/ Cascadia IT Conference] in [[Seattle, Washington]]

===Training and Tutorials===
[[File:System Administration Conference Booth.jpg|right|thumb|System Administrators gather at an information booth for LOPSA at a conference.]]

==Organizational Structure==
The organization is a 501c3 not-for-profit group, and is governed by a nine-member [[Board of Directors]]. The first board was elected in July 2005 by the membership of SAGE. Elections are held each year for either four or five Board members, with each election term being for two years.

LOPSA is headquartered in [[Mount Laurel, New Jersey]].

==Chapters and Affiliations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lopsa.org/Chapters|title=LOPSA - Chapters|website=lopsa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
LOPSA fosters community through local chapters and affiliation with and support for other local groups.

Thus, the [[Decision altitude|Decision Altitude]], DA, can be as low as 200 feet.  An LPV approach is an approach with vertical guidance, APV, to distinguish it from a precision approach, PA, or a non-precision approach, NPA.  WAAS criteria includes a vertical alarm limit more than 12 m, but less than 50 m, yet an LPV does not meet the [[ICAO]] Annex 10 precision approach standard.&lt;ref name="FAA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Instrument Procedures Handbook, FAA-H-8083-16B |date=2017 |publisher=US Dept. of Transportation, FAA Flight Standards Service |page=G-6,4-26,4-50 |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/instrument_procedures_handbook/media/FAA-H-8083-16B.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Examples of receivers providing LPV capability include (from [[Garmin]]) the GTN 7xx &amp; 6xx, GNS 480, GNS 430W &amp; 530W, and the post 2007 [[Garmin G1000]] with GIA 63W.

== History ==
[[File:Detector magnetico Marconi 1902 - Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|One of the first prototype magnetic detectors built by Marconi in 1902, in Milan museum]]
[[Image:Radio_MARCONI.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Recreation of a Marconi ship radio room at the Aalborg Maritime Museum, Aalborg, Denmark. A magnetic detector is on the desk to right of the Marconi tuner receiver, which provided the signal for the magnetic detector.]]

The primitive [[spark gap transmitter|spark gap radio transmitters]] used during the first three decades of radio (1886-1916) could not transmit [[audio signal|audio]] (sound) and instead transmitted information by [[wireless telegraphy]]; the operator switched the transmitter on and off with a [[telegraph key]], creating pulses of radio waves to spell out text messages in [[Morse code]].  So the radio receiving equipment of the time did not have to convert the radio waves into sound like modern receivers, but merely detect the presence or absence of the radio signal.   The device that did this was called a [[detector (radio)|detector]].  The first widely used detector was the [[coherer]], invented in 1890.

[[Ernest Rutherford]] had first used the [[hysteresis]] of iron to detect Hertzian waves in 1896&lt;ref name="Rutherford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the demagnetization of an iron needle when a radio signal passed through a coil around the needle, however the needle had to be remagnetized so this was not suitable for a continuous detector.&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt;  Many other wireless researchers such as E. Wilson, C. Tissot,  [[Reginald Fessenden]], [[John Ambrose Fleming]],  [[Lee De Forest]], J.C. Balsillie, and L. Tieri  had subsequently devised detectors based on hysteresis, but none had become widely used due to various drawbacks.&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt;  Many earlier versions had a rotating magnet above a stationary iron band with coils on it.&lt;ref name="Phillips1"&gt;[http://www.acrayara.com.ar/biblioteca/public/Historia/Early%20Radio%20Wave%20Detectors%20-%20Vivian%20J.%20Philips%20(1980).pdf   Phillips (1980) ''Early radio wave detectors'', p. 103-105]&lt;/ref&gt; This type was only periodically sensitive, when the magnetic field was changing, which occurred as the magnetic poles passed the iron.

During his transatlantic radio communication experiments in December 1902 [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] found the [[coherer]] to be too unreliable and insensitive for detecting the very weak radio signals from long distance transmissions. It was this need that drove him to develop his magnetic detector.  Marconi devised a more effective configuration with a moving iron band driven by a clockwork motor passing by stationary magnets and coils, resulting in a continuous supply of iron that was changing magnetization, and thus continuous sensitivity (Rutherford claimed he had also invented this configuration).&lt;ref name="Phillips1" /&gt;   The Marconi magnetic detector was the "official" detector used by the [[Marconi Company]] from 1902 through 1912, when the company began converting to the [[Fleming valve]] and [[Audion]]-type vacuum tubes. It was used through 1918.

== Description ==
[[File:Marconi magnetic detector scheme.jpg|right|333px|thumb|(A) Antenna wire,  (B,B) Iron band around pulleys, (C, C) RF excitation winding on glass tube through which the iron band travels, (D) Audio pickup winding, (E) Ground-plate,  (S, N) Permanent magnets,  (T) Telephone receiver.]]

See drawing at right.  The Marconi version consisted of an endless iron band (''B'') built up of 70 strands of number 40 gage silk-covered [[iron]] [[wire]]. In operation, the band passes over two grooved pulleys rotated by a wind-up [[clockwork]] motor.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The iron band passes through the center of a glass tube which is close wound with a single layer along several millimeters with number 36 gage silk-covered [[copper]] wire.  This coil (''C'') functions as the [[radio frequency]] excitation coil.  Over this winding is a small bobbin wound with wire of the same gauge to a [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of about 140 [[ohm]]s.  This coil (''D'') functions as the [[sound|audio]] pickup coil.  Around these coils two permanent [[horseshoe magnet]]s are arranged to [[magnetization|magnetize]] the iron band as it passes through the glass tube.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

== How it works ==
The device works by [[magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]] of the magnetization in the iron wires.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;  The [[permanent magnet]]s are arranged to create two opposite [[magnetic field]]s each directed toward (or away) from the center of the coils in opposite directions along the wire.  This functions to magnetize the iron band along its axis, first in one direction as it approaches the center of the coils, then reverse its magnetism to the opposite direction as it leaves from the other side of the coil.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;  Due to the hysteresis ([[coercivity]]) of the iron, a certain threshold magnetic field (the [[coercive field]], ''H''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is required to reverse the magnetization.   So the magnetization in the moving wires does not reverse in the center of the device where the field reverses, but some way toward the departing side of the wires, when the field of the second magnet reaches ''H''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;   Although the wire itself is moving through the coil, in the absence of a radio signal the location where the magnetization "flips" is stationary with respect to the pickup coil, so there is no flux change and no voltage is induced in the pickup coil.

The radio signal from the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] (''A'') is received by a tuner (''not shown'') and passed through the excitation coil ''C'', the other end of which is connected to [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] (''E'').&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;  The rapidly reversing magnetic field from the coil exceeds the coercivity ''H''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and cancels the hysteresis of the iron, causing the magnetization change to suddenly move up the wire to the center, between the magnets, where the field reverses.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;  This had an effect similar to thrusting a magnet into the coil, causing the magnetic flux through the pickup coil ''D'' to change, inducing a current pulse in the pickup coil.  The audio pickup coil is connected to a telephone receiver ([[earphone]]) (''T'') which converts the current pulse to [[sound]].&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

The radio signal from a spark gap transmitter consisted of pulses of radio waves ([[damped wave]]s) which repeated at an audio rate, around several hundred per second.  Each pulse of radio waves produced a pulse of current in the earphone,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; so the signal sounded like a musical tone or buzz in the earphone.

== Technical details ==
[[Image:Marconi magnetic detector.jpg|thumb|Magnetic detector in use]]

The iron band was turned by a [[mainspring]] and clockwork mechanism inside the case.  Differing values have been given for the speed of the band, from 1.6 to 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm per second; the device could probably function over a wide range of band speeds.&lt;ref name="Phillips1" /&gt;  The operator had to keep the mainspring wound up, using a crank on the side.  Operators would sometimes forget to wind it, so the band would stop turning and the detector stop working, sometimes in the middle of a radio message.

The detector produced [[electronic noise]] that was heard in the earphone as a "hissing" or "roaring" sound in the background, somewhat fatiguing to listen to.&lt;ref name="Phillips2"&gt;[http://www.acrayara.com.ar/biblioteca/public/Historia/Early%20Radio%20Wave%20Detectors%20-%20Vivian%20J.%20Philips%20(1980).pdf   Phillips (1980) ''Early radio wave detectors'', p. 98, 102, 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was [[Barkhausen noise]] due to the [[Barkhausen effect]] in the iron.&lt;ref name="Phillips2" /&gt;  As the magnetic field in a given area of the iron wire changed as it moved through the detector, the microscopic [[domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]]s between [[magnetic domain]]s in the iron moved in a series of jerks, as they got hung up on defects in the iron crystal lattice, then pulled free.  Each jerk produced a tiny change in the magnetic field through the coil, and induced a pulse of noise.

Because the output was an audio alternating current and not a direct current, the detector could only be used with earphones and not with the common recording instrument used in coherer radiotelegraphy receivers, the siphon paper tape recorder.&lt;ref name="Fleming2"&gt;{{cite book

From a technical standpoint, several subtle prerequisites are necessary for operation.  The strength of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets at the iron band must be of the same order of magnitude as the strength of the field generated by the radio frequency excitation coil, allowing the radio frequency signal to exceed the threshold hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron.  Also, the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the tuner that supplies the radio signal must be low to [[impedance match|match]] the low impedance of the excitation coil, requiring special tuner design considerations. The impedance of the telephone earphone must roughly match the impedance of the audio pickup coil, which is a few hundred ohms.  The iron band moves a few millimeters per second.  The magnetic detector was much more sensitive than the [[coherer]]s commonly in use at the time,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; although not as sensitive as the [[Fleming valve]], which began to replace it around 1912.&lt;ref name="Wenaas" /&gt;

In the ''Handbook Of Technical Instruction For Wireless Telegraphists'' by: J. C. Hawkhead (Second Edition Revised by H. M. Dowsett) on pp 175 are detailed instructions and specifications for operation and maintenance of Marconi's magnetic detector.

A '''makeup brush''' is a tool with [[bristle]]s, used for the application of [[cosmetics|makeup]] or [[face painting]]. The bristles may be made out of natural or synthetic materials, while the handle is usually made out of plastic or wood. When cosmetics are applied using the appropriate brush, they blend better into the skin.

There is a large variety of shapes and sizes of makeup brushes, depending on the face area where makeup will be applied, the cosmetic product and the wanted result. For example, the shape of the brush tip can be chiseled, straight, angular, round, flat or tapered.

==Types of makeup brushes (by area of application)==

===Face===
[[File:Makeup-brush-tips.jpg|thumb|Makeup brush tips used for face makeup]]
* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] brush - long, flat bristles and tapered tip&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/makeup-brushes-and-their-uses.html|title=A Girl's Style Guide to Makeup Brushes and Their Uses|work=BeautiSecrets|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Face powder|Powder]] brush - fluffy bristles; soft, full and rounded
* Fan Brush - It is used dust off any fall outs and also to apply highlighter on the highest points of the face. A large fan brush is usually made out of natural fibers and is fanned out 180 degrees that covers a large perimeter of the face.
* Blush brush - fine bristles and rounded head
* Bronzer brush - It is made with natural bristles and is fluffy in shape. It applies powder bronzer beautifully and distributes the product evenly on the skin. One can also use this brush to apply face powders if one finds a normal powder brush too big to use.
* Concealer brush - soft and flat with a pointed tip and a wide base
* [[Kabuki brush]] - There are 2 types : Flat Top and Angled. Both types are densely packed. It best applies liquid foundations and it provides full coverage. 
* Duo-fiber multipurpose brush - flat, circular and feathery head
* Mineral powder brush - thick and rounded
* Face contour brush - slanted and rounded for cheekbones
* Face sponge - varied shape, sponge texture (use wet or dry)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/how-to/a40310/makeup-brushes-how-to/|title=12 Makeup Brushes You Actually Need and Exactly How to Use Them|date=2018-02-08|work=Cosmopolitan|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-US}} &lt;/ref&gt;
* Highlighter Brush - This brush is usually made out of natural bristles and is considerably small in size. The tapered but elongated bristles makes it perfect to apply powder highlighter on the highest points of the face. The tapered bristles while applying makes it evenly distributed on the skin. 
* Blending Brush - Blending brushes are made using natural bristles and is fluffy in appearance. It is used to blend out any harsh edges for a seamless effect. It works best with powder products because of the natural fibers.

===Eyes===
* [[Eyeshadow]] brushes:
** Flat shader eye brush - This brush can be made either with synthetic or natural fibers and is flat in shape. It is used to pack on powder and cream eyeshadows evenly on the lid area. 
** Angled shader brush - This brush is made out of natural fibers and it has an angle to it. It is used to apply darker shades on the outer corner for a more detailed look. 
** Fluffy blending brush - Usually blending brushes are made using natural bristles and is fluffy in appearance. It is used to blend out any harsh edges for a seamless effect. It works best with powder products because of the natural fibers. 
** Crease brush - This brush can be made either with natural or synthetic bristles and has a tapered cut to it. It is much smaller than the previous blending brush and it beautifully blends out the crease color without moving it too much. 
** Pencil brush - This brush is a much smaller version of the previous blending brush and it is usually made with natural fibers. The pencil brush can be used to add colors to smaller areas and also to blend them in without spreading the pigments too much. One can also add browbone and inner corner highlights it works well with powders. 
* Pointed eyeliner brush -  It is made out of synthetic fibers and has a tapered end to it with barely any bristles which helps with the sharpest winged eyeliner.
* Smudger brush - This brush is made out of natural bristles for even application and is best used with powders and creams.
* Mascara wand (usually comes with the mascara)
* Eyebrow brush - long, thin with tougher bristles
* Lash and brow comb - Keep the brow hairs in place using the brow comb and the lash comb helps remove mascara clumping together on the lashes to get rid of the spidery lashes.
* Duo brow brush - This is a multitasking brush as you can line your upper lash line using the angled end and also fill in your eyebrows. This brush is usually made using synthetic bristles. It could be used with powders, liquids and creams. The spoolie end of this brush helps with blending in the brow product to make it look as natural as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://makeupmartini.com/ultimate-guide-makeup-brushes-uses/|title=The Ultimate Makeup Guide Part 2 - Makeup Brushes 101|date=2016-05-19|work=MakeUpMartini|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lips===
* Lip Liner Brush - This brush is little bigger than the fine liner brush and is used to get a crisp outline on the lips.
* Lip Brush - This brush is used to fill in the lips using the lip color of one’s choice and it provides an even application.
* Lip Gloss brush (usually comes with the lip gloss)

==Types of makeup brush bristles==
Makeup application can alter due to the materials used to create a brush. The bristles of a makeup brush can either be synthetic or natural. The brush itself is important to the application of makeup as it can densely pack on product or loosely pack on product.

===Synthetic bristles===
Synthetic bristles are the most common material used in makeup brushes. These brushes are widely found in drugstores and makeup-specific stores. The bristles are made out of plastic, [[nylon]], or other synthetic fibers, and may be dyed. Synthetic bristles are often used with liquid and cream products, as they tend to blend out products more easily and will not absorb product as much as a natural bristle brush.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotashi.com/jetaime/?p=1523|title=Making The Switch: Why Synthetic Makeup Brushes Are Better Than Natural Hair Brushes – Je t'aime by Hotashi|website=www.hotashi.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic brushes are cruelty-free. Synthetic brushes usually last longer than natural haired bristles as they do not degrade and are not as fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kjbennett.com/makeup-brush-buying-guide/|title=The Makeup Brush Buying Guide|date=2013-05-12|newspaper=Kevin James Bennett|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural bristles===
The natural bristles are often dark in color, not super soft, sheds, hold pigments better and difficult to wash. As the natural bristles are very porous they pick up more pigments and distributes them evenly. The natural bristled brushes best applies powder products and it is best to avoid liquid or cream products as they will drink up most of the products. Although natural bristles are more preferred in the cosmetic industry, the bristles themselves can cause allergic reactions to the animal hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/66523-what-kind-of-makeup-brush-should-you-use-heres-the-difference-between-synthetic-and-natural-brushes|title=What Kind Of Makeup Brush Should You Use? Here's The Difference Between Synthetic And Natural Brushes|last=Erdogan|first=Melodi|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Natural bristles may more easily control the product when blending out or even packing on a product, because they have hair cuticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hair-and-makeup-artist.com/makeup-brush-construction/|title=A Guide to Makeup Brush Construction - Hair and Makeup Artist Handbook|date=2012-08-31|newspaper=Hair and Makeup Artist Handbook|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Moondial queens college.jpg|right|thumb|Moondial at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], showing the table of corrections for the phase of the moon]]

'''Moondials''' are time pieces similar to a [[sundial]]. The most basic moondial, which is identical to a sundial, is only accurate on the night of the [[full moon]]. Every night after it becomes an additional (on average)&lt;ref group="note" name="avg"&gt;The Moon's orbit is not circular, so it does not move around the Earth at a uniform rate. Thus while the average difference between moonrises is 48 minutes, the actual time can vary considerably (roughly 20min to 1hr50min depending on the time of year and the location of the Moon in its orbit). The time read by a moondial will also vary in a similar, though not so drastic manner.
&lt;/ref&gt; 48 minutes slow, while every night preceding the full moon it is (again on average)&lt;ref group="note" name="avg"/&gt; 49 minutes fast, assuming there is even enough [[light]] to take a reading by. Thus, one week to either side of the full moon the moondial will read 5 hours and 36 minutes before or after the proper time. {{fact|date=February 2017}}

More advanced moondials can include charts showing the exact calculations to get the correct time, as well as dials designed with latitude and longitude in mind.

Moondials are very closely associated with lunar gardening (night-blooming plants) and some comprehensive gardening books may mention them.

'''Moving bed biofilm reactor''' ('''MBBR''') is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] process that was first invented by Prof. [[Hallvard Ødegaard]] at [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ødegaard|first=H.|last2=Rusten|first2=B.|last3=Westrum|first3=T.|date=1994-10-01|title=A new moving bed biofilm reactor - applications and results|url=http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/29/10-11/157|journal=Water Science and Technology|language=en|volume=29|issue=10-11|pages=157–165|issn=0273-1223}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commercialized by Kaldnes Miljöteknologi (now called AnoxKaldnes and owned by [[Veolia Water|Veolia Water Technologies]]). There are over 700 wastewater treatment systems&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vann- og Avløpsteknikk|last=Ødegaard|first=Hallvard|publisher=Norsk Vann|year=2012|isbn=9788241403361|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (both municipal and industrial) installed in over 50 countries. Currently, there are various suppliers of MBBR systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBLA8y6GGAMC|title=Handbook of Biological Wastewater Treatment: Design and Optimisation of Activated Sludge Systems|last=Haandel|first=Adrianus C. van|last2=Lubbe|first2=J. G. M. van der|date=2012-01-01|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=9781780400006|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process description ==

=== Overview ===
The MBBR system consists of an aeration tank (similar to an [[activated sludge]] tank) with special plastic carriers that provide a surface where a [[biofilm]] can grow. The carriers are made of a material with a density close to the density of water (1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). An example is high-density polyethylene (HDPE) which has a density close to 0.95 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The carriers will be mixed in the tank by the aeration system and thus will have good contact between the substrate in the influent wastewater and the biomass on the carriers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To prevent the plastic carriers from escaping the aeration it is necessary to have a sieve on the outlet of the tank.

=== Advantages ===
The MBBR system is considered a biofilm process. Other conventional biofilm processes for wastewater treatment are called [[trickling filter]], [[Rotating biological contactor|rotating biological contactor (RBC)]] and biological aerated filter (BAF). Biofilm processes in general require less space than [[activated sludge]] systems because the biomass is more concentrated, and the efficiency of the system is less dependent on the final sludge separation. A disadvantage with other biofilm processes is that they experience [[bioclogging]] and build-up of headloss. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

MBBR systems don't need a recycling of the sludge, which is the case with activated sludge systems.

The MBBR system is often installed as a retrofit of existing activated sludge tanks to increase the capacity of the existing system. The degree of filling of carriers can be adapted to the specific situation and the desired capacity. Thus an existing treatment plant can increase its capacity without increasing the footprint by constructing new tanks.

When constructing the filling degree can be set to, for example, 40% in the beginning, and later be increased to 70% by filling more carriers. Examples of situations can be population increase in a city for a municipal wastewater treatment plant or increased wastewater production from an industrial factory.

Some other advantages compared to activated sludge systems are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KVKMAEACAAJ|title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Resource Recovery |last=Burton |first=Franklin |last2=Tchobanoglous |first2=George |last3=Tsuchihashi |first3=Ryujiro |last4=Stensel |first4=H.

* Higher effective sludge retention time (SRT) which is favorable for [[nitrification]]
* Responds to load fluctuations without operator intervention
* Lower sludge production
* Less area required
* Resilient to toxic shock
* Process performance independent of secondary clarifier (due to the fact that there is no sludge return line)

To portray the unusual, often confused worldview of lead character Elliot Alderson, [[Franklin P. Peterson|Franklin Peterson]], who edited three ''Mr. Robot'' episodes in the first season and six in the second season, used creative editing styles that included jump cuts, varied lengths of takes and shuffling scenes around within an episode and sometimes even between episodes. Esmail encouraged the experimentation as Peterson and his team explored the personality of each character in the editing suite, finding creative ways to tell their stories and maintain their humanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Season 1====
The first season of ''Mr. Robot'' received critical acclaim. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a rating of 98%, based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.36/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Mr. Robot'' is a suspenseful cyber-thriller with timely stories and an intriguing, provocative premise."&lt;ref name=RTS01&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. Robot: Season 1 (2015)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/mr-robot/s01/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set a record on Rotten Tomatoes as the only show to earn perfect episode scores for an entire season since the site began tracking television episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zap2it.com/2015/09/mr-robot-rotten-tomatoes-record-episode-ratings/ |title='Mr. Robot' sets Rotten Tomatoes record |first=Andrea |last=Reiher |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |date=September 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 79 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-robot |title=Mr. Robot : Season 1 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' gave it a very positive review, writing, "''Mr. Robot'' has one of the best kick-offs to any series in a while" and that it "could be the series that finally, after years of ignorance, puts a deserving network among the likes of [[HBO]], [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] in terms of acclaim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillbarr/2015/05/27/mr-robot-usa-review/ |title='Mr. Robot' Review: The Best Show Of The Summer And On Track To Be A Modern Classic |work=[[Forbes]] |first=Merrill |last=Barr |date=May 27, 2015 |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Alessandra Stanley]] noted that "[[Occupy Wall Street]], the protest movement that erupted in 2011, didn’t do much to curb the financial industry. It didn’t die out, though. It went Hollywood", before finding ''Mr. Robot'' to be, "an intriguing new series&amp;nbsp;... a cyber-age thriller infused with a dark, almost nihilistic pessimism about the Internet, capitalism and income inequality.

Although Hogan found too much attention was devoted to Elliot's social anxiety, he eventually decided that "this alienated anti-hero was a brilliant, boldly complex character." Overall, Hogan concluded that the show deserved to find an audience in the UK.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 16 October 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hogan |first=Michael |title=Mr Robot, review: 'edgily exciting' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11934858/Mr-Robot-review.html |date=October 16, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mr. Robot'' made several critics' list for the best TV shows of 2015. Three critics, [[Jeff Jensen]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and the staff of ''[[TV Guide]]'', named it the best show of the year. The series also placed second on the list from three other critics, and was named among the best of the year from four other critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of 2015: Television Critic Top Ten Lists|publisher=Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/critics-pick-the-top-10-best-tv-shows-of-2015|date=December 8, 2015|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 2====
The second season also received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a score of 92%, based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 8.05/10. The site's consensus reads: "Unique storytelling, a darker tone, and challenging opportunities for its tight cast push ''Mr. Robot'' even further into uncharted television territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/mr-robot/s02/ |title=Mr. Robot: Season 2 (2016) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Metacritic, it has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-robot/season-2 |title=Mr. Robot : Season 2 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonia Saraiya of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised [[Rami Malek]]'s performance and wrote, "it's Malek's soulful eyes and silent pathos that give ''Mr. Robot'' its unexpected warmth, as the viewer is lured into Elliot's chaos and confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/mr-robot-season-2-rami-malek-christian-slater-sam-esmail-1201811854/ |title=TV Review: ‘Mr. Robot,’ Season 2 |work=Variety |first=Sonia |last=Saraiya |date=July 11, 2016 |accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Goodman of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' lauded [[Sam Esmail]]'s direction, writing "Esmail's camerawork—characters tucked into corners of the frame, among other nontraditional compositions—continues to give the sense of disorientation and never feels tired" and "there are some flourishes in the first two hours that are brilliantly conceived and [...] contribute to what is one of the most visually remarkable hours on television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/mr-robot-season-2-tv-909235 |title='Mr. Robot' Season 2: TV Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Tim |last=Goodman |date=July 8, 2016 |accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''{{NOx}} adsorber''' or '''{{NOx}} trap''' (also called '''Lean {{NOx}} trap''', abbr. '''LNT''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/122012.pdf |title=NOX REDUCTION WITH NATURAL GAS FOR LEAN LARGE-BORE ENGINE APPLICATIONS USING LEAN NOX TRAP AFTERTREATMENT  |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a device that is used to reduce [[oxides of nitrogen]] (NO and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions from a [[lean burn]] [[internal combustion engine]] by means of [[adsorption]].

==Purpose and function of a {{NOx}} adsorber==
A {{NOx}} adsorber is designed to reduce oxides of nitrogen emitted in the exhaust gas of a lean burn [[internal combustion engine]]. Lean burn engines, particularly [[diesel engine|diesel]]s, present a special challenge to emission control system designers because of the relatively high levels of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (atmospheric [[oxygen]]) in the exhaust gas. The 3-way [[catalytic converter]] that has been successfully used since the 1980s on [[stoichiometric]] engines (such as fueled by [[petrol]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]], or [[ethanol]]) will not function at O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in excess of 1.0%, and does not function well at levels above 0.5%. Because of the increasing need to limit {{NOx}} emissions from diesel engines, technologies such as [[exhaust gas recirculation]] (EGR) and [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) have been used, however EGR is of limited effectiveness and SCR requires a continuous supply of reductant to the exhaust.

The {{NOx}} adsorber was designed to avoid the problems that EGR and SCR experienced. An adsorbant such as [[zeolite]] traps the NO and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules — acting as a molecular sponge. Once the trap is full (like a sponge full of water) no more {{NOx}} can be absorbed. Various schemes have been designed to "purge" or "regenerate" the trap. One of possible reactants used to this aim is diesel fuel. Injection of diesel fuel before the adsorber can purge it — the {{NOx}} is made to desorb and react with [[hydrocarbon]]s under rich conditions to produce [[water]] and [[nitrogen]]. Also [[hydrogen]] is a good reductant, but is dangerous and difficult to store. Some experimental systems have used [[Steam reforming|fuel reformers]] for on-board hydrogen generation.

==Market use==
A {{NOx}} trap is used on the [[Volkswagen Jetta]] TDI and the [[Volkswagen Tiguan]] concepts. Both are projected to be introduced into the American market by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2015 an [[ADAC]] study (ordered by [[International Council on Clean Transportation|ICCT]]) of 32 [[Euro6]] cars showed that few complied with on-road emission limits, and LNT cars had the highest emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theicct.org/nox-control-technologies-euro-6-diesel-passenger-cars NOx control technologies for Euro 6 diesel passenger cars]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
The {{NOx}} adsorber is based on a monolithic catalyst support that has been coated with a  {{NOx}} adsorbing washcoat such as one containing zeolites.  Alkali/alkaline oxide (carbonate) can also be used as the adsorbant.

Traps are gradually poisoned by SO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; which adsorbs more strongly than {{NOx}}. It necessitates a periodic high temperature regeneration that tends to reduce the adsorber's operating life.&lt;ref name=EAS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hu|first1=Horan|title=Eaton Aftertreatment System (EAS) For On-Highway Vehicles|url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/03/f9/2006_deer_hu.pdf|publisher=12th Diesel Engine-Efficiency and Emissions|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2013}}
In [[computer programming]], '''aliasing''' refers to the situation where the same memory location can be accessed using different '''names'''.

For instance, if a function takes two pointers &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; which have the same value, then the name &lt;code&gt;A[0]&lt;/code&gt; aliases the name &lt;code&gt;B[0]&lt;/code&gt;.  In this case we say the [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; '''alias''' each other.  Note that the concept of pointer aliasing is not very well-defined – two pointers &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; may or may not alias each other, depending on what operations are performed in the function using &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.

==Aliasing and re-ordering==
Aliasing introduces strong constraints on program execution order.  If two write accesses which alias occur in sequence in a program text, they must occur in sequence in the final machine code.  Re-ordering the accesses will produce an incorrect program result (in the general case).  The same is true for a write access and a read access.

However, if two read accesses which alias occur in sequence in a program text, they need not occur in the same sequence in the machine code - aliasing read accesses are safe to re-order.  This is because the underlying data is not changed by the read operation, so the same value is always read.

It is vitally important that a compiler can detect which accesses may alias each other, so that re-ordering optimizations can be performed correctly.

Several strategies are possible:

In [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]], as mandated by the strict aliasing rule, pointer arguments in a function are assumed not to alias if they point to fundamentally different types, except for &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;, which may alias to any other type.  Some compilers allow the strict aliasing rule to be turned off, so that any pointer argument may alias any other pointer arguments.  In this case, the compiler must assume that any accesses through these pointers can alias.  This can prevent some optimizations.

In [[C99]], the &lt;code&gt;[[restrict]]&lt;/code&gt; keyword was added, which specifies that a pointer argument does not alias any other pointer argument.

In [[Fortran]], procedure arguments and other variables may not alias each other (unless they are pointers or have the target attribute), and the compiler assumes they do not.  This enables excellent optimization, and is one major reason for Fortran's reputation as a fast language.  (Note that aliasing may still occur within a Fortran function.  For instance, if &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is an array and &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; are indices which happen to have the same value, then &lt;code&gt;A[i]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A[j]&lt;/code&gt; are two different names for the same memory location.  Fortunately, since the base array must have the same name, index analysis can be done to determine cases where &lt;code&gt;A[i]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A[j]&lt;/code&gt; cannot alias.)

In pure functional languages, function arguments may usually alias each other, but all pointers are read-only. Thus, no alias analysis needs to be done.{{citation needed|reason=This is true for optimizations performed on a high-level pure representation, but after lowering it to a low-level representation alias analysis will enable further optimizations.|date=January 2014}}

==Aliasing and multi-threading==
If multiple threads have names which alias the same memory location, two problems arise.

First, unless the memory location is protected in some way, then read-modify-write operations which are non-atomic might be interleaved with similar operations on another thread, producing incorrect results.  In this case, some form of synchronization primitive must be used (e.g. a [[critical section]]).

Second, even with synchronization, if two aliasing accesses occur in different threads in a non-ordered way, the program behaviour may become non-deterministic - different runs of the same program on the same data may produce different results.  Thus, it is often important to impose an explicit ordering between threads which have aliases.

[[Image:IGBT 3300V 1200A Mitsubishi.jpg|thumb|300px|High power [[IGBT]]s (here a 3300V, 1200A switch) are obtained by connecting tens of dies in parallel in a power module.]]
[[File:IGBT 2441.JPG|thumb|Opened IGBT module; different semiconductor dies are connected via wire bonds while external connectors are connected to lead-frame structures]]

A '''power module''' or '''power electronic module''' provides the physical containment for several [[Power electronics|power]] components, usually [[power semiconductor device]]s. These power semiconductors (so-called [[die (integrated circuit)|die]]s) are typically soldered or sintered on a [[power electronic substrate]] that carries the power semiconductors, provides electrical and thermal contact and [[electrical insulation]] where needed. Compared to discrete power semiconductors in plastic housings as TO-247 or [[TO-220]], power packages provide a higher [[power density]] and are in many cases more reliable.

==Module Topologies==
Besides modules that contain a single power electronic switch (as [[MOSFET]], [[IGBT]], [[BJT]], [[Thyristor]], [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTO]] or [[JFET]]) or [[diode]], classical power modules contain multiple semiconductor dies that are connected to form an electrical circuit of a certain structure, called topology. Modules also contain other components such as ceramic capacitors to minimize switching voltage overshoots and NTC thermistors to monitor the module's substrate temperature.  Examples of broadly available topologies implemented in modules are:
* switch ([[MOSFET]], [[IGBT]]), with antiparallel [[Diode]];
* [[bridge rectifier]] containing four (1-phase) or six (3-phase) diodes
* half bridge&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vincotech.com/products/by-topologies.html&lt;/ref&gt; ([[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] leg, with two switches and their corresponding antiparallel diodes)
* H-Bridge (four switches and the corresponding antiparallel diodes)
* boost or power factor correction (one (or two) switches with one (or two) high frequency rectifying diodes)
* ANPFC (power factor correction leg with two switches and their corresponding antiparallel diodes and four high frequency rectifying diodes)
* three level NPC (I-Type) (multilevel [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] leg with four switches and their corresponding antiparallel diodes)
* three level MNPC (T-Type) (multilevel [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] leg with four switches and their corresponding antiparallel diodes)
* three level ANPC (multilevel [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] leg with six switches and their corresponding antiparallel diodes)
* three level H6.5&lt;ref&gt;http://www.power-mag.com/pdf/feature_pdf/1418228828_Vincotech_Feature_0714_Layout_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - (consisting of six switches (four fast IGBTs/two slower IGBTs) and five fast diodes)
* three-phase inverter&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vincotech.com/products/by-topologies.html&lt;/ref&gt; (six switches and the corresponding antiparallel diodes)
* Power Interface Module (PIM) - (consisting of the input rectifier, power factor correction and inverter stages)
* Intelligent Power Module (IPM) - (consisting of the power stages with their dedicated gate drive protection circuits. May also be integrated with the input rectifier and power factor correction stages.)

==Electrical Interconnection Technologies==
Additional to the traditional screw contacts the electrical connection between the module and other parts of the power electronic system can also be achieved by pin contacts (soldered onto a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]), press-fit contacts pressed into PCB [[Via (electronics)|via]]s, spring contacts that inherently press on contact areas of a PCB or by pure pressure contact where corrosion-proof surface areas are directly pressed together.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260424145_DCB-based_low-inductive_SiC_modules_for_high_frequency_operation&lt;/ref&gt;
Press-fit pins achieve a very high reliability and ease the mounting process without the need for soldering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infineon.com/pressfit-product-information&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to press-fit connections, spring contacts have the benefit of allowing easy and non-destructive removal of the connection several times, as for inspection or replacement of an module, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semikron.com/dl/service-support/downloads/download/semikron-flyer-skim-2014-04-08.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both contact types have rather limited current-carrying capability due to their comparatively low cross-sectional area and small contact surface. Therefore, modules often contain multiple pins or springs for each of the electrical power connections.

==Current Research and Development==
The current focus in R&amp;D is on cost reduction, increase of [[power density]], increase of reliability and reduction of parasitic lumped elements. These parasitics are unwanted capacitances between circuit parts and inductances of circuit traces. Both can have negative effects on the electromagnetic radiation ([[Electromagnetic radiation|EMR]]) of the module if it is operated as an inverter, for instance. Another problem connected to parasitics is their negative impact on the switching behavior and the switching loss of the power semiconductors. Therefore, manufacturers work on minimizing the parasitic elements of their modules while keeping cost low and maintain a high degree of interchangeability of their modules with those of a second source (other manufacturer).
A further aspect for optimization is the so-called thermal path between the heat source (the dies) and the heat-sink. The heat has to pass through different physical layers as solder, DCB, baseplate, thermal interface material ([[Thermal grease|TIM]]) and the bulk of the heat-sink, until it is transferred to a gaseous medium as air or a fluid medium as water or oil. Since modern silicon-carbide power semiconductors show a larger power density, the requirements for heat transfer are rising.

==Applications==
Power modules are used for power conversion equipment such as [[industrial motor drives]], [[embedded motor drives]], [[uninterruptible power supplies]], [[AC-DC power supplies]] and in [[welder power supplies]].

Power modules are also widely found in inverters for [[renewable energies]] as [[wind turbine]]s, [[solar power]] panels, tidal power plants and [[electric vehicle]]s (EVs).

==History==
The first potential-free power module was introduced into the market by [[Semikron]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semikron.com/dl/service-support/downloads/download/semikron-application-manual-power-semiconductors-english-en-2010-11.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in production, which gives an idea about the lifecycles of power modules.

'''PSoC''' ([[Computer program|programmable]] [[System on a chip|system-on-chip]]) is a family of microcontroller [[integrated circuit]]s by [[Cypress Semiconductor]]. These chips include a [[CPU]] core and [[mixed-signal integrated circuit|mixed-signal]] arrays of configurable integrated analog and digital peripherals.

== History ==
In 2002, Cypress began shipping commercial quantities of the PSoC 1.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters: [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS116335+10-Mar-2009+BW20090310 "Cypress Hits Half-Billion Mark in Shipments of PSoC Programmable System-on-Chip Devices"] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  To promote the PSoC, Cypress sponsored a "PSoC Design Challenge" in ''[[Steve Ciarcia|Circuit Cellar]]'' magazine in 2002 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Circuit Cellar:[http://www.circuitcellar.com/psoc2002/ "PSoC Design Challenge 2002"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703044748/http://www.circuitcellar.com/psoc2002/ |date=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Cypress released the fourth generation, PSoC 4. The PSoC 4 features a 32-bit [[ARM Cortex-M0]] CPU, with programmable analog blocks ([[operational amplifier]]s and comparators), programmable digital blocks (PLD-based UDBs), programmable routing and flexible GPIO (route any function to any pin), a serial communication block (for SPI, UART, [[I²C]]), a timer/counter/PWM block and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fully-qualified-production-silicon-cypress-120000787.html|title=" Fully Qualified Production Silicon for Cypress’s First Two PSoC® 4 Product Families Is Now Available"|author=|date=|website=yahoo.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PSoC is used in devices as simple as Sonicare toothbrushes and Adidas sneakers, and as complex as the [[TiVo]] set-top box. One PSoC, using [[CapSense]], controls the [[Touch panel|touch-sensitive]] [[scroll wheel]] on the Apple [[iPod click wheel]].

In 2014, Cypress extended the PSoC 4 family by integrating a [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] radio along with a PSoC 4 Cortex-M0-based SoC in a single, monolithic die.

In 2016, Cypress released PSoC 4 S-Series, featuring [[ARM Cortex-M0+]] CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cypress-offers-complete-portfolio-of-flexible-psoc-arm-cortex-m0-and-cortex-m0-solutions-to-replace-legacy-8-bit-and-16-bit-platforms-300224302.html|title=Cypress Offers Complete Portfolio of Flexible PSoC ARM Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ Solutions to Replace Legacy 8-Bit and 16-Bit Platforms|last=Corp.|first=Cypress Semiconductor|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A PSoC integrated circuit is composed of a core, configurable analog and digital blocks, and programmable routing and interconnect. The configurable blocks in a PSoC are the biggest difference from other microcontrollers.

PSoC has three separate memory spaces: paged SRAM for data, [[Flash memory]] for instructions and fixed data, and I/O registers for controlling and accessing the configurable logic blocks and functions. The device is created using [[SONOS]] technology.

PSoC resembles an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]: blocks can be assigned a wide range of functions and interconnected on-chip. Unlike an ASIC, there is no special manufacturing process required to create the custom configuration&amp;nbsp;— only startup code that is created by Cypress' ''PSoC Designer'' (for PSoC 1) or ''PSoC Creator'' (for PSoC 3 / 4 / 5) [[Integrated development environment|IDE]].

PSoC resembles an [[FPGA]] in that at power up it must be configured, but this configuration occurs by loading instructions from the built-in Flash memory.

PSoC most closely resembles a [[microcontroller]] combined with a PLD and programmable analog. Code is executed to interact with the user-specified peripheral functions (called "Components"), using automatically generated APIs and interrupt routines. ''PSoC Designer'' or ''PSoC Creator'' generate the startup configuration code. Both integrate APIs that initialize the user selected components upon the users needs in a [[Visual studio|Visual-Studio]]-like GUI.

=== Configurable analog and digital blocks ===
[[Image:Psoc blocks.PNG|right|thumb | 200px |PsoC Block Example]]

Using configurable analog and digital blocks, designers can create and change mixed-signal embedded applications. The digital blocks are state machines that are configured using the blocks registers. There are two types of digital blocks, Digital Building Blocks (DBBxx) and Digital Communication Blocks (DCBxx). Only the communication blocks can contain serial I/O user modules, such as SPI, UART, etc.

Each digital block is considered an 8-bit resource that designers can configure using pre-built digital functions or user modules (UM), or, by combining blocks, turn them into 16-, 24-, or 32-bit resources. Concatenating UMs together is how 16-bit PWMs and timers are created.

There are two types of analog blocks. The continuous time (CT) blocks are composed of an op-amp circuit and designated as ACBxx where xx is 00-03. The other type is the switch cap (SC) blocks, which allow complex analog signal flows and are designated by ASCxy where x is the row and y is the column of the analog block. Designers can modify and personalize each module to any design.

=== Programmable routing and interconnect ===
PSoC mixed-signal arrays' flexible routing allows designers to route signals to and from I/O pins more freely than with many competing microcontrollers. Global buses allow for signal multiplexing and for performing logic operations. Cypress suggests that this allows designers to configure a design and make improvements more easily and faster and with fewer PCB redesigns than a digital logic gate approach or competing microcontrollers with more fixed function pins.

== Series ==
There are five different families of devices, each based around a different microcontroller core:
* PSoC 1 - CY8C2xxxx series&amp;nbsp;— M8C core.
* PSoC 3 - CY8C3xxxx series - [[Intel 8051|8051]] core.
* PSoC 4 - CY8C4xxxx series - [[ARM Cortex-M0]] core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/microcontrollers/custom-peripherals-surround-cortex-m0-platform|title=Custom Peripherals Surround Cortex-M0 Platform|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PSoC 5/5LP - CY8C5xxxx series - [[ARM Cortex-M3]] core.
* PSoC 6 - CY8C6xxxx series - [[ARM Cortex-M4]] core with an added [[ARM Cortex-M0+]] core (in some models). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/c/cypress/psoc-6-cy8ckit-062-pioneer-kit|title=PSoC 6 CY8CKIT-062 Pioneer Kit - Cypress - DigiKey|author=|date=|website=www.digikey.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

;Bluetooth Low Energy
Starting in 2014, Cypress began offering PSoC 4 BLE devices with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth Smart). This can be used to create connected products leveraging the analog and digital blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PSoC® 4 BLE (Bluetooth Smart)|website=http://www.cypress.com/psoc4ble/|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users can add and configure the BLE module directly in PSoC creator. Cypress also provides a complete Bluetooth Low Energy stack licensed from [[Mindtree]] with both Peripheral and Central functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cypress offering BLE chipset, Here's what you need to know|website=http://www.argenox.com/blog/cypress-offers-ble-chipset/|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The PSoC 6 series includes versions with BLE including [[Bluetooth 5]] features including extended range or higher speed.

== Development tools ==

=== PSoC Designer ===
This is the first generation software IDE to design and debug and program the PSoC 1 devices. It introduced unique features including a library of pre-characterized analog and digital peripherals in a drag-and-drop design environment which could then be customized to specific design needs by leveraging the dynamically generated API libraries of code.

=== PSoC Creator ===
PSoC Creator is the second generation software IDE to design debug and program the PSoC 3 / 4 / 5 devices. The development IDE is combined with an easy to use graphical design editor to form a powerful hardware/software co-design environment. PSoC Creator consists of two basic building blocks. The program that allows the user to select, configure and connect existing circuits on the chip and the components which are the equivalent of peripherals on MCUs. What makes PSoC intriguing is the possibility to create own application specific peripherals in hardware. Cypress publishes component packs several times a year. PSoC users get new peripherals for their existing hardware without being charged or having to buy new hardware. PSoC Creator also allows much freedom in assignment of peripherals to I/O pins.

== Documentation ==

;PSoC 4 / 5
The amount of documentation for all ARM chips is daunting, especially for newcomers.  The documentation for microcontrollers from past decades would easily be inclusive in a single document, but as chips have evolved so has the documentation grown.  The total documentation is especially hard to grasp for all ARM chips since it consists of documents from the IC manufacturer ([[Cypress Semiconductor]]) and documents from CPU core vendor ([[ARM Holdings]]).

A typical top-down documentation tree is: manufacturer website, manufacturer marketing slides, manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip, manufacturer detailed reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family, ARM core generic user guide, ARM core technical reference manual, ARM architecture reference manual that describes the instruction set(s).

'''Radio occultation''' (RO) is a [[remote sensing]] technique used for measuring the physical properties of a planetary [[atmosphere]] or [[Ring system (astronomy)|ring system]].

==Atmospheric radio occultation==
Atmospheric radio occultation relies on the detection of a change in a radio signal as it passes through a planet's atmosphere, i.e. as it is [[occulted]] by the atmosphere. When [[electromagnetic radiation]] (light) passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted (or bent). The magnitude of the [[refraction]] depends on the gradient of refractivity normal to the path, which in turn depends on the density gradient. The effect is most pronounced when the radiation traverses a long atmospheric limb path. At radio frequencies the amount of bending cannot be measured directly; instead the bending can be calculated using the [[Doppler shift]] of the signal given the geometry of the emitter and receiver. The amount of bending can be related to the refractive index by using an [[Abel transform]] on the formula relating bending angle to refractivity. In the case of the neutral atmosphere (below the ionosphere) information on the atmosphere's [[temperature]], [[pressure]] and water vapour content can be derived giving radio occultation data applications in [[meteorology]].

==GNSS radio occultation==
'''GNSS''' or '''GPS radio occultation''' (GNSS-RO, GPS-RO, GPSRO) is a type of radio occultation that relies on radio transmissions from GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]), or more generally from GNSS ([[Global Navigation Satellite System]]), satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne et al. 1994.  ''The application of spacebourne GPS to atmospheric limb sounding and global change monitoring.''  Publication 94-18, Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kursinski et al. 1997.  ''Observing the Earth's atmosphere with radio occultation measurements using the Global Positioning System.''  J. Geophys. Res. '''102:'''23.429-23.465.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a relatively new technique (first applied in 1995) for performing atmospheric measurements. It is used as a [[weather forecasting]] tool, and could also be harnessed in monitoring [[climate change]]. The technique involves a [[low-Earth orbit]] satellite receiving a signal from a [[GPS]] satellite. The signal has to pass through the atmosphere and gets [[refracted]] along the way. The magnitude of the refraction depends on the temperature and water vapor concentration in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="GPS Thermometer"&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS 'thermometer' could flag up climate change|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/tech/dn13329-gps-thermometer-could-flag-up-climate-change.html|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GPS Radio occultation amounts to an almost instantaneous depiction of the atmospheric state. The relative position between the [[GPS]] satellite and the [[low-Earth orbit]] satellite changes over time, allowing for a vertical scanning of successive layers of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="GPS Space-Based &amp; Radio occultation"&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS Space-Based &amp; GPS Radio occultation|url=http://geodaf.mt.asi.it/html_old/GPSAtmo/space.html|accessdate=2008-02-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515121521/http://geodaf.mt.asi.it/html_old/GPSAtmo/space.html|archivedate=2009-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Wakeley Kidner''' was a railway enthusiast and noted publisher whose imprint, '''[[The Oakwood Press]]''', published many of the earliest books on [[British narrow-gauge railways]].

== Biography ==
Kidner was born on 16 March 1914, the son of civil servant Arthur, and Mabel. His love of railways stemmed from being given a few [[Locomotive Publishing Company]] postcards in primary school.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; He attended [[Westminster School]] where he struck up a friendship with Michael Robbins. The two bonded over a shared interest in railways, and in 1931, they founded '''The Four Os'''&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; to publish a newsletter called ''Locomotion''. Both were still at school, and the company operated out of Kidner's parents' garage. \&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

In 1935, Kidner and Robbins changed the name of their nascent publishing house to The Oakwood Press and published their first book, ''Railway Bibliography'' by Canon Fellows. This was followed in 1936 by L.T. Catchpole's ''The Lynton and Barnstaple Railway'' which is still in print in its 9th. edition. Meanwhile, after a year at the [[London School of Economics]]&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Kidner was working as an editor of travel guides for [[Benn Brothers]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; In 1938, Oakwood published the first [[railfan|train spotter's]] guide, called ''How to Recognise Southern Railway Locomotives'' written by Kidner.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt;

Kidner travelled widely to research the railways that his authors wrote about. He visited the [[Lynton and Barnstaple Railway]] in 1935 with Catchpole,&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; and the [[Welsh Highland Railway]] in 1926 and 1934.&lt;ref name=WHHJ/&gt;

The Oakwood Press suspended publication during the [[Second World War]], and Kidner served in the [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment]] where he rose to the rank of Major.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; He also married Beryl Walton in 1943. After the war he resumed publishing, though was initially restricted by paper rationing. He published [[James I. C. Boyd]]'s seminal series on the narrow-gauge railways of north Wales, starting in 1949 with ''Narrow Gauge Rails to Portmadoc'' which drew attention to the then-closed [[Ffestiniog Railway]] and was instrumental in its eventual restoration.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Michael Robbins dropped out of the business in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

In 1972, Kidner retired from his work in [[public relations]] to focus full-time on The Oakwood Press. He broadened the range of subjects covered, to include biographies of railwaymen and books about trams, [[traction engine]]s, buses and [[canal]]s. He sold The Oakwood Press in 1984, but kept in close contact with the new owner, writing and editing books until 2015.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; He died of cancer in 2007.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian |title=RW Kidner |date=6 October 2007 |last=Johnson |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Johnson (railway historian) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/06/obituaries.guardianobituaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people consider shadow IT an important source of [[innovation]], and such systems may become [[prototype]]s for future approved IT solutions. On the other hand, shadow IT solutions are not often in line with organizational requirements for control, documentation, security, reliability, etc. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Compliance issues==
Shadow IT is any application or transmission of data, relied upon for business processes, that is not under the jurisdiction of a centralized IT or IS department. The IT department did not develop it or was not aware of it, and does not support it. This increases the likelihood of ‘unofficial’ and uncontrolled data flows,  making it more difficult to comply with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (USA) and many other compliance-centric initiatives, such as:
* [[Basel II]] (International Standards for Banking),
* GLBA (Gramm Leach Bliley Act)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act&lt;/ref&gt;,
* COBIT ([[Control Objectives for Information and related Technology]])
* FISMA ([[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]])
* DFARS ([[Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement]])
* GAAP ([[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]])
* HIPAA ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]])
* IFRS ([[International Financial Reporting Standards]])
* ITIL ([[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]])
* PCI DSS ([[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]])
* TQM ([[Total Quality Management]]), etc.
* GDPR ([[General Data Protection Regulation]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eugdpr.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of these unofficial data flows include [[USB flash drive]]s or other portable data storage devices, [[MSN Messenger]] or other online messaging software, [[Gmail]] or other online e-mail services, [[Google Docs]] or other online document sharing and [[Skype]] or other online [[VOIP]] software—and other less straightforward products: self-developed Access databases and self-developed [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] spreadsheets and [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Security risks arise when data or applications move outside protected systems, networks, physical location, or security domains.

A 2012 French survey &lt;ref&gt;RESULTATS DE L’ENQUETE SUR LE PHENOMENE DU « SHADOW IT » par Thomas Chejfec : http://chejfec.com/2012/12/18/resultats-complets-de-lenquete-shadow-it/&lt;/ref&gt; of 129 IT managers revealed some examples of shadow IT :
* Excel macro 19%
* software  17%
* cloud solutions 16%
* ERP 12%
* BI systems 9%
* Websites 8%
* hardware 6%
* VoIP 5%
* shadow IT support 5%
* shadow IT project 3%
* BYOD 3%.

Another form of shadow IT comes by way of OAuth connected applications, where a user authorizes access to a third-party application via a sanctioned application.  For example, the user can use their Facebook credentials to log into Spotify, or another 3rd party application via their corporate cloud app (Google G Suite or Microsoft Office 365).  With this access, the 3rd party app may have excessive access to the sanctioned app, thereby introducing up unintended risk.

==Reasons for use==
Incumbent IT management dealing with legacy infrastructure and data management challenges cannot easily provision [[data as a service]] either because they are unaware of its advantages, or cannot acquire the budget for its successful implementation. Against this background, neither can the IT department ever deliver against all business requirements at a low enough cost relative to a true DaaS IT department. These deficiencies lead the business to implement IT solutions that may be perceived to cost less to execute, albeit whilst introducing risks a formal IT project could avoid.

For example, with the rise of powerful desktop CPUs, business subject matter experts can use shadow IT systems to extract and manipulate complex datasets without having to request work from the IT department. The challenge for IT is to recognize this activity and improve the technical control environment, or to guide the business in selecting enterprise-class data analysis tools.

A further barrier to adopting DaaS is the legacy IT bulk provisioning of only the 'Read' element of the CRUD model (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This leads IT into neglecting the need to 'write back' into the original dataset, because this is complex to achieve. It is the need of shadow IT users to then store this changed data separately (I.E. 'siloeing') that results in a loss of organisational data integrity.

Placing barriers to shadow IT can be the equivalent of stifling organizational innovation and cost reduction.
A study&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=RSA,November 2007,The Confessions Survey: Office Workers Reveal Everyday Behavior That Places Sensitive Information at Risk,available from: |url=http://www.rsa.com/company/news/releases/pdfs/RSA-insider-confessions.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211105302/http://www.rsa.com/company/news/releases/pdfs/RSA-insider-confessions.pdf |archive-date=February 11, 2012 |access-date=September 15, 2017 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirms that 35% of employees feel they need to work around a security measure or protocol to work efficiently. 63% send documents to their home e-mail address to continue work from home, even when they are aware that this is probably not allowed.

==Implications==
{{condense|section|date=February 2016}}
Besides security risks, some of the implications of Shadow IT are:&lt;ref&gt;Raden, N., October 2005, Shadow IT: A Lesson for BI, BI Review Magazine, Data Management Review and SourceMedia, Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Noah and Starliper, Matthew W. and Summers, Scott L. and Wood, David A., The Impact of Shadow IT Systems on Perceived Information Credibility and Managerial Decision Making (March 8, 2016). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2334463 or https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2334463&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wasted time===
Shadow IT adds hidden costs to organizations, consisting largely of non-IT workers in finance, marketing, HR, etc., who spend a significant amount of time discussing and re-checking the validity of certain data, setting up and managing systems and software without experience.

===Inconsistent business logic===
If a ‘shadow IT’ spreadsheet application encapsulates its own definitions and calculations, it is likely that over time inconsistencies will arise from the accumulation of small differences from one version to another and from one group to another, as spreadsheets are often copied and modified. In addition, many errors that occur from either lack of understanding of the concepts or incorrect use of the spreadsheet frequently go undetected due to a lack of rigorous testing and version control.

===Inconsistent approach===
Even when the definitions and formulas are correct, the methodology for doing analysis can be distorted by the arrangement and flow of linked spreadsheets, or the process itself can be wrong.

===Wasted investment===
Shadow IT applications sometimes prevent full [[Return on investment]] (ROI) from investments in systems that are designed to perform the functions now replaced by Shadow IT. This is often seen in Data warehousing (DW) and [[Business informatics]] (BI) projects, which are initiated with good intentions, where the broader and consistent usage of DW and BI in the organization never really starts off. This can also be caused by management failure to anticipate deployment, licensing and system capacity costs when attempting to deliver DW &amp; BI solutions. Adopting an internal cost model that forces potential new users of the DW/BI system to choose cheaper (shadow) alternatives, also plays a part in preventing successful enterprise implementation.

===Inefficiencies===
Shadow IT can be a barrier to innovation by blocking the establishment of more efficient work processes. Additional performance bottlenecks and new single points of failure may be introduced when Shadow IT systems layer on top of existing systems. Data might be exported from a shared system to a spreadsheet to perform the critical tasks or analysis.

===Higher risk of data loss or leaks===
Shadow IT data backup procedures may not be provided or audited. Personnel and contractors in Shadow IT operations may not be put through normal education, procedures or vetting processes. Originators of Shadow IT systems may leave the organization often leaving with proprietary data or leaving behind complicated systems the remainder of staff cannot manage.

===Barrier to enhancement===
Shadow IT can act as a brake on the adoption of new technology. Because IT artifacts, e.g., spreadsheets, are deployed to fill critical needs, they must be replaced carefully. But lacking adequate documentation, controls and standards, that process is slow and error-prone.

===Organizational dysfunction===
Shadow IT creates a dysfunctional environment leading to animosity between IT and non-IT related groups within an organization. Improper motivations behind Shadow IT efforts such as seeking job-security (i.e., "Bob is the only person with this data," or "What will happen if he leaves?"), data hoarding, self-promotion, favor trading, etc. can lead to significant management issues.

A 2015 survey of over 400 global CIOs showed 90% of CIOs worldwide find themselves by-passed by line of business at least sometimes. One third (31%) of CIOs globally are routinely side-lined when it comes to making IT purchasing decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Shadow IT is a reality for 90% of CIOs
|accessdate = 2015-11-23
|work = Logicalis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on IT Departments===
According to Gartner, by 2015, 35 percent of enterprise IT expenditures for most organizations will be managed outside the IT department's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Shiply''' is a UK-based limited company&lt;ref name="companies-house-api" /&gt; providing an [[internet marketplace]] where transport service requesters may list items they need to move, and where providers of transport services can [[Bidding|bid]] in a [[reverse auction]] format.

==Concept==

The concept employed by Shiply aims to utilise transport capacity that may be wasted in inefficient transport operations and as a consequence enables transport service providers to offer [[Marginal concepts|marginal prices]] to transport service requesters.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Service requesters create accounts and list the items to be transported, stipulating the maximum they are prepared to pay and specifying whether they can be flexible on delivery/pickup dates or need the listed items moved subject to specified date parameters. The transport service providers bid the lowest amount they would accept to perform the transport service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Age of Energy: Boosting business by cutting carbon | author = Andrew Cave| publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 17 February 2011| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/earth/future-of-energy/8330217/The-Age-of-Energy-Boosting-business-by-cutting-carbon.html | accessdate = 16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user feedback system is enabled in order to keep track of the reputation of the transport service providers and transport service requesters, this allows the transport service requesters the ability to frame their procurement decision on factors other than solely price.&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDG"/&gt;

Registration is free for both transport service providers and transport service requesters. Transport service providers' bids are subject to a transaction based tiered fee structure, (in the UK this is between 3.9% and 9.9% -dependent on the amount of the transaction-with a minimum fee of £6) the cost of which is borne by the transport service requesters. Transport service requesters may also be subject to an auction service fee. This fee amount is dependent on the shipment in question and is displayed before the transport service requester accepts a bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Shiply &gt; Shiply User Agreement | publisher = Shiply.com | url =http://www.shiply.com/terms | accessdate = 8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 Shiply had 17,500 transport service provider accounts, and helped voice their concerns over trade-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Air fares sent soaring after ash clouds, fuel and strikes | author= John Ingham| publisher = [[Daily Express]] | date = 29 September 2010  | url =http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/202330/Air-fares-sent-soaring-after-ash-clouds-fuel-and-strikes | accessdate = 2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Shiply aims to build European green logistics network | author= | publisher = [[Incisive Media|BusinessGreen]] | date = 11 October 2010  | url =http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2271299/hiply-aims-build-european-green| accessdate = 14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC News 24 | author= | publisher =  | date = 10 December 2010  | url =http://www.shiply.com/press-centre/coverage.php?article_id=54 | accessdate = 16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiply was founded in March 2008 by Robert Matthams, in [[Manchester]]. He has said he had the idea of this business concept when a pool table he ordered was delivered to his university in Manchester. The driver complained that he would have to make the return journey to London empty, thereby wasting fuel and his own resources.&lt;ref name="Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite web | title = Amid all the gloom, here’s one man on the road to success | author=  Mickey Clark | publisher = [[Evening Standard]] | date = 29 October 2009| url =http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-business/article-23762098-amid-all-the-gloom-heres-one-man-on-the-road-to-success.do  | accessdate = 27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===eBay===
In March 2009 Shiply launched an [[eBay]] widget to be inserted by sellers into eBay auction listings. This - now part of the item listing process - gives prospective eBay bidders the option to import items they have won - or on which they are currently bidding - into Shiply.com. The widget allows them to enter their delivery post code and then Shiply imports other pertinent information into their listing.&lt;ref name="TDG"&gt;{{cite web | title = Plan to cut transport waste moving forward with Shiply.com  | author=   | publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 12 May 2009| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/business/businesstruth/5314494/Plan-to-cut-transport-waste-moving-forward-with-Shiply.com.html  | accessdate = 27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Announcing Shiply's new eBay widget  | author=   | publisher = Shiply.com | date = 3 March 2009| url =http://blog.shiply.com/2009/03/announcing-shiplys-new-ebay-widget.html  | accessdate = 27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Shiply signed an exclusive agreement with eBay Motors UK, becoming the site’s transport partner. At that time, 50% of its business came from eBay users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Shiply inks deal with eBay Motors UK to become transport partner | author=  Steve O'Hear | publisher = [[TechCrunch]] | date = 6 January 2011 | url =https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/06/shiply-inks-deal-with-ebay-motors-uk-to-become-transport-partner/#disqus_thread  | accessdate = 16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

===Area covered===
Initially, only haulage companies from UK participated in the marketplace. In October 2009, the company expanded in Germany, opening a German website and allowing German haulage companies. In August 2010, when the company expanded to France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, 15% of shipments on Shiply already crossed national borders and 10% of its business came from the German website.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Legal dispute ===
On 24 February 2011 [[uShip]] and Shiply jointly announced a settlement regarding uShip's claims of trademark and copyright infringement. As part of the settlement, Shiply has agreed to redesign some parts of its web site, and pay an amount in compensation to uShip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =uShip and Shiply Announce Settlement of Their Legal Dispute | publisher = prnewswire | date = 24 February 2011 | url =http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=312997 | accessdate =26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misleading Advertising ===

On 19 December 2012, UK's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|ASA]] published an adjudication against Shiply Ltd about misleading advertising on www.shiply.com.&lt;ref name="archive-org-asa--on-compliant-online-advertisers-shiply"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075431/http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Non-compliant-online-advertisers/Shiply.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The ASA investigated whether www.shiply.com made it sufficiently clear that a credit policy applied to cancellations. The ASA concluded:

"The home page breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification)."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140424051055/http://asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/12/Shiply-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_206172.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
"Because of Shiply Ltd’s continued non compliance we took the decision to place the details for www.shiply.com on the ASA section of the website on 14 October 2013. Shiply Ltd’s details shall remain in place until such time as www.shiply.com clearly and prominently states the significant condition of its cancellation policy on its home page."&lt;ref name="archive-org-asa--on-compliant-online-advertisers-shiply" /&gt;

Shiply Ltd's details are no longer on the ASA section of the website.

A '''sight glass''' or '''water gauge''' is a type of [[level sensor]], a transparent tube through which the operator of a tank or [[boiler]] can observe the [[Liquid level|level of liquid]] contained within.

==Liquid in tanks==
Simple sight glasses may be just a [[plastic]] or [[glass]] tube connected to the bottom of the tank at one end and the top of the tank at the other.  The level of liquid in the sight glass will be the same as the level of liquid in the tank. Today, however, sophisticated [[float switch]]es have replaced sight glasses in many such applications.

==Steam boilers==
If the liquid is hazardous or under pressure, more sophisticated arrangements must be made. In the case of a boiler, the pressure of the water below and the steam above is equal, so any change in the water level will be seen in the gauge. The transparent tube (the “glass” itself)  may be mostly enclosed within a [[metal]] or toughened glass shroud to prevent it from being damaged through scratching or impact and offering protection to the operators in the case of breakage. This usually has a patterned backplate to make the magnifying effect of the water in the tube more obvious and so allow for easier reading. In some locomotives where the boiler is operated at very high pressures, the tube itself would be made of metal-reinforced toughened glass.&lt;ref name=bell&gt;{{cite book

To check that the device is offering a correct reading and the connecting pipes to the boiler are not blocked by [[Limescale|scale]], the water level needs to  be “bobbed” by quickly opening the taps in turn and allowing a brief spurt of water through the drain cock.&lt;ref&gt;Unidentified author (1957). ''Handbook for steam locomotive enginemen.'' London: British Transport Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors recommends a daily testing procedure described by the American National Standards Institute, chapter 2 part I-204.3 water level gauge. While not strictly required, this procedure is designed to allow an operator to safely verify that all parts of the sight glass are operating correctly and have free flowing connections to the boiler necessary for proper operation.

==Failure==
The gauge glass on a boiler needs to be inspected periodically and replaced if it is seen to have worn thin in the vicinity of the [[Gland (engineering)|gland nuts]], but a failure in service can still occur. Drivers are expected to carry two or three glass tubes, pre-cut to the required length, together with hemp or rubber seals, to replace the tubes on the road.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt; Familiarity with this disquieting occurrence was considered so important that a glass would often be smashed deliberately while a trainee driver was on the footplate, to give him practice in fitting a new tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It was standard procedure to hold the coal scoop in front of the face while the other hand, holding the cap for protection, reached to turn off the valves at both ends of the glass.

==Reflex gauges==
A reflex gauge is more complex in construction but can give a clearer distinction between gas (steam) and liquid (water). Instead of containing the media in a glass tube, the gauge consists of a vertically oriented slotted metal body with a strong glass plate mounted on the open side of the slot facing the operator. The rear of the glass, in contact with the media, has grooves moulded into its surface, running vertically. The grooves form a zig-zag pattern with 90° angles. Incident light entering the glass is refracted at the rear surface in contact with the media. In the region that is contact with the gas, most of the light is reflected from the surface of one groove to the next and back towards the operator, appearing silvery white. In the region that is in contact with the liquid, most of the light is refracted into the liquid causing this region to appear almost black to the operator. Well-known makes of reflex gauge are IGEMA,TGI Ilmadur,Penberthy, Jerguson, Klinger, Cesare-Bonetti and Kenco. Due to the caustic nature of boiler anti-scaling treatments ("water softeners"), reflex gauges tend to become relatively rapidly etched by the water and lose their effectivess at displaying the liquid level. Therefore, bi-colour gauges are recommended for certain types of boiler, particularly those operating at pressure above 60 bar.

==Bi-colour gauges==
A bi-colour gauge is generally preferred for caustic media in order to afford protection to the glass. The gauge consists of a vertically oriented slotted metal body with a strong plain glass to the front and the rear. The front and rear body surfaces are in non-parallel vertical planes. Behind the gauge body are light sources with two quite different wavelengths, typically red and green. Due to the different refraction of the red and green light, the liquid region appears green to the operator, while the gas region appears red. Unlike the reflex gauge, the glass has a plane surface which it does not need to be in direct contact with the media and can be protected with a layer of a caustic-resistant transparent material such as silica. Well-known manufacturers of the highest quality Bi-Colour Level Gauges are FPS-Aquarian, IGEMA and Quest-Tec

==Magnetic indicator==
In a magnetic indicator is a float on the surface of the liquid contains a permanent magnet. The liquid is contained in a chamber of strong, non-magnetic material, avoiding the use of glass. The level indicator consists of a number of pivoting magnetic vanes arranged one above the other and placed close to the chamber containing the float. The two faces of the vanes are differently coloured. As the magnet passes up and down behind the vanes it cause them to rotate, displaying one colour for the region containing the liquid and another for the region containing gas. Magnetic indicators are stated in various manufacturers' literature to be most suitable for very high pressure and / or temperature and for aggressive liquids.

==History==
The first locomotive to be fitted with the device was built  in 1829 by [[John Urpeth Rastrick|John Rastrick]] at his Stourbridge works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Modern industrial sight glass==

Industrial observational instruments have changed with industry itself. More structurally sophisticated than the water gauge, the contemporary sight glass — also called the sight window or sight port — can be found on the media vessel at chemical plants and in other industrial settings, including pharmaceutical, food, beverage and bio gas plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.papailias.com/index.html|title=Sight Glass|last=Papailias|first=George|date=|website=www.papailias.com|language=EN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sight glasses enable operators to visually observe processes inside tanks, pipes, reactors and vessels. 

The modern industrial sight glass is a glass disk held between two metal frames, which are secured by bolts and gaskets, or the glass disc is fused to the metal frame during manufacture. The glass used for this purpose is either soda lime glass or [[borosilicate glass]], and the metal, usually a type of stainless steel, is chosen for desired properties of strength. [[Borosilicate glass]] is superior to other formulations in terms of chemical corrosion resistance and temperature tolerance, as well as transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.udel.edu/chem/GlassShop/PhysicalProperties.htm|title=Glass Physical Properties|last=University of Delaware|first=Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry|date=|website=www1.udel.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fused sight glasses are also called mechanically prestressed glass, because the glass is strengthened by compression of the metal ring. Heat is applied to a glass disc and its surrounding steel ring, causing a fusion of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Richard|date=|title=The Mechanical Properties of Glass|url=http://glassproperties.com/references/MechPropHandouts.pdf|journal=Glass Engineering|publisher=Rutgers State University of New Jersey|volume=150:312|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the steel cools, it contracts, compressing the glass and making it resistant to tension. Because glass typically breaks under tension, mechanically prestressed glass is unlikely to break and endanger workers. The strongest sight glasses are made with [[borosilicate glass]], because of the greater difference in its coefficient of expansions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14225">The '''Smart Onboard Data Interface Module''' (SMODIM) is used by the [[United States Army]] and foreign militaries for live simulated weapons training on military platforms. The SMODIM is the primary component of the Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System (LBA TESS) that provides weapons systems training and collective Force-on-Force live training participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, LBA TESS (Page 88) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESS is an advanced weapons training system developed for the [[AH-64 Apache]] to support force-on-force and force-on-target live training at U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs), Aviation Home Stations, and deployed locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/LBA_TESS/ |title=PEO STRI LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; TESS integrates with aircraft and ground vehicles to provide collective [[opposing force]] participation in live training.

The Aerial Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) integration with LBA TESS provides the ability to conduct force-on-target engagements using live ammunition for 30 mm gun, rockets, and simulated Hellfire missiles. Gunnery scoring is supported by the SMODIM, which transmits aviation data from the LBA to the Exercise Control (EXCON). AWSS scores the pilot’s live-fire gunnery performance and provides constructive After Action Review (AAR) feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |title=PEO STRI AWSS LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320202151/http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |archivedate=2014-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, AWSS LBA TESS (Page 83) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|citeseerx = 10.1.1.177.858 |title=PEO STRI Products and Services Catalog (Page 81) |publisher=PEO STRI |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it eliminates the requirement for MILES-type lasers by providing the capability to geometrically pair weapon engagements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smodim.html |title=SMODIM - Smart Onboard Data Interface Module |date= |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Smart Onboard Data Interface Module (SMODIM).png|thumb|right|SMODIM]]

== Background ==

In 1992, Inter-Coastal Electronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net |title=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected by U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cecom.army.mil |title= U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide the real-time casualty assessment (RTCA) interface for the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter. This component was called the onboard data interface module (ODIM). As the Army incorporated new technologies, the SMODIM added GPS and telemetry and became the core component of live helicopter training systems at all U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs) with a fielding of over 240 systems. In 1997, the SMODIM was modified to provide a proof of concept for the upgraded AH-64 (D model) Longbow Apache. In 1998 the "Modular" SMODIM and the longbow tactical engagement simulation system (TESS) training system was fielded to all three CTCs and Aviation Home Stations, and became the U.S. Army's first fully integrated live aviation training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a359363.pdf |title=The Development of a Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) Plan for a Proposed Tactical Engagement Simulation System for the AH-64D Attack Helicopter |publisher=Robert A. Pupalaikis, Defense Technical Information Center |date= November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following 15&amp;nbsp;years, the SMODIM has deployed in multiple systems and platforms with over one thousand SMODIMs fielded in the U.S. and abroad. An "Advanced" SMODIM or "ASMODIM" is currently in development due to parts obsolescence and will provide an 80% increased processing performance. Security encryption is in accordance with [[FIPS 140-2]] level 2. Advanced weapon simulation is augmented by digital terrain elevation data ([[DTED]]) and geometric ranging. Data communication and data transmission upgrades utilize [[RS-422]] and [[RS-485]] full duplex channels, and [[ARINC 429]] technical standards.

== Overview ==

The SMODIM includes a built-in GPS receiver, [[telemetry]] radio, data recorder, and [[MIL-STD-1553]] mux bus processors. The SMODIM interfaces with the weapons systems and actively tracks, records and transmits data to the ground station or exercise control (EXCON). RTCA feedback is passed directly to the weapons processor and the ground station through the onboard telemetry radio. The SMODIM processes area weapons effects (AWE) data received from the EXCON and computes geometric pairing solutions for weapon engagements using the RF Hellfire, semi-automated laser (SAL) Hellfire, 30 mm chain gun, and rockets. It selects a target from its onboard player/position database in the appropriate weapons impact footprint, then uses the probability-of-hit (Ph) factor to determine the assessment (i.e., ‘hit’/‘miss’). Via the data link, it then informs the target it has been selected for assessment.

The SMODIM maintains a dynamic position database through player-to-player network communications. The onboard telemetry radio supports simultaneous distribution to multiple locations. The radio acts as a message repeater to overcome line of sight (LOS) interruptions. The SMODIM interfaces with [[distributed interactive simulation]] (DIS) networks using SMODIM tracking analysis and recording (SMOTAR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smotar.html |title=SMODIM Tracking Analysis and Recording (SMOTAR) |publisher=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an advanced software suite that provides visual display and tracking of SMODIM instrumented players. GPS provides real-time position data as players are dynamically simulated, tracked and recorded over tactical maps and aerial photos for after-action review (AAR).

The TESS Aircraft System consists of an “A” kit that becomes part of the aircraft, and a “B” kit that is added to the aircraft for training exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p350_9.pdfl |title=TESS Apache Longbow TESS B-Kit (Pages 88-89) |publisher=Headquarters Department of the Army |date= 12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “A” kit includes the SMODIM Tray Assembly, modified software in the weapons display and systems processors, with cable connection provisions.

== U.S. army programs ==

The TESS training system and SMODIM are used by the U.S. Army at Aviation Homestations and CTCs ([[Fort Irwin National Training Center|NTC]], [[Fort Polk|JRTC]], [[Grafenwöhr|JMRC]]). Permanent TESS training support is provided at [[Ft Hood]], TX since 1998 for the 21st Cavalry Brigade 
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/fas/21stCAVBrigadeSustainmentSupportOpSupport.pdf |title=21st Cavalry Brigade |publisher=GSA |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is ongoing through the 166th Aviation Brigade and Foreign Military customers that train there. Permanent field support for TESS is also provided at the CTCs.

The UH-72A LUH Lakota is recently instrumented with the SMODIM and will deploy to Germany at the [[Joint Multinational Command Training Center]] (JMTC) to train pilots in combat engagements.

'''Swaddling''' is an age-old practice of wrapping [[infants]] in blankets or similar cloths so that movement of the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s is tightly restricted. '''Swaddling bands''' were often used to further restrict the infant. Swaddling fell out of favor in the 17th century.

Some authors are of the opinion that swaddling is becoming popular again, although medical and psychological opinion on the effects of swaddling is divided. Some modern medical studies indicate that swaddling helps babies fall asleep and to remain asleep and helps to keep the baby in a [[supine position]], which lowers the risk of [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS).&lt;ref name="waking"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, one recent study indicated that swaddling increased the risk of SIDS.&lt;ref&gt;See Blair et al. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally emerging evidence is showing that certain swaddling techniques may increase the risk of [[Hip dysplasia (human)|developmental dysplasia of the hip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hipdysplasia.org/Infant-and-Child-Hip-Dysplasia/Hip-Healthy-Swaddling/Default.aspx hipdysplasia.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest depictions of swaddled babies are [[votive offerings]] and [[grave goods]] from Crete and Cyprus, 4000 to 4500 years old.

[[File:Gewickelte Kinder Kreta-Vorpalastzeit.jpg|thumb|Swaddled babies. Votive offerings from [[Agia Triada Monastery|Agia Triada]] (Crete), [[Bronze age]], 2600-2000 BC., Heraklion (Iraklion), Crete. Archeological museum Iraklion]]

[[Votive offering|Votive statuettes]] have been found in the [[tomb]]s of Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] women who died in childbirth, displaying babies in swaddling clothes. In shrines dedicated to [[Amphiaraus]],  models representing babies wrapped in swaddling clothes have been excavated. Apparently, these were frequently given as thank-offerings by anxious mothers when their infants had recovered from sickness.&lt;ref name=greek&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most famous record of swaddling is found in the [[New Testament]] concerning the birth of [[Jesus]] in {{bibleverse||Luke|2:6–2:7|KJV|}}:
{{quote|And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
}}

Swaddling clothes described in the Bible consisted of a cloth tied together by bandage-like strips. After an infant was born, the umbilical cord was cut and tied, and then the baby was washed, rubbed with salt and oil, and wrapped with strips of cloth. These strips kept the newborn child warm and also ensured that the child's limbs would grow straight. {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:4|KJV|}} describes Israel as unswaddled, a metaphor for abandonment.

During [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times, swaddling involved wrapping the new baby in linen bands from head to foot to ensure the baby would grow up without physical deformity. A stay band would be attached to the forehead and the shoulders to secure the head. Babies would be swaddled like this until about 8 or 9 months.&lt;ref name=Alison&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss surgeon [[Felix Würtz]] (approx. 1500 to approx. 1598) was the first who criticized aspects of swaddling openly.&lt;ref&gt;Würtz (1612), p. 726 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I also saw right and straight children created by God and born into this world by humans, who became nevertheless bent and lame men, who never got straight and healthy thighs. (…) In addition, I have for instance let a child lay again down and tied up, so that I see, in which way he was swaddled. There I then really saw, where it was gone wrong (…). By misunderstanding however they wanted to bind him straight, but in fact they bind him bent and tighten the bandages hard, so that the child cannot have peace (….).&lt;ref&gt;Würtz (1612), p. 714 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the seventeenth century, the scientific opinion towards swaddling began to change. There was an association of neglect with swaddling, especially regarding [[wetnurse]]s who would leave babies in their care swaddled for long periods without washing or comforting them.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; More than a hundred years after Würtz, physicians and philosophers from England began to openly criticize swaddling and finally demanded its complete abolishment. The British philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) rejected swaddling in his 1693 publication ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'', becoming a lobbyist for not binding babies at all.&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1779), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This thought was very controversial during the time, but slowly gained ground, first in England and later elsewhere in Western Europe.

[[William Cadogan (childcare)|William Cadogan]] (1711–1797) seems to have been the first physician, who pleaded for the complete abolition of swaddling. In his "Essay upon Nursing" of 1748, he expressed his view of contemporary child care, swaddling, the topic of too much clothing for infants and overfeeding. He wrote:

{{quote|But besides the Mischief arising from the Weight and Heat of these Swaddling-cloaths, they are put on so tight, and the Child is so cramp'd by them, that its Bowels have not room, nor the Limbs any Liberty, to act and exert themselves in the free easy Manner they ought. This is a very hurtful Circumstance, for Limbs that are not used, will never be strong, and such tender Bodies cannot bear much Pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Cadogan (1748), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] baby of the [[Nez Perce tribe]], 1911]]

Philosophers and physicians more and more began to reject swaddling in the 18th century. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] wrote in his book ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' in 1762:

{{quote| The child has hardly left the mother's [[womb]], it has hardly begun to move and stretch its limbs, when it is given new bonds. It is wrapped in swaddling bands, laid down with its head fixed, its legs stretched out, and its arms by its sides; it is wound round with linen and bandages of all sorts so that it cannot move […]. Whence comes this unreasonable custom? From an unnatural practice. Since mothers despise their primary duty and do not wish to [[Breastfeeding|nurse]] their own children, they have had to entrust them to [[Wetnurse|mercenary women]]. These women thus become mothers to a stranger's children, who by nature mean so little to them that they seek only to spare themselves trouble. A child unswaddled would need constant watching; well swaddled it is cast into a corner and its cries are ignored […]. It is claimed that infants left free would assume faulty positions and make movements which might injure the proper development of their limbs. This is one of the vain rationalizations of our false wisdom which experience has never confirmed. Out of the multitude of children who grow up with the full use of their limbs among nations wiser than ourselves, you never find one who hurts himself or maims himself; their movements are too feeble to be dangerous, and when they assume an injurious position, [[pain]] warns them to change it. }}

Although this form of swaddling has fallen out of favour in the [[Western world]], many Eastern cultures and [[Tribe|tribal people]] still use it.&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern swaddling==

The swaddling clothes of [[mediaeval]] [[Madonna and Child]] paintings are now replaced with cotton receiving blankets, cotton muslin wraps, or specialised "winged" baby swaddles. Modern swaddling is becoming increasingly popular today as a means of settling and soothing irritable infants and helping babies sleep longer with fewer awakenings. Since the early 1990s, the medical community has recommended placing babies on their back to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. As studies proved swaddled babies sleep better in the back sleeping position, swaddling has become increasingly popular and recommended so parents avoid the dangerous stomach sleeping position. 
Swaddling also prevents newborns waking themselves with their [[Moro reflex]].&lt;ref name="waking"/&gt;

Loose and ineffective swaddling techniques made while using an undersized blanket can generally be kicked off by a wakeful baby. It is important for caregivers to accomplish a secure swaddle to ensure the blanket does not become loose and the baby remains wrapped during the sleep period. The act of swaddling does carry a risk of the baby overheating if the caregiver uses multiple blankets that are too thick or uses thick fluffy fabric that creates excessive thermal insulation.&lt;ref name="Risks"&gt;

Modern specialized baby swaddles are designed to make it easier to swaddle a baby than with traditional square blanket. They are typically fabric blankets in a triangle, 'T' or 'Y' shape, with 'wings' that fold around the baby's torso or down over the baby's shoulders and around underneath the infant. Some of these products employ Velcro patches or other fasteners. Some parents prefer a specialized device because of the relative ease of use, and many parents prefer a large square receiving blanket or wrap because they can get a tighter and custom fit and the baby will not outgrow the blanket.

To avoid hip dysplasia risk, the swaddle should be done in such a way that the baby is able to move his or her legs freely at the hip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_swaddling-your-baby_125.bc | title=Swaddling your baby}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is more easily done with a large blanket that can keep the arms in place while allowing the legs flexibility, all while allowing for proper hip development.

By the time the baby is learning to roll over, often around 4–5 months, parents and caregivers should transition the baby from swaddling to a less restrictive covering for sleep. If the baby can roll over, then it is important for the baby to have use of its hands and arms to adjust his or her head position after rolling over.
The traditional swaddling uses flat strings for babies to be tied; care is needed not to tie them too hard or blood flow would be restricted.

===Regional variations===
Swaddling still is distributed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Frenken (2011 a), p. 321-351, Frenken (2011 b), p. 233 ff..&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, swaddling is the standard treatment of babies. In Turkey, for instance, 93.1% of all babies become swaddled in the traditional way.&lt;ref&gt;See Caglayan et al (1991), p. 117, the statistics are from the Turkish population and health survey (1978), Ankara, p. 78, 82, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), 39% of all documented contemporary non-industrialized cultures show swaddling practices; further 19% use other methods of movement restriction for infants.&lt;ref&gt;See Nelson et al. (2000), p. e 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors assume that the popularity of swaddling is growing in the U.S., Great Britain and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;See van Sleuwen (2007), p. e1097.&lt;/ref&gt; A British sample showed up 19.4% of the babies are swaddled at night.&lt;ref&gt;See Bacon et al. (1991), p. 630.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, swaddling is not used as routine care measure and experiences relatively little acceptance, as the missing mentioning of this practice in the standard work on regulatory disturbances of Papusek shows.&lt;ref&gt;See Meyer &amp; Erler (2009), p. 24, also Papusek et al., p. 20, 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical uses===
Swaddling as a medical intervention with a clearly limited indication range is used in the care practices of premature babies or crybabies with brain-organically provable damage.&lt;ref&gt;Van Sleuwen et al. (2007), p. e1097, e1101, e1102 and e1103.&lt;/ref&gt; Also swaddling is used for reducing pain in such care actions as collecting blood at the heel.&lt;ref&gt;See Fearon et al. (1997), p. 222 ff. Swaddling here had a pain reducing effect.&lt;/ref&gt; The swaddling of these premature babies (very low birth weight infants, VLBW infants) takes place only very loosely. It is meant to hold the weak arms at the body and make certain movements possible.&lt;ref&gt;See Short et al. (1996), p. 25; illustration on p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This "swaddling" is something completely different from traditional swaddling in the stretched position.

== Psychological and physiological effects ==

Modern medical studies of swaddling use a form that is considerably shorter and less severe than the historical forms. The results of such studies are therefore to be understood only as assessments of historical practices. The classical study by Lipton ''et al.'' of 1965 dealt with a modern swaddling form. The researchers described the two main effects of tightly wrapping babies: they are motorically calm and sleep much.&lt;ref&gt;See Lipton, ''et al.'' (1965), S. 560 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are detected by means of various psycho-physiological parameters, such as heart rate, sleep duration and duration of crying. The research group around the Dutch biologist van Sleuwen in 2007 confirms this picture in their latest meta-analysis of medical studies on swaddling and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2007), p. e1097.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, severe restrictions on the scope of these studies should be kept in mind, because most of the positive effects mentioned by van Sleuwen ''et al.'' are not related to normally developed newborns, but to impaired babies, namely [[premature babies]] and babies with detectable organic brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2007), p. e1097, e1101, e1102 and especially p. e1103, where 3 of 5 central and empirically convincing effects are concerned with immature babies!&lt;/ref&gt;
Swaddling enhances the REM sleep (active sleep) and also the whole sleep duration.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Franco, ''et al.'' (2005), S. 1307 ff.; Chisholm (1983), S. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect of swaddling on the regulatory disturbance excessive crying is not very convincing: By adding the swaddling there is an immediate "calming" effect on children, but after a few days the effect of the introduction of regularity with swaddling is exactly the same as the regularity on its own.&lt;ref&gt;See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2003), (2006) und (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words: after a few days swaddling is completely unnecessary. It is therefore contraindicated to address the potential risk of swaddling, because the effect is only for a short term available, but after a little while is negligible.&lt;ref&gt;See Long (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor development ===
Two studies based on [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] did not show a delay in the onset of walking caused by the restraint of the use of the [[cradleboard]].&lt;ref&gt;See Dennis (1940 a), p. 107; Chisholm (1983), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas of the motor development, clear delays of the development show up even when mild restrictions take place.&lt;ref&gt;Aldolph et al. (2010), p. 72 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Skepticism concerning the allegedly missing effect of swaddling on the onset of walking delivers a Japanese study: the application of the basket cradle (ejiko) leads to a delayed onset of walking.&lt;ref&gt;See Lipton et al (1965), S. 564 mentioning Sofue, T.; Suye, H.; Murakami, T (1957). Anthropological study of Ejiko, Japanese cradle for child. Journal of the anthropological society of Nippon, 66, S. 77-91.&lt;/ref&gt; An older Austrian study showed that swaddled Albanian babies showed a delayed ability to crawl and reach things with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;See Danzinger &amp; Frankl (1934), S. 235; see also Frenken (2011), S. 44 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the need for further substantial scientific clarifying regarding the impairment of motor skills by swaddling.

=== Sudden infant death syndrome ===
The effects of swaddling on the [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) are unclear.&lt;ref name=Moon2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moon RY, Fu L | title = Sudden infant death syndrome: an update. | journal = Pediatrics in Review / American Academy of Pediatrics | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 314–20 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22753789 | doi = 10.1542/pir.33-7-314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3275 |pmid=27244847 |title=Swaddling and the Risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Meta-analysis |journal=Pediatrics |volume=137 |issue=6 |pages=e20153275 |year=2016 |last1=Pease |first1=A. S. |last2=Fleming |first2=P. J. |last3=Hauck |first3=F. R. |last4=Moon |first4=R. Y. |last5=Horne |first5=R. S. C. |last6=Lhoir |first6=M. P. |last7=Ponsonby |first7=A.-L. |last8=Blair |first8=P. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaddling was supposed to keep babies on their back, in order to prevent SIDS. Swaddling itself is not seen as a protective factor for SIDS. Swaddling may even increases the risk when babies sleep in the prone position; it reduces the risk if they sleep in the supine position.&lt;ref&gt;See Thach (2009), p. 461, Richardson et al. (2009), p. 475 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study demonstrated now, that swaddling is apparently a risk factor for SIDS, although the opposite was often previously assumed: Of the babies who died of SIDS, 24% were swaddled; in the control-groups only 6% were swaddled.&lt;ref&gt;See Blair et al. (2009). In the sample, one quarter of the babies who died of SIDS were swaddled. See also Richardson et al. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documented negative effects ===
Several empirical studies show evidence of negative effects of swaddling. 
* Swaddling, especially traditional forms, increases the risk for hip dysplasia.&lt;ref&gt;See Kutlu et al. (1992), p. 598 f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akman et al. (2007), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaarani et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kremli et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.f6499 |title=Swaddling increases babies' risk of hip abnormalities |journal=BMJ |volume=347 |pages=f6499 |year=2013 |last1=Torjesen |first1=I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahan &amp; Kasser (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mafart et al. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tight swaddling, particularly where the head is covered, reduces the baby's ability to cool its body temperature which can lead to hyperthermia.&lt;ref&gt;See Bacon et al (1991), p. 627 ff., Cheng &amp; Partridge (1993), p. 238 ff., also van Sleuwen et al. (2007), p. e1101.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a heavily wrapped child died of hyperthermia.&lt;ref&gt;See van Gestel et al. (2002). See also Task Force on Infant Sleep Position and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (2000), p. 654.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In one study, the risk of developing respiratory infections increased fourfold by swaddling.&lt;ref&gt;See Yurdakok et al. (1990), p. 878&lt;/ref&gt;
* A pediatrician found in his sample the flattening of the occipital aspect of the head of babies, who were wrapped tightly and lay in their traditional cradles.&lt;ref&gt;See Bloch (1966). p. 645 (Kurdish sample), also Young (2005) for a prehistoric indigenous population.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the most important contemporary study on swaddling practices in maternity wards by Bystrova et al., it is shown that swaddling in the hours after birth is linked with a delayed recovery from post-natal weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;See Bystrova et al. (2007 a), p. 29 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A positive effect on the recovery is given by direct skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby in the hours after birth.&lt;ref&gt;See Bystrova et al. (2007 a), p. 37 f.; also Bystrova et al. (2003), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Skin-to-skin contact was shown to reduce the impact of the stress of being born, with babies maintaining their body temperature to a greater degree than those swaddled in a nursery.&lt;ref&gt;See also Kennell &amp; MacGrath (2003), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The recent results of an investigation of Bystrova et al. demonstrates that maternal behavior develops less under swaddling conditions, and reciprocity within the mother-child dyad is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;See Bystrova (2008), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
SwitchUp, was started after Jonathan Lau, an MIT alum, attended a [[Coding Bootcamp]] in Boston. He left feeling he could have gained more from his bootcamp experience. He noticed a quickly growing industry with little oversight, where it was difficult for students to identify high-quality programs. This industry was becoming saturated, and he wanted to find a way to help students easily access information and advice about tech bootcamps. He launched SwitchUp with a small team, and left the very first [https://www.switchup.org/research/best-coding-bootcamps code bootcamp] review on the site.

Since SwitchUp's founding, the industry has only grown more quickly. SwitchUp aims to add transparency to the technology education industry.&lt;ref name="bostinno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/all-series/switch-review-site-for-alternative-learning-programs-and-developer-bootcamps/|title=MIT Alum Launches a Yelp for Technology Bootcamps to Help Students Switching Careers|publisher=BostInno|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative now, more than ever, to have a site like SwitchUp available to prospective students, free-of-charge. The website was launched in August 2014.&lt;ref name="techcrunch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Switch Is TripAdvisor For Finding A Tech Bootcamp |publisher=Techcrunch |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/18/switch-is-tripadvisor-for-switching-careers/|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS)''' is a form of [[sonar]] in which sophisticated post-processing of sonar data are used in ways closely analogous to [[synthetic aperture radar]]. Synthetic aperture sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher along-track resolution than conventional sonars. The along-track resolution can approach half the length of one sonar element, though is downward limited by 1/4 wavelength. The principle of synthetic aperture sonar is to move the sonar while illuminating the same spot on the sea floor with several pings. When moving along a straight line, those pings that have the image position within the beamwidth constitutes the synthetic array. By coherent reorganization of the data from all the pings, a synthetic aperture image is produced with improved along-track resolution. In contrast to conventional [[Sidescan sonar|side-scan]] sonar, SAS processing provides range-independent along-track resolution. At maximum range the resolution can be magnitudes better than that of side-scan sonars.

'''TPS Pakistan''' is a  [[Pakistani]] [[technology company]] established in 1996 by two entrepreneurs Mohammed Sohail and Mubashir Rahim.&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1157840|title=TPS software house's reach|author=Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana|date=19 January 2015|publisher=Dawn (newspaper)|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Company background==
TPS Pakistan's two founders, Mohammad Sohail and Mubashir Rahim completed their higher education in the US in engineering and returned to Pakistan in the early 1990s. Before returning, they worked for a short period at [[NCR Corporation]], a [[software]] and [[electronics]] company which is primarily involved in selling computer servers and ATMs.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; They returned to Pakistan and decided to form their own software company in Karachi. They both worked very hard and mainly looked for opportunities in networking connectivity especially in the banking and financial sectors.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; In 2015, CEO of TPS Pakistan, Shahzad Shahid compared Pakistan with the neighboring countries like [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] where more people had bank accounts and emphasized the need for Pakistan to catch up with them.&lt;ref name=Dawn1/&gt;
==Accomplishments==
===Business agreements with other companies===
* In 2017, [[National Bank of Pakistan]] launched 'Pre-paid' cards with the cooperation of TPS Pakistan company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/183817-NBP-launches-Prepaid-cards National Bank of Pakistan launches 'Prepaid' cards with the company TPS Pakistan], The News International (newspaper), Published 4 February 2017, Retrieved 21 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of 2015, TPS Pakistan reportedly claims that around 40 microfinance banks were part of their inter-bank-shared-switch-[[1LINK]], an [[interbank network]] in Pakistan. Before adopting their software, individual banks in Pakistan were using a software application that allowed them to have links with only their own ATMs during regular banking hours only. Most banks in Pakistan needed to have online network connectivity for their ATMs especially after banking hours. Simply put, Pakistani banks needed to have connectivity all the time and at all hours of the day with not only their own ATMs but also those of other banks to make it convenient for bank customers to be able to use all ATMs regardless of where they had their individual bank accounts.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;
* TPS Pakistan reportedly claims that they developed the badly needed ''Inter-Bank Fund Transfer (IBFT) technology in Pakistan which then allowed electronic fund transfers from bank to bank in real time.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;
* As this technology already existed in many countries, TPS Pakistan reportedly wanted to introduce it in Pakistan with their developed software to allow people to do their basic banking transactions through the internet and mobile phones.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1205355|title=Financial inclusion through digitization|author=Ali Raza Mehdi|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Dawn (newspaper)|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Headquarters==
TPS Pakistan's headquarters are located at TPS Tower in [[Karachi, Pakistan]]

TPS Pakistan's headquarters were located in Business Avenue [[Karachi, Pakistan]]. In 2008 TPS Pakistan announced that it was moving its headquarters from Business Avenue to a bigger and spacious building named as TPS Tower in Karachi, Pakistan.

==History==
TPS Pakistan started off as a two-man operation in 1996 by the name of Transaction Processing Systems, it gradually grew and eventually was incorporated with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan]] as ''TPS Pakistan (Private) Limited company'' in 2003.

'''Technology strategy''' ('''information technology strategy''' or '''IT strategy''') is the overall plan which consists of objectives, principles and tactics relating to use of technologies within a particular organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aligning Enterprise, System, and Software Architectures|last=Mistrik|first=Ivan|last2=Tang|first2=Antony|last3=Bahsoon|first3=Rami|last4=Stafford|first4=Judith|publisher=IGI Global|year=2012|isbn=9781466621992|location=Hershey, PA|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such strategies primarily focus on the technologies themselves and in some cases the people who directly manage those technologies.  The strategy can be implied from the organization's behaviors towards technology decisions, and may be written down in a document. The strategy includes the formal vision that guide the acquisition, allocation, and management of IT resources so it can help fulfill the organizational objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information Technology Control and Audit, Third Edition|last=Senft|first=Sandra|last2=Gallegos|first2=Frederick|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781420065503|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other generations of technology-related strategies primarily focus on: the efficiency of the company's spending on technology; how people, for example the organization's customers and employees, exploit technologies in ways that create value for the organization; on the full integration of technology-related decisions with the company's strategies and operating plans, such that no separate technology strategy exists other than the de facto strategic principle that the organization does not need or have a discrete 'technology strategy'.

A technology strategy has traditionally been expressed in a document that explains how technology should be utilized as part of an organization's overall [[corporate strategy]] and each [[business strategy]].  In the case of IT, the strategy is usually formulated by a group of representatives from both the business and from IT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://informationtechnologystrategy.org/2010/07/information-technology-strategy-overview/ Information Technology Strategy Projects] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20100731043133/http://informationtechnologystrategy.org/2010/07/information-technology-strategy-overview/ |date=2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often the Information Technology Strategy is led by an organization's [[Chief Technology Officer]] (CTO) or equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CTOs at Work|last=Donaldson|first=Scott|last2=Siegel|first2=Stanley|last3=Donaldson|first3=Gary|publisher=Apress|year=2012|isbn=9781430235934|location=New York|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accountability varies for an organization's strategies for other classes of technology. Although many companies write an overall business plan each year, a technology strategy may cover developments somewhere between 3 and 5 years into the future.

The United States identified the need to implement a technology strategy in order to restore the country's competitive edge. In 1983 [[Project Socrates]], a US [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] program, was established to develop a national technology strategy policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernd|first1=Bernd|title=Strategy Execution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful technology strategy involves the documentation of planning assumptions and the development of success metrics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Convergence: Linking Business Strategies and Technology Decisions to Create Sustainable Success|last=Hoque|first=Faisal|last2=Walsh|first2=Lawrence|last3=Mirakaj|first3=Diana|last4=Bruckner|first4=Jeffrey|publisher=American Management association|year=2011|isbn=9780814416952|location=New York|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These establish a mission-driven strategy, which ensures that initiatives are aligned with the organization's goals and objectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This aspect underscores that the primary objective of designing technology strategy is to make sure that the [[business strategy]] can be realized through technology and that technology investments are aligned with business. Some experts underscore the successful technology strategy is one that is integrated within the organization's overall business strategy not just to contribute to the mission and vision of the company but also get support from it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Management of Technology: Perception and opportunities|last=Lowe|first=Paul|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=1995|isbn=0412643707|location=London|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are frameworks (e.g. ASSIMPLER&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140606063158-4649200-assimpler-ea-framework-making-life-simpler-for-an-enterprise&lt;/ref&gt;) available that provide insights into the current and future business strategy, assess business-IT alignment on various parameters, identify gaps, and define technology roadmaps and budgets. These highlight key information, which include the following: 

* The important components of information tech-strategy is information technology and strategic planning working together.
* The IT strategy alignment is the capability of [[Information technology|IT]] functionality to both shape, and support business strategy (Henderson and Venkatraman, 1993).
* The degree to which the IT mission, objectives, and plans support and are supported by the business mission, [[Goal|objective]], and plans (Reich and Benbasat, 2000)

For a strategy to be effective, it should also answer questions of how to create value, deliver value, and capture value. In order to create value one needs to trace back the technology and forecast on how the technology evolves, how the [[market penetration]] changes, and how to organize effectively. Capturing value requires knowledge how to gain [[competitive advantage]] and sustain it, and how to compete in case that standards of technology is important. The final step is delivering the value, where firms defines how to execute the strategy, make strategic decisions and take decisive actions. The Strategic Alignment Process is a step by step process that helps managers stay focused on specific task in order to execute the task and deliver value.

== Meta-model of (IT) technology strategy==
Aligned with Statement Of Applicability (SOA) approach, IT strategy is composed of IT Capability Model (ITCM) and IT Operating Model (IT-OM) as proposed by Haloedscape IT Strategy Model.&lt;ref name=singh2015&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Neeraj | title=Essential strategy and enterprise architecture : strategy and enterprise architecture for business-aligned, SOA-based IT solution developed through different phases of preliminaries &amp; foundation, business architecture, information system architecture, application &amp; data architecture, platform &amp; technology architecture | publisher=Haloedscape Haves | publication-place=Middletown, DE | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-5078-4014-6 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework of (IT) technology strategy==
Process of IT Strategy is simplified with framework constituted of IT Service Management (ITSM&lt;ref&gt;https://servicemanagers.org/definition-itsm-it-service-management&lt;/ref&gt;), Enterprise Architecture Development (TOGAF) and Governance (COBIT). IT Strategy is modeled as vertical IT service applied to and supported by each horizontal layers of SOA architecture. For details, refer Haloedscape IT Strategy Framework.

==Typical structure of a (IT) technology strategy==
The following are typically sections of a technology strategy:
* Executive Summary – This is a summary of the IT strategy
** High level organizational benefits
** Project objective and scope 
** Approach and methodology of the engagement
** Relationship to overall business strategy
** Resource summary
*** Staffing
*** Budgets
*** Summary of key projects
* Internal capabilities
** '''IT [[project portfolio management]]''' – An inventory of current projects being managed by the information technology department and their status.  Note: It is not common to report current project status inside a future-looking strategy document.  Show Return on Investment (ROI) and timeline for implementing each application.
** An catalog of existing applications supported and the level of resources required to support them
** Architectural directions and methods for implementation of IT solutions
** Current IT departmental 
Includes a SWOT Analysis [[SWOT_analysis]]
*Strengths 
**Current IT departments strengths
*Weaknesses
**Current IT department weaknesses

*** Example: Availability of open-source [[learning management system]]s
** List of new IT projects requested by the organization
* Opportunities
** Description of new cost reduction or efficiency increase opportunities
***Example:  List of available Professional Service contractors for short term projects
** Description of how [[Moore's law]] (faster processors, networks or storage at lower costs) will impact the organization's [[return on investment|ROI]] for technology p
* Threats
** Description of disruptive forces that could cause the organization to become less profitable or competitive
** Analysis IT usage by competition
* IT Organization structure and Governance
** IT organization roles and responsibilities
** IT role description
** IT governance
* Milestones
** List of monthly, quarterly or mid-year milestones and review dates to indicate if the strategy is on track
** List milestone name, deliverables and metrics

==Audience==
A technology strategy document is usually designed to be read by non-technical stakeholders involved in business planning within an organization.  It should be free of technical jargon and information technology acronyms.

The IT strategy should also be presented or read by internal IT staff members.  Many organizations will circulate prior year versions to internal IT department for feedback.  The feedback is used to create new annual IT strategy plans.

One critical integration point is the interface with an organization's [[marketing plan]].  The marketing plan frequently requires the support of a [[web site]] to create an appropriate on-line presence.  Large organizations frequently have complex web site requirements such as [[web content management]].

== Implementation ==
The implementation of technology strategy will likely follow the conventional procedure taken when implementing a business strategy or an organization's planned changes within the so-called [[change management]] framework. Fundamentally, it is directed by a manager who oversees the process, which could include gaining targeted organizational members' commitment to an innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managing Information Technology Resources in Organizations in the Next Millennium: 1999 Information Resources Management Association International Conference, Hershey, PA, USA, May 16-19, 1999|last=Khosrowpour|first=Mehdi|publisher=Idea Group Inc.|year=1999|isbn=1878289519|location=Hershey, PA|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of strategic options available when implementing a technology strategy and one of these involves the structured approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Strategic Management of Technology: A Guide for Library and Information Services|last=Baker|first=David|publisher=Chandos Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1843340429|location=Oxford|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the area of systematic exploration of emerging technologies, this approach help determine the relevance and opportunities offered by new technologies to business through its well-defined assessment mechanisms that can effectively justify adoption.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Relationship between strategy and enterprise technology architecture==
A technology strategy document typically refers to but does not duplicate an overall [[enterprise architecture]].  The technology strategy may refer to:
* High-level view of logical architecture of information technology systems
* High-level view of physical architecture of information technology systems
* Technology rationalization plan

[[File:Cptvdisplay.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Flat-screen televisions for sale at a consumer electronics store in 2008.]]
'''Television''' ('''TV'''), sometimes shortened to '''tele''' or '''telly''', is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in [[monochrome]] ([[black and white]]), or in colour, and in two or [[3D television|three dimensions]] and sound. The term can refer to a [[television set]], a [[television program]] ("TV show"), or the medium of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|television transmission]]. Television is a [[mass medium]] for advertising, entertainment and news.  

Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After [[World War II]], an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as [[Betamax]], [[VHS]] tape, [[Hard disk drive|local disks]], DVDs, [[flash drives]], high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, and cloud [[digital video recorders]] has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies— at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on [[Cloud computing|the cloud]].  At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, [[digital television]] transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) ([[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution and [[480i]]) to [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: [[1080p]], [[1080i]] and [[720p]]. Since 2010, with the invention of [[smart television]], [[Internet television]] has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through [[streaming video]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]], [[iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Roku]] and [[Chromecast]].

In 2013, 79% of the world's [[households]] owned a television set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/0087/the-state-of-television-worldwide/222681|title=TVTechnology: The State of Television, Worldwide|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage [[Cathode ray tube|cathode ray tube (CRT)]] screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]s (both [[Cold cathode#Lamps|fluorescent-backlit]] and [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED]]), [[OLED]] displays, and [[plasma display]]s was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="cepro.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/mitsubishi_drops_dlp_displays_goodbye_rptvs_forever/|title=Mitsubishi Drops DLP Displays: Goodbye RPTVs Forever|author=Julie Jacobson|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-end-plasma-tvs,news-19840.html|title=LG's Exit May Herald End of Plasma TVs|author=Marshall Honorof|work=Tom's Guide|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/lg-electronics-expects-oled-tv-market-gradually-replace-led-tv-market|title=LG Electronics expects the OLED TV market to gradually replace the LED TV market|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7497383/sony-new-smart-tv-run-android-tv-ces-2015|title=All of Sony's new Smart TVs run on Android TV|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24117/20150103/ces-2015-new-samsung-smart-tvs-will-be-powered-by-tizen-os.htm|title=CES 2015: New Samsung Smart TVs Will Be Powered by Tizen OS|work=Tech Times|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/lg-to-show-off-webos-2-0-smart-tv-at-ces-2015/|title=LG to show off webOS 2.0 smart TV at CES 2015|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smart TV]]s with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.&lt;ref name="Techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/internet-tv-and-the-death-of-cable-tv-really/ |title=Internet TV and The Death of Cable TV, really |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] transmitters to [[broadcasting|broadcast]] the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by [[Cable television|coaxial cable or optical fiber]], [[Satellite television|satellite]] systems and, since the 2000s via the [[Internet television|Internet]]. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as [[analog television|analog]] signals, but a [[Digital television transition|transition]] to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal [[electronic circuit]]s, including a tuner for [[Tuner (electronics)|receiving]] and decoding broadcast signals. A visual [[display device]] which lacks a [[tuner (television)|tuner]] is correctly called a [[video monitor]] rather than a television.

==Etymology==
The word ''television'' comes {{ety|grc|''τῆλε'' (tèle)|far|lat|visio|sight}}. The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist [[Constantin Perskyi]] used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris. The Anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still "...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over [[telegraph]] or telephone wires".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=television |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=30 December 1969 |accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "...formed in English or borrowed from French télévision."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; In the 19th century and early 20th century, other "...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904)."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The abbreviation "TV" is from 1948. The use of the term to mean "a television set" dates from 1941.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The use of the term to mean "television as a medium" dates from 1927.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The slang term "telly" is more common in the UK. The slang term "the tube" or the "boob tube" refers to the bulky [[cathode ray tube]] used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs. Another slang term for the TV is "idiot box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thompson, Robert|title=1985: Television Transformed 1.0|work=[[New York Times]]|date=3 October 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/media/1985-television-transformed-1-0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s, during the early rapid growth of television programming and television-set ownership in the United States, another slang term became widely used in that period and continues to be used today to distinguish productions originally created for broadcast on television from films developed for presentation in movie theaters.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"&gt;Johnson, Richard (2018). [https://pagesix.com/2018/10/11/big-movie-stars-are-not-making-the-cut-on-the-small-screen/ “Big movie stars are not making the cut on the small screen”], Page Six, ''[[The New York Post]]'' (New York, N.Y.), October 11, 2018. Retrieved November 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The “small screen”, as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the “[[Feature film|big screen]]” was used to identify productions made for theatrical release.&lt;ref name="Smallscreen"/&gt;

[[Facsimile transmission]] systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. [[Alexander Bain]] introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. [[Frederick Bakewell]] demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered the [[photoconductivity]] of the element [[selenium]] in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, [[Paul Nipkow|Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow]] proposed and patented the [[Nipkow disk]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers, George and May (1997), ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940''. Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 13, 22. {{ISBN|978-0-8240-7782-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk "[[rasterizer|image rasterizer]]" became exceedingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers &amp; Shiers, p. 13, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Perskyi]] had coined the word  ''television'' in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris on 24 August 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Constantin PERSKYI|url=https://www.histv.net/perskyi-1900|title=Télévision au moyen de l'électricité|agency=Congrès Inographs by Telegraph|work=The New York Times Sunday Magazine|date=20 September 1907|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology by [[Lee de Forest]] and [[Arthur Korn]], among others, made the design practical.&lt;ref name="Sending Photographs by Telegraph"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E4DA1331E733A25757C2A9649C946697D6CF "Sending Photographs by Telegraph"], ''The New York Times'', Sunday Magazine, 20 September 1907, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 [[selenium]] cells, individually wired to a mechanical [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], served as an electronic [[retina]]. In the receiver, a type of [[Kerr effect|Kerr cell]] modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 [[pixel]] resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted "several times" each second.&lt;ref&gt;Henry de Varigny, "[http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm La vision à distance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231305/http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}", ''L'Illustration'', Paris, 11 December 1909, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 [[Edouard Belin]] sent the first image via radio waves with his [[belinograph]].

In 1911, [[Boris Rosing]] and his student [[Vladimir Zworykin]] created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, "very crude images" over wires to the "[[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube" ([[cathode ray tube]] or "CRT") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: "the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZcwhVyiMqsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burns+%27%27Television:+An+International+History+of+the+Formative+Years%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=zworykin%20rosing%20selenium&amp;f=false R.

[[File:John Logie Baird and Stooky Bill.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Baird in 1925 with his televisor equipment and dummies "James" and "Stooky Bill" ''(right)''.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John Logie Baird, 1st Image.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The first known photograph of a moving image produced by Baird's "televisor", circa 1926 (The subject is Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson)]] --&gt;

By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] employed the [[Nipkow disk]] in his prototype video systems. On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v115/n2892/pdf/115504a0.pdf "Current Topics and Events"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 115, 4 April 1925, p. 505–506, {{doi|10.1038/115504a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal.  This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]].

In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Pathé]] established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Baird, "[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.

An American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on "Motion Pictures by Wireless" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 June 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used the [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles, from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion", ''The New York Times'', 14 June 1925, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glinsky"&gt;{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = 41–45| isbn = 0-252-02582-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent]] No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).

[[Herbert E. Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&amp;nbsp;inches wide by 30&amp;nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: "It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality."&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland &amp; Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[WRGB]], then W2XB, was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the [[General Electric]] facility in [[Schenectady, NY]]. It was popularly known as "[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television". Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Léon Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.&lt;ref name="glinsky"/&gt; By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/rca_story_brewster.html | title=Early Electronic Television RCA TV Development: 1929 – 1949 | publisher=Early Television Museum | accessdate=20 February 2016 | author=Brewster, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 1926, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan.

Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. McLean, ''Restoring Baird's Image'' (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that [[Peck Television Corp.]] started in 1935 at station VE9AK in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ve9ak.html |title=VE9AK entry at |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peck Television Corporation Console Receiver and Camera|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/peck.html|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissectors]] and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.

In 1897, English [[physicist]] [[J. J. Thomson]] was able, in his three famous experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897 and is also known as the "Braun" tube.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Braun (1897) [https://archive.is/20141217172841/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Ströme"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''' :  552–559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]], with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

In 1908 [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]], fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in which he described how "distant electric vision" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube, or Braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device,&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams succeeded in transmitting "very faint" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first cathode ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B.

[[File:Zworykin kinescope 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Zworykin]] demonstrates electronic television (1929)]]
Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast, and poor definition, and was stationary.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 51. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a [[patent interference]] suit against Farnsworth. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application;&lt;ref name=US1691324&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mZ9KAAAAEBAJ Zworykin, Vladimir K., Television System].

However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a [[flying-spot scanner]] to scan slides and film.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''Zworykin: Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the [[Franklin Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]] on 25 August 1934, and for ten days afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA838 New Television System Uses 'Magnetic Lens']", ''Popular Mechanics'', Dec. 1934, p. 838–839.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns370"&gt;Burns, R.

The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumière Electrique'', vol. 11, 1 December 1880, p. 477–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,&lt;ref&gt;Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C. Sutton, Business &amp; Economics – 1973, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; and was patented in Germany on 31 March 1908, patent № 197183, then in Britain, on 1 April 1908, patent № 7219,&lt;ref&gt;The History of Television, 1880–1941, by Albert Abramson, 1987, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; in France (patent № 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent № 17912).&lt;ref name="tvmuseum.ru"&gt;[http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 A.

Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at London's [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios]. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.

The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C.

CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Color Firsts in Television (commented)].&lt;/ref&gt; These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22," ''New York Times'', 8 March 1942, p. 1.

As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called [[Telechrome]]. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "[[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the [[NTSC|National Television Systems Committee]]&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951–1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. As black-and-white TVs could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] "compatible". ("Compatible Color", featured in RCA advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song "[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]", of [[West Side Story]], 1957.) The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.

[[File:SMPTE Color Bars.svg|thumb|left|Color bars used in a [[test pattern]], sometimes used when no program material is available.]]
Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices, and the scarcity of color programming, greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on 1 January 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy; so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE]]'s relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.

===Digital===
{{main article|Digital television}}
{{see also|Digital television transition}}

Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]]. Due to [[data compression]] digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml | title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information | accessdate=28 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522191336/http://www.disabled%2Dworld.com/artman/publish/digital%2Dhdtv.shtml | archivedate=22 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, as Japanese [[consumer electronics]] firms forged ahead with the development of [[High-definition television|HDTV]] technology, the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.

In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being "[[simulcast]]" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing [[NTSC]] standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.

The final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, [[aspect ratios]], or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the [[consumer electronics]] industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the [[computer industry]] (joined by the [[film industry]] and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816184950/http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2009 |title=Information about interlaced and progressive scan signals |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth.  Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfforum.com/FAQs/view/All-About-HDTV/What-s-the-Difference-between-Interlaced-and-Progressive-Video/33.html|title=What's the Difference between "Interlaced" and "Progressive" Video? – ISF Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as [[Lcd|Liquid-crystal (LCD)]], for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"/&gt;

[[Progressive scanning]], the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not "flicker" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. [[William F. Schreiber]], who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital television transition]] started in late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly. But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.

The advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as ''connected TV'' or ''hybrid TV'', is a television set or [[set-top box]] with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features, and is an example of [[technological convergence]] between computers, television sets and set-top boxes.  Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional [[Broadcasting|broadcasting media]], these devices can also provide Internet TV, online [[interactive media]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and [[home network]]ing access. These TVs come pre-loaded with an operating system.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carmi Levy Special to the Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/media/article/876278--future-of-television-is-online-and-on-demand |title=Future of television is online and on-demand |work=Toronto Star |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20 October 2010 by Jeremy Toeman 41 |url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/20/connected-tv-content-not-apps/ |title=Why Connected TVs Will Be About the Content, Not the Apps |publisher=Mashable.com |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Techcrunch.com"/&gt;

Smart TV should not to be confused with [[Internet TV]], [[Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) or with [[Web TV]]. [[Internet television]] refers to the receiving of television content over the Internet instead of by traditional systems – terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods). IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet.com"/&gt; Smart TVs are expected to become dominant form of television by late 2010s.

{{main article|3D television}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}
3D television conveys [[depth perception]] to the viewer by employing techniques such as [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] display, [[free viewpoint television|multi-view]] display, [[2D-plus-depth]], or any other form of [[3D display]]. Most modern 3D [[television set]]s use an [[active shutter 3D system]] or a [[polarized 3D system]], and some are [[Autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] without the need of glasses. Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by [[John Logie Baird]] in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html |title=How Stereoscopic Television is Shown |publisher=Baird Television website|accessdate=18 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101019045734/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html| archivedate= 19 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs. Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public. Many 3D television channels which started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s.According to DisplaySearch 3D televisions shipments totaled 41.45&amp;nbsp;million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3D TV-sales growth |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |newspaper=globalpost.com |date=18 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724082049/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2013, the number of 3D TV viewers started to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future looks flat for 3D TV|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/future-looks-flat-for-3d-tv-20130814-2rv1q.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is 3D TV dead?

[[File:UHF TV Antenna 001.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|A modern high gain UHF Yagi [[television antenna]]. It has 17 directors, and one reflector (made of 4 rods) shaped as a [[corner reflector antenna|corner reflector]].]]
Programming is [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] by television stations, sometimes called "channels", as stations are [[Frequency allocation|licensed]] by their governments to broadcast only over assigned [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]] in the television [[band (radio)|band]]. At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].

[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters '''W2XB'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The First Television Show" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177–179]&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularly known as "WGY Television" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. On 2 November 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.

With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 "CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas"], '"TVTechnology'', 30 July 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217104116/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 |date=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 "Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012"], ''TVTechnology'', 14 January 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218160139/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 |date=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to [[digital terrestrial television]] broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for [[cord cutters]]. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.

[[File:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coaxial cable]] is used to carry cable television signals into cathode ray tube and flat panel television sets.]]
Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large "community antennas" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcable.org/learn/history-of-cable/ | title=History of Cable | publisher=California Cable and Telecommunications Association | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924. Earlier cable television was analog, but since the 2000s, all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.

===Satellite television===
{{main article|Satellite television}}

[[File:Dishing out the truth.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|right|DBS satellite dishes installed on an apartment complex.]]
Satellite television is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using broadcast signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.

The most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as "direct to home" (DTH).&lt;ref name="tr101198"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1–7|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] wavelength and are completely digital.&lt;ref name=m101&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|journal=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] spectrum from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name=fcc&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|Digital signals]] may include [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are [[pay television]] requiring a subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet television===
{{main article|Streaming television}}
{{Distinguish|Smart television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}

Internet television (Internet TV) (or online television) is the [[digital distribution]] of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the Internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

==Sets==
{{main article|Television set}}

[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced television set, which sold in 1946–1947]]
A television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or "telly", is a device that combines a tuner, display, an amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. Introduced in late 1920's in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]], which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies. In the subsequent decades, TVs were used to watch DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s of movies and other content. Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma and fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. Televisions since 2010s mostly use [[LED-backlit LCD display|LEDs]].&lt;ref name="cepro.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/140415_lcd_tv_growth_improving_as_plasma_and_crt_tv_disappear.asp|title=IHS Technology – The Source for Critical Information and Insight. – IHS Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/rip-rear-projection-tv/|title=RIP, rear-projection TV|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display technologies===
{{main article|Display device}}

====Disk====
{{main article|Nipkow disk}}
The earliest systems employed a spinning [[Nipkow disk|disk]] to create and reproduce images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daKPJ7T8FhIC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=The+earliest+tv+systems+employed+a+spinning+disk+to+create+and+reproduce+images&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj84t-v9frUAhVE2mMKHZvhD0gQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20earliest%20tv%20systems%20employed%20a%20spinning%20disk%20to%20create%20and%20reproduce%20images&amp;f=false|title=The Kingfisher Science Encyclopedia|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=2000|publisher=Kingfisher|isbn=9780753452691|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.

====CRT====
{{main article|Cathode ray tube}}
[[File:Crt14.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A 14-inch cathode ray tube showing its deflection coils and electron guns]]
The cathode ray tube (CRT) is a [[vacuum tube]] containing one or more [[electron gun]]s (a source of [[electrons]] or electron emitter) and a [[fluorescent]] screen used to view images.&lt;ref name="crthistory"/&gt;
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures (television, [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.

In television sets and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.&lt;ref name='workings'&gt;{{cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.&lt;ref name='workings' /&gt;

====DLP====
{{main article|Digital Light Processing}}
[[File:Christie Mirage 5000.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Christie Mirage 5000, a 2001 DLP projector.]]
Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of [[video projector]] technology that uses a [[digital micromirror device]]. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. [[Larry Hornbeck]] of [[Texas Instruments]]. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997.  Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded [[Emmy Awards]] in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology.  DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of [[digital cinema]] projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Digital Light Processing Works|url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221025534/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2014|publisher=THRE3D.com|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plasma====
{{main article|Plasma display}}

A [[plasma TV|plasma]] display panel (PDP) is a type of [[flat panel display]] common to large TV displays {{convert|30|in|cm}} or larger. They are called "[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing [[electrically]] [[electric charge|charged]] [[ionized]] [[gases]], or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as [[fluorescent lamp]]s.

====LCD====
{{main article|Liquid crystal display}}
[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen.]]
Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use [[LCD]] [[display technology]] to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCD's come in two types: those using [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]], simply called LCDs and those using [[LED]] as backlight called as [[LED-backlit LCD television|LEDs]].

In 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Shipments+of+LCD+TVs+Surpass+CRT+TVs/article10775.htm | title=Hardware Report: Shipments of LCD TVs Surpass CRT TVs | publisher=DailyTech LLC. | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLEDs]], [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]], but {{as of|2014|lc=on}} none of these have entered widespread production.

====OLED====
{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}
[[File:LG전자, 깜빡임 없는 55인치 3D OLED TV 공개(2).jpg|thumb|left|OLED TV]]

An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current.  This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as [[television set|television]] screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld games console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small [[molecule]]s and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]]. OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display resolution===
[[File:8K UHD, 5K, 4K UHD, FHD and SD.svg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Comparison of 8K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], 4K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], [[High-definition television|HDTV]] and [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] resolution]]

====LD====
{{main article|Low-definition television}}

Low-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such [[240p]] (320*240). It is used in [[handheld television]]. The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to download. Many mobile phones and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320×240]] and 480×272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480×320). For the first years of its existence, YouTube offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer grade [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).

====SD====
{{main article|Standard-definition television}}

Standard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: [[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems; and [[480i]] based on the American National Television System Committee [[NTSC]] system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either [[high-definition television]] ([[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], [[1440p]], [[4K UHDTV]], and [[8K UHD]]) or [[enhanced-definition television]] (EDTV [[480p]]).  In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same [[4:3]] aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being [[center cut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html|title=Digital Television|date=28 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a [[pillarbox]]ed image.

====HD====
{{main article|High-definition television}}

High-definition television (HDTV) provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher than that of [[standard-definition television]].

HDTV may be transmitted in various formats:
* [[1080p]]: 1920×1080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 [[megapixel]]s) per [[frame (video)|frame]]
* [[1080i]]: 1920×1080i: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 MP) per [[field (video)|field]] or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP) per frame
** A non-standard CEA resolution exists in some countries such as 1440×1080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 MP) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 MP) per frame&lt;!-- Do not delete this, it is used for all free to air HDTV in the UK (and probably elsewhere) and is also used by various home recording equipment. See also the 1080i article. --&gt;
* [[720p]]: 1280×720p: 921,600 pixels (~0.92 MP) per frame

====UHD====
{{main article|Ultra-high-definition television}}

Ultra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or [[XVGA#UHD (4K) (3840×2160)|UHD]]) includes [[4K resolution#Resolutions|4K UHD]] (2160p) and [[8K resolution#Resolutions|8K UHD]] (4320p), which are two [[digital video]] formats proposed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] and defined and approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU). The [[Consumer Electronics Association]] announced on 17 October 2012, that "Ultra High Definition", or "Ultra HD", would be used for displays that have an [[display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of at least 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/what-is-ultra-hdtv/ | title = What is Ultra HDTV? | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/the-ultimate-guide-to-4k-and-8k-ultra-hd/ | title = The Ultimate Guide to 4K Ultra HD | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming===
{{See also|Television show}}
Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:

# Original run or First run: a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same.
# [[Broadcast syndication]]: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases, other companies, TV stations, or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words, to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.

First-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic [[free-to-air]] (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the US, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on [[local programming]].

===Genres===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2014}}
[[Television genre]]s include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic [[miniseries]]. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.

Popular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as [[medical drama]]s and daytime soap operas. Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as ''[[South Park]]''.

The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or [[Master of Ceremonies]]. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. ''Reality TV'' shows "regular" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'') to significant weight loss (''[[The Biggest Loser]]''). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]]'') or doing regular jobs (''[[The Simple Life]]'').

Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  "[[quality television]]", include series such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in [[art film]]s, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are "quality television", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.

Around the globe, broadcast TV is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2&amp;nbsp;million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9&amp;nbsp;billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html Global TV 2010 – Markets, Trends Facts &amp; Figures (2008–2013)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/global-tv-revenues-2008-2009.html Global TV Revenues (2008–09)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%–50% TV advertising revenues, 40%–45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html iDate's Global TV Revenue Market Shares] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html OFCOM's Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
{{main article|Television advertisement}}

TV's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers ("sponsors") to fund their programming.&lt;ref name="Hornick"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml Karen Hornick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917000611/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml |date=17 September 2010 }} "That Was the Year That Was" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in [[American English]], and known in [[British English]] as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length [[infomercial]]s). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.

[[File:Radio News Sep 1928 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Television was still in its experimental phase in 1928, but the medium's potential to sell goods was already predicted.]]

The effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as [[Marshall McLuhan]]. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as [[Nielsen Media Research]], is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a "daypart"). In many countries, including the United States, television [[Campaign advertising|campaign advertisements]] are considered indispensable for a [[political campaign]]. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted,&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Plasser, ''Global Political Campaigning'', p226&lt;/ref&gt; while some countries, such as [[Norway]], completely ban political advertisements.

The first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941 over New York station WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase "Bulova Watch Time", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.&lt;ref&gt;"Imagery For Profit" R.W. Stewart, New York Times, 6 July 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WNBT/Bulova test pattern|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 22 September 1955, advertising [[Gibbs SR]] toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on [[Nippon Television]] in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising [[Seikosha]] (now [[Seiko]]), which also displayed a clock with the current time.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:コマーシャルメッセージ|コマーシャルメッセージ (Commercial message)]], Retrieved 24 November 2013{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
Since inception in the US in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |title=1940–1949 C.E. : Media History Project : U of M |publisher=Mediahistory.umn.edu |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025200852/http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the [[advertiser]]s over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande07.html |title=The American Experience &amp;#124; Quiz Show Scandal &amp;#124; People &amp; Events &amp;#124; The Aftermath of the Quiz Show Scandal |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers.

US advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen ratings]]. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular [[American Idol]], while the same amount of time for the [[Super Bowl]] can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed [[time slot]]s, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of [[infomercials]] at far lower rates. In recent years, the paid program or [[infomercial]] has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some [[Pharmaceutical company|drug companies]] and other businesses have even created "news" items for broadcast, known in the industry as [[video news release]]s, paying [[program director]]s to use them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart]] of "[[The Daily Show]]" was mock-outraged at this, saying, "That's what we do!", and calling it a new form of television, "infoganda".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some TV programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Segrave |first=Kerry |title=Product Placement in Hollywood Films |year=1994 |isbn= 0-7864-1904-0 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known as [[product placement]]. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurant]], or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a [[product placement]]). Sometimes, a specific brand or [[Trademark|trade mark]], or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)

=====United Kingdom=====
The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], likened the broadcasting licence as being a "licence to print money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616115610/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |title=Kenneth Roy Thomson |publisher=Press Gazette |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]], and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any [[religious broadcasting]] service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The [[BBC]], being strictly [[non-commercial]], is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from [[television license]] fees (see below) and [[broadcast syndication]], the sale of content to other broadcasters.

=====Ireland=====
Broadcast advertising is regulated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/General-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf General Commercial Communications Code] and [http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Childrens-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf Children’s Commercial Communications Code], referenced in: {{cite web|url=http://www.bai.ie/index.php/2010/05/bai-launches-revised-broadcasting-codes/|title=BAI launches Revised Broadcasting Codes|date=May 2010|publisher=Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|accessdate=1 May 2016}};&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription====
Some TV channels are partly funded from [[subscription]]s; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch [[pay television]] or [[specialty channel]]s. Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.

====Taxation or license====
Television services in some countries may be funded by a [[television licence]] or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:
* Australia ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])
* [[Belgium]] ([[RTBF]])
* [[Denmark]] ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]])
* Ireland ([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]])
* Japan ([[NHK]])
* [[Norway]] ([[NRK]])
* [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]])
* United Kingdom ([[BBC]])
* United States ([[PBS]])

The [[BBC]] carries no [[television advertising]] on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8&amp;nbsp;million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/|title=TV Licensing-FOI: Licences facts and figures |publisher=tvlicensing.co.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.

The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |title=viewing statistics in UK |publisher=Barb.co.uk |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045049/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |archivedate=5 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |title=The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report – Digital TV, Q3 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625013029/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels costs £147 a year (about US$200) as of 2018 regardless of the number of TV sets owned; the price is reduced by two thirds if only black and white television is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Licence types and costs|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/tv-licence-types-and-costs-top2|website=tvlicensing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the [[audience]], indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.

Other than internal promotional material, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the ABC Act 1983. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years. In the 2014/15 federal budget, the ABC received A$1.11&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/abc-spent-nearly-50m-on-redundancy-payouts-after-coalition-budget-cuts-hit | title=ABC spent nearly $50m on redundancy payouts after Coalition budget cuts hit | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs. The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia. Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.

In France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax ("la redevance audiovisuelle").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html Ministry of Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501212316/http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html |date=1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, [[NHK]] is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as {{nihongo| reception fee |受信料|Jushinryō}}). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.

===Broadcast programming===
{{main|Broadcast programming}}
{{see also|TV listings (UK)}}
Broadcast programming, or TV listings in the United Kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of TV programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters' programs.

==Social aspects==
{{Main article|Social aspects of television}}
[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|American family watching television, circa 1958]]
Television has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as [[media violence]]. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;Butler, Fionnuala, Cynthia Pickett.  "Imaginary Friends." ''Scientific American''. 28 July 2009.  Web.  26 March 2010.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=imaginary-friends&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that [[educational television]] has many advantages. The article "The Good Things about Television"&lt;ref name="good-things-about-tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203124845/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2006|title=The Good Things About Television|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.

===Consumption===
{{main|Television consumption}}

==Negative impacts==
With high lead content in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which ([[LCD]]s) use lamps which contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], there is growing concern about [[electronic waste]] from discarded televisions. Related [[occupational health]] concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing [[electrical energy]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |publisher=Energy Saving Trust |title=The Rise of the Machines: A Review of Energy Using Products in the Home from the 1970s to Today |date=3 July 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828072528/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study in ''[[The Journal of Human Resources]]'' found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. The article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hernæs, Ø., Markussen, S., Røed, K. 2017.

The '''W67''' was an American [[Thermonuclear bomb|thermonuclear warhead]] which was developed in the mid-1960s but then cancelled prior to any production or service use in 1967.

The W67 was intended to be a new warhead for both land and sea-based ballistic missiles, specifically the [[UGM-73 Poseidon]] and [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman III (LGM-30G)]] missiles.

The design was developed by Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (now [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]).

After its cancellation, the [[W68]] warhead was used for the Poseidon and the [[W78]] for the Minuteman III.
