'''Accessible tourism''' is the ongoing endeavour to ensure tourist destinations, products and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their physical limitations, [[disabilities]] or age. It encompasses publicly and privately owned tourist locations. The term has been defined by Darcy and Dickson (2009, p34) as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Accessible tourism enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and environments. This definition is inclusive of all people including those travelling with children in prams, people with disabilities and seniors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atypon-link.com/AAP/doi/abs/10.1375/jhtm.16.1.32]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Darcy, S., &amp; Dickson, T. (2009). A Whole-of-Life Approach to Tourism: The Case for Accessible Tourism Experiences. Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 16(1), 32-44.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Overview ==
Modern society is increasingly aware of the concept of integration of people with disabilities. Issues such as [[accessibility]], [[Design for All (design philosophy)|design for all]] and universal design&lt;ref&gt;Preiser, W. F. E., &amp; Ostroff, E. (2001). Universal Design Handbook. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; are featured in the international symposia of bodies such as the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tourism/other_interesting_links/index_en.htm European and International Associations at the European Commission's Enterprise and Industry Tourism web page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130010841/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tourism/other_interesting_links/index_en.htm |date=January 30, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Steps have been taken to promote guidelines and [[best practice]]s, and major resources are now dedicated to this field.

A greater understanding of the accessible tourism market has been promoted through research commissioned by the European Commission where a stakeholder analysis has provided an insight into the complexities of accessible tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Buhalis, D., Michopoulou, E., Eichhorn, V., &amp; Miller, G. (2005). Accessibility market and stakeholder analysis - One-Stop-Shop for Accessible Tourism in Europe (OSSATE). Surrey, United Kingdom: University of Surrey. http://www.ossate.org/doc_resources/OSSATE_Market&amp;Stakeholder%20Analysis_Public_Version_Fina..pdf Retrieved 2012.08.26&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Australian Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre funded an Accessible Tourism Research Agenda&lt;ref&gt;Darcy, S. (2006). Setting a Research Agenda for Accessible Tourism. STCRC Technical Report Series, Gold Coast - Australia. Available from http://www.crctourism.com.au/BookShop/BookDetail.aspx?d=473&lt;/ref&gt; that sought to outline a research base on which to develop the supply, demand and coordination/regulation information required to develop the market segment. The research agenda has now seen three other funded projects contribute towards a research base on which the tourism industry and government marketing authorities can make more informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Darcy, S., Cameron, B., Pegg, S., &amp; Packer, T. (2008). Technical Report 90042: Developing Business Cases for Accessible Tourism, STCRC technical report Available from http://www.crctourism.com.au/BookShop/BookDetail.aspx?d=582&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darcy, S., Cameron, B., Dwyer, L., Taylor, T., Wong, E., &amp; Thomson, A. (2008). Technical Report 90064: Visitor accessibility in urban centrespp. 75). Available from http://www.crctourism.com.au/BookShop/BookDetail.aspx?d=626 at&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Packer, T., Small, J., &amp; Darcy, S. (2008). Technical Report 90044: Tourist Experiences of Individuals with Vision Impairment STCRC Technical Report Available from http://www.crctourism.com.au/BookShop/BookDetail.aspx?d=602&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

As of 2008, there were more than 50 million persons with disabilities in [[Europe]], and more than 600 million around the world. When expanded to include all beneficiaries of accessible tourism, as defined above, the number grows to some 130 million people affected in Europe alone.&lt;ref name="accessibletourism.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibletourism.org|title=ENAT - European Network for Accessible Tourism|accessdate=2008-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220001545/http://www.accessibletourism.org/| archivedate= 20 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report.pdf World Report on Disability] by World Health Organization and the World Bank in 2011, over 1 billion of people in the world had some disability, of whom nearly 200 million experienced severe difficulty in functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report.pdf|title=World Report On Disability 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In addition to the social benefits, the market represents an opportunity for new investment and new service requirements, rarely provided by key players in the tourism sector.

According to [[ENAT]], the European Network for Accessible Tourism, accessible tourism includes:&lt;ref name="accessibletourism.org"/&gt;
* '''Barrier-free destinations''': infrastructure and facilities
* '''Transport''': by air, land and sea, suitable for all users
* '''High quality services''': delivered by trained staff
* '''Activities, exhibits, attractions''': allowing participation in tourism by everyone
* '''Marketing, booking systems, web sites &amp; services''': information accessible to all

== Specific needs and requirements ==
Specific problems found by travellers or tourists with disabilities include:
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Inaccessible, or only partly accessible, web sites
* Lack of accessible airport transfer
* Lack of wheelchair accessible vehicles
* Lack of well-adapted hotel rooms
* Lack of professional staff capable of dealing with accessibility issues
* Lack of reliable information about a specific attraction's level of accessibility
* Lack of accessible restaurants, bars, and other facilities
* Lack of adapted toilets in restaurants and public places
* Inaccessible streets and sidewalks
* Lack of technical aids and disability equipment such as wheelchairs, bath chairs and toilet raisers

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Brief history ==

Europe and the United States of America are home to the majority of the existing companies in this niche. However, companies worldwide are starting to appear as the result of a growing need, largely driven by senior tourism, due to increasing life expectancy in developed countries. The United States requires ADA compliant ramp access to virtually all businesses and public places.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.modular-wheelchair-ramps.com/Modular_Ramps/ADA_Modular_Ramp_Specs.aspx
|title=ADA Specifications for Wheelchair use
|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and other northern European countries are increasingly prepared to receive tourists in wheelchairs, and to provide disability equipment and wheelchair accessible transport.

With the growth of the internet, online travel planning is also becoming more common, leading to the rise of online accessibility maps. Starting in 2016, Lonely Planet started offering online resources by country.

The '''Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]], which introduces a [[Statutory law|statutory]] [[minimum price]] for alcohol, initially 50[[Pence sterling|p]] per [[Unit of alcohol|unit]], as an element in the programme to counter [[alcohol problems]].

The Act was passed with the support of the [[Scottish National Party]], the [[Conservatives (Scotland)|Conservatives]], the [[Liberal Democrats (Scotland)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Greens (Scotland)|Greens]]. The opposition [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] refused to support the legislation because the Act failed to claw back an estimated £125m [[Windfall profits|windfall profit]] from alcohol retailers.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish minimum alcohol pricing passed by parliament|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18160832|publisher=BBC Scotland|accessdate=16 May 2013|location=Glasgow|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour MSP [[Malcolm Chisholm]], the former [[Minister for Health and Community Care]], disobeyed his [[party's whip]] and supported the government.

==Legal challenge==
A legal challenge to the minimum pricing legislation failed at the [[Court of Session]]. The [[Scotch Whisky Association]], the [[Confédération Européenne des Producteurs de Spiritueux]] and the [[Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins]] appealed the judgement.  The act was delayed, with a legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association being referred to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] by the [[Court of Session]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=30 April 2014|date=30 April 2014|publisher=BBC News Online|title=Minimum alcohol policy referred to European court|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27219905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of the court, delivered in December 2015, was that such legislation would only be lawful if alternative policies such as higher taxes would not be effective in protecting public health.  Scottish judges would be required to consider evidence on this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court sets conditions on Scotland’s minimum alcohol price|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/51b2a3c6-a95b-11e5-843e-626928909745.html#axzz3v8xtNMqw|accessdate=23 December 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=173249&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=621855|litigants=Scotch Whisky Association and Others v The Lord Advocate and The Advocate General for Scotland|opinion=ECLI:EU:C:2015:845|date=23 December 2015|accessdate=2016-07-27|court=ECJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2017, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] unanimously rejected the Scotch Whisky Association's case, ending the legal battle, arguing that minimum pricing was a "proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-41981909|title=Supreme Court backs Scottish minimum alcohol pricing|website=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2017-11-15|accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act came into effect on 1 May 2018.

The '''''appellation d'origine contrôlée''''' ('''AOC'''; {{IPA-fr|a.pɛ.la.sjɔ̃ dɔ.ʁi.ʒin kɔ̃.tʁo.le}}; "protected designation of origin") is the French certification granted to certain [[France|French]] [[geographical indication]]s for [[French wine|wines]], [[List of French cheeses|cheeses]], [[butter]]s, and other agricultural products, all under the auspices of the [[government]] bureau ''[[Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité|Institut national des appellations d'origine]]'', now called [[Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité]] (INAO). It is based on the concept of ''[[terroir]]''.

==History==
The origins of AOC date to the year 1411, when [[Roquefort cheese|Roquefort]] was regulated by a [[Parlement|parliamentary]] decree. The first French law on viticultural designations of origin dates to August 1, 1905,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecap-project.org/archive/fileadmin/ecapII/pdf/en/activities/national/Vietnam/ip_education/Unit_4_Trademarks.pdf EC-ASEAN Intellectual Property Rights Co-operation Programme, Unit 4. Trademarks and Geographical Indications]{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003073312/http://www.ecap-project.org/archive/fileadmin/ecapII/pdf/en/activities/national/Vietnam/ip_education/Unit_4_Trademarks.pdf |date=3 October 2011 }} (by Professor Michael Blakeney, October 2007), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the first modern law was set on May 6, 1919, when the Law for the Protection of the Place of Origin was passed, specifying the region and commune in which a given product must be manufactured, and has been revised on many occasions since then.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} On July 30, 1935, the ''Comité National des appellations d'origine'' (CNAO), with representatives of the government and the major winegrowers,  was created to manage the administration of the process for wines at the initiative of deputy [[Joseph Capus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=182|last=Bouneau|first=Christine|title=Dictionnaire des parlementaires d'Aquitaine sous la Troisième République |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYTAbg-XBhAC&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=2015-08-12 |date=1998|publisher=Presses Univ de Bordeaux|language=French|isbn=978-2-86781-231-6|chapter=CAPUS Joseph, Marie 1867-1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rhône wine|Rhône wine region]] [[Baron Pierre Le Roy Boiseaumarié]], a trained [[lawyer]] and winegrower from [[Châteauneuf-du-Pape]], successfully obtained legal recognition of the "[[Côtes du Rhône]]" appellation of origin in 1936.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} After World War II the committee became the public-private ''[[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine]]'' (INAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lukacs|first=Paul|title=Inventing Wine: A New History of One of the World's Most Ancient Pleasures: A New History of One of the World's Most Ancient Pleasures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdIbRb8wXRwC&amp;pg=PT199|accessdate=2015-08-12|page=PT200 |date=2013-10-21|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-23964-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AOC seal was created and mandated by French laws in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. On July 2, 1990, the scope of work of the INAO was extended beyond wines to cover other agricultural products .{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

AOCs vary dramatically in size. Some cover vast expanses with a variety of climatic and soil characteristics, while others are small and highly uniform. For example, the [[Côtes du Rhône AOC]] "covers some {{convert|400|km2|sqmi}}, but within its area lies one of the smallest AOCs, [[Château-Grillet AOC|Château-Grillet]], which occupies less than {{convert|4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of land."&lt;!--Presumably, this quotation is from Phillips 2000, but I don't have the text so I won't add it.--&gt;

==Enforcement==
The INAO guarantees that all AOC products will hold to a rigorous set of clearly defined standards. The organization stresses that AOC products will be produced in a consistent and traditional manner with ingredients from specifically classified producers in designated geographical areas. The products must further be aged at least partially in the respective designated area.

Under French law, it is illegal to manufacture and sell a product under one of the AOC-controlled geographical indications if it does not comply with the criteria of the AOC. AOC products can be identified by a seal, which is printed on the label in wines, and with cheeses, on the rind. To prevent any possible misrepresentation, no part of an AOC name may be used on a label of a product not qualifying for that AOC.

This strict label policy can lead to confusion, especially in cases where towns share names with appellations. If the town of origin of a product contains a controlled appellation in its name, the producer (who is legally required to identify the place of origin on the product label but legally prohibited from using the full town's name unless the product is an approved AOC product) is enjoined from listing anything more than a cryptic postal code. For example, there are a dozen [[Communes of the Aude department|townships in l'Aude]] that have Cabardès in their names, several of which are not even within the geographical boundaries of the [[Cabardès AOC]]. Any vineyard that produces wine in one of those towns must not mention the name of the town of origin on the product labels.

== Wine ==
There are currently over [[List of Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée wines|300 French wines]] entitled to the designation AOC on their label.

Legislation concerning the way vineyards are identified makes recognizing the various AOCs very challenging for wine drinkers not well-acclimated to the system. Often, distinguishing classifications requires knowledge of esoteric label laws such as "Unless the wine is from a ''[[Premier Cru]]'' vineyard, the vineyard name must be printed in characters no more than half the height of the ones used for the village name"&lt;ref name="joseph05"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, while the process of label approval is enforced to the millimetre, the quality control for the wine in the bottle is much less strict. While a blind taster must approve the wine for it to receive AOC classification, this tasting often occurs before the product is even bottled, and by a local expert who may well have ties to the local vintners. Even if the taster is objective, the wine sample may not be representative of the actual product, and there is almost no way to verify that the finished bottled product is the same as the original AOC sample.&lt;ref name="joseph05"/&gt;

==Cheese==
In 1925, [[Roquefort cheese|Roquefort]] became the first cheese to be awarded an AOC label, and since then over [[List of Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée cheeses|40 cheeses]] have been assigned AOC status.

==Meat==
[[File:Poulet de Bresse - Bresse Chicken.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Poulet de Bresse]]]]
On August 15, 1957, the National Assembly gave AOC status to the poultry of [[Bresse]] ([[Poulet de Bresse]]). In 2006, it awarded AOC status to [[Agneau de pré-salé|salt marsh lamb]] raised in the Bay of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]].&lt;ref name="FranceToday"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.francetoday.com/articles/2011/06/19/la_baie_de_somme.html | title=La baie de Somme | publisher=FrancePress | work=France Today | date=June 19, 2011 | accessdate=March 25, 2012 | author=Lascève, Agnès | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814002317/http://www.francetoday.com/articles/2011/06/19/la_baie_de_somme.html | archive-date=14 August 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lavender==
[[File:Abbaye de Sénanque.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lavandula angustifolia]] at the [[Abbaye de Sénanque]] in [[Gordes]] in the département of the [[Vaucluse]]]]

In 1981, the AOC label was given to Haute-Provence Lavender Essential Oil. It refers to a very high-quality production and concerns only the essential oil of fine lavender - ''[[Lavandula angustifolia]]''. The fields must be located within a specific territory at a minimum altitude of 800 meters. This geographic area covers 284 communities in the [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], [[Hautes-Alpes]], [[Drôme]] and [[Vaucluse]] regions.

==Lentils==
[[Lentil]]s from [[Le Puy-en-Velay]] have AOC status. (See: [[Le Puy Green lentil]].)

==Honey==
Honey from the island of [[Corsica]] has been given AOC status. There are six certified varietals of Corsican honey: Printemps, Maquis de printemps, Miellats du maquis, Châtaigneraie, Maquis d'été, and Maquis d'automne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inao.gouv.fr/|title=INAO - Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité|work=inao.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Butter==
France recognizes the [[Charente]], [[Charente-Maritime]], [[Vienne]], [[Deux-Sèvres]] and [[Vendée]] AOC regions for butter.&lt;br&gt;
The [[Beurre Charentes-Poitou]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[:fr:Beurre Charentes-Poitou|Beurre Charentes-Poitou]]&lt;/ref&gt; has been assigned AOC status in 1979.

==Spirits==
[[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], [[Calvados]], [[Cognac]] and [[Martinique]] [[Rhum agricole|Rhum Agricole]] all have AOC status.

==Other countries==
{{further|Appellation (wine)}}

===Europe===
Many other countries have based their [[appellation|controlled place name systems]] on the French AOC classification. [[Italy]]'s [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata]] and [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita]] followed the model set by the French AOC, and the [[EU]] standard for [[Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions]] (QWpsr) also corresponds closely.

While Spain's [[Denominación de Origen]] is very similar, the classification of [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] in 1925 and [[Sherry]] in 1933 preceded the French AOC system by a few years and show that Spain's DdO system developed parallel to France's AOC system to some extent. Similarly, [[Germany]]'s [[Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete]] is a wine classification system based on geographic region, but it differs from the AOC in important ways. Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete wines are commonly seen as less prestigious than [[Qualitätswein mit Prädikat]], making it more similar to the [[Vin de Pays]] or [[Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure]] systems.

[[Portugal]]'s [[Denominação de Origem Controlada]], [[Austria]]'s [[Districtus Austria Controllatus]], [[South Africa]]'s [[Wine of Origin]], and [[Switzerland]]'s [http://www.aoc-igp.ch AOC-IGP] are all similar to the French AOC system as well.

It appears also that AOC influenced the development of the [[European Union]]'s [[protected designation of origin]] (PDO) system.

=== Switzerland ===
{{Further|Geographical indications and traditional specialities in Switzerland}}

Switzerland has an ''appellation d'origine contrôlée'' certification for wines and an ''[[Appellation d'origine protégée (Switzerland)|appellation d'origine protégée]]'' certification for other food products. Before 2013, the ''appellation d'origine contrôlée'' was used for all products.

===United States===
The United States' [[American Viticultural Area]]s also follows the model set by the French AOC. The [[United States Department of the Treasury]]'s [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] even uses the legal terminology "Appellation of Wine Origin" to describe a vintage wine's location of origin. The AVA indication on a label indicates that 85% of the grapes for wine are grown in the designated AVA. Overall, the appellation of a wine simply says where the grapes are from, although there are some particularities. If the appellation is a state, 100% of the grapes which go into the wine must come from the specific state. If a winery gets grapes from a neighboring state (for example, a [[California]] vintner getting [[Pinot noir]] from [[Oregon]]), it may label the wine "Oregon", but if the state is not a neighboring one (for example, a California vintner getting [[Cabernet Sauvignon|Cabernet]] from [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]), the only permitted appellation is "American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winetrail.com/whatsinaname.html|title=WINES: What's in a Name?|work=winetrail.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], there is a government-sanctioned wine standard called [[Vintners Quality Alliance]] (VQA). It only applies to Canadian wines, and only the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[British Columbia]] regulate it.

===International trade issues===
Outside their home country, protecting the AOC status of certain products can face challenges, notably from a legal perspective. Some countries do not uphold a geographical indication system for their own products and thus, products which are labelled AOC in France, for instance, can be confronted on the international stage with foreign products claiming a similar geographical origin, even though it has not been recognized as such by the AOC system. In such a case, France (or another country) may enter into [[bilateral agreement]]s with other countries, whereupon the signatories accept to recognize a special status to a list of designated products, or it can also seek the development of rules or agreements at the [[World Trade Organization]] level.

Since each country has its own legal and agricultural framework, the specifics of each trade relationship are likely to vary. Also, there are often conflicts between [[trademark]]s and geographical indications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1000467|title=Quibbling Siblings: Conflicts between Trademarks and Geographical Indications|work=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in Canada, only Canadian wines can be VQA approved but other [[certification]] trademarks can be registered under the intellectual property legal regime. The owner of a certification trademark is then allowed to sell licences to be used for certain products meeting the owner's criteria. Thus in the case of wines, one AOC certification trademark is owned by the French Republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opic.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do;jsessionid=0001YRl_axpaozvs3UgVy5vAc_w:2RNHFRUL03?lang=eng&amp;status=OK&amp;fileNumber=0971322&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1|title=Canadian trade-mark data|work=ic.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another is owned by ''Maison des Futailles'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opic.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do;jsessionid=0001YRl_axpaozvs3UgVy5vAc_w:2RNHFRUL03?lang=eng&amp;status=OK&amp;fileNumber=0865316&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1|title=Canadian trade-mark data|work=ic.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; a wine producer, of which the [[government-owned corporation|publicly owned]] [[Société des alcools du Québec]] is a partner.

'''Assisted suicide''' is [[suicide]] committed with the aid of another person, sometimes a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=assisted+suicide&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0|title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry: assisted suicide|author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|work=ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used interchangeably with '''physician-assisted suicide''' ('''PAS'''), which involves a doctor "knowingly and intentionally providing a person with the knowledge or means or both required to commit suicide, including counseling about lethal doses of drugs, prescribing such lethal doses or supplying the drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://policybase.cma.ca/dbtw-wpd/Policypdf/PD07-01.pdf|title=EUTHANASIA AND ASSISTED SUICIDE (UPDATE 2007)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230512/http://policybase.cma.ca/dbtw-wpd/Policypdf/PD07-01.pdf|archivedate=December 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|publisher=Canadian Medical Association|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physician-assisted suicide is similar to but formally distinct from [[euthanasia]]. In cases of euthanasia the physician administers the means of death, usually a lethal drug. In physician-assisted suicide, it is required that a person of [[sound mind]] voluntarily expresses his or her wish to die and requests a dose of barbiturates that will end his or her life. The distinguishing aspect is that physician-assisted suicide requires the patient to self-administer the drugs.&lt;ref name="Harris2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris|first1=D |title=Assisted dying: the ongoing debate|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=82|issue=970 |year=2006 |pages=479–482 |issn=0032-5473|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2006.047530|pmc=2585714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Materstvedt &amp; Kaasa|first=|year=2002|title=Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in Scandinavia Ð with a conceptual suggestion regarding international research in relation to the phenomena|url=|journal=Palliative Medicine|volume=16|pages=19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for assisted suicide===
One argument for assisted suicide is that it reduces prolonged suffering in those with terminal illnesses. When death is imminent (half a year or less) patients can choose to have assisted death as a medical option to shorten what the person perceives to be an unbearable dying process.
Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation for seeking physician assisted suicide in the United States;&lt;ref name="Attitudes2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attitudes and Practices of Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide in the United States, Canada, and Europe 2016|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2532018|publisher=JAMA Network|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the three most frequently mentioned end‐of‐life concerns reported by Oregon residents who took advantage of the Death With Dignity Act in 2015 were: decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable (96.2%), loss of autonomy (92.4%), and loss of dignity (78.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OREGON DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACT: 2015 DATA SUMMARY|url=https://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year18.pdf|website=Oregon.gov|publisher=Oregon Health Authority|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oregon statistics====
A study of hospice nurses and social workers in Oregon reported that symptoms of pain, depression, anxiety, extreme air hunger and fear of the process of dying were more pronounced among hospice patients who did not request a lethal prescription for barbiturates, the drug used for physician assisted death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganzini|first1=L|last2=Harvath|first2=T.A.|last3=Jackson|first3=A.|title=Experiences of Oregon nurses and social workers with hospice patients who requested assistance with suicide|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=347 |issue=8 |page=585|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa020562#t=article|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa020562|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Journal of Palliative Medicine report on patterns of hospice use noted that Oregon was in both the highest quartile of hospice use and the lowest quartile of potentially concerning patterns of hospice use. A similar trend was found in Vermont, where AiD was authorized in 2013.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=S.|last2=Aldridge|first2=M.D.|last3=Gross|first3=C.P.|last4=Canavan|first4=M.|last5=Cherlin|first5=E.|last6=Johnson-Hurzeler|first6=R.|title=Geographic Variation of Hospice Use Patterns at the End of Life.|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|date=2015|volume=18 |issue=9 |page=778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oregon, in hospital death rates are at the lowest in the nation, at home death rates are at the highest in the nation, and violent suicide among hospice patients has been reduced significantly.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

In February 2016, Oregon released a report on their 2015 numbers.  During 2015, there were 218 people in the state who were approved and received the lethal drugs to end their own life.  Of that 218, 132 terminally ill patients ultimately made the decision to ingest drugs, resulting in their death.  According to the state of Oregon Public Health Division’s survey, the majority of the participants, 78%, were 65 years of age or older and predominately Caucasian, 93.1%.  72% of the terminally ill patients who opted for ending their own lives had been diagnosed with some form of cancer. In the state of Oregon’s 2015 survey, they asked the terminally ill who were participating in medical aid in dying, what their biggest end-of-life concerns were: 96.2% of those people mentioned the loss of the ability to participate in activities that once made them enjoy life, 92.4% mentioned the loss of autonomy, or their independence of their own thoughts or actions, and 75.4% stated loss of their dignity (Oregon Death With Dignity Act).

===Washington State statistics===
An increasing trend in deaths caused from ingesting lethal doses of medications prescribed by physicians was also noted in Washington: from 64 deaths in 2009 to 202 deaths in 2015.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Washington State Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt; Among the deceased, 72% had terminal cancer and 8% had neurodegenerative diseases (including ALS).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====U.S. polls====
Polls conducted by Gallup dating back to 1947 positing the question, "When a person has a disease that cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed to end the patient's life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it?" show support for the practice increasing from 37% in 1947 to a plateau of approximately 75% lasting from approximately 1990 to 2005. When the polling question was modified as such so the question posits "severe pain" as opposed to an incurable disease, "legalization" as opposed to generally allowing doctors, and "patient suicide" rather than physician-administered euthanasia, public support was substantially lower, by approximately 10% to 15%.&lt;ref name="Attitudes2016"/&gt;

A poll conducted by National Journal and Regence Foundation found that both Oregonians and Washingtonians were more familiar with the terminology "end-of-life care" than the rest of the country and residents of both states are slightly more aware of the terms palliative and hospice care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Living Well at the End of Life Poll|journal=The National Journal|date=February 2010|url=http://syndication.nationaljournal.com/communications/NationalJournalRegenceSeattleToplines.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey from the Journal of Palliative Medicine found that family caregivers of patients who chose assisted death were more likely to find positive meaning in caring for a patient and were more prepared for accepting a patient's death than the family caregivers of patients who didn’t request assisted death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganzini|first1=L|last2=Goy|first2=E.R.|last3=Dobscha|first3=S.R.|last4=Prigerson|first4=H.|title=Mental health outcomes of family members of Oregonians who request physician aid in dying|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|date=2009|volume=38, 807-815|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2009.04.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safeguards===
Many current assisted death/assisted suicide laws contain provisions that are intended to provide oversight and investigative processes to prevent abuse.

This includes eligibility and qualification processes, mandatory state reporting by the medical team, and medical board oversight. In Oregon and other states, two doctors and two witnesses must assert that a person's request for a lethal prescription wasn’t coerced or under undue influence.

These safeguards include proving one's residency and eligibility. The patient must meet with two physicians and they must confirm the diagnoses before one can continue; in some cases, they do include a psychiatric evaluation as well to determine whether or not the patient is making this decision on their own. The next steps are two oral requests, a waiting period of a minimum of 15 days before making your next request. A written request which must be witnessed by two different people, one of which cannot be a family member, and then another waiting period by your doctor in which they either say you're eligible for the drugs or not ("Death with Dignity").

The debate about whether these safeguards work is debated between opponents and proponents.

===Support organizations===
Listed below are some major organizations that support [[medical aid in dying]]:

'''Compassion and Choices'''

Compassion and Choices is a nonprofit organization in support of end of life care and claims to be the biggest nonprofit in the United States to do so. Created over 30 years ago the group provides patients with legal assistance as well as advice and information about medical aid in dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.compassionandchoices.org/|title=Compassion and Choices|last=|first=|date=|website=Compassion and Choices|access-date=May 2nd, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Death with Dignity National Center ====
The [[Death with Dignity National Center]] is a nonprofit organization that has been in existence since 1993.  This organization is most notably associated with the original writing and continued advocating of the Oregon Death with Dignity Law that was enacted on October 27, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.deathwithdignity.org/news/news/willametteweek031908.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-04-10 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080509072447/http://www.deathwithdignity.org/news/news/willametteweek031908.asp |archive-date=2008-05-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=April 2013}} Oregon, Washington, and Vermont laws state that mentally competent, and terminally ill adult patients can determine if they want to receive prescription medication so they can die in a humane and peaceful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deathwithdignity.org/learn/|title=Learn - Death With Dignity|newspaper=Death With Dignity|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dignitas (Switzerland) ====
[[Dignitas (Swiss non-profit organisation)|Dignitas]] helps Swiss nationals and foreigners to die by providing advice and lethal drugs. The legal pre-requisites are that a person must have either a terminal illness, an unendurable incapacitating disability or unbearable and uncontrollable pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22&amp;lang=en|title=Brochure of DIGNITAS|author=Karin|work=dignitas.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice they also accept mentally ill patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalexit.org/assisted_suicide_world_laws_page2.html|title=World Laws on Assisted Suicide - ERGO|work=finalexit.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those without a medical diagnosis. 25% of people in [[Switzerland]] who use assisted suicide do not have a terminal illness but are "tired of life",&lt;ref name="Andorno 246–253"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andorno|first=Roberto|date=2013-07-01|title=Nonphysician-Assisted Suicide in Switzerland|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/nonphysician-assisted-suicide-in-switzerland/446B61D157793D9AB4046A5C6BE28423|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|volume=22|issue=3|pages=246–253|doi=10.1017/S0963180113000054|issn=0963-1801}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the retired British art teacher who killed herself on 27 March 2014 "in part because she had become fed up with the modern world of emails, TVs, computers and supermarket ready meals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/retired-british-art-teacher-ends-life-at-dignitas-because-she-couldnt-adapt-to-modern-world-9242053.html|title=Retired British art teacher ends life at Dignitas ‘because she couldn't adapt to modern world'|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dignity in Dying ====
[[Dignity in Dying]] Is a United Kingdom based campaign group for the right to die, supporting members with advice and information relating to palliative care, and other end of life options. The organization frequently campaigns for the right of adults to make choices about their end of life options. The group was founded in 1935 and has since then been one of the bigger organizations to openly support assisted suicide in the UK. Their main goal is for the choice to choose how they die and to have a completely free choice to their end of life options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/|title=Dignity in Dying|last=|first=|date=|website=Dignity in Dying|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Humanists UK ====
[[Humanists UK]] is a British charity that promotes [[humanism]]. They support the right of those who are suffering incurably to have access to an assisted death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted Dying - Humanists UK |url=https://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/public-ethical-issues/assisted-dying/ |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and they have supported various court cases to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted dying appeals supported by the BHA dismissed by Supreme Court, Parliament urged to review law - Humanists UK |url=https://humanism.org.uk/2014/06/25/assisted-dying-appeals-supported-bha-dismissed-supreme-court-parliament-urged-review-law/ |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Dignity in Dying]], they do not think assisted dying should only be the right of the terminally ill.

==Opposition==

===Medical ethics===

==== Code of Ethics ====
The most current version of the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics clearly states that physician-assisted suicide is prohibited. It prohibits physician-assisted suicide because it is “fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer” and because it would be “difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-01-01|others=Lagay, Faith|title=Physician-Assisted Suicide: The Law and Professional Ethics|url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2003/01/pfor1-0301.html|journal=Virtual Mentor|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2003.5.1.pfor1-0301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hippocratic Oath====
Some doctors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kass|first=Leon R.|year=1989|title=Neither for love nor money: why doctors must not kill|url=http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/KASSwhydoctorsmust.pdf|journal=Public Interest|volume=94|pages=25–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; remind that physician-assisted suicide is contrary to the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which is the oath historically taken by physicians. It states "I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel".&lt;ref name="mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/hippooath.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Oath by Hippocrates|work=mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266652/Hippocratic-oath|title=Hippocratic oath|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original oath however has been modified many times and, contrary to popular belief, is not required by most modern medical schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html|title=Greek Medicine - The Hippocratic Oath|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also procedures forbidden by the Hippocratic Oath which are in common practice today, such as abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is the Hippocratic oath still relevant to practising doctors today? |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6629 |website=BMJ |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Declaration of Geneva====
The [[Declaration of Geneva]] is a revision of the Hippocratic Oath, first drafted in 1948 by the [[World Medical Association]] in response to forced euthanasia, eugenics and other medical crimes performed in [[Nazi Germany]]. It contains, "I will maintain the utmost respect for human life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-geneva/|title=WMA DECLARATION OF GENEVA|last=|first=|date=2017-11-06|website=www.wma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The International Code of Medical Ethics====
The [[International Code of Medical Ethics]], last revised in 2006, includes "A physician shall always bear in mind the obligation to respect human life" in the section "Duties of physicians to patients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c8/|title=WMA International Code of Medical Ethics|date=1 October 2006|work=wma.net|access-date=2014-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825225730/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c8/|archive-date=2012-08-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Statement of Marbella====
The Statement of Marbella was adopted by the 44th World Medical Assembly in Marbella, Spain, in 1992. It provides that "physician-assisted suicide, like euthanasia, is unethical and must be condemned by the medical profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/p13/|title=WMA Statement on Physician-Assisted Suicide|date=1 May 2005|work=wma.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition because of expansion to people with chronic disorders and disabilities===
{{main|Euthanasia and the slippery slope}}
There are many health care professionals,{{who|date=November 2016}} especially those concerned with bioethics, who are opposed to PAS due to the detrimental effects that the procedure can have with regard to vulnerable populations. This argument is known as the "[[slippery slope]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/opinion/07douthat.html|title=A More Perfect Death|author=Ross Douthat|date=September 6, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument encompasses the apprehension that once PAS is initiated for the terminally ill it will progress to other vulnerable communities, namely the disabled, and may begin to be used by those who feel less worthy based on their demographic or socioeconomic status. In addition, vulnerable populations are more at risk of untimely deaths because, "patients might be subjected to PAS without their genuine consent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mayo DJ, Gunderson M | title = Vitalism revitalized.... Vulnerable populations, prejudice, and physician-assisted death | journal = Hastings Cent Rep | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 14–21 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12362519 | doi = 10.2307/3528084 | jstor = 3528084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious stances===
====Catholicism====
The Roman Catholic Church acknowledges the fact that moral decisions regarding a person's life must be made according to one's own conscience and faith.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donovan|first=Kevin G.|year=1997|title=Decisions at the End of Life: Catholic Tradition|journal=Christian Bioethics: Non-Ecumenical Studies in Medical Morality|volume=3|pages=188–203|doi=10.1093/cb/3.3.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic tradition has said that one's concern for the suffering of another is not a sufficient reason to decide whether it is appropriate to act upon euthanasia. According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], "God is the creator and author of all life." In this belief system God created human life, therefore God is the judge when to end life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From the Roman Catholic Church’s perspective, deliberately ending one’s life or the life of another is morally wrong and defies the Catholic doctrine. Furthermore, ending one’s life deprives that person and his or her loved ones of the time left in life and causes enormous grief and sorrow for those left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Kathryn. “Mercy and Physician-Assisted Suicide”. Ethics &amp; Medics (2016): 41- 6, p1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/pope-francis-21152349|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current dominant figure of the Catholic Church. He affirms that death is a glorious event and should not be decided for by anyone other than God. Pope Francis insinuates that defending life means defending its sacredness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherry|first=Mark J.|year=2015|title=Pope Francis, Weak Theology, and the Subtle Transformation of Roman Catholic Bioethics|url=http://summit.csuci.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=101914008&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Christian Bioethics|volume=21|pages=84–88|via=EBSCOhost|doi=10.1093/cb/cbu045}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church teaches its followers that the act of euthanasia is unacceptable because it is perceived as a sin, as it goes against the Ten Commandments, [[Ten Commandments in Catholic theology|"Thou shalt not kill. (You shall not kill)"]] As implied by the fifth commandment, the act of assisted suicide contradicts the dignity of human life as well as the respect one has for God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roman-Catholicism|title=Roman Catholicism|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church also recognizes the story of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]]. It uses the story to call earnestly upon the Good Samaritan's actions and his love for his neighbor. In this tradition, the act of assisted suicide negates the respect and love we should have for our neighbors, as it mistakenly places the love God has for his followers in the hands of physicians.

As an alternative to the physician-assisted suicide and in order to alleviate pain, the Catholic Church proposes that terminally ill patients focus on religion and making peace with the Creator while receiving the love and mercy of their families and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Kathryn. “Mercy and Physician-Assisted Suicide”. Ethics &amp; Medics (2016): 41- 6, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church recommends that terminally ill patients should receive palliative care, which deals with physical pain while treating psychological and spiritual suffering as well, instead of physician-assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Yao, Teresa. “Can We Limit a Right to Physician-Assisted Suicide?” National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly (2016):16-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
While preservation of life is one of the greatest values in [[Judaism]], there are rare instances of suicide and assisted suicide appearing in the [[Bible]] and [[Rabbinic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Samuel 1:31:4-5, Daat Zekeinim Baalei Hatosfot Genesis 9:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval authorities debate the legitimacy of those measures and in what limited circumstances they might apply. The conclusion of the majority of later rabbinic authorities, and accepted normative practice within Judaism, is that suicide and assisted suicide can not be sanctioned even for a terminal patient in intractable pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steinberg|first1=Dr. Abraham|title=Encyclopedia Hilchatit Refuit|date=1988|publisher=Shaarei Zedek Hospital|location=Jerusalem|page=Vol. 1 Pg. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unitarian Universalism====
According to a 1988 General Resolution, "[[Unitarian Universalist]]s advocate the right to self-determination in dying, and the release from civil or criminal penalties of those who, under proper safeguards, act to honor the right of terminally ill patients to select the time of their own deaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right to Die with Dignity: 1988 General Resolution|url=http://www.uua.org/statements/right-die-dignity|website=Unitarian Universalist Association|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormonism====
The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is against euthanasia. Anyone who takes part in euthanasia, including "assisted suicide", is regarded as having violated the commandments of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies/21.3?lang=eng&amp;_r=1#213|title=Handbook 2: Administering the Church – 21.3 Medical and Health Policies|publisher= Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Church recognizes that when a person is in the final stages of terminal illness there may be difficult decisions to be taken. The Church states that 'When dying becomes inevitable, death should be looked upon as a blessing and a purposeful part of an eternal existence. Members should not feel obligated to extend mortal life by means that are unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/official-statement/euthanasia-and-prolonging-life|title=Euthanasia and Prolonging Life|work=LDS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the right to decline medical treatment is a basic right of the patient and the physician does not act unethically even if respecting such a wish results in the death of the patient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/e13b/|title=WMA Resolution on Euthanasia|date=6 October 2002|work=wma.net|access-date=2014-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124001332/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/e13b/|archive-date=2015-11-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutrality==

There have been calls for organisations representing medical professionals to take a neutral stance on assisted dying, rather than a position of opposition. The argument is that this would enable public debate on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted dying: it’s time to poll UK doctors |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.k593 |website=The BMJ |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NYS American Academy of Family Physicians Helps Persuade American Academy of Family Physicians to Adopt New Position on Medical Aid in Dying |url=https://www.compassionandchoices.org/nys-american-academy-of-family-physicians-helps-persuade-american-academy-of-family-physicians-to-adopt-new-position-on-medical-aid-in-dying/ |website=Compassion &amp; Choices |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] (MMS) voted to repeal their opposition to physician-assisted suicide and adopt a position of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Medical Society adopts several organizational policies at Interim Meeting |url=http://www.massmed.org/News-and-Publications/MMS-News-Releases/Massachusetts-Medical-Society-adopts-several-organizational-policies-at-Interim-Meeting/#.W8ccpWhKiUk |website=Massachusetts Medical Society |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP) voted to adopt a position of neutrality from one of opposition. This is contrary to the position taken by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), who oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=COD Addresses Medical Aid in Dying, Institutional Racism |url=https://www.aafp.org/news/2018-congress-fmx/20181010cod-hops.html |website=AAFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes of physicians and healthcare professionals==
It is widely acknowledged that physicians must play some role in the process of assisted suicide and euthanasia (as evident in the name "physician-assisted suicide"), often putting them at the forefront of the issue. Decades of opinion research shows that physicians in the US and several European countries are less supportive of legalization of PAS than the general public.&lt;ref name="seale" /&gt; In the US, although "about two-thirds of the American public since the 1970s" have supported legalization, surveys of physicians "rarely show as much as half supporting a move."&lt;ref name="seale" /&gt; However,  physician and other healthcare professional opinions vary widely on the issue of assisted suicide, as shown in the following tables.

Attitudes toward PAS vary by health profession as well; an extensive survey of 3733 medical physicians was sponsored by the National Council for Palliative Care, Age Concern, Help the Hospices, Macmillan Cancer Support, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, the MS Society and Sue Ryder Care showed that opposition to euthanasia and PAS was highest among Palliative Care and Care of the Elderly specialists, with more than 90% of palliative care specialists against a change in the law.&lt;ref name=seale&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seale C | title = Legalisation of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide: survey of doctors' attitudes | journal = Palliat Med | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–12 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19318460 | doi = 10.1177/0269216308102041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 study by Glasgow University's Institute of Law &amp; Ethics in Medicine found pharmacists (72%) and anaesthetists (56%) to be generally in favor of legalizing PAS. Pharmacists were twice as likely as medical GPs to endorse the view that "if a patient has decided to end their own life then doctors should be allowed in law to assist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=S.|title=Sometimes a Small Victory|date=1997|publisher=Institute of Law and Ethics in Medicine, University of Glasgow.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report published in January 2017 by NPR suggests that the thoroughness of protections that allow physicians to refrain from participating in the municipalities that legalized assisted suicide within the United States presently creates a lack of access by those who would otherwise be eligible for the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legalizing Aid In Dying Doesn't Mean Patients Have Access To It|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/01/25/511456109/legalizing-aid-in-dying-doesnt-mean-patients-have-access-to-it|publisher=NPR|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll in the United Kingdom showed that 54% of General Practitioners are either supportive or neutral towards the introduction of assisted dying laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Opinion - Dignity in Dying |url=https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/assisted-dying/public-opinion/ |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar poll on [[Doctors.net.uk]] published in the [[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] said that 55% of doctors would support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Assisted dying case ‘stronger than ever’ with majority of doctors now in support |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/health/assisted-dying-debate-bmj-doctors-majority-support/ |accessdate=4 August 2018 |date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the [[British Medical Association|BMA]], which represents doctors in the UK, opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physician-assisted dying - BMA |url=https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/ethics-a-to-z/physician-assisted-dying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality by country ==
{{see also|Legality of euthanasia}}
Voluntary euthanasia was legalized in the [[Netherlands]] (in 2002), [[Belgium]] (in 2002), [[Luxembourg]] (in 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luxembourg-euthanasia-idUSL2011983320080220|title=Luxembourg parliament adopts euthanasia law|author=Julien Ponthus|date= February 20, 2008|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada]] (in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Supreme court gives Parliament 4-month extension on doctor-assisted dying law  | date = January 15, 2016  | url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/supreme-court-gives-parliament-4-month-extension-on-doctor-assisted-dying-law-1.2739275 | accessdate =28 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Assisted suicide, where the patient has to take the final action themselves (unlike voluntary euthanasia), is legal in Canada, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland and parts of the United States. In the United States there are assisted dying laws restricted to terminally ill adults in [[Oregon]], [[Montana]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Vermont]], [[Hawaii]], [[California]], [[Colorado]] and [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/18/dc-physician-assisted-suicide-law-goes-effect/|title=D.C. physician-assisted suicide law goes into effect|publisher=The Washington Times|date=2017-02-18|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws require that the patient's attending physician certify mental competence. Oregon was the first United States state to legalize assisted suicide, which was achieved through popular vote. The Act was a citizens' initiative passed twice by Oregon voters. The first time was in a general election in November 1994 when it passed by a margin of 51% to 49%. An injunction delayed implementation of the Act until it was lifted on October 27, 1997. In November 1997, a measure was placed on the general election ballot to repeal the Act. Voters chose to retain the Act by a margin of 60% to 40%.&lt;ref name="FAQ DWDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/faqs.aspx#whocan|title=Frequently Asked Questions – About the Death With Dignity Act|publisher=Oregon Health Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Euthanasia in Australia}}

Assisted suicide is currently illegal throughout Australia with the exception of Victoria where the [[Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2017 (Victoria)]] was passed on 29 November 2017. It was legal in the [[Northern Territory]] for a short time under the [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995]].

===Belgium===
The "Euthanasia Act" legalized euthanasia in Belgium in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article_body.pl?language=nl&amp;pub_date=2002-06-22&amp;numac=2002009590&amp;caller=summary|title=Moniteur Belge - Belgisch Staatsblad|work=fgov.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article_body.pl?language=fr&amp;pub_date=2002-06-22&amp;numac=2002009590&amp;caller=summary|title=Moniteur Belge - Belgisch Staatsblad|work=fgov.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it didn't cover assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams M, Nys H | title = Comparative reflections on the Belgian Euthanasia Act 2002 | journal = Med Law Rev | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 353–76 | year = 2003 | pmid = 16733879 | doi = 10.1093/medlaw/11.3.353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Belgium partially legalized euthanasia with certain regulations:
::* The patient must be an adult and in a "futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::* The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents.
::* There need to be several requests that are reviewed by a commission and approved by two [[physician|doctors]].&lt;ref name="McDougall 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2015, Belgium had the most liberal assisted suicide laws in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWWkUzkfJ4M|publisher=[[Economist Group]]|accessdate=11 April 2016|date=10 November 2015|title=24 &amp; ready to die|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Belgium became the first country to authorize euthanasia for children, on request, if they have a terminal illness and understand the repercussions of their act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biznews.com/health/2014/12/12/right-die-terminal-divisions-state-euthanasia-europe/|title=Right to die: terminal divide in state of euthanasia in Europe - BizNews.com|date=2014-12-12|newspaper=BizNews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Canada}}
Suicide was considered a criminal offence in Canada until 1972. Physician-assisted suicide has been legal in the Province of Quebec since June 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hamilton |first=Graeme |date=December 10, 2015 |title=Is it euthanasia or assisted suicide? Quebec's end-of-life care law explained |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/is-it-euthanasia-or-assisted-suicide-quebecs-end-of-life-care-law-explained |newspaper=National Post |location=Toronto, Ontario |access-date=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared legal across the country because of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision ''[[Carter v Canada (AG)]]'', of February 6, 2015. After a lengthy delay, the House of Commons passed a Bill (C-14) in mid June 2016 that allows for doctor-assisted suicide.
Between December 10, 2015 and June 30, 2017, since the passing of Bill C-14, over 2,149 medically assisted deaths were documented in Canada. Research published by Health Canada illustrates physician preference for physician administered euthanasia, citing concerns of effective administration and prevention of the potential complications of self-administration by patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2nd Interim Report on Medical Assistance in Dying in Canada 2017|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/health-system-services/medical-assistance-dying-interim-report-sep-2017.html |publisher=Health Canada |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In China, assisted suicide is illegal under Articles 232 and 233 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000136|title=Euthanasia &amp; Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS) around the World - Euthanasia - ProCon.org|website=euthanasia.procon.org|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in People's Daily reported that "Nine people from Xi'an City in China made news when they 'jointly wrote to local media asking for euthanasia, or mercy killings'.[84] These people had uremia, a disease due to the failure of the kidneys, and expressed their "unbearable suffering and [an unwillingness] to burden their families any more".[85] In China, suicide or neglect is considered homicide and can be punished by three to seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/china-case-of-assisted-suicide-stirs-euthanasia-debate/|title=China: Case of Assisted Suicide Stirs Euthanasia Debate {{!}} Global Legal Monitor|date=2011-08-17|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhong’s{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} case rejected the legality of assisted suicide.

===Colombia===
In May 1997 the Colombian Constitutional Court allowed for the euthanasia of sick patients who requested to end their lives, by passing Article 326 of the 1980 Penal Code.&lt;ref name="McDougall 2008"/&gt; This ruling owes its success to the efforts of a group that strongly opposed euthanasia. When one of its members brought a lawsuit to the Colombian Supreme Court against it, the court issued a 6 to 3 decision that "spelled out the rights of a terminally ill person to engage in voluntary euthanasia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Whiting | first = Raymond | title = A Natural Right to Die: Twenty-Three Centuries of Debate | publisher =  | year = 2002 | location = Westport, Connecticut | pages = 41 | url =  | doi =  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the Supreme Court gave the government 30 days to create a comprehensive set of guidelines for doctors, to assist them in avoiding breaches of the law, as although technically legal, many physicians face lawsuits where they must prove that all legal requirements were met prior to the procedure. This fear of legal action has led many doctors to refuse to perform the procedure, in spite of its legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Sabrina|title=Colombia to Finalize Euthanasia Law in March|url=http://panampost.com/sabrina-martin/2015/02/19/colombia-to-finalize-euthanasia-law-in-march/|website=PanAm Post|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In Denmark, passive euthanasia, or the refusal to accept treatment is not illegal. But voluntary euthanasia when a patient actively tries to kill themselves is illegal. 71% of Denmark's population is in favor of legalizing assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Morten Ebbe Juul|last2=Andersen|first2=Martin Marchman|date=2014-07-01|title=Bioethics in Denmark: Moving from First- to Second-Order Analysis?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/bioethics-in-denmark/3C206154163C39C917893D432003668D|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|volume=23|issue=3|pages=326–333|doi=10.1017/S0963180113000935|issn=0963-1801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The controversy over legalising euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is not as big as in the United States because of the country's "well developed [[hospice]] care programme".&lt;ref name="McDougall 2008 84"&gt;{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000 the controversy over the topic was ignited with [[Vincent Humbert]].  After a car crash that left him "unable to 'walk, see, speak, smell or taste'", he used the movement of his right thumb to write a book, ''I Ask the Right to Die (Je vous demande le droit de mourir)'' in which he voiced his desire to "die legally".&lt;ref name="McDougall 2008 84"/&gt;  After his appeal was denied, his mother assisted in killing him by injecting him with an overdose of barbiturates that put him into a [[coma]], killing him two days later. Though his mother was arrested for aiding in her son's death and later acquitted, the case did jump-start new [[legislation]] which states that when medicine serves "no other purpose than the artificial support of life" it can be "suspended or not undertaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 President [[François Hollande]] said that France should hold a national debate on the issue, and stated his intention to introduce a bill to parliament before the end of the year. Opinion polls in France show that the majority of the public are in favor of an assisted suicide law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heneghan|first=Tom|title=Francois Hollande Pledges To Legalize Voluntary Euthanasia In France|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/francois-hollande-legalize-euthanasia-france_n_3529748.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however France's national ethics committee has advised against any change in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.fr/20130701/french-ethics-council-rejects-swiss-style-euthanasia|title=France set to reject Swiss-style euthanasia|work=thelocal.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Killing somebody in accordance with their demands is always illegal under the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German criminal code]] (Paragraph 216, "Killing at the request of the victim; mercy killing").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = German Criminal Code
| publisher = German Federal Ministry of Justice
| url = http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGB_000P216
|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assisting with suicide by, for example, providing poison or a weapon, is generally legal. Since suicide itself is legal, assistance or encouragement is not punishable by the usual legal mechanisms dealing with complicity and incitement (German criminal law follows the idea of "accessories of complicity" which states that "the motives of a person who incites another person to commit suicide, or who assists in its commission, are irrelevant").&lt;ref name="Wolfslast 2008 88"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Gabriele | last = Wolfslast | editor-last = Birnbacher | editor-first = Dieter | editor2-last = Dahl | editor2-first = Edgar | contribution = "Physician-Assisted Suicide and the German Criminal Law." | title = Giving Death a Helping Hand: Physician Assisted Suicide and Public Policy. An international Perspective. | year = 2008 | pages = 88 | place = Germany | publisher = Springer | url =  | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is assisting with suicide explicitly outlawed by the criminal code. There can however be legal repercussions under certain conditions for a number of reasons. Aside from laws regulating firearms, the trade and handling of controlled substances and the like (e.g. when acquiring poison for the suicidal person), this concerns three points:

====Free vs. manipulated will====
If the suicidal person is not acting out of his own free will, then assistance is punishable by any of a number of homicide offences that the criminal code provides for, as having "acted through another person" (§25, section 1 of the German criminal code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = German Criminal Code
| publisher = German Federal Ministry of Justice
| url = http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGB_000P25
|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually called "mittelbare Täterschaft"). Action out of free will is not ruled out by the decision to end one's life in itself; it can be assumed as long as a suicidal person "decides on his own fate up to the end [...] and is in control of the situation."&lt;ref name="Wolfslast 2008 88"/&gt;

Free will cannot be assumed, however, if someone is manipulated or deceived. A classic textbook example for this, in German law, is the so-called ''Sirius'' case on which the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] ruled in 1983: The accused had convinced an acquaintance that she would be reincarnated into a better life if she killed herself. She unsuccessfully attempted suicide, leading the accused to be charged with, and eventually convicted of attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejura-examensexpress.de/online-kurs/entsch_show_neu.php?Alp=1&amp;dok_id=2885|title=BGH Urteil vom 05.07.1983 (1 StR 168/83)|work=ejura-examensexpress.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The accused had also convinced the acquaintance that he hailed from the star [[Sirius]], hence the name of the case).

Apart from manipulation, the criminal code states three conditions under which a person is not acting under his own free will:

# if the person is under 14
# if the person has "one of the mental diseases listed in §20 of the German Criminal Code"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Gabriele | last = Wolfslast | editor-last = Birnbacher | editor-first = Dieter | editor2-last = Dahl | editor2-first = Edgar | contribution = "Physician-Assisted Suicide and the German Criminal Law." | title = Giving Death a Helping Hand: Physician Assisted Suicide and Public Policy. An international Perspective. | year = 2008 | pages = 90 | place = Germany | publisher = Springer | url =  | doi =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
# a person that is acting under a state of emergency.

Under these circumstances, even if colloquially speaking one might say a person is acting of his own free will, a conviction of murder is possible.

====Neglected duty to rescue====
German criminal law obliges everybody to come to the rescue of others in an emergency, within certain limits (§323c of the German criminal code, "Omission to effect an easy rescue").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = German Criminal Code
| publisher = German Federal Ministry of Justice
| url = http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGB_000P323c
|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as a [[duty to rescue]] in English. Under this rule, the party assisting in the suicide can be convicted if, in finding the suicidal person in a state of [[unconsciousness]], he does not do everything in his power to revive him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Gabriele | last = Wolfslast | editor-last = Birnbacher | editor-first = Dieter | editor2-last = Dahl | editor2-first = Edgar | contribution = "Physician-Assisted Suicide and the German Criminal Law." | title = Giving Death a Helping Hand: Physician Assisted Suicide and Public Policy. An international Perspective. | year = 2008 | pages = 92 | place = Germany | publisher = Springer | url =  | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if someone assists a person in committing suicide, leaves, but comes back and finds the person unconscious, he must try to revive him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Gabriele | last = Wolfslast | editor-last = Birnbacher | editor-first = Dieter | editor2-last = Dahl | editor2-first = Edgar | contribution = "Physician-Assisted Suicide and the German Criminal Law." | title = Giving Death a Helping Hand: Physician Assisted Suicide and Public Policy. An international Perspective. | year = 2008 | pages = 87–95 | place = Germany | publisher = Springer | url =  | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This reasoning is disputed by legal scholars, citing that a life-threatening condition that is part, so to speak, of a suicide underway, is not an emergency. For those who would rely on that defence, the Federal Court of Justice has considered it an emergency in the past.

====Homicide by omission====
German law puts certain people in the position of a warrantor (Garantenstellung) for the well-being of another, e.g. parents, spouses, doctors and police officers. Such people might find themselves legally bound to do what they can to prevent a suicide; if they do not, they are guilty of homicide by omission.

===Iceland===
Assisted suicide is illegal.  "At the current time, there are no initiatives in Iceland that seek the legalization of euthanasia or assisted suicide. The discussion on euthanasia has never received any interest in Iceland, and both lay people and health care professionals seem to have little interest in the topic. A few articles have appeared in newspapers but gained little attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimer-europe.org/Policy-in-Practice2/Country-comparisons/Healthcare-and-decision-making-in-dementia/Iceland|title=Iceland|work=alzheimer-europe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Assisted suicide is illegal." Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal under Irish law.

In March 2003, a vote to legalise assisted suicide was lost by a single vote (at the time, assisted suicide was not illegal, as suicide was permitted under the criminal code, but a person assisting someone to take their own life could face prosecution).&lt;ref name="Assisted Suicide Laws Around the World"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humphry|first1=Derek|title=Tread Carefully When You Help to Die, Assisted Suicide Laws Around the World|url=http://www.assistedsuicide.org/suicide_laws.html|website=Assisted Suicide|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After again failing to get royal assent for legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide, in December 2008 Luxembourg's parliament amended the country's constitution to take this power away from the monarch, the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/12/luxembourg-monarchy |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Luxembourg strips monarch of legislative role |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized in the country in April, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=191410|title=Luxembourg becomes third EU country to legalize euthanasia|work=Tehran Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613232728/http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=191410|archivedate= June 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
{{Main|Euthanasia in the Netherlands}}
Netherlands is the first country in the world formally to legalise euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/79%286%29580.pdf|title=Netherlands, first country to legalize euthanasia.|last=|first=|date=2001|work=The World Health Organization|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physician-assisted suicide is legal under the same conditions as euthanasia. Physician-assisted suicide became allowed under the Act of 2001 which states the specific procedures and requirements needed in order to provide such assistance. Assisted suicide in the Netherlands follows a medical model which means that only doctors of patients who are suffering "unbearably without hope"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Euthanasia is legalised in Netherlands |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/euthanasia-is-legalised-in-netherlands-5364802.html |website=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are allowed to grant a request for an assisted suicide. The Netherlands allows people over the age of 12 to pursue an assisted suicide when deemed necessary.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Euthanasia in New Zealand}}

Assisted suicide is illegal in New Zealand. Under Section 179 of the Crimes Act 1961, it is illegal to 'aid and abet suicide.'

===South Africa===
South Africa is struggling with the debate over legalizing euthanasia. Owing to the underdeveloped health care system that pervades the majority of the country, Willem Landman, "a member of the South African Law Commission, at a symposium on euthanasia at the World Congress of Family Doctors" stated that many South African doctors would be willing to perform acts of euthanasia when it became legalized in the country.&lt;ref name="McDougall 2008 80"&gt;{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; He feels that because of the lack of doctors in the country, "[legalizing] euthanasia in South Africa would be premature and difficult to put into practice [...]".&lt;ref name="McDougall 2008 80" /&gt;

On 30 April 2015 the High Court in [[Pretoria]] granted Advocate Robin Stransham-Ford an order that would allow a doctor to assist him in taking his own life without the threat of prosecution. On 6 December 2016 the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the High Court ruling.&lt;ref name="News24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sca-overturns-right-to-die-ruling-20161206 |title=

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Switzerland}}

Though it is illegal to assist a patient in dying in some circumstances, there are others where there is no offence committed.&lt;ref name="UZ"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Schwarzenegger|first=Christian|author2=Summers, Sarah J.| date=2005-02-03| title=Hearing with the Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill| journal=House of Lords Hearings|publisher=[[University of Zürich]] Faculty of Law |location=Zürich|url=http://www.rwi.uzh.ch/lehreforschung/alphabetisch/schwarzenegger/publikationen/assisted-suicide-Switzerland.pdf }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant provision of the Swiss Criminal Code&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1989-06-23| title=Inciting and assisting someone to commit suicide (Verleitung und Beihilfe zum Selbstmord) |journal=Swiss Criminal Code| pages=Article 115 |publisher=Süisse| language=German |location=Zürich}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to "a person who, for selfish reasons, incites someone to commit suicide or who assists that person in doing so will, if the suicide was carried out or attempted, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (''Zuchthaus'') of up to 5 years or a term of imprisonment (''Gefängnis'')."

A person brought to court on a charge could presumably avoid conviction by proving that they were "motivated by the good intentions of bringing about a requested death for the purposes of relieving "[[suffering]]" rather than for "selfish" reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Whiting | first = Raymond | title = A Natural Right to Die: Twenty-Three Centuries of Debate | publisher =  | year = 2002 | location = Westport, Connecticut | pages = 46 | url =  | doi =  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid conviction, the person has to prove that the deceased knew what he or she was doing, had capacity to make the decision, and had made an "earnest" request, meaning they asked for death several times. The person helping also has to avoid actually doing the act that leads to death, lest they be convicted under Article 114: Killing on request (Tötung auf Verlangen) -
A person who, for decent reasons, especially compassion, kills a person on the basis of his or her serious and insistent request, will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (Gefängnis). For instance, it should be the suicide subject who actually presses the syringe or takes the pill, after the helper had prepared the setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Christian Schwarzenegger and Sarah Summers of the University of Zurich's Faculty of Law|title=Hearing with the Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill|location=House of Lords, Zurich|date=3 February 2005 |url=http://www.rwi.uzh.ch/lehreforschung/alphabetisch/schwarzenegger/publikationen/assisted-suicide-Switzerland.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way the country can criminalise certain controversial acts, which many of its people would oppose, while legalising a narrow range of assistive acts for some of those seeking help to end their lives.

In July 2009, British conductor Sir [[Edward Downes]] and his wife Joan died together at a suicide clinic outside Zürich "under circumstances of their own choosing". Sir Edward was not terminally ill, but his wife was diagnosed with rapidly developing cancer.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887 |title=YOUthanasia |last=Lundin |first=Leigh |date=2009-08-02 |publisher=Criminal Brief |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the PBS [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|FRONTLINE]] TV program in the United States showed a documentary called "The Suicide Tourist" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]], and their decision to commit assisted suicide using [[Pentobarbital|sodium pentobarbital]] in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (Lou Gehrig's disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicidetourist/|title=The Suicide Tourist - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[Zurich]] held a referendum that asked voters whether (i) assisted suicide should be prohibited outright; and (ii) whether Dignitas and other assisted suicide providers should not admit overseas users. Zurich voters heavily rejected both bans, despite anti-euthanasia lobbying from two Swiss [[social conservative]] political parties, the [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland]] and [[Federal Democratic Union]]. The outright ban proposal was rejected by 84% of voters, while 78% voted to keep services open should overseas users require them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13405376|title=BBC News - Switzerland: Zurich votes to keep assisted suicide|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, The BBC televised the assisted suicide of Peter Smedley, a canning factory owner, who was suffering from motor neurone disease. The programme – ''Sir Terry Pratchett's Choosing To Die'' – told the story of Peter's journey to the end where he used The Dignitas Clinic, a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland, to assist him in carrying out the taking of his own life.
The programme shows Peter eating chocolates to counter the unpalatable taste of the liquid he drinks to end his own life.  Moments after drinking the liquid, Peter begged for water, gasped for breath and became red, he then fell into a deep sleep where he snored heavily while holding his wife's hand.  Minutes later, Peter stopped breathing and his heart stopped beating.

In Switzerland non-physician-assisted suicide is legal, the assistance mostly being provided by volunteers, whereas in Belgium and the Netherlands, a physician must be present. In Switzerland, the doctors are primarily there to assess the patient's decision capacity and prescribe the lethal drugs. Additionally, unlike cases in the United States, a person is not required to have a terminal illness but only the capacity to make decisions. About 25% of people in Switzerland who take advantage of assisted suicide do not have a terminal illness but are simply old or "tired of life."&lt;ref name="Andorno 246–253"/&gt;

===Uruguay===
{{main|Euthanasia in Uruguay}}

Assisted suicide, while criminal, does not appear to have caused any convictions, as article 37 of the Penal Code (effective 1934) states: "The judges are authorized to forego punishment of a person whose previous life has been honorable where he commits a homicide motivated by compassion, induced by repeated requests of the victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=del Uruguay|first1=Republica Oriental|title=Penal Code of Uruguay|url=http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/l1t2.htm|website=Parliament of Uruguay|accessdate=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730062858/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/l1t2.htm|archive-date=2015-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Lord Falconer]] of Thoroton tabled an Assisted Dying Bill in the House of Lords which passed its Second Reading but ran out of time before the General Election. During its passage peers voted down two amendments which were proposed by opponents of the Bill. In 2015 Labour MP [[Rob Marris]] introduced another Bill, based on the Falconer proposals, in the House of Commons. The Second Reading was the first time the House was able to vote on the issue since 1997. A Populus poll had found that 82% of the British public agreed with the proposals of Lord Falconer's Assisted Dying Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Dignity-in-Dying-Poll-March-2015-WEBSITE-DATATABLES.pdf|title=Dignity in Dying Poll|date=2015|work=Populus|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617124821/http://www.populus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Dignity-in-Dying-Poll-March-2015-WEBSITE-DATATABLES.pdf|archivedate= June 17, 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a free vote on 11 September 2015, only 118 MPs were in favour and 330 against, thus defeating the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34208624|title=Assisted Dying Bill: MPs reject 'right to die' law|authors=James Gallagher &amp; Philippa Roxby|date=11 September 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
Unlike the other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom, suicide was not illegal in Scotland before 1961 (and still is not) thus no associated offences were created in imitation. Depending on the actual nature of any assistance given to a suicide, the offences of [[murder]] or [[culpable homicide]] might be committed or there might be no offence at all; the nearest modern prosecutions bearing comparison might be those where a culpable homicide conviction has been obtained when drug addicts have died unintentionally after being given "hands on" non-medical assistance with an injection. Modern law regarding the assistance of someone who intends to die has a lack of certainty as well as a lack of relevant case law; this has led to attempts to introduce statutes providing more certainty.

Independent MSP Margo MacDonald's "End of Life Assistance Bill" was brought before the Scottish Parliament to permit assisted suicide in January 2010. The [[Catholic]] Church and the [[Church of Scotland]], the largest denomination in Scotland, opposed the bill.  The bill was rejected by a vote of 85–16 (with 2 abstentions) in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/38-EndLifeAssist/index.htm |title=End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill (SP Bill 38) |date=21 January 2010 |publisher=The Scottish Parliament |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11876821 |title=Margo MacDonald's End of Life Assistance Bill rejected |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 13 November 2013 by the late [[Margo MacDonald]] MSP and was taken up by [[Patrick Harvie]] MSP on Ms MacDonald's death. The Bill entered the main committee scrutiny stage in January 2015 and reached a vote in Parliament several months later; however the bill was again rejected.

In [[Montana]] (through the 2009 trial court ruling ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]''), the court found no public policy against assisting suicide, so consent may be raised as a defense at trial. Oregon and Washington specify some restrictions. It was briefly legal in [[New Mexico]] from 2014, but this verdict was overturned in 2015.

Oregon requires a physician to prescribe drugs but, it must be self-administered. For the patient to be eligible, the patient must be diagnosed by an attending physician as well as by a consulting physician, with a terminal illness that will cause the death of the individual within six months.  The law states that, in order to participate, a patient must be: 1) 18 years of age or older, 2) a resident of Oregon,  3) capable of making and communicating health care decisions for him/herself, and 4) diagnosed with a terminal illness that will lead to death within six months. It is up to the attending physician to determine whether these criteria have been met.&lt;ref name="FAQ DWDA"/&gt; It is required the patient orally request the medication at least twice and contribute at least one (1) written request. The physician must notify the patient of alternatives; such as palliative care, hospice and pain management. Lastly the physician is to request but not require the patient to notify their next of kin that they are requesting a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Assuming all guidelines are met and the patient is deemed competent and completely sure they wish to end their life, the physician will prescribe the drugs.&lt;ref name="euthanasia.procon.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000132|title=State-by-State Guide to Physician-Assisted Suicide - Euthanasia - ProCon.org|work=procon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was passed in 1997. As of 2013, a total of 1,173 people had had DWDA prescriptions written and 752 patients had died from ingesting drugs prescribed under the DWDA.&lt;ref name=DWDA2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Oregon Public Health Division – 2013 DWDA Report|url=http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year16.pdf|publisher=Oregon Health Authority|accessdate=28 November 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, there were approximately 22 assisted deaths per 10,000 total deaths in Oregon.&lt;ref name=DWDA2013/&gt;

Washington's rules and restrictions are similar, if not exactly the same, as Oregon's. Not only does the patient have to meet the above criteria, they also have to be examined by not one, but two doctors licensed in their state of residence. Both doctors must come to the same conclusion about the patient's prognosis. If one doctor does not see the patient fit for the prescription, then the patient must undergo psychological inspection to tell whether or not the patient is in fact capable and mentally fit to make the decision of assisted death or not.&lt;ref name="euthanasia.procon.org"/&gt;

In May 2013, Vermont became the fourth state in the union to legalize medical aid-in-dying. Vermont's House of Representatives voted 75–65 to approve the bill, Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act. This bill states that the qualifying patient must be at least 18, a Vermont resident and suffering from an incurable and irreversible disease, with less than six months to live. Also, two physicians, including the prescribing doctor must make the medical determination.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Nora. "Vermont Legislature Passes Assisted Suicide Bill."

In January 2014, it seemed as though New Mexico had inched closer to being the fifth state in the United States to legalize assisted suicide via a court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://newmexico.tylerhost.net/ServeDocument.ashx?SID=0730da82-c2ce-4331-9d34-98fe74190124&amp;RID=001664dd-e045-4d6c-b5ce-1294189b0a7a |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115190443/https://newmexico.tylerhost.net/ServeDocument.ashx?SID=0730da82-c2ce-4331-9d34-98fe74190124&amp;RID=001664dd-e045-4d6c-b5ce-1294189b0a7a |archive-date=2014-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "This court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private or more integral to the liberty, safety and happiness of a New Mexican than the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose aid in dying," wrote Judge Nan G. Nash of the Second District Court in Albuquerque. The NM attorney general's office said it was studying the decision and whether to appeal to the State Supreme Court. However, this was overturned on August 11, 2015 by the New Mexico Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling, that overturned the Bernalillo County District Court Ruling. The Court gave the verdict: "We conclude that aid in dying is not a fundamental liberty interest under the New Mexico Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Valerie|title=New Mexico court strikes down ruling that allowed assisted suicide|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/11/assisted-suicide-new-mexico-ruling-struck-higher-c/|website=Washington Times|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the citizens of [[Colorado]] approved Proposition 106, the Colorado End of Life Options Act, with 65% in favor. This made it the third state to legalize medical aid-in-dying by a vote of the people, raising the total to six states.

The punishment for participating in physician-assisted death (PAD) varies throughout many states.  The state of Wyoming does not “recognize common law crimes and does not have a statute specifically prohibiting assisted suicide”.  In Florida, “every person deliberately assisting another in the commission of self-murder shall be guilty of manslaughter, a felony of the second degree”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org/site/assisted-suicide-state-laws/|title=Assisted Suicide Laws in the United States {{!}} Patients Rights Council|website=www.patientsrightscouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brittany Maynard ====
A highly publicized case in the United States was the death of [[Brittany Maynard]] in 2014. After being diagnosed with terminal [[brain cancer]], Maynard decided that instead of suffering with the side effects the cancer would bring, she wanted to choose when she would die. She was residing in California when she was diagnosed, where assisted death was not legal. She and her husband moved to Oregon where assisted death was legal, so she could take advantage of the program. Before her death, she started the Brittany Maynard fund, which works to legalize the choice of ending one's life in cases of a terminal illness. Her public advocacy motivated her family to continue to try and get assisted death laws passed in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrittanyfund.org/about/|title=The Brittany Fund {{!}} About|website=thebrittanyfund.org|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published research==
A study approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health, the Dutch Ministry of Justice, and the Royal Dutch Medical Association reviewed the efficacy in cases of physician-aided dying (PAD).These studies, conducted in the Netherlands in 1990, 1991, 1995 and 1996 totaling 649 cases of which 114 cases were physician-assisted suicide and 535 were euthanasia, showed complications of any category were of higher frequency in cases of assisted suicide than in cases of euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Groenewoud JH, van der Heide A, Onwuteaka-Philipsen BD, Willems DL, van der Maas PJ, van der Wal G | title = Clinical Problems with the Performance of Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide in the Netherlands | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 342 | issue = 8 | pages = 551–6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10684914 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200002243420805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed that 32% of cases had complications. These included 12% with time to death longer than expected (45 min – 14 days), 9% with problems administering the required drugs, 9% with a physical symptom (e.g. nausea, vomiting, myoclonus) and 2% waking from coma. In 18% of cases the doctors provided euthanasia because of problems or failures with PAD.

The Portland (Oregon) Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Department of Psychiatry at the [[Oregon Health and Science University]] set out to assess the prevalence of depression in 58 patients who had chosen PAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganzini L, Goy ER, Dobscha SK | title = Prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients requesting physicians' aid in dying: cross sectional survey | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | pages = a1682 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18842645 | pmc = 2562435 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a1682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of 15 patients who went to receive PAD, three (20%) had a clinical depression. All patients who participated in the study were determined in advance to be mentally competent. The authors conclude that the "...current practice of the (Oregon) Death with Dignity Act may fail to protect some patients whose choices are influenced by depression from receiving a prescription for a lethal drug".

In a Dutch study of patients with severe and persistent symptoms requiring sedation, the researchers found that only 9% of patients received a palliative care consultation prior to being sedated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rietjens J, van Delden J, Onwuteaka-Philipsen B, Buiting H, van der Maas P, van der Heide A | title = Continuous deep sedation for patients nearing death in the Netherlands: descriptive study | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7648 | pages = 810–3 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18344245 | pmc = 2292332 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39504.531505.25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 1995 a group of doctors in the Netherlands interviewed and studied physicians in charge of giving patients the life ending drugs used in assisted suicide cases. They found that from 1990 to 1995 the use of this method rose slightly as more patients were turning to assisted suicide as an end of life option. From 1990 to 1995 the number of deaths from assisted suicide methods had risen from 486 in 1990 to 1466 in 1995. When interviewing these physicians they found that 88% had been asked for the life ending drugs and 77% reported they had asked for the drugs at a specific time. They also discovered there was a number of physicians equal to about 0.7% who had given their patients these life ending drugs without the patient's explicit consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 28, 1996|title=Euthanasia, Physician-Assisted Suicide, and Other Medical Practices Involving the End of Life in the Netherlands, 1990-1995|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199611283352227|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Breastfeeding Association''' ('''ABA''') is an [[Australia]]n organisation interested in the promotion of [[breastfeeding]] and protection of nursing mothers. Members of ABA include nursing mothers and their partners as well as health professionals such as doctors, lactation consultants and midwives.

ABA was founded in [[Melbourne, Victoria]] in 1964 as the '''Nursing Mothers' Association''', with the aim of giving mother-to-mother support to breastfeeding women. It is [[Australia]]'s leading source of breastfeeding information and support{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.

The association is supported by health authorities and specialists in infant and child health and nutrition, including a panel of honorary advisers{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. &lt;!--NEEDS A REFERENCE TO PROVE IT!..................ABA is recognised internationally as a source of accurate information about breastfeeding management and research{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.--&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
[[Mary Paton]] founded the Nursing Mothers' Association with five other mothers in Melbourne after having difficulty breastfeeding her first child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/australian-breastfeeding-association-celebrates-50th-anniversary-20140212-32ia7.html|title=Australian Breastfeeding Association celebrates 50th anniversary|last=Webb|first=Carolyn|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lack of support and accurate information about breastfeeding. Doctors and nurses at the time were not trained to handle breastfeeding problems and with the modern [[nuclear family]] there were few older women to turn to for advice, so the founding members supported each other, thus creating the model for mother-to-mother support than continues today. The other founders were Glenise Francis, Pat Patterson, Jan Barry (a member of the [[Coles Group|Coles family]]), Pauline Pick and Sue Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/birthday|title=Our 50th birthday in 2014|last=Association|first=Australian Breastfeeding|date=2013-04-24|newspaper=Australian Breastfeeding Association|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/sti/twiggbarnard.html|title='Mother to Mother': Mary Paton's Leadership in the Nursing Mothers' Association of Australia, 1964-1975|last=Twigg|first=Karen|last2=Barnard|first2=Jill|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting was held in Melbourne at Mary Paton's house on 13 February 1964 and the first newsletter was published later that year. Initially based primarily in Victoria, the ABA gradually spread to other states and territories with state representatives for the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia appointed in 1969, the national headquarters set up in [[Hawthorn, Victoria]] in 1970, and groups established in South Australia and Tasmania in 1971. The ABA had over 10,000 members by 1973.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2001, NMAA changed its name to Australian Breastfeeding Association.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=ABA is 50!|journal=Essence|volume=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at 2016, over 350,000 people have been members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/aboutaba|title=About the Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA)|last=Association|first=Australian Breastfeeding|date=2011-04-13|newspaper=Australian Breastfeeding Association|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
The ABA has groups across Australia which hold discussion meetings for mothers.  Breastfeeding education seminars are run for expectant parents; community education continues through all levels of education from [[pre-school]] to tertiary and members visits mothers in hospital to introduce the association and its services. ABA holds seminars and conferences for health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/aboutaba|title=About the Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA)|last=Association|first=Australian Breastfeeding|date=2011-04-13|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA is a [[Registered Training Organisation]] and provides training in breastfeeding counselling and community education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 20 March 2009, a national breastfeeding helpline was launched to improve on the previous state-level helplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/baby/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-helpline-launched-20090319-92yo|title=Breastfeeding helpline launched|last=ABA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helpline is staffed by volunteers who have completed the ABA's training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/breastfeeding-helpline|title=Breastfeeding Helpline|last=Association|first=Australian Breastfeeding|date=2011-09-25|newspaper=Australian Breastfeeding Association|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Sunday Mail news story in August 2012 reported that during an Australian Breastfeeding Association class the undercover reporter was told a baby died "every 30 seconds" from formula and "Formula is a little bit like AIDS,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian Breastfeeding Association class told baby formula 'was like AIDS|url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/hardline-counsellor-slams-bottlefeeding/story-e6frfkp9-1226458040994#ixzz24bHwygsq||accessdate=26 August 2012|work=The Sunday Mail (Qld)|date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association launched an internal investigation soon afterwards and in a media statement on 29 August 2012 said the "comments reported in the media are not the view of the association and the counsellor involved has been stood down from all duties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Release|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/sites/default/files/imce/Media_Statement_29_August_2012.pdf||accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2027">'''''Blainey v Ontario Hockey Association''''' (1986) 54 O.R. (2d) 513 is a famous decision of the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] on the relationship between the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' and the [[Ontario Human Rights Code]]. The Court held that Human Rights Codes in general are statutes and so must conform with the ''Charter''.

[[Justine Blainey-Broker|Justine Blainey]] was excluded from playing in the boys [[hockey]] league by the [[Ontario Hockey Association]]. She was unable to bring a claim against the OHA because the Ontario Human Rights Code contained a provision that allowed male-only sports teams and since the OHA was a private organization the ''Charter'' did not apply to it. Instead she challenged the constitutionality of the provision of the Human Rights Code as a violation of the equality provision of the ''Charter''.

The Court held that the exception for sports teams violated [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the ''Charter'' in a way that could not be justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]], and struck down the provision. 

The crown sided with Blainey as the Ontario Hockey Association was in violation of section 15 of the charter of rights and freedoms. Justine Blainey was later included in the division. Although they were content with the verdict, Blainey got levelled in her first game and was out for the season.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3169">'''Chronic radiation syndrome''' is a constellation of [[Radiobiology|health effects of radiation]] that occur after months or years of chronic exposure to high amounts. Chronic radiation syndrome develops with a speed and severity proportional to the [[radiation dose]] received, i.e., it is a deterministic effect of exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], unlike [[radiation-induced cancer]]. It is distinct from [[acute radiation syndrome]] in that it occurs at dose rates low enough to permit natural repair mechanisms to compete with the radiation damage during the exposure period. Dose rates high enough to cause the acute form (&gt; ~0.1 Gy/h) are fatal long before onset of the chronic form. The lower threshold for chronic radiation syndrome is between 0.7 and 1.5 [[gray (unit)|Gy]], at dose rates above 0.1 Gy/yr.&lt;ref name="Guskova2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gusev|first1=Igor A. |last2=Gusʹkova|first2=Angelina Konstantinovna |last3=Mettler|first3=Fred Albert |title=Medical Management of Radiation Accidents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6b4qDorN4wC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=2012-06-11|date=2001-03-28|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-7004-5|pages=15–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is primarily known from the [[Kyshtym disaster]], where 66 cases were diagnosed, and has received little mention in Western literature.&lt;ref name="Guskova2001" /&gt; A future [[ICRP]] publication, currently in draft, may recognize the condition but with higher thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ICRP|title=Early and late effects of radiation in normal tissues and organs: threshold doses for tissue reactions and other non-cancer effects of radiation in a radiation protection context|url=http://www.icrp.org/docs/Tissue%20Reactions%20Report%20Draft%20for%20Consultation.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103182422/http://www.icrp.org/docs/Tissue%20Reactions%20Report%20Draft%20for%20Consultation.pdf|archivedate=3 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Alexander V. Akleyev described the chronology of the clinical course or CRS while presenting at ConRad in [[Munich|Munich, Germany]]. In his presentation, he defined the latent period as being 1-5 years, and the formation coinciding with the period of maximum radiation dose. The recovery period was described as being 3-12 months after exposure ceased. He concluded that "CRS represents a systemic response of the body as a whole to the chronic total body exposure in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.bsbb.de/Conrad/AKLEYEV.pdf|title=Chronic Radiation Syndrome (CRS) in residents of the Techa riverside villages|last=Akleyev|first=Alexander|date=2013-05-13|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Akleyev's book "Comprehensive analysis of chronic radiation syndrome, covering epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathoanatomy, diagnosis and treatment" was published by [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642451164#aboutBook|title=Chronic Radiation Syndrome {{!}} Alexander V.

'''Delayed gratification''', or '''deferred gratification''', describes the process that the subject undergoes when the subject resists the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate   reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later.&lt;ref name = Carducci&gt;{{cite book |last=Carducci |first=Bernardo J. |year=2009 |chapter=Basic Processes of Mischel's Cognitive-Affective Perspective: Delay of Gratification and Conditions of Behavioral Consistency |pages=443–4 |title=The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-3635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay [[gratification]] to a host of other positive outcomes, including [[academic success]], physical health, [[psychological health]], and [[social competence]].

A person's ability to delay gratification relates to other similar skills such as [[patience]], impulse control, [[self-control]] and willpower, all of which are involved in self-regulation.

[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of psychoanalytic theory, discussed the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego.

==Background==

===The cognitive-affective processing system===
One well-supported theory of self-regulation, called the [[Cognitive-affective personality system]] (CAPS), suggests that delaying gratification results from an ability to use "cool" regulatory strategies (i.e., calm, controlled and cognitive strategies) over "hot regulatory strategies (i.e., emotional, impulsive, automatic reactions), when faced with provocation.&lt;ref name = Mischel10 /&gt; In "hot" processing, a person thinks intently about the object causing temptation, and especially about its most appealing elements, and is subsequently less able to resist the immediate reward. The use of cool strategies can translate to more control over behavior. Effective "cool" strategies involve distraction and restructuring the perception of the tempting stimulus to make it seem less appealing. For example, in one study of pre-adolescent boys with behavioral problems, the boys showed a reduction in verbal and physical aggression when they used "cool" strategies, such as looking away or distracting themselves.&lt;ref name= Romer /&gt; The most effective type of distraction seems to be imagining another desirable reward, which takes attention away from the immediate temptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Karasu |first=Sylvia R. |date=March 26, 2012 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-gravity-weight/201203/lead-us-not-temptation-the-neuroscience-behind-the-marshmallow-test |title=Lead Us Not Into Temptation: The Neuroscience Behind the Marshmallow Test |work=Psychology Today |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stanford marshmallow experiment===

The seminal research on delayed gratification – the now-famous "[[marshmallow experiment]]" – was conducted by [[Walter Mischel]] in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stanford University]]. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year-olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options: (1) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: "small reward now, bigger reward later." Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain "cool" distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding under the desk, singing songs,&lt;ref name = Lehrer&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehrer |first=Jonah |date=May 18, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer |title=Don't!: The Secret of Self Control |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste).&lt;ref name = Brooks&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/opinion/07brooks.html |title=Marshmallows and Public Policy |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan&gt;{{cite book |first=Marsha |last=Linehan |title=Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder |year=1993 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-89862-034-4}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children who waited longer, when re-evaluated as teenagers and adults, demonstrated a striking array of advantages over their peers. As teenagers, they had higher [[SAT]] scores, social competence, self-assuredness and self-worth, and were rated by their parents as more mature, better able to cope with stress, more likely to plan ahead, and more likely to use reason.&lt;ref name = Carducci/&gt; They were less likely to have [[conduct disorders]] or high levels of impulsivity, aggressiveness and hyperactivity.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Mischel11&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/scan/nsq081 |title='Willpower' over the life span: Decomposing self-regulation |year=2010 |last1=Mischel |first1=Walter |last2=Ayduk |first2=Ozlem |last3=Berman |first3=Marc G. |last4=Casey |first4=B.

Each minute that a preschooler was able to delay gratification translated to a .2% reduction in [[Body Mass Index]] 30 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.06.049 |title=Preschoolers' Delay of Gratification Predicts their Body Mass 30 Years Later |year=2013 |last1=Schlam |first1=Tanya R. |last2=Wilson |first2=Nicole L. |last3=Shoda |first3=Yuichi |last4=Mischel |first4=Walter |last5=Ayduk |first5=Ozlem |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=162 |pages=90–3 |pmid=22906511 |issue=1 |pmc=3504645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these positive outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward in favor of a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against [[rejection sensitivity]] (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds.&lt;ref name = Carducci /&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan /&gt; These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.

Forty years after the first marshmallow test studies, neuroimaging data has shed light on the neural correlates of delayed gratification. A team led by B. J. Casey, of [[Cornell University]], recruited 59 of the original participants – who are now in their mid-40s – and gave them a delayed gratification task. Instead of resisting marshmallows, these adults were instructed to suppress responses to images of happy faces, but not to neutral or fearful faces. Those who had been high delayers as pre-schoolers were more successful at controlling their impulses in response to the emotional faces (i.e., not pressing the button in response to happy faces), suggesting that the high delayers continued to show better ability to dampen or resist impulses.&lt;ref name = Casey&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2011PNAS..10814998C |laysummary=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/thinking-cap-delaying-gratification/ |laysource=The New York Times |laydate=September 20, 2011 |title=Behavioral and neural correlates of delay of gratification 40 years later |author1=Casey |first1=B.

The researchers hypothesized that high delayers would be more likely to use "cool" regulation strategies to control their responses, which would manifest as activation of the right [[prefrontal cortex]], whereas low delayers would use "hot" strategies, which would activate the [[ventral striatum]], an area also linked to addiction. Indeed, results showed this differential brain activity.&lt;ref name = Casey/&gt; This mirrors other fMRI research of delayed gratification conducted by Noah Shamosh and Jeremy Gray, of [[Yale University]], demonstrating that individuals who chose larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards (in hypothetical situations) showed greater brain activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = Phys.org&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02175.x |laysummary=http://phys.org/news140173735.html |laysource=Phys.org |laydate=Sep 9, 2008 |title=Individual Differences in Delay Discounting: Relation to Intelligence, Working Memory, and Anterior Prefrontal Cortex |year=2008 |last1=Shamosh |first1=Noah A. |last2=Deyoung |first2=Colin G. |last3=Green |first3=Adam E. |last4=Reis |first4=Deidre L. |last5=Johnson |first5=Matthew R. |last6=Conway |first6=Andrew R.A. |last7=Engle |first7=Randall W. |last8=Braver |first8=Todd S. |last9=Gray |first9=Jeremy R. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=904–11 |pmid=18947356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting one's ability==

===Neurocognitive factors===
The way that a person frames a situation heavily influences a decision's outcome.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.58.9.697 |title=A perspective on judgment and choice: Mapping bounded rationality |year=2003 |last1=Kahneman |first1=Daniel |journal=American Psychologist |volume=58 |issue=9 |pages=697–720 |pmid=14584987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on "hot" and "cool" strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what they are waiting for as a real reward by focusing on the reward's arousing, "hot" qualities (taste, smell, sound,feel, etc.) their self-control and delay of gratification decreases, while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract, "cool" qualities (shape, color, number, etc.), can enhance self-control and increase the delay. Optimal self-control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item, especially the arousing, "hot" qualities of a competing item.&lt;ref name = Lehrer/&gt; For example, delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy. This illustrates an individual's ability to manipulate his/her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal-directed purposes.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt;

Delaying gratification is the same as controlling the impulse for immediate gratification, which requires cognitive control.

The prefrontal cortex is also the part of the brain that determines the focus of a person's attention,&lt;ref name="Haines 2006"/&gt; which enables a better framing that facilitates delayed gratification.&lt;ref name= Lehrer/&gt;  During adolescence and early adulthood, the prefrontal cortex develops and matures to become more complicated and connected with the rest of the brain.&lt;ref name = Fair /&gt; Older children and adults find the deferment-of-gratification tasks easier than do young children for this reason.&lt;ref name =Fair/&gt; However, the relative ability to defer gratification remains stable throughout development.&lt;ref name = Lehrer/&gt; Children who can better control impulses grow up to be adults who also have better control.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt; Practicing deferred gratification is quite beneficial to cognitive abilities throughout life.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt;

===Behavioral factors===
Behaviorists focus on the acquisition and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. [[Applied behavior analysis|Behavior analysts]] capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It is important to note that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt; Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt;

Behavior theorists see delaying gratification as an adaptive skill.&lt;ref name = McComas&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2000.33-359 |title=Designing interventions that include delayed reinforcement: Implications of recent laboratory research |year=2000 |last1=Stromer |first1=R |last2=McComas |first2=J J |last3=Rehfeldt |first3=R A |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=359–71 |pmid=11051582 |pmc=1284263}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions.&lt;ref name = McComas /&gt; For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities.&lt;ref name = McComas /&gt; To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.

Behavioral researchers have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement.&lt;ref name = Begley /&gt; A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for a short amount of time and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued.&lt;ref name = Phys.org /&gt; Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0023-9690(80)90021-1 |title=An experimental analysis of impulsivity and impulse control in humans |year=1980 |last1=Solnick |first1=Jay V. |last2=Kannenberg |first2=Catherine H. |last3=Eckerman |first3=David A. |last4=Waller |first4=Marcus B. |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=11 |pages=61–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual thresholds for delay====
In a 2011 study, researchers tested to see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended on the amount of money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward.&lt;ref name = Begley /&gt; The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As [[prospect theory]] states, people are heavily loss-averse.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt; People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.&lt;ref name="Khaneman 2003"/&gt;

====Duration of time delay====
The duration of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-101 |title=Temporal discounting: Basic research and the analysis of socially important behavior |year=2001 |last1=Critchfield |first1=T S |last2=Kollins |first2=S H |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=34 |pages=101–22 |pmid=11317983 |issue=1 |pmc=1284292}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 study demonstrated that if a reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, the bulk of the participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.

====Behavioral training====

=====Applications in classroom settings=====
In a Year 3 elementary classroom in South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan was put into place. The study gave limits on the numbers of questions the children could ask, and if they did not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The [[token economy]] for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2011.44-451 |title=Using Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates to Reduce Children's Requests for Teacher Attention |year=2011 |last1=Austin |first1=Jennifer L |last2=Bevan |first2=Deborah |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=451–61 |pmid=21941378 |pmc=3177329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Applications to ADHD=====
Compared to neurotypical children, those with [[ADHD]] generally demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more than by the frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through the implementation of a simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased.&lt;ref name = Binder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2000.33-233 |title=A procedure to teach self-control to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |year=2000 |last1=Binder |first1=L M |last2=Dixon |first2=M R |last3=Ghezzi |first3=P M |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=233–7 |pmid=10885530 |pmc=1284241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Neef 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-397 |title=Assessment of impulsivity and the development of self-control in students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |year=2001 |last1=Neef |first1=N A |last2=Bicard |first2=D F |last3=Endo |first3=S |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=397–408 |pmid=11800181 |pmc=1284336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Neef&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.2005.146-02 |title=Behavioral Assessment of Impulsivity: A Comparison of Children with and Without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder |year=2005 |last1=Neef |first1=Nancy A |last2=Marckel |first2=Julie |last3=Ferreri |first3=Summer J |last4=Bicard |first4=David F |last5=Endo |first5=Sayaka |last6=Aman |first6=Michael G |last7=Miller |first7=Kelly M |last8=Jung |first8=Sunhwa |last9=Nist |first9=Lindsay |last10=Armstrong |first10=N |editor1-last=Lerman |editor1-first=Dorothea |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=38 |pages=23–37 |pmid=15898472 |issue=1 |pmc=1224407|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD.&lt;ref name = "Neef 2001"/&gt; In another study, three children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation of the quality of the reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.&lt;ref name = Neef /&gt;

===Across the lifespan===
At birth, infants are unable to wait for their wants and needs to be met and exhibit a defining lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt; Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kumst, S., &amp; Scarf, D. |title=Your wish is my command! The influence of symbolic modelling on preschool children's delay of gratification |journal=PeerJ |year=2015 |volume=3|pages=e774|doi=10.7717/peerj.774|pmid=25737814 |pmc=4338768 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/774/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of age====
Children under five years old display the least effective strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay.&lt;ref name = Mischel92 /&gt; Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name = Casey /&gt; Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01732.x |jstor=40064397 |title=Predicting Cognitive Control from Preschool to Late Adolescence and Young Adulthood |year=2006 |last1=Eigsti |first1=Inge-Marie |last2=Zayas |first2=Vivian |last3=Mischel |first3=Walter |last4=Shoda |first4=Yuichi |last5=Ayduk |first5=Ozlem |last6=Dadlani |first6=Mamta B. |last7=Davidson |first7=Matthew C. |last8=Aber |first8=J.

====Effects of gender====
Throughout 33 studies on gender differences, a small significant effect (r = .06) has been found&lt;ref name = Tobin /&gt; indicating that a base-rate of 10% more females are able to delay rewards than males, which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.198 |title=Self-discipline gives girls the edge: Gender in self-discipline, grades, and achievement test scores |year=2006 |last1=Duckworth |first1=Angela Lee |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E.

Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does.&lt;ref name = Silverman /&gt;

===Clinical factors===

====Contemporary clinical psychology perspectives====
Self-control has been called the "master virtue"&lt;ref name = Baumeister&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00086 |title=Virtue, Personality, and Social Relations: Self-Control as the Moral Muscle |year=1999 |last1=Baumeister |first1=Roy F. |last2=Juola Exline |first2=Julie |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1165–94 |pmid=10637991}}&lt;/ref&gt; by clinical and social psychologists, suggesting that the ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person's overall psychological adjustment. People with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing, self-esteem and openness to experience, as well as more productive ways of responding to anger and other provocations.&lt;ref name = Psychopedia /&gt; Early delay ability has been shown to protect against the development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life, such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name = Mischel11 /&gt; Meanwhile, many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification. The tendency to choose short-term rewards at the expense of longer-term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology.

A growing body of research suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice.&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt; In other words, self-control abilities are malleable,&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt; [[Exposure therapy]] is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes.&lt;ref name="Linehan" /&gt; For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.

===== Externalizing disorders =====
[[Externalizing disorders]] (i.e., acting-out disorders) show a clearer link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents,&lt;ref name="Mischel11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00816.x |title=Delay of Gratification, Psychopathology, and Personality: Is Low Self-Control Specific to Externaiizing Problems? |year=1996 |last1=Krueger |first1=Robert F. |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom |last3=Moffitt |first3=Terrie E. |last4=White |first4=Jennifer |last5=Stouthamer-Loeber |first5=Magda |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=64 |pages=107–29 |pmid=8656312 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults.&lt;ref name="Mischel11" /&gt; In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis.&lt;ref name="Romer" /&gt; A 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for [[IQ]] (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02347.x |title=Delay discounting of reward in ADHD: Application in young children |year=2011 |last1=Wilson |first1=Vanessa B. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Suzanne H. |last3=Musser |first3=Erica D. |last4=Schmitt |first4=Colleen F. |last5=Nigg |first5=Joel T. |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=256–64 |pmid=21083561 |pmc=3059765}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification,&lt;ref name="Phys.org" /&gt; and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.

===== Internalizing disorders =====
Difficulty delaying gratification also plays a role in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing disorders]] like [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Psychopedia" /&gt; A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. [[Procrastination]], which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barlow |first1=David H. |last2=Durand |first2=V. Mark |year=2011 |title=Abnormal Psychology, An Integrative Approach |edition=6th |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn=978-1-111-34365-1}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Capacity to Delay Reward Differentiates Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder|year=2014|first=Anthony|last=Pinto|doi= 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.09.007|journal=Biol Psychiatry|volume=75|pages=653–659|issue=8|pmc=3969772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear.&lt;ref name="Rehm"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(77)80150-0 |title=A self-control model of depression |year=1977 |last1=Rehm |first1=Lynn P. |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=787–804}}&lt;/ref&gt; A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate [[self-harm]] (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.04.009 |title=An experimental investigation of emotional willingness and physical pain tolerance in deliberate self-harm: The moderating role of interpersonal distress |year=2011 |last1=Gratz |first1=Kim L. |last2=Hepworth |first2=Claire |last3=Tull |first3=Matthew T. |last4=Paulson |first4=Autumn |last5=Clarke |first5=Sue |last6=Remington |first6=Bob |last7=Lejuez |first7=C.W. |journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |volume=52 |pages=63–74 |pmid=21220067 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.

====Psychoanalytic drives and impulses====
[[Sigmund Freud]] viewed the struggle to delay gratification as a person's efforts to overcome the instinctive, libidinal drive of the id. According to classic psychoanalytic theory, a person's psyche is composed of the [[id, ego and superego]].&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt; The id is driven by the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]: it wants physical pleasure, and it wants it now. The ego, operating under the [[reality principle]], serves to moderate the id's desire for instant gratification against the superego, which is guided by a person's internalized sense of morality.&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt; According to [[psychoanalytic]] theory, a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by intrapsychic conflict – the ego cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego – and experiences psychological distress, often in the form of anxiety or "neurosis".&lt;ref name = Barlow /&gt;

Other psychoanalytic researchers describe a more nuanced, and less universally positive, view of delayed gratification. [[David C. Funder]] and [[Jack Block]] theorized that a person's tendency to delay, or not delay, gratification is just one element of a broader construct called ego control, defined as a person's ability to modulate or control impulses.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; Ego control "ranges from ego undercontrol at one end to ego overcontrol at the other", according to Funder.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; These tendencies are thought to be relatively stable in each individual, such that someone who tends toward undercontrol will "grab whatever rewards are immediately available even at the cost of long-term gain" and someone who tends toward overcontrol will "delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost".&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; By this view, delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings, but inappropriate or even costly in other settings.

Funder and Block draw a distinction between the ego-control model, in which delayed gratification is seen as a general tendency to contain motivational impulses (whether or not it is adaptive in a specific instance), and the ego-resiliency model (supported by Mischel's research), in which delayed gratification is seen as a skill that arises only when it is adaptive.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; To tease apart these models, Funder and Block explored the association between ego control, ego resiliency, IQ and delayed gratification in adolescents. The adolescents had the choice between being paid $4 at each of six study sessions or delaying their payment until the last session, in which case they would also earn an addition $4 of "interest". The results supported both models of delayed gratification. The teens' tendency to delay gratification was indeed associated with IQ and with ego resiliency (e.g., higher delayers were rated as more responsible, consistent, likable, sympathetic, generous; less hostile, moody, self-indulgent, rebellious), but was also independently associated with ego control (e.g., higher delayers were rated as "tends toward over-control of needs and impulses" and "favors conservative values in a number of areas").&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt; The researchers noted that individual differences in ego control (i.e., overall impulsivity) may play a larger role in delayed gratification when the incentives are larger and more motivating.&lt;ref name = Funder /&gt;

Writing in 1998, Funder described delayed gratification as a "mixed bag". He concluded: "Participants who exhibited the most delay were not just 'better' at self-control, but in a sense they seemed unable to avoid it. [...] Delayers are in general smart and well-adjusted, but they also tend to be somewhat overcontrolled and unnecessarily inhibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0903_3 |title=On the Pros and Cons of Delay of Gratification |year=1998 |last1=Funder |first1=David C. |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=211–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental and social factors===

====Who's in control====
Factors affecting one's ability to delay gratification depend on whether the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at the will of the person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.&lt;ref name = Miller /&gt;

====Task engagement====
Engaging in work or an assigned task can generate an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person to wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.&lt;ref name=Mischel02 /&gt;

====Mother–child relationship====
The more positive emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies in order to delay gratification.&lt;ref name = Mischel00 /&gt; This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with social and interpersonal frustrations are similar to those utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown.&lt;ref name = Mischel00 /&gt; A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], [[self-control]] and emotional competency.&lt;ref name = Rodriguez  /&gt;

====Reliability of gratification====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marshmallow Graph.png|thumb|Mean wait time for children in unreliable vs. reliable environments]]  --&gt;Researchers have investigated whether the reliability of the reward affects one's ability to delay gratification.&lt;ref name = post /&gt; Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches what the person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity. For example, researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited. After the children successfully waited for the reward, better supplies could not be "found" and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape. Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification. Children who had learned that the researcher's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow, waiting only an average of three minutes. Conversely, children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes, with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for the researcher to return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows.&lt;ref name = post /&gt;

===Genetics and evolution===
Evolutionary theory can argue against the selection of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior.&lt;ref name = vanderBos&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2006.02.008 |title=Evolved to satisfy our immediate needs: Self-control and the rewarding properties of food |year=2006 |last1=van den Bos |first1=Ruud |last2=de Ridder |first2=Denise |journal=Appetite |volume=47 |pages=24–9 |pmid=16678304 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such cost is the basic [[opportunity cost]] associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time that could be used to find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref name = vanderBos/&gt; There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk.&lt;ref name = Fawcett&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2011.08.015 |title=When is it adaptive to be patient? A general framework for evaluating delayed rewards |year=2012 |last1=Fawcett |first1=Tim W. |last2=McNamara |first2=John M. |last3=Houston |first3=Alasdair I. |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=128–36 |pmid=21920413 |url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/29424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref name = vanderBos /&gt;

It is likely that there is a strong genetic component to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior.&lt;ref name = Lehrer /&gt; For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.

==Animal studies==

Delayed gratification or deferred gratification is an animal behavior that can be linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[tamarin]]s, [[marmoset]]s, rats, and pigeons.

===Delay discounting===
When animals are faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the [[hyperbolic discounting|discounting]] of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.12.016 |title=Decision Making: Don't Risk a Delay |year=2007 |last1=Kalenscher |first1=Tobias |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=R58–61 |pmid=17240330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.
To test for this theory, they gave the same test while varying the time between the opportunities to choose a reward. They found that as the interval increased, the number of times that the monkeys chose the more risky reward decreased.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher /&gt; While this occurred in macaque monkeys, the varying interval time did not affect pigeons' choices in another study. This suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed.&lt;ref name = Kalenscher /&gt;  When provided a choice between a small, short delay reward, and a large, long delay reward, there is an impulsive preference for the former. Additionally, as the delay time for the small/short and large/long reward increases, there is a shift in preference toward the larger, delayed reward.&lt;ref name = Fawcett /&gt; This evidence only supports hyperbolic discounting, not exponential.

===Ecological factors===
Although predicting reward preference seems simple when using empirical models, there are a number of ecological factors that seem to affect the delayed gratification behavior of animals. In real world situations, "discounting makes sense because of the inherent uncertainty of future payoffs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.024 |title=Decision Making: The Virtue of Patience in Primates |year=2005 |last1=Long |first1=Arwen |last2=Platt |first2=Michael |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=21 |pages=R874–6 |pmid=16271858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study looked at how reward discounting is context specific.&lt;ref name = StevensRosati/&gt; By differing the time and space between small and large rewards, they were able to test how these factors affected the decision making in [[tamarins]] and [[marmosets]]. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.

The physiological similarities between humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups. Future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.

'''Dental insurance''' is a form of [[health insurance]] designed to pay a portion of the costs associated with [[Dentistry|dental care]]. There are several different types of individual, family, or group dental insurance plans grouped into three primary categories: Indemnity, Preferred Provider Network (PPO), and Dental Health Managed Organizations (DHMO).

Generally dental offices have a [[Wikt:fee schedule|fee schedule]], or a list of prices for the dental services or procedures they offer. Dental insurance companies have similar fee schedules which is generally based on [[Usual, customary and reasonable|Usual and Customary dental services]], an average of fees in an area. The fee schedule is commonly used as the transactional instrument between the insurance company, dental office and/or dentist, and the consumer.

==Types of coverage==

=== Indemnity Dental Insurance Plan ===
With indemnity dental plans,  the insurance company generally pays the dentist a percentage of the cost of services. Restrictions may include the co-payment requirements, [[waiting period]], stated [[deductible]], annual limitations, graduated percentage scales based on the type of procedure, and the length of time that the policy has been owned.

=== {{Anchor|Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO)}}Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO) ===
Dental Health Maintenance Organization plans entail dentists contracting with a dental insurance company that dentists agree to accept an insurance fee schedule and give their customers a reduced cost for services as an In-Network Provider. Many DHMO insurance plans have little or no waiting periods and no annual maximum benefit limitations, while covering major dental work near the start of the policy period. This plan is sometimes purchased to help defray the high cost of the dental procedures. Some dental insurance plans offer free semi-annual preventative treatment. Fillings, crowns, implants, and dentures may have various limitations.

=== Participating Provider Network (PPO) ===
In the United States, Participating Provider Network or PPO, also referred to as Preferred Provider Organization, is an organization governed by medical doctors, hospitals, other health centers, and medical care providers. This organization has an agreement with an insurer or the third party administrator to provide health insurance to the people associated with their client at reduced or low rates. Participating Provider Network plan may work similar to a DHMO while using an In-Network facility. However, a PPO allows Out-of-Network or Non-Participating Providers to be used for service. Any difference of fees will become the financial responsibility of the patient, unless otherwise specified.

== Payouts ==
Dental insurance companies divide benefits, services, or procedures into categories and refer to them with American Dental Association (ADA) 3-4 digit code. As an example, Preventative and Diagnostic procedures often include exams (ADA code 0120), [[Dental radiography|x-rays]] (ADA code 0210), and [[Dental cleaning|basic cleanings]] or [[Preventive medicine#Prophylaxis|prophylaxis]] (ADA code 1110). Basic procedures often include [[Dental restoration|fillings]], [[Periodontology|periodontics]], [[endodontics]], and [[oral surgery]]. Major procedures often are [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[dentures]], and [[Dental implant|implants]]. Procedures such as [[periodontics]], [[endodontics]], and [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|oral surgery]] may be considered major, depending on the policy.

=== Restrictions ===
Some dental insurance plans may have an annual maximum benefit limit. Once the annual maximum benefit is exhausted any additional treatments may become the patient's responsibility. Each year, the annual maximum is reissued. The reissue date may vary as a calendar year, company fiscal year, or date of enrollment based on the specific plan.

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is a state of low mood and aversion to activity. It may be a normal reaction to occurring life events or circumstances, a symptom of a medical condition, a side effect of drugs or medical treatments, or a symptom of certain psychiatric [[syndrome]]s, such as the [[mood disorder]]s [[major depressive disorder]] and [[dysthymia]]. '''Depression in childhood and adolescence''' is similar to adult major depressive disorder, although young sufferers may exhibit increased irritability or aggressive and self-destructive behavior, rather than the all-encompassing sadness associated with adult forms of depression.&lt;ref name=Birmaher&gt;{{cite journal | author = Birmaher B., Ryan N.D., Williamson D.E., Brent D.A., Kaufman J., Dahl R.E., Perel J., Nelson B. | year = 1996 | title = Childhood and adolescent depression: A review of the past 10 years. Part I. | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 11| pages = 1427–1439 | doi=10.1097/00004583-199611000-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who are under stress, experience loss, or have attention, learning, behavioral, or anxiety disorders are at a higher risk for depression. Childhood depression is often comorbid with [[mental disorders]] outside of other mood disorders; most commonly [[anxiety disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]]. Depression also tends to run in families.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry. The Depressed Child, "Facts for Families," No. 4 (5/08)&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have developed different treatments to assist children and adolescents suffering from depression, though the legitimacy of the diagnosis of childhood depression as a psychiatric disorder, as well as the efficacy of various methods of assessment and treatment, remains controversial.

==Base rates and prevalence==
About 8% of children and adolescents suffer from depression.&lt;ref name=Eapen&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eapen Valsamma | year = 2012 | title = Strategies and challenges in the management of adolescent depression | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 7–13 | doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32834de3bd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the prevalence of young depression sufferers in Western cultures ranges from 1.9% to 3.4% among primary school children and 3.2% to 8.9% among adolescents.&lt;ref name=Kovacs&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kovacs M., Feinberg T.L., Crousenovak M.A., Paulauskas S.L., Finkelstein R. | year = 1984 | title = Depressive-disorders in childhood. 1. A longitudinal prospective-study of characteristics and recovery | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 229–237 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1984.01790140019002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found that among children diagnosed with a depressive episode, there is a 70% rate of recurrence within five years.&lt;ref name=Kovacs /&gt; Furthermore, 50% of children with depression will have a [[Relapse|recurrence]] at least once during their adulthood.&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kessler R.C., Avenevoli S., Merikangas K.R. | year = 2001 | title = Mood disorders in children and adolescents: An epidemiological perspective | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 12| pages = 1002–1014 | doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(01)01129-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no gender difference in depression rates up until age 15, after that age the rate among women doubles compared to men. However, in terms of recurrence rates and symptom severity, there is no gender difference.&lt;ref name=Hankin&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hankin B.L., Abramson L.Y., Moffitt T.E., Siilva P.A., McGee R. Angell | year = 1998 | title = Development of depression from preadolescence to young adulthood: Emerging gender differences in a 10-year longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 107 | issue = 1| pages = 128–1140 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.107.1.128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to explain these findings, one theory asserts that preadolescent women, on average, have more risk factors for depression than men. These risk factors then combine with the typical stresses and challenges of adolescent development to trigger the onset of depression.&lt;ref name=Nolen-Hoeksema&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nolen-hoeksema S., Girgus J.S. | year = 1994 | title = The emergence of gender differences in depression during adolescence | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 115 | issue = 3| pages = 424–443 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.3.424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicidal intent===
Like their adult counterparts, children and adolescent depression sufferers are at an increased risk of attempting or committing [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shaffer D, Gould MS, Fisher P ''et al.'' | year = 1996 | title = Psychiatric diagnosis in child and adolescent suicide | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 339–48 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1996.01830040075012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15-19 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hallfors Denise D. ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Adolescent depression and suicide risk: association with sex and drug behavior | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 224–231 | doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(04)00124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent males may be at an even higher risk of suicidal behavior if they also present with a conduct disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer D, Craft L. Methods of adolescent suicide prevention" ''Journal of Clinical Psychiatry'' 1999; 60(Suppl 2): 70-4; discussion 75-6, 113-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) found that up to 7% of adolescents who develop major depressive disorder may commit suicide as young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weissman MM, Wolk S, Goldstein RB ''et al.'' | year = 1999 | title = Depressed adolescents grown up | doi = 10.1001/jama.281.18.1707 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 281 | issue = | pages = 1707–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such statistics demonstrate the importance of interventions by family and friends, as well as the importance of early diagnosis and treatment by medical staff, to prevent suicide among depressed or at-risk youth.
However, some data showed an opposite conclusion. Most depression symptoms are reported more frequently by females; such as sadness (reported by 85.1% of women and 54.3% of men), and crying (approximately 63.4% of women and 42.9% of men). Women have a higher probability to experience depression than men, with the prevalences of 19.2% and 13.5% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez Molina|first1=Mariane Acosta|last2=Jansen|first2=Karen|last3=Drews|first3=Cláudio|last4=Pinheiro|first4=Ricardo|last5=Silva|first5=Ricardo|last6=Souza|first6=Luciano|title=Major depressive disorder symptoms in male and female young adults|journal=Psychology, Health &amp; Medicine|date=7 May 2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=136–145|doi=10.1080/13548506.2013.793369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk factor===

In childhood, boys and girls appear to be at equal risk for depressive disorders; during adolescence, however, girls are twice as likely as boys to develop depression. Before adolescence rates of depression are about the same in girls and boys, it is not until between the ages of 11-13 that is begins to change. Young girls around this age, physically, go through more changes than young boys which put that a higher risk for depression and hormonal imbalance. The gender gap in depression between adolescent men and women is mostly due to young women's lower levels of positive thinking, need for approval, and self-focusing negative conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvete|first=Esther|last2=Cardeñoso|first2=Olga|date=2005-04-01|title=Gender Differences in Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression and Behavior Problems in Adolescents|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-005-1826-y|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=179–192|doi=10.1007/s10802-005-1826-y|issn=0091-0627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent exposure to victimization or bullying was related to high risks of depression, ideation and suicide attempts compare to those not involved in bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klomek Anat Brunstein ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Bullying, depression, and suicidality in adolescents | doi = 10.1097/01.chi.0000242237.84925.18 | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 40–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine dependence is also associated with depression, anxiety, and poor dieting, mostly in young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Psujek|first=Jessica K.|last2=Martz|first2=Denise M.|last3=Curtin|first3=Lisa|last4=Michael|first4=Kurt D.|last5=Aeschleman|first5=Stanley R.|date=2004-02-01|title=Gender differences in the association among nicotine dependence, body image, depression, and anxiety within a college population|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460303001266|journal=Addictive Behaviors|volume=29|issue=2|pages=375–380|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2003.08.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although causal direction has not been established, involvement in any sex or drug use is cause for concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hallfors Denise D.

Adolescents with depression are also likely to have a family history of depression, though the correlation is not as high as it is for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fact Sheet|url=http://www.about-teen-depression.com/teen-depression.html|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2012/09/22/why-do-women-get-depressed-more-than-men/&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

===Comorbidity===

Research has shown that there is a high rate of comorbidity with depression in children with [[dysthymia]].&lt;ref name=Angold&gt;{{cite journal | author = Angold A., Costello E.J. | year = 1993 | title = Depressive co-morbidity in children and adolescents: Empirical, theoretical, and methodological issues | url = | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 150 | issue = 12| pages = 1779–1791 | doi=10.1176/ajp.150.12.1779}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a substantial comorbidity rate with depression in children with anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, and impaired social functioning.&lt;ref name=Birmaher /&gt;&lt;ref name=Angold /&gt; Particularly, there is a high comorbidity rate with anxiety, ranging from 15.9% to 75%.&lt;ref name=Angold /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brady&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brady E.U., Kendall P.C. | year = 1992 | title = Co-morbidity of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 244–255 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conduct disorders also have a significant comorbidity with depression in children and adolescents, with a rate of 23% in one longitudinal study.&lt;ref name=Paulauskas&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kovacs M., Paulauskas S., Gatsonis C., Richards C. | year = 1988 | title = Depressive-disorders in childhood. 3. A longitudinal-study of co-morbidity with and risk for conduct disorders | url = | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 205–217 | doi=10.1016/0165-0327(88)90018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond other clinical disorders, there is also an association between depression in childhood and poor psychosocial and academic outcomes, as well as a higher risk for substance abuse and suicide.&lt;ref name=Birmaher /&gt;

The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence may vary by race and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weller|first=Bridget E.|last2=Blanford|first2=Kathryn L.|last3=Butler|first3=Ashley M.|date=2018|title=Estimated Prevalence of Psychiatric Comorbidities in U.S. Adolescents With Depression by Race/Ethnicity, 2011-2012|journal=The Journal of Adolescent Health: Official Publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine|volume=62|issue=6|pages=716–721|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.12.020|issn=1879-1972|pmid=29784115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
According to the [[DSM-IV]], children must exhibit either a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities. These activities may include school, extracurricular activities, or peer interactions. Depressive moods in children can be expressed as being unusually irritable, which may be displayed by "acting out," behaving recklessly, or often reacting with anger or hostility. Children who do not have the cognitive or language development to properly express mood states can also exhibit their mood through physical complaints such as showing sad facial expressions (frowning) and poor eye contact. A child must also exhibit four other symptoms in order to be clinically diagnosed. However, according to the Omnigraphics ''Health References Series: Depression Sourcebook, Third Edition'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sutton|editor1-first=Amy|chapter=Depression in Children and Adolescents |title=Depression Sourcebook, 3rd Edition |publisher=Omnigraphics: Health Reference Series |year=2012|location=Detroit|pages=131–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more calculated evaluation must be given by a medical or mental health professional such as a physiologist or psychiatrist. Following the bases of symptoms, signs include, but are not limited to, an unusual change in sleep habits (for example, trouble sleeping or overly indulged sleeping hours); a significant amount of weight gain/loss by lack or excessive eating; experiencing aches/pains for no apparent reason that can found; and an inability to concentrate on tasks or activities. If these symptoms are present for a period of two weeks or longer, it is safe to make the assumption that the child, or anybody else for that matter, is falling into major depression.

===Correlation between adolescent depression and adulthood obesity===
According to research conducted by Laura P. Richardson et al., major depression occurred in 7% of the cohort during early adolescence (11, 13, and 15 years of age) and 27% during late adolescence (18 and 21 years of age). At 26 years of age, 12% of study members were obese. After adjusting for each individual's baseline body mass index (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), depressed late adolescent girls were at a greater than 2-fold increased risk for obesity in adulthood compared with their non-depressed female peers (relative risk, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-3.83). A dose-response relationship between the number of episodes of depression during adolescence, and risk for adult obesity was also observed in female subjects. The association was not observed for late adolescent boys or for early adolescent boys or girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1-last=Richardson |author1-first=LP |author2-last=Davis |author2-first=R |author3-last=Poulton |author3-first=R |author4-last=McCauley |author4-first=E |author5-last=Moffitt |author5-first=TE |author6-last=Caspi |author6-first=A |author7-last=Connell |author7-first=F |title=A longitudinal evaluation of adolescent depression and adult obesity |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |date=Aug 2003  |volume=157 |issue=8 |pages=739–45 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.157.8.739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correlation between child depression and adolescent cardiac risks===
According to research by RM Carney et al., any history of child depression influences the occurrence of adolescent cardiac risk factors, even if individuals no longer suffer from depression. They are much more likely to develop heart disease as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130315202640.htm |title=Depression in kids linked to cardiac risks in teens
  |vauthors=Carney RM, etal |date=15 May 2013 |website=Science Daily |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction from major depressive disorder in adults===
While there are many similarities to adult depression, especially in expression of symptoms, there are many differences that create a distinction between the two diagnoses. Research has shown that when a child’s age is younger at diagnosis, typically there will be a more noticeable difference in expression of symptoms from the classic signs in adult depression.&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kaufman J., Martin A., King R.A., Charney D. | year = 2001 | title = Are child-, adolescent-, and adult-onset depression one and the same disorder? | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 12| pages = 980–1001 | doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(01)01127-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major difference between the symptoms exhibited in adults and in children is that children have higher rates of internalization; therefore, symptoms of child depression are more difficult to recognize.&lt;ref name=Zahn-Waxler&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zahn-Waxler C., Klimes-Dougan B., Slattery M.J. | year = 2000 | title = Internalizing problems of childhood and adolescence: Prospects, pitfalls, and progress in understanding the development of anxiety and depression | doi = 10.1017/s0954579400003102 | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 443–466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One major cause of this difference is that many of the neurobiological effects in the brain of adults with depression are not fully developed until adulthood. Therefore, in a neurological sense, children and adolescents express depression differently.

==History==
Professionals first became aware of child abuse in the early 1980s, so it is possible that some of the young people identified with depressive disorders may have had a history of sexual abuse, which was not disclosed. This raises the question of what the outcome would have been in those young people if they had disclosed the abuse and received appropriate therapeutic interventions. It is well-known that childhood sexual abuse is a significant factor in the history of some adults with depressive syndromes.

In the past, [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) was not recognized, and [[hyperkinetic disorder]] was only rarely diagnosed. Some young people, especially those with comorbid conduct disorder and major depressive disorder, may have had undiagnosed and untreated ADHD. Before the use of psycho-stimulants, some young people may have been more vulnerable to development of depressive syndromes because of untreated attentional and other behavioural problems which reduce their self-esteem.

Although [[antidepressant]]s were used by child and adolescent psychiatrists to treat major depressive disorder, they may not always have been used in young people with a comorbid conduct disorder because of the risks of overdose in such a population. [[Tricyclic antidepressant]] were the predominant antidepressants used at that time in this population. With the advent of [[selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), child and adolescent psychiatrists probably began prescribing more anti-depressants in the comorbid conduct disorder/major depressive group because of the lower risk of serious harm in overdose. This raises the possibility that more effective treatment of these young people might also improve their outcomes in adult life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hynes|first=J|author2=N. McCune|title=Follow-up of childhood depression: historical factors|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=181|pages=166–167|pmid=12151295|doi=10.1192/bjp.181.2.166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
Among the psychological assessments for identifying whether or not children and adolescents are experiencing depression or depressive symptoms is the [[Children's Depression Inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kovacs M |title=The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) |journal=Psychopharmacol Bull|year=1985|volume=21|issue=4|pages=995–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2016, the USPSTF released an updated recommendation for the screening of adolescents ages 12 to 18 years for major depressive disorder (MDD). Appropriate treatment and follow-up should be provided for adolescents who screen positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1?ds=1&amp;s=adolescent%2520depression|title=Final Update Summary: Depression in Children and Adolescents: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There are multiple treatments that can be effective in treating children diagnosed with depression. [[Psychotherapy]] and medications are commonly used treatment options. In some research, adolescents showed a preference for psychotherapy rather than antidepressant medication for treatment.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bradley K.L., McGrath P.J., Brannen C.L., Bagnell A.L. | year = 2010 | title = Adolescents' attitudes and opinions about depression treatment | url = | journal = Community Mental Health Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 242–251 | doi=10.1007/s10597-009-9224-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For adolescents, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[interpersonal therapy]] have been empirically supported as effective treatment options.&lt;ref name=Birmaher /&gt; The use of antidepressant medication in children is often seen as a last resort; however, studies have shown that a combination of psychotherapy and medication is the most effective treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chakraburtty|first=Amal|title=Depression in Children|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-children|work=WebMD|publisher=WebMD, LLC.|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pediatric [[massage therapy]] may have an immediate effect on a child's emotional state at the time of the massage, but sustained effects on depression have not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jorm AF, Allen NB, O'Donnell CP, Parslow RA, Purcell R, Morgan AJ |title=Effectiveness of complementary and self-help treatments for depression in children and adolescents |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=185 |issue=7 |pages=368–72 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17014404 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment programs have been developed that help reduce the symptoms of depression. These treatments focus on immediate symptom reduction by concentrating on teaching children skills pertaining to primary and secondary control. While much research is still needed to confirm this treatment program’s efficacy, one study showed it to be effective in children with mild or moderate depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weisz J.R., Thurber C.A., Sweeney L., Proffitt V.D., LeGagnoux G.L. | year = 1997 | title = Brief treatment of mild-to-moderate child depression using primary and secondary control enhancement training | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 703–707 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.65.4.703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talk therapy===
There are three common types of talk therapy. These can assist people to live more fully and have a better life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An overview of talk therapy|url=http://www.thehealthcenter.info/talk-therapy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are encouraged to open up more emotionally and communicate their personal distress, while women are encouraged to be assertive of their own strengths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danielsson|first=Ulla E.|last2=Bengs|first2=Carita|last3=Samuelsson|first3=Eva|last4=Johansson|first4=Eva E.|date=2010-12-13|title="My Greatest Dream is to be Normal": The Impact of Gender on the Depression Narratives of Young Swedish Men and Women|url=http://qhr.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/12/10/1049732310391272|journal=Qualitative Health Research|language=en|pages=1049732310391272|doi=10.1177/1049732310391272|issn=1049-7323|pmid=21149850|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive therapy====
[[Cognitive therapy]] aims to change harmful ways of thinking and reframe negative thoughts in a more positive way. Aims of cognitive therapy include various steps of patient learning. They learn to monitor their negative thoughts, to become aware of the link between their thoughts, the affect their thoughts have on them &amp; their behavior, to become aware of and change the negative, depressive thoughts which affect their health and state of mind &lt;ref&gt;Aaron T Beck, 1979, ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression '', Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behavioral therapy====
[[Behavioral therapy]] helps change harmful ways of acting and gain control over behavior which is causing problems.

====Interpersonal therapy====
Interpersonal therapy helps one learn to relate better with others, express feelings, and develop better social skills.

====Psychotherapy====
Psychotherapy teaches coping skills while allowing the teens or children to explore feelings and events in a safe environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/conditions/depression-teens&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family therapy===
The principles of group dynamics are relevant to [[family therapy|family therapists]] who must not only work with individuals, but with entire family systems.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols &amp; Schwartz, Family Therapy: Concepts and Methods. Fourth Edition. Allyn &amp; Bacon 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Two key concepts that influence family therapy are the distinction between the process and content of group discussions, and role theory.

Therapists strive to understand not just what the group members say, but how these ideas are communicated (process). Therapists can help families improve the way they relate and thus enhance their own capacity to deal with the content of their problems by focusing on the process of their discussions.  Virginia Satir expanded on the concept of how individuals behave and communicate in groups by describing several family roles that can serve to stabilize expected characteristic behavior patterns in a family. For instance, if one child is considered to be a "rebel child", a sibling may take on the role of the "good child" to alleviate some of the stress in the family. This concept of role reciprocity is helpful in understanding family dynamics because the complementary nature of roles makes behaviors more resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family therapy historical overview|url=http://www.abacon.com/famtherapy/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Throughout the development and research of this disorder, controversies have emerged over the legitimacy of depression in childhood and adolescence as a diagnosis, the proper measurement and validity of scales to diagnose, and the safety of particular treatments.

===Legitimacy as a diagnosis===
In early research of depression in children, there was debate as to whether or not children could clinically fit the criteria for [[Major Depressive Disorder|major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chambers W.J., Puigantich J., Tabrizi M., Davies M. | year = 1982 | title = Psychotic symptoms in prepubertal major depressive disorder | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = 8| pages = 921–927 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1982.04290080037006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1970s, it has been accepted among the psychological community that depression in children can be clinically significant.&lt;ref name=Chambers /&gt; The more pertinent controversy in psychology today centers around the clinical significance of subthreshold mood disorders. This controversy stems from the debate regarding the definition of the specific criteria for a clinically significant depressed mood in relation to the cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Some psychologists argue that the effects of mood disorders in children and adolescents that exist (but do not fully meet the criteria for depression) do not have severe enough risks.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=the previous sentence doesn't makes sense}} Children in this area of severity, they argue, should receive some sort of treatment since the effects could still be severe.&lt;ref name=Kessler /&gt; However, since there has yet to be enough research or scientific evidence to support that children that fall within the area just shy of a clinical diagnosis require treatment, other psychologists are hesitant to support the dispensation of treatment.

===Diagnosis controversy===
In order to diagnose a child with depression, different screening measures and reports have been developed to help clinicians make a proper decision. However, the accuracy and effectiveness of certain measures that help psychologists diagnose children have come into question.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barret M.L., Berney T.P., Bhate S., Famuyiwa O.O., Fundudis T., Kolvin I., Tyrer S. | year = 1991 | title = Diagnosing childhood depression - who should be interviewed - parent or child - the Newcastle-child-depression-project | pmid = 1840754 | journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 159 | issue = 11| pages = 22–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions have also surfaced about the safety and effectiveness of antidepressant medications.&lt;ref name=Cheung&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheung A.H., Emslie G.J., Mayes T.L. | year = 2005 | title = review of the efficacy and safety and antidepressants in youth depression | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = 7| pages = 735–754 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement reliability====
The effectiveness of dimensional child self-report checklists has been criticized. Although literature has documented strong psychometric properties, other studies have shown a poor specificity at the top end of scales, resulting in most children with high scores not meeting the diagnostic criteria for depression.&lt;ref name=Kessler /&gt;  Another issue with reliability of measurement for diagnosis occurs in parent, teacher, and child reports. One study, which observed the similarities between child self-report and parent reports on the child's symptoms of depression, acknowledged that on more subjective symptom reports measures, the agreement was not significant enough to be considered reliable.&lt;ref name=Barrett /&gt; Two self-report scales demonstrated an erroneous classification of 25% of children in both the depressed and controlled samples.&lt;ref name=Fundudis&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fundudis T., Berney T.P., Kolvin I., Famuyiwa O.O., Barrett L., Bhate S., Tyrer S.P. | year = 1991 | title = Reliability and validity of 2 self-rating scales in the assessment of childhood depression | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 159 | issue = 11| pages = 36–40 | pmid = 1840756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large concern in the use of self-report scales is the accuracy of the information collected. The main controversy is caused by uncertainty about how the data from these multiple informants can or should be combined to determine whether a child can be diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name=Kessler /&gt;

==== Treatment issues ====

The controversy over the use of [[antidepressants]] began in 2003 when Great Britain's Department of Health stated that, based on data collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, [[paroxetine]] (an antidepressant) should not be used on patients under the age of 18.&lt;ref name=Cheung /&gt; Since then, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has issued a warning describing the increased risk of adverse effects of antidepressants used as treatment in those under the age of 18.&lt;ref name=Cheung /&gt; The main concern is whether the risks outweigh the benefits of the treatment. In order to decide this, studies often look at the adverse effects caused by the medication in comparison to the overall symptom improvement.&lt;ref name=Cheung /&gt; While multiple studies have shown an improvement or efficacy rate of over 50%, the concern of severe side effects – such as suicidal ideation or suicidal attempts, worsening of symptoms, or increase in hostility – are still concerns when using antidepressants.&lt;ref name=Cheung /&gt; However, an analysis of multiple studies argues that while the risk of suicidal ideation or attempt is present, the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.&lt;ref name=Bridge&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bridge J.A., Iyengar S., Salary C.B., Barbe R.P., Birmaher B., Pincus H.A., Ren L., Brent D.A. | year = 2007 | title = Clinical response and risk for reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in pediatric antidepressant treatment: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 297 | issue = 15| pages = 1683–1696 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.15.1683 | pmid=17440145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variability of these studies, it is currently recommended that if antidepressants are chosen as a method of treatment for children or adolescents, the clinician monitor closely for adverse symptoms, since there is still no definitive answer on the safety and overall efficacy.&lt;ref name=Cheung /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bridge /&gt;

[[Bill Baird (activist)|William Baird]] was charged with a felony for distributing contraceptive foams after [[lectures]] on birth control and [[population control]] at [[Boston University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060208012003/http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/630/ Eisenstadt v. Baird Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prochoiceleague.org/history.html Personal account of Plaintiff Bill Baird at prochoiceleague.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The prearranged violation of the law occurred on April 6, 1967 when Baird handed a condom and a package of contraceptive foam to a 19-year-old woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/03/22/the-short-history-of-our-right-to-contraceptives-eisenstadt-v-baird-40-years-later The Short History of Our Right to Contraceptives: Eisenstadt v. Baird 40 Years Later]&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Massachusetts]] law on "[[Crime against chastity|Crimes against chastity]]" ([http://law.onecle.com/massachusetts/272/21A.html Chapter 272, section 21A]), contraceptives could be distributed only by registered [[physician|doctors]] or [[pharmacists]], and only to married persons.

After Baird was convicted, an appeal resulted in partial overturn by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], which concluded that the lectures were covered by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protections. However, the court affirmed the conviction under contraceptive distribution laws. Baird filed a petition for a federal [[writ of habeas corpus]], which was refused by the federal district court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Baird v. Eisenstadt |vol=310 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=951 |pinpoint= |court=[[D.

Eisenstadt |vol=429 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1398 |pinpoint= |court=[[1st Cir.]] |date=1970 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/429/1398/433675/ |accessdate=2018-10-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, by Sheriff Eisenstadt, who had prosecuted the case, on the ground that Baird lacked [[standing (law)|standing]] to appeal, being neither an authorized distributor under the statute nor a single person.

==Supreme Court decision==
In a 6–1 decision&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Eisenstadt v. Baird|link=|volume=405|page=438|pin=|year=1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Justices Rehnquist and Powell were not sworn in on time to participate in the case), the Court upheld both Baird's standing to appeal and the First Circuit's decision on the basis of the [[Equal Protection Clause]], but did not reach the Due Process issues. The majority opinion was written by Justice [[William J. Brennan Jr.]] and joined by three other justices, [[William O. Douglas]], [[Potter Stewart]], and [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Brennan reasoned that, since Massachusetts did not (and perhaps could not under ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'') enforce its law against married couples, the law worked irrational discrimination by denying the right to possess contraceptives by unmarried couples.  He found that Massachusetts's law was not designed to protect public health and lacked a rational basis.

Brennan, writing for the Court, made four principal observations:

# Baird had standing to assert the rights of unmarried persons who wished to have access to contraceptives.
# Although states could constitutionally prohibit and punish sex outside of marriage, the Massachusetts law could not reasonably be held to advance that purpose, since a) fornication was a misdemeanor in Massachusetts, and a state could not reasonably wish to punish a misdemeanor by forcing an unwanted child on the fornicator; b) the state could not reasonably wish to punish the distributor of contraceptives as a felon for aiding and abetting the misdemeanor of fornication; c) the law did not prohibit the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons for the purpose of preventing sexually-transmitted diseases, and d) the law made no attempt to ensure that contraceptives legally obtained by a married person for the purpose of preventing pregnancy would not be used in an extramarital affair.
# The Massachusetts law could not reasonably be held to promote health, as whatever health risks posed by contraceptives were just as great for married persons as unmarried persons.
# The Massachusetts law could not be justified by the State's judgment that contraceptives are immoral ''per se'', because the morality of contraceptives does not depend on the marital status of those who use it.  It is possible that the Due Process right of privacy of married couples to use contraceptives recognized in ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' means that married couples have the right to have contraceptives distributed to them; if so, then unmarried people have that same right.  ("If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.")  But even if ''Griswold'' does not imply a Due Process right of married couples to be distributed contraceptives, the Equal Protection Clause prevents states from using the immorality of contraception as a basis for denying to unmarried people the same access to contraceptives as married people.

Justice Douglas, concurring, argued that since Baird was engaged in speech while distributing vaginal foam, his arrest was prohibited by the First Amendment.

Justice White, joined by Justice Blackmun, did not join Brennan's opinion but concurred in the judgment on narrower grounds. White and Blackmun declined to reach the issue of whether Massachusetts could limit distribution of contraceptives only to married couples. They argued that Massachusetts had asserted an implausible health rationale for limiting distribution of vaginal foam to licensed pharmacists or physicians.

Chief Justice Burger dissented alone, arguing that there were no conclusive findings available to the Court on the health risks of vaginal foam since that issue had not been presented to the lower courts, and thus no basis for the Court's finding that the Massachusetts statute served no public health interest. Burger also held that the Massachusetts statute independently advanced the state's interest in ensuring couples receive informed medical advice on contraceptives.

==Significance==
While Brennan's ruling conceded that states may prohibit sex outside of marriage, later cases have interpreted its most famous sentence&amp;mdash;"If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."—as recognizing the right of single people to procreate on the same basis as married couples, reasoning which would eventually be extended to a more general right to engage in sexual activity.  ''[[Carey v. Population Services International]]'', decided in 1977, struck down a New York law forbidding distribution of contraceptives to those under 16 but failed to produce a majority opinion and thus is not widely cited.  ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' in 1986 rejected the claim of homosexuals to a fundamental right to engage in [[sodomy]]. However, ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' overruled ''Bowers'' in 2003, citing ''Eisenstadt'' in support of this ruling, and recognized that consenting adults had a right to engage in private, consensual non-commercial sexual intercourse. Roy Lucas, a prominent abortion rights lawyer, assessed the case as  "among the most influential in the United States during the entire [20th] century by any manner or means of measurement."&lt;ref name=sLucas&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Roy|title=New Historical Insights on the Curious Case of Baird v. Eisenstadt |journal=Roger Williams University Law Review |date=Fall 2003|volume=IX|issue=1 |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eisenstadt v. Baird'' is mentioned in over 52 Supreme Court cases from 1972 through 2002.&lt;ref name=sLucas/&gt;  Each of the eleven U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit, as well as the Federal Circuit, has cited ''Eisenstadt v. Baird'' as authority.&lt;ref name="sLucas" /&gt;  The highest courts of all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have cited ''Eisenstadt v. Baird''.&lt;ref name="sLucas" /&gt;

[[File:55 Water Street and north wing.jpg|thumb|[[55 Water Street]] houses the company headquarters]]
'''EmblemHealth''' is one of the [[United States]]' largest nonprofit health plans. It is headquartered at 55 Water Street in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It is a $10 billion company with 3.1 million members.&lt;ref name="Crain"/&gt;

EmblemHealth was created in 2006 through the merger of Group Health Incorporated (GHI) and the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP). GHI and HIP had been operating as separate companies in the New York region since 1937 and 1947, respectively.&lt;ref name="healthplanone.com"&gt;{{cite web| website=healthplanone.com|url=http://healthplanone.com/articles/article_ghi.aspx|title=HIP &amp; GHI Agree to Merge to Create Largest Health Insurer in New York State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Group Health Incorporated (GHI) ===

GHI – originally named Group Health Association of New York – was established in 1937 to provide New York’s working families with access to medical services regardless of cost. This new health care model – built around a network of participating providers – was a precursor to today’s [[preferred provider organization]] (PPO).&lt;ref name="dfs.ny.gov"&gt;{{cite web|website=www.dfs.ny.gov |url=http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/hearings/hip_ghi_conv/planof_pdf/02_draftof.pdf |title=Plan of Conversion of the EmblemHealth Companies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518112007/http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/hearings/hip_ghi_conv/planof_pdf/02_draftof.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In order to expand its presence in the upstate New York market, GHI established GHI HMO as an incorporated entity in New York State in May 1999. The following month, GHI HMO acquired certain assets of Well Care Management Group, Inc.&lt;ref name="dfs.ny.gov"/&gt;

In August 2005, GHI Select HMO acquired the assets, including the membership, of ABC Health Plans, which provides managed care services to Medicaid, Family Health Plus and Child Health Plus enrollees in Manhattan and The Bronx, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=www.bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=23417887|title=Company Overview of ABC Health Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP) ===

In 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello LaGuardia convened a panel to explore the feasibility of offering pre-paid medical services to New Yorkers of “moderate means.”&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web| website=www.emblemhealth.com|url=http://www.emblemhealth.com/about-Us.aspx/|title=About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; That panel led to the incorporation of HIP in 1944 as the first health insurance plan for public service workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=laguardia.cuny.edu |url=http://www.laguardia.cuny.edu/uploadedFiles/Main_Site/Content/About/Docs/LaGLegacy-Reitano.pdf/ |title=Honoring the Namesake of Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing various medical centers throughout the city. More than 2,600 members of the Chefs, Cooks, Pastry Cooks and Assistants Local 89 became the first subscribers to HIP in 1947.&lt;ref name="About Us"/&gt;

In 1997, HIP began offering its members medical services through a physician provider network, in addition to its medical centers.&lt;ref name="dfs.ny.gov"/&gt;

On November 30, 2001, HIP acquired Vytra Health Plans Long Island along with certain related entities. Due to their steadily worsening financial condition, the decision was made to merge these entities into HIP, effective March 29, 2006.&lt;ref name="dfs.ny.gov"&gt;{{cite web|website=www.dfs.ny.gov |url=http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/hearings/hip_ghi_conv/planof_pdf/02_draftof.pdf |title=Plan of Conversion of the EmblemHealth Companies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518112007/http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/hearings/hip_ghi_conv/planof_pdf/02_draftof.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, HIP moved 2,000 of its employees to 55 Water Street, the largest corporate relocation to Lower Manhattan since the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="renewnyc.com"&gt;{{cite web|website=www.renewnyc.com|url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=eb1b5a57-d936-43ee-adbd-35b4c420d0b4|title=Governor and Mayor Open New HIP Headquarters in Lower Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to expand its service area, HIP acquired ConnectiCare Holding Company, Inc., a [[Connecticu]]t corporation (“ConnectiCare Holding”) and its subsidiaries, on March 10, 2005. ConnectiCare was later established as an independent HMO is 1982. ConnectiCare serves approximately 240,000 members in a service area that includes the entire State of Connecticut; [[Berkshire]], [[Hampshire]], [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden]], [[Franklin County, Massachusetts|Franklin]] and parts of [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester]] counties in [[Massachusetts]]; and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] and [[Orange County (New York)|Orange Counties]] in New York. ConnectiCare’s members have access to a provider network of approximately 19,900 health care providers.&lt;ref name="dfs.ny.gov"&gt;{{cite web|website=www.dfs.ny.gov |url=http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/hearings/hip_ghi_conv/planof_pdf/02_draftof.pdf |title=Plan of Conversion of the EmblemHealth Companies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518112007/http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/hearings/hip_ghi_conv/planof_pdf/02_draftof.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merger of GHI and HIP ===
On September 29, 2005, the boards of directors of GHI and HIP announced an agreement to merge the two companies. The resulting company – to be named EmblemHealth – would be governed by a Foundation made up of an equal number of directors from both companies.&lt;ref name="healthplanone.com"/&gt;

Anthony Watson, then chairman and CEO of HIP, managed the 2006 merger, which created the largest health insurer based in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=healthplanone.com|url=http://www.healthplanone.com/articles/article_ghi.aspx |title=HIP &amp; GHI Agree To Merge To Create Largest Health Insurer In New York State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Frank Branchini became chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Watson, who retired. Watson's compensation, $8.8 million in 2011, was often discussed. In contrast, Mark Wagar, president and CEO of [[Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield|Empire BlueCross BlueShield]], the largest New York insurer, was paid $2.2 million.&lt;ref name="Crain"/&gt;

Although discussions about for-profit conversion have taken place, the organization remains a non-profit.&lt;ref name="Crain"&gt;{{cite news|author=Benson, Barbara |url=http://www.ahipcoverage.com/2014/11/11/health-plans-extending-their-reach-to-help-consumers/ |title=Health Plans Exctending Their Reach to Help Consumers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082331/http://www.ahipcoverage.com/2014/11/11/health-plans-extending-their-reach-to-help-consumers/ |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As EmblemHealth ===

In November 2012, EmblemHealth began establishing a community presence in its service area by launching a hybrid care coordination and wellness program called Neighborhood Care. The first two Neighborhood Care facilities were located in [[Harlem]] and [[Cambria Heights, Queens]]. Two additional Neighborhood Care sites were subsequently established in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] in December 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=www.prnewswire.com|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emblemhealth-neighborhood-care-opens-in-chinatown-235581481.html|title=EmblemHealth Neighborhood Care Opens in Chinatown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Crown Heights in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=blog.emblemhealth.com|url=http://blog.emblemhealth.com|title=Care in Crown Heights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Neighborhood Care site is a brick-and-mortar health care retail location where members and non-members alike can receive in-person medical guidance, referral assistance, medication support and connections to appropriate social services. The facilities also host informational sessions, health screenings, health and wellness activities, exercise classes, and sponsorships of local farmers' markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com|url=http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/managed-healthcare-executive/content/tags/healthcare-stakeholders/payers-make-wellness-investments|title=Payers make wellness investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2015, it was announced that [[Karen Ignagni]], CEO of America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), would be leaving the industry’s powerful lobbying group to become President and CEO of EmblemHealth, effective September 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.nasdaq.com|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/karen-ignagni-to-be-emblemhealth-ceo-20150521-01057|title=Karen Ignagni to be EmblemHealth CEO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignagni, who spent more than 20 years with AHIP, replaced Frank Branchini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www3.ambest.com |url=http://www3.ambest.com/ambv/bestnews/newscontent.aspx?AltSrc=108&amp;refnum=182941 |title=AHIP’s Karen Ignagni Slated to Take Helm of EmblemHealth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529231051/http://www3.ambest.com/ambv/bestnews/newscontent.aspx?AltSrc=108&amp;refnum=182941 |archivedate=2015-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, EmblemHealth announced a partnership with AdvantageCare Physicians (ACPNY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.acpny.com|url=http://www.acpny.com/documents/acpny-overview|title=ACPNY Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, EmblemHealth announced a new partnership with the City of New York and the Municipal Labor Committee to provide expanded access to health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.prnewswire.com|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emblemhealth-pleased-to-partner-with-the-city-of-new-york-and-its-unions-to-expand-access-to-innovative-value-based-care-300228074.html|title=EmblemHealth Pleased to Partner with the City of New York and its Unions to Expand Access to Innovative, Value-Based Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership was also developed to support the City's goal of health care cost savings for NYC taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.crainsnewyork.com|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150401/HEALTH_CARE/150409990/mayor-details-3-4-billion-plan-for-lowering-health-care-costs.html|title=Mayor details $3.4 billion plan for lowering health care costs}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a strong focus on preventive and primary care – such as $0 copays and telemedicine services – Emblem worked with the City and its Unions to develop new, accessible benefits to City employees and their families.

On March 25, 2016, EmblemHealth announced a new two-year partnership agreement with [[Northwell Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160325/NEWS/160329915|title=EmblemHealth signs partnership with Northwell|work=Modern Healthcare|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emblemhealth.com"&gt;{{cite web|website=www.emblemhealth.com|url=http://emblemhealth.com/About-Us/Press-Room/Press-Releases/EmblemHealth-Northwell-Sign-New-Leadership-Agreement.aspx|title=EmblemHealth, Northwell Sign New Leadership Agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV|date=October 2014}}

'''Feminist Perspectives on Eating Disorders''' is a book edited by Patricia Fallon and others in which [[feminist]]s analyzed the impact of what they regard as [[sexist]] and oppressive of women on women's [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EOwSAF61G4C |author1=Fallon, Patricia |date=1996-10-01 |author2=Katzman, Melanie A |author3=Wooley, Susan C |title=Feminist perspectives on eating disorders |isbn=978-1-57230-182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists do not ''necessarily'' believe that society is the sole cause of an eating disorder, but that societal influences definitely play a role in these addictions (the craving to control one’s body and the euphoria established through weight loss or controlled food in-take) and that eating disorders thrive in this type of environment.

== History ==
When [[World War I]] (as well as [[World War II]]) began, many women had to work out of the household because their husbands were fighting in the war and the family needed financial support. Many women took jobs that were deemed masculine, including the production of war supplies. In reaction to this advertisers began to heavily market their products to women, to make them feel more feminine while doing “a man’s job”{{cn|date=December 2012}}. The marketing industry boomed with the growth of advertising in [[magazines]].

Until the 1920s women in America were kept “under wraps”, wearing clothing that covered almost every inch of skin (other than hands and heads). After getting the vote women began to wear clothes that displayed their arms and legs, heightening the issues of body image. Women grew concerned about the appearance of their limbs and tried to keep them smooth and desirable. The ideal figure changed, and women were expected to be more slender{{cn|date=December 2012}}. Inevitably, this is when the dieting craze began{{cn|date=December 2012}}. The average woman in the West however, has become far larger, even as the ideal has remained for a slender figure, with obesity being  as much 60 percent in many studies{{cn|date=December 2012}}. 

From this point forward women in the media grew smaller and smaller{{cn|date=December 2012}}. In 1965 [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] introduced [[Twiggy]], known for her large eyes, long eyelashes, and thin build. The media began to focus more on women’s bodies and because there are few positive female [[role model]]s in the media, women tried to imitate these figures.

With the average model weighing 23% less than the average woman, ideal body image becomes virtually impossible (Wolf, 184). At any given time 25% of American women are dieting (Wolf, 185). Between 5-10% of American women are [[anorexic]] (Brumberg, 20).  Between 90-95% of anorexics and bulimics are women (Wolf, 181). On some college campuses 1 in 5 women have an eating disorder (Wolf, 182). It is also reported that 5 to 15% of hospitalized anorexics die while in treatment, one of the highest fatality rates for mental diseases (Brumberg, 24). These alarming statistics further prove that American culture affects eating disordered behavior and allows these behaviors to thrive.

Feminists want to take action against what they claim to be harmful images the media uses against its viewers. Few efforts have been made to reverse this possible epidemic as people tend to become desensitized to such images and may not recognize their possibly harmful potential. Recently, the cosmetic manufacturers of [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] have promoted their “[[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty|Campaign for Real Beauty]]”. This campaign uses many different body types to advertise their products, including overweight women, older women, and women with imperfections. [[Tyra Banks]] has also made efforts to expose the “less than ideal” body types. Banks has taken advantage of her fame to promote different body figures. The new talk show host has publicly defended her recent weight gain and attempts to deliver the message that being sexy has nothing to do with being thin or healthy.

Media has also been blamed for poor body image and eating disorders in women.  Magazines, TV shows, and various other advertisements show thin models as having the "ideal body type" for women.  Some scholars argue that these types of media items can enforce poor eating habits and eating disorder-like behavior. The other factor may be the growth of clinical obesity in the average woman, but the opposing direction being taken in the figures of media personalities.

However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferguson |first=C. |author2=Winegard, B. |author3=Winegard, B.M. |title=Who is the fairest one of all: How evolution guides peer and media influences on female body dissatisfaction |journal=Review of General Psychology |date=March 2011 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=11–28 |url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |doi=10.1037/a0022607 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65q5xHqLw?url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders, especially severe eating disorders like anorexia nervosa.

== Main Types of Eating Disorders ==
Eating disorders describe illnesses that are characterized by irregular eating habits and severe distress or concern about body weight or shape. Eating disturbances may include inadequate or excessive food intake, which can ultimately damage an individual’s well being. According to the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), the most common forms of eating disorders include Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, and Binge-Eating Disorder, and these illnesses primarily affect girls and women (APA). People with anorexia nervosa have a “distorted body image” that causes them to see themselves as overweight even when they are dangerously thin (APA). Individuals often refuse to eat, exercise compulsively, and develop unusual habits such as refusing to eat in front of others. They lose large amounts of weight and may even starve to death (APA). People with anorexia feel they can never be thin enough and continue to see themselves as “fat” despite extreme weight loss. 
Additionally, individuals with bulimia nervosa eat excessive quantities, then “purge their bodies of the food and calories they fear by using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics; vomiting; or exercising” (APA). Often acting in secrecy, they feel disgusted and ashamed as they binge, yet relieved of tension and negative emotions once their stomachs are empty again (APA). Like people with bulimia, those with binge eating disorder experience “frequent episodes of out-of-control eating” (APA). The difference is that binge eaters do not purge their bodies of excess calories. Another category of eating disorders is “eating not otherwise specified” (EDNOS), in which individuals have eating-related problems, but do not meet the official criteria for anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating.

== Signs and Symptoms ==
For some people, a preoccupation with food becomes a way to gain control over one aspect of their lives. Although it may start out as simply eating a bit more or less than usual, the behavior can spiral out of control and take over the person’s life. Eating disorders are a serious medical problem that can have long-term health consequences if left untreated. It is common for people with eating disorders to hide their unhealthy behaviors, so it can be difficult to recognize the signs of an eating disorder, especially early on. 
According to [[WebMD]], the signs of anorexia can be “subtle at first because it develops gradually” (WebMD). It may begin as an interest in dieting before an event like a school dance or a beach vacation, but as the disorder takes hold, “preoccupation with weight intensifies” (WebMD). It creates a vicious cycle: The more weight a person loses, the more than person worries and obsesses about weight. There are a numerous number of signs and symptoms of anorexia, but some of them that are common in most people include: “dramatic weight loss, wearing loose, bulky clothes to hide weight loss, refusal to eat certain foods, such as carbs or fats, avoiding mealtimes or eating in front of others, making comments about being ‘fat’, exercising excessively, stopping menstruating, and complaining about constipation or stomach pain” (WebMD). People with anorexia are very good at hiding it; therefore, the disease can become severe before anyone around them notices anything wrong (WebMD). If left untreated, anorexia can lead to serious complications such as malnutrition and organ failure (WebMD). 

Unlike anorexia, people with bulimia are often a normal weight, but they have the same “intense fear” of gaining weight and distorted body image (WebMD). They see themselves as “fat” and desperately want to lose weight. Because they often feel ashamed and disgusted with themselves, people with bulimia also become very good at hiding their bulimic behaviors. Much like the signs of anorexia, there are also many signs of bulimia. Some of them being: “Evidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in a short time, or finding lots of empty food wrappers or containers, evidence of purging, including trips to the bathroom after meals, sounds or smells of vomiting, or packages of laxatives or diuretics, skipping meals or avoiding eating in front of others, or eating very small portions, using gum, mouthwash, or mints excessively, constantly dieting, and scarred knuckles from repeatedly inducing vomiting” (WebMD). If left untreated, bulimia can result in long-term health problems such as “abnormal heart rhythms, bleeding from the esophagus due to excessive reflux of stomach acid, dental problems, and kidney problems” (WebMD). 

Rather than simply eating too much all the time, people with binge eating disorder have frequent episodes where they binge on large quantities of food. Like people with bulimia, they often feel out of control during these episodes and later feel guilt and shame about it. The behavior becomes a vicious cycle because the more “distressed” they feel about bingeing, the more they seem to do it (WebMD). Because people with binge eating disorder do not purge, fast, or exercise after they binge, they are usually overweight or obese (WebMD). Some common signs of binge eating disorder include: “Hoarding food, or hiding large quantities of food in strange places, constantly dieting, but rarely losing weight, wearing baggy clothes to hide the body, and skipping meals or avoiding eating in front of others” (WebMD). Because binge eating leads to obesity, it can have serious health consequences if left untreated.

== Statistics ==
According to the [[National Eating Disorder Association]] (NEDA), “20 million women suffer from a clinically significant eating disorder at some time in their life, whether it is anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder” (NEDA). Ruth H. Striegel-Moore and Cynthia M. Bulik in their article, [[“Risk Factors for Eating Disorders”]], say that eating disorders rank among the “10 leading causes of disability among young women” (Striegel-Moore &amp; Bulik 181). Anorexia nervosa has the “highest death rate of any psychiatric illness”, including major depression (NEDA). It is estimated that “1-4% of women have suffered from anorexia nervosa in their lifetime” (NEDA). The mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa is “12 times higher” than the death rate of all causes of death for females 15-24 years old (NEDA). Without treatment, up to “20% of people with serious eating disorders die” (NEDA).

Bulimia statistics tell us that the lifetime prevalence of bulimia nervosa in the United States is “1.5% in women, translating to approximately 4.7 million females who will have their lives threatened by this potentially deadly disorder” (NEDA). While bulimia occurs most commonly in the adolescent and young adult years, it has been diagnosed in patients as young as six years old. Further, binge eating disorder (BED) is actually the most common eating disorder in the United States. In fact, is more common than breast cancer, HIV, and schizophrenia (NEDA). BED affects an estimated “2.8 million people in the United States”, according to a national survey done in 2008. Moreover, binge eating disorder also affects three times the number of people diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia combined. 

== Conclusion ==
Adolescence is a complex stage of development in which a number of physical changes and psychosocial challenges converge. The demands of meeting the “tasks” of adolescence can be very difficult for many individuals and can very well have a significant impact on confidence and self-esteem. Those who struggle to meet the challenges may feel a sense of being out of control. Furthermore, in a society that continues to prize thinness even as Americans become heavier than ever before, almost everyone worries about their weight, at least occasionally. People with eating disorders take such concerns to extremes, developing abnormal eating habits that threaten their well-being and even their lives. 
What needs to be understood is that eating disorders are complex conditions that can arise from a combination of long-standing behavioral, biological, emotional, psychological, interpersonal, and social factors. Once started, however, they can create a self-perpetuating cycle of physical and emotional destruction. 

Additionally, eating disorders are also highly related to significant comorbidity, functional impairment, suicidality, and health service usage. Given the young age of the onset, early intervention and prevention is crucial. A question often asked in relation to eating disorders is: Does treatment really work? In reference to the [[American Psychological Association]], most cases of eating disorders can be treated successfully by “appropriately trained health and mental care professionals” (APA). However, treatments do not work instantly. For many patients, treatment may need to be long-term depending on the severity of their disorder. Most importantly, the sooner treatment starts, the better. The longer abnormal eating patterns continue, the more deeply ingrained they become and the more difficult they are to treat. While eating disorders can severely impair people’s functioning and health, the prospects for long-term recovery are good for most people who seek help from appropriate professionals, like qualified therapists/licensed psychologists with experience in the area (APA). They can help those who suffer from eating disorders regain control of their eating behaviors and their lives. Furthermore, recognizing the signs and symptoms of an eating disorder is the first step toward getting help for it. Eating disorders are treatable, and with the right treatment and support, most people with an eating disorder can learn healthy eating habits and get their lives back on track.

The '''health effects of chocolate''' are the possible positive and negative effects on health of eating [[chocolate]].

Unconstrained consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity, increases the risk of [[obesity]]. Raw chocolate is high in [[cocoa butter]], a fat removed during chocolate refining, then added back in varying proportions during  manufacturing. Manufacturers may add other fats, [[sugar]]s, and [[powdered milk]] as well.

Although considerable research has been conducted to evaluate the potential health benefits of consuming chocolate, there are insufficient [[clinical research|studies]] to confirm any effect and no medical or regulatory authority has approved any health claim.

==History==

''[[Theobroma cacao]]'', the cacao tree, produces seeds containing [[flavanol]]s. The seeds have been used to make beverages for some 2000 years in [[Aztec]], [[Olmec]], and [[Maya civilization]]s in central and south America. The drinks were ascribed a wide variety of curative and stimulant properties, unsupported by experimental evidence. In the 19th century, chocolate as a solid was invented, and milk and sugar were added to create milk chocolate, high in fat and sugar. Doubtful research, sometimes funded by the chocolate industry, has at times made suggestions of possible health benefits for these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Nic|title=The dark truth about chocolate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/25/chocolate-the-dark-truth-is-it-good-for-you-health-wellbeing-blood-pressure-flavanols|accessdate=25 March 2018|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Acne===
Overall evidence is insufficient to determine the relationship between chocolate consumption and [[acne]].&lt;ref name="bhate2013"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23210645|year=2013|author1=Bhate|first1=K|title=Epidemiology of acne vulgaris|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|volume=168|issue=3|pages=474–85|last2=Williams|first2=H.

===Addiction===
Food, including chocolate, is not typically viewed as [[addiction|addictive]].&lt;ref name=Rogers2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rogers |first1=Peter J |last2=Smit |first2=Hendrik J |title=Food Craving and Food 'Addiction' |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |year=2000 |pmid=10837838 |doi=10.1016/s0091-3057(00)00197-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, however, may want or crave chocolate,&lt;ref name=Rogers2000/&gt; leading to a self-described term, [[chocoholic]].&lt;ref name=Rogers2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-chocoholics-survival-guide|title=The Chocoholic's Survival Guide|last=Skarnulis|first=Leanna|work=webmd.com|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
It has been claimed that chocolate is an [[aphrodisiac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=G|last2=Parker|first2=I|last3=Brotchie|first3=H|title=Mood state effects of chocolate|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=June 2006|volume=92|issue=2–3|pages=149–59|pmid=16546266|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no rigorous studies to prove this effect. There is no clear evidence that stimulants like [[Phenethylamine|phenylethylamine]] found in chocolate increase PEA in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chocolatemonthclub.com/chocolate-history|title=History of Chocolate - Chocolate History Timeline {{!}} The Gourmet Chocolate of the Month Club|work=The Gourmet Chocolate of the Month Club|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimulant===
Chocolate contains [[caffeine]] and [[theobromine]], both mild [[stimulant]]s.&lt;ref name=Franco2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franco |first1=Rafael |last2=Oñatibia-Astibia |first2=Ainhoa |last3=Martínez-Pinilla |first3=Eva |title=Health Benefits of Methylxanthines in Cacao and Chocolate |journal=Nutrients |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=4159–73 |year=2013 |pmid=24145871 |pmc=3820066 |doi=10.3390/nu5104159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight gain===
The effect of chocolate on [[body weight]] is unclear.

==Other animals==

{{Main|Theobromine poisoning}}
In sufficient amounts, the theobromine found in chocolate is [[toxic]] to animals such as cats, dogs, horses, parrots, and small rodents because they are unable to [[metabolize|metabolise]] the chemical effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smit HJ |year=2011 |title=Theobromine and the pharmacology of cocoa |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol |volume=200 |issue= 200|pages=201–34 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-13443-2_7|pmid=20859797 |pmc= |url= |&lt;!-- accessdate= 4 July 2012 --&gt;|series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=978-3-642-13442-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If animals are fed chocolate, the theobromine may remain in the circulation for up to 20&amp;nbsp;hours, possibly causing [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[internal bleeding]], and eventually death. Medical treatment performed by a [[veterinarian]] involves inducing [[vomiting]] within two hours of ingestion and administration of [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[barbiturate]]s for seizures, [[antiarrhythmic agents|antiarrhythmics]] for [[cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmias]], and [[forced diuresis|fluid diuresis]].

A typical {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog will normally experience great intestinal distress after eating less than {{convert|240|g|oz}} of dark chocolate, but will not necessarily experience [[bradycardia]] or [[tachycardia]] unless it eats at least a half a kilogram (1.1&amp;nbsp;lb) of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate has 2 to 5 times more theobromine and thus is more dangerous to dogs. According to the [[Merck Veterinary Manual]], approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp; grams of baker's chocolate per kilogram of a dog's body weight (0.02&amp;nbsp; oz/lb) is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity. For example, a typical {{convert|25|g|oz|adj=on}} baker's chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog. Of course, [[baking chocolate]] is rarely consumed directly due to its unpleasant taste, but other dark chocolates' canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure. Given access, dogs frequently consume chocolate at toxic levels because they like the taste of chocolate products and are capable of finding and eating quantities much larger than typical human servings. There are reports that [[mulch]] made from cacao bean shells is dangerous to dogs and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drolet |first1=R |last2=Arendt |first2=TD |last3=Stowe |first3=CM |title=Cacao bean shell poisoning in a dog |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=185 |issue=8 |pages=902 |year=1984 |pmid=6501051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blakemore |first1=F |last2=Shearer |first2=GD |title=The poisoning of livestock by cacao products |journal=Veterinary Record |year=1943 |volume=55 |issue=15 |pages=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the rest of the [[Economy of Cuba|Cuban economy]], Cuban medical care suffered following the end of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[subsidies]] in 1991 and the stepping up of the [[United States embargo against Cuba]] at this time also had an effect.&lt;ref name="US embargo"/&gt;

Retrieved 26 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Modern Western medicine has been practiced in Cuba by formally trained [[Physician|doctors]] since at least the beginning of the 19th century and the first surgical clinic was established in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlay-online.com/nicolasgutierrez/medicalsynopsis1.htm Official site of the Finlay medical center]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba has had many world class doctors, including [[Carlos Finlay]], whose mosquito-based theory of [[yellow fever]] transmission was given its final proof under the direction of [[Walter Reed]], [[James Carroll (scientist)|James Carroll]], and [[Aristides Agramonte]].&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt; During the period of U.S presence (1898–1902) yellow fever was essentially eliminated due to the efforts of [[Clara Maass]] and surgeon [[Jesse William Lazear]].&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursingworld.org/hof/maascl.htm  Clara Louise Maass]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s the number of doctors per thousand of the population ranked above Britain, France and the Netherlands. In Latin America it ranked in third place after Uruguay and Argentina.&lt;ref name="Gott" /&gt;
There remained marked inequalities, however. Most of Cuba's doctors were based in the relatively prosperous cities and regional towns, and conditions in rural areas, notably [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], were significantly worse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], ''Cuba : The pursuit of Freedom''. p968-970 "[since the revolution] The distribution of food has been erratic. Still, few die of malnutrition and, particularly in Oriente province, the very poor peasants must be fed better and more regularly than before the revolution" – "The revolution has in many ways improved everybody's health. Medicines are more fairly distributed throughout the country. Preventative medicine has been much emphasized and many clinics have been established in rural areas."&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality rate was the third lowest in the world.&lt;ref name="beforecastro"/&gt; According to the World Health Organization, the island had the lowest infant mortality rate of Latin America.&lt;ref name="beforecastro" /&gt;

Following the [[Cuban Revolution|Revolution]] and the subsequent [[United States embargo against Cuba]], an increase in [[disease]] and [[infant mortality]] worsened in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="bethell" /&gt; The new [[Politics of Cuba|Cuban government]] asserted that universal healthcare was to become a priority of state planning. In 1960 revolutionary and [[physician]] [[Che Guevara]] outlined his aims for the future of Cuban healthcare in an essay entitled ''[[On Revolutionary Medicine]]'', stating: "The work that today is entrusted to the Ministry of Health and similar organizations is to provide public health services for the greatest possible number of persons, institute a program of preventive medicine, and orient the public to the performance of hygienic practices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0105guevara.htm On Revolutionary Medicine by Che Guevara] Monthly review&lt;/ref&gt; These aims were hampered almost immediately by an exodus of almost half of Cuba’s physicians to the United States, leaving the country with only 3,000 doctors and 16 professors in the [[University of Havana]]’s medical college.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Beginning in 1960, the Ministry of Public Health began a program of [[nationalization]] and [[regionalization]] of medical services.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 1965, Cuba became the first Latin American country to legalize abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/ameriques/article/2012/10/17/en-uruguay-le-parlement-vote-la-depenalisation-de-l-avortement_1776959_3222.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Cuba's healthcare program was enshrined in Article 50 of the revised [[Cuban constitution]] which states "Everyone has the right to health protection and care. The state guarantees this right by providing free medical and hospital care by means of the installations of the rural medical service network, [[polyclinic]]s, hospitals, preventative and specialized treatment centers; by providing free dental care; by promoting the health publicity campaigns, health education, regular medical examinations, general vaccinations and other measures to prevent the outbreak of disease. All the population cooperates in these activities and plans through the social and mass organizations."&lt;ref&gt;° [[wikisource:Constitution of Cuba|English translation of the 1976 Constitution of Cuba]] Wikisource &lt;br/&gt;

Cuba's doctor to patient ratio grew significantly in the latter half of the 20th century, from 9.2 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants in 1958, to 58.2 per 10,000 in 1999.&lt;ref name="sixto" /&gt; In the 1960s the government implemented a program of almost universal [[vaccination]]s. This helped eradicate many contagious diseases including [[polio]], [[tetanus]], [[diphtheria]] and [[rubella]], though some diseases increased during the period of economic hardship of the 1990s, such as [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]] and [[chicken pox]]. Other campaigns included a program to reduce the infant mortality rate in 1970 directed at maternal and prenatal care.&lt;ref name="sixto" /&gt; As of 2012, infant mortality in Cuba had fallen to 4.83 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 6.0 for the United States and just behind Canada with 4.8.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have however noted that these statistics may reflect heavy-handed treatment of pregnant patients or that the statistics may be falsified.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/31/tom-harkin/sen-tom-harkin-says-cuba-has-lower-child-mortality/|title=Sen.

===Post-Soviet Union===
Loss of Soviet subsidies brought food shortages to Cuba in the early 1990s.  The famine during the [[Special Period]] was caused by an authoritarian regime that denied people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed; priority was given to the elite classes and the military.&lt;ref name="cmaj" /&gt; The regime did not accept donations of food, medicines and money from the US until 1993.&lt;ref name="cmaj" /&gt;

Epidemiologist Manuel Franco describes the Special Period as "the first, and probably the only, natural experiment, born of unfortunate circumstances, where large effects on diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality have been related to sustained population-wide weight loss as a result of increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake".&lt;ref name="francocrisis" /&gt;

In 2007, Cuba announced that it has undertaken computerizing and creating national networks in blood banks, nephrology and medical images. Cuba is the second country in the world with such a product, only preceded by France. Cuba is preparing a computerized health register, hospital management system, primary health care, academic affairs, medical genetic projects, neurosciences, and educational software. The aim is to maintain quality health service free for the Cuban people, increase exchange among experts and boost research-development projects. An important link in wiring process is to guarantee access to Cuba's Data Transmission Network and Health Website (INFOMED) to all units and workers of the national health system.

=== United States embargo ===
During the 1990s the ongoing [[United States embargo against Cuba]] caused problems due to restrictions on the export of medicines from the US to Cuba.&lt;ref name="embargo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Impact Of The US Embargo
On The Health And Nutrition In Cuba. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=8150565&amp;dopt=Abstract Online]. American Association for World Health Report. March 1997. Accessed ''6 October 2006''. Supplementary source : [http://www.apha.org/wfpha/cuba.htm American Public Health Association website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813155121/http://www.apha.org/wfpha/cuba.htm|date=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the US embargo was made more stringent with the passage of the [[Cuban Democracy Act]] resulting in all U.S. subsidiary trade, including trade in food and medicines, being prohibited.&lt;ref name="embargo" /&gt; The legislation did not state that Cuba cannot purchase medicines from U.S. companies or their foreign subsidiaries; however, such license requests have been routinely denied.&lt;ref name="embargo" /&gt; In 1995 the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] of the Organization of American States informed the U.S. Government that such activities violate international law and has requested that the U.S. take immediate steps to exempt medicine from the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1113007#B3 Role of the USA in shortage of medicines in Cuba. Anthony F. Kirkpatrick. The Lancet. 2004.] Accessed ''6 October 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Lancet]] and the [[British Medical Journal]] also condemned the embargo in the 90s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2500503 BMA must voice its opposition to Cuban embargo]. British Medical Journal. 1998. Accessed ''6 October 2006.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The embargo forced Cuba to use more of its limited resources on medical imports, both because equipment and drugs from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms or from non-U.S.sources tend to be higher priced and because shipping costs are greater. The Democracy Act of 1992 further exacerbated the problems in Cuba's medical system. It prohibited foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from selling to Cuba, thus further limiting Cuba's access to medicine and equipment, and raising prices. In addition, the act forbid ships that dock in Cuban ports from docking in U.S. ports for six months. This drastically restricted shipping, and increased shipping costs some 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030720011919/http://www.wola.org/publications/cuba_myths_facts.pdf Myths and Facts about the US embargo on medicines and supplies]. Oxfam America and the Washington Office on Latin America.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the ''[[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act]]'' was passed.  The US is now Cuba's single largest source for imported food.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalization.about.com/od/bigstories/a/cubaembargo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/24/eveningnews/main2036729.shtml|title=U.S. Companies Flock To Cuba|date=24 September 2006|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cuban American National Foundation]] (CANF) states that should Cuba choose not to purchase from the U.S., it can purchase any medicine or medical equipment it needs from other countries.&lt;ref name="canf" /&gt; Such third-country transactions only cost an estimated 2%–3% more than purchases from the U.S. as a result of higher shipping costs.&lt;ref name="canf" /&gt; CANF also asserts the United States is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Cuba and much of this consists of medicines and medical equipment.&lt;ref name="canf" /&gt;

The US government states that since 1992, 36 out of 39 license requests from U.S. companies and their subsidiaries for sales of medical items to Cuba have been approved. The dollar amount of these sales is over $1,600,000. Furthermore, the U.S. government licensed more than $227 million in humanitarian donations of medicines and medical supplies to Cuba between 1993 and 1997.  There are other factors beside the embargo explaining the lack of imports, in particular Cuba's lack of hard currency. Those with dollars can easily buy medicines and food in Cuba from Latin America and Canada. Cuba defaulted on its debt to Western banks in 1986 and lacks access to the international credit system in order to get foreign currency. In addition, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused the loss of several billions of dollars in yearly subsidies and overnight required hard currency for all imports.&lt;ref name="unc.edu"&gt;http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_13/linderman_cuba2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 report to the U.N. Secretary-General, Cuba acknowledged the authorization of medicines, though stated that they were subject to severe restrictions and complicated procedures. Cuba is obliged to make payments in cash and in advance, and is precluded from obtaining credit funding, even from private sources. The sale and transportation of the goods require licenses to be obtained for each transaction. Cuba cannot use its own merchant fleet for transporting these goods, but has to make use of vessels from third countries, primarily the [[United States]]. Payments are made through banks in third countries, since direct banking relationships are prohibited. The Cuban delegation concluded that restrictions on importing medical products were "so extensive that they make such imports virtually impossible". The World Health organization/PAHO and [[UNFPA]] concurred that it was impossible for Cuba to purchase equipment, medicines and laboratory materials produced by the United States or covered by United States patents, even though those products were purchased through multilateral cooperation. Cuba was not able to purchase the isotope I-125 that is used to treat eye cancer in children. The companies manufacturing reagents and equipment are 70 per cent United States owned, which makes it difficult to purchase necessary medical equipment and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Secretary-General. 2006.

=== National health system ===
Cuba's national health system is made up of multiple tiers: 1) the community containing individuals and families, 2) family doctor-and-nurse teams, 3) basic work teams, 4) community polyclinics, 5) hospitals, and 6) medical institutes.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Keck, C. William, and Gail A. Reed. "The curious case of Cuba." ''American journal of public health'' 102.8 (2012): e13-e22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba's Family Physician and Nurse program is made up of physician and nurse teams that serve individuals, families, and their communities.  They live above their government-built family medicine offices, living directly in the communities they serve and available 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These teams work to improve the public health concerns in the environment as well as provide medical care.  They perform a neighborhood health diagnosis biannually where community risk factors are evaluated to focus priorities for improving the health of the community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Clinically, family doctor-and-nurse teams follow the Continuous Assessment and Risk Evaluation (CARE) method which monitors individual and family health by examining community and home environments, current health, and medical history.  The teams make home visits to each family at least once yearly to assess and evaluate their health.  Individuals with chronic illness are seen at least every three months.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These teams' role combine the importance of focusing on both public health and clinical medicine.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorry|first=Conner|date=January 2017|title=Cuba's Family Doctor-and-Nurse Teams: A Day in the Life|journal=MEDICC review|volume=19|issue=1|pages=6–9|issn=1527-3172|pmid=28225539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyclinics are community-based clinics that house primary care specialists.  They exist in every Cuban community and are well-acquainted with the people and the communities they serve.  They can see the social determinants and environment that affect the community's health, bettering their ability to serve their patients.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Specialists at the polyclinic are there to support physicians when they are needed.  Each clinic of specialists supports 20-40 doctor-and-nurse teams. Basic work teams within the polyclinics supervise and evaluate the neighborhood and clinical health work of the family medicine offices.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

While [[Preventive medicine|preventive medical care]], [[Medical test|diagnostic test]]s and [[medication]] for hospitalized patients are free, some aspects of healthcare are paid for by the patient. Items which are paid by patients who can afford it are: drugs prescribed on an [[outpatient]] basis, hearing, [[Dental insurance|dental]], and [[orthopedic]] processes, [[wheelchair]]s and [[crutch]]es. When a patient can obtain these items at state stores, prices tend to be low as these items are subsidized by the state. For patients on a low-income, these items are free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry M. Spiegel and Annalee Yassi "Lessons from the margins of globalization: appreciating the Cuban health paradox" in Journal of Public Health Policy, Volume 25, Number 1, 2004, pp. 85–110(26)[http://www.jphp.umb.edu/documents/204-020_Health_25_1_spiegel.pdf online]. "Patients pay for drugs, hearing, dental, and orthopedic prostheses, wheelchairs, crutches, and similar items but prices are low and subsidized by the state; and in the case of low-income patients, these items are offered free of charge"&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the rest of the [[Economy of Cuba|Cuban economy]], numerous reports have shown that Cuban medical care has long suffered from severe material shortages caused by the [[United States embargo against Cuba|US embargo]]. The ending of Soviet subsidies in the early 1990s has also affected it.&lt;ref name="US embargo" /&gt;

==== Alternative healthcare ====
Economic constraints and restrictions on medicines have forced the Cuban health system to incorporate [[Alternative medicine|alternative]] and [[Herbalism|herbal]] solutions to healthcare issues, which can be more accessible and affordable to a broader population&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; In the 1990s, the Cuban Ministry of Public Health officially recognized natural and [[traditional medicine]] and began its integration into the already well established Western medicine model.&lt;ref name="model"&gt;[http://www.nfam.org/2004yearendnewsletter_cuba.html Cuba : A model for alternative healthcare] National Foundation for Alternative medicine&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=March 2018}}

Cuba had 128 physicians and dentists per 100,000 people in 1957. This was comparable to the levels in many European countries and allegedly the highest in Latin America.&lt;ref name="comparison" /&gt; In 1986, Cuba had 219 doctors per 100,000 people (compared with 423.7 doctors in the Soviet Union, which had the most doctors among industrialized countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Health Systems of the World: The issues|author=Milton Irwin Roemer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Cuba had 627 physicians and 94 dentists per 100,000 population. That year the United States had 225 physicians and 54 dentists per 100,000 population; the Central American isthmus had 123 physicians and 30 dentists per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Pan American Health Organization, ''Health situation in the Americas: Basic Indicators 2008'' [http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=220&amp;Itemid=317] page 9, "resources, access &amp; coverage indicators," retrieved July 2009.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2005, Cuba became the world leader in the ratio of doctors to population with 67 doctors per 10,000 population as compared with 43 in the Russian Federation and 24 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation: U.S. Global Health Policy. Figures for 2005–2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abortion]] rates, which are high in Cuba, increased dramatically during the 1980s, but had almost halved by 1999 and declined to near-1970s levels of 32.0 per 1000 pregnancies. The rate is still among the highest in Latin America.&lt;ref name="sixto"/&gt;

====Sexual health====
According to the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] report of 2003 there were an estimated 3,300 Cubans living with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] (approx 0.05% of the population). In the mid-1980s, when little was known about the virus, Cuba compulsorily tested thousands of its citizens for [[HIV]]. Those who tested positive were taken to Los Cocos and were not allowed to leave. The policy drew criticism from the [[United Nations]] and was discontinued in the 1990s. Since 1996 Cuba began the production of generic [[Antiretroviral drug|anti-retroviral]] drugs reducing the costs to well below that of developing countries. This has been made possible through the substantial government subsidies to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/prev_care/en/cuba.pdf Approaches to the management of HIV/Aids in Cuba] World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Cuba had the lowest HIV prevalence in the Americas and one of the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsonline.com/pt/re/aids/fulltext.00002030-200208160-00010.htm;jsessionid=Fsnp8F72GNT9Q12gng9rYChv85qJ0zyTGqsLXLbNPtVLQCGhJzGx!-910938601!-949856144!8091!-1#P22|title=High HIV-1 genetic diversity in Cuba AIDS 2002|publisher=Official Journal of the International AIDS society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education in Cuba concerning issues of HIV infection and AIDS is implemented by the [[Cuban National Center for Sex Education]].

According to a 2005 report by UNAIDS and the [[World Health Organization]], "Cuba’s epidemic remains by far the smallest in the Caribbean."&lt;ref name= avert/&gt; They add however that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... new HIV infections are on the rise, and Cuba’s preventive measures appear not to be keeping pace with conditions that favour the spread of HIV, including widening income inequalities and a growing sex industry. At the same time, Cuba’s prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme remains highly effective. All pregnant women are tested for HIV, and those testing positive receive antiretroviral drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean|url=http://www.unaids.org/epi/2005/doc/epiupdate2005_html_en/epi05_08_en.htm#TopOfPage|work=UNAIDS/WHO AIDS epidemic update: December 2005|publisher=UNAIDS|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, a major public health accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/mtct-hiv-cuba/en/|title=WHO {{!}} WHO validates elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis in Cuba|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years because of the rise in [[prostitution in Cuba]] due to [[tourism]], [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]] have increased.&lt;ref name="sixto"/&gt;

== Training doctors ==
Cuba's healthcare system persists, in part, due to its medical education system.  In Cuba, the medical university is not a separate entity from health services, but it exists within the system.  Medical and nursing students mentor and intern within the national system from the first years of their training,&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Salas Perea, Ramón, and Arlene Salas Mainegra. "La educación médica cubana. Su estado actual." ''Revista de Docencia Universitaria'' 10 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; specifically within primary care facilities rather than hospitals.  This creates a community-based teaching method rather than a typical hospital-based teaching method.  Primary care, being the first level of contact to a patient, is closely located to the patient's home and work.  Here, students are exposed to medicine and the social, economical, and political factors that influence health.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, John K. F., and Ann Wylie. “Community - and Hospital - Based Teaching in the Medical Curriculum - Examples from Cuba and the UK.” ''International Journal of Cuban Studies'', vol. 2, no. 3/4, 2010, pp. 343–350.&lt;/ref&gt;  At primary care facilities, ethics and values are a taught as a large part of the Cuban healthcare system alongside science and technology. Students graduate capable of resolving health issues and knowing when to report to a person higher in the healthcare pyramid. Students graduate with a commitment to providing and preserving quality and equity within healthcare for their communities.{{Tone inline|date=December 2017}} The largest medical university in the world exists in Cuba, the [[ELAM (Latin American School of Medicine) Cuba|Latin American School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

==Cuba and international healthcare==
{{Main|Cuban medical internationalism}}

Cuba provides more medical personnel to the developing world than all the G8 countries combined.&lt;ref&gt;"Cuban Medical Internationalism and the Development of the Latin American School of Medicine, Robert Huish and John M. Kirk (2007), Latin American Perspectives, 34;77.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the Cuban state initiated bilateral service contracts and various money-making strategies.&lt;ref name="eckstein" /&gt; Cuba has entered into agreements with [[United Nations]] agencies specializing in health: [[PAHO]]/[[WHO]], [[UNICEF]], the [[FAO|United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Population Fund]] ([[UNFPA]]) and the [[United Nations Development Fund]] ([[UNDP]]). Since 1989, this collaboration has played a very important role in that Cuba, in addition to obtaining the benefits of being a member country, has strengthened its relations with institutions of excellence and has been able to disseminate some of its own advances and technologies&lt;ref name="PAN"/&gt;

Cuban doctors have been part of a large-scale plan by the Cuban state to provide free medical aid and services to the international community (especially third world countries) following natural disasters. Currently dozens of American medical students are trained to assist in these donations at the [[ELAM (Latin American School of Medicine) Cuba|Escuela Latino Americana de Medicina]] (ELAM).&lt;ref name="cusack1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/carmen_cusack/1/|title=Healthcare in Cuba|last=Cusack|first=Carmen|work=Selected Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba's missions in 68 countries are manned by 25,000 Cuban doctors.  Medical teams have worked in crisis such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|South Asian tsunami]] and the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-236/0607178261185837.htm Cuban Embassy opens in Islamabad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044323/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-236/0607178261185837.htm |date=2012-02-04 }} Islamic News Agency&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 2,000 Cuban doctors are currently working in Africa in countries including [[South Africa]], [[Gambia]], [[Guinea Bissau]] and [[Mali]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/10/AR2006081000278.html Castro has stamped his mark on Africa's history] Washington Post August 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Chernobyl nuclear plant]] exploded in 1986, more than 20,000 children from [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]] have traveled to Cuba for treatment of [[radiation sickness]] and psychologically based problems associated with the radiation disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/17/IN52141.DTL%20 15,000 sick Ukrainian kids get treatment in Cuba] San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the 2005 [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster, Castro offered to send a "brigade" of 1,500 doctors to the U.S. to provide humanitarian aid, but was never accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4263552.stm Cuba to create doctors' brigade] BBC News September 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health tourism===
Cuba attracts about 20,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html Commentary: A Novel Tourism Concept] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=2010-01-28 }} Caribbean Net News&lt;/ref&gt; paying [[health tourists]], generating revenues of around $40 million a year for the Cuban economy. Cuba has been serving health tourists from around the world for more than 20 years. The country operates a special division of hospitals specifically for the treatment of foreigners and diplomats.  Foreign patients travel to Cuba for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], [[cosmetic surgery]], addictions treatment, [[retinitis pigmentosa]] and [[orthopaedics]]. Most patients are from Latin America, Europe and Canada, and a growing number of Americans also are coming. By 1998, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Cuban health sector had risen to occupy around 2 percent of total tourism. Some of these revenues are in turn transferred to health care for ordinary Cubans, although the size and importance of these transfers is both unknown and controversial. At one nationally prominent hospital/research institute, hard currency payments by foreigners have financed the construction of a new bathroom in the splenic surgery wing; anecdotal evidence suggests that this pattern is common in Cuban hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/Lasa2001/DunningThad.pdf|title=Structural Reform and Medical Commerce: The Political Economy of Cuban Health Care in the Special Period|author=Thad Dunning|date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical research==
The Cuban Ministry of Health produces a number of [[medical journal]]s including the [[ACIMED]], the [[Cuban Journal of Surgery]] and the [[Cuban Journal of Tropical Medicine]]. MEDICC Review is an English language journal which works to bring Cuban medical and public health policy, research, programs, and outcomes to the attention of the global health community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicc.org/mediccreview/|title=MEDICC Review|website=www.medicc.org|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the U.S. government restricts investments in Cuba by U.S. companies and their affiliates, Cuban institutions have been limited in their ability to enter into research and development partnerships, although exceptions have been made for significant drugs.

The [[Center of molecular immunology]] (CIM) developed [[nimotuzumab]], a monoclonal antibody used to treat cancer. Nimotuzumab is an inhibitor of [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), which is over-expressed in many cancers. Nimotuzumab is now being developed with international partners.

In April 2007, the Cuba IPV Study Collaborative Group reported in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] that inactivated (killed) poliovirus vaccine was effective in vaccinating children in tropical conditions. The Collaborative Group consisted of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, Kourí Institute, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pan American Health Organization, and the World Health Organization. This is important because countries with high incidence of polio are now using live oral poliovirus vaccine. When polio is eliminated in a country, they must stop using the live vaccine, because it has a slight risk of reverting to the dangerous form of polio. The collaborative group found that when polio is eliminated in a population, they could safely switch to killed vaccine and be protected from recurrent epidemics. Cuba has been free of polio since 1963, but continues with mass immunization campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Cuba IPV Study Collaborative Group. Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of inactivated poliovirus vaccine in Cuba. N Engl J Med. 2007 Apr 12;356(15):1536–44.

In the 1980s, Cuban scientists developed a vaccine against a strain of bacterial meningitis B, which eliminated what had been a serious disease on the island. The Cuban vaccine is used throughout Latin America. After outbreaks of meningitis B in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department granted a license in 1999 to an American subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham to enter into a deal to develop the vaccine for use in the U.S. and elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/406780.stm Cuba vaccine deal breaks embargo, BBC, July 29, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting views on Cuba's health system==
The issue of the effectiveness of the Cuban health system is politically polarized. According to William Ventres in his review of five books about Cuba's medical system (including one by Katherine Hirschfeld; see below), it is "difficult to make sense of the reality of Cuban health care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2012/February/William136.pdf|title=Book Review: Caring for Them From Birth to Death: The Practice of Community-based Cuban Medicine; Community Health Care in Cuba: An Enduring Model; Health, Politics, and Revolution in Cuba Since 1898; Primary Health Care in Cuba: The Other Revolution; Social Relations and the Cuban Health Miracle|author=William Ventres|journal=Family Medicine |volume=44|issue=2|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praise===
In 2006, [[BBC]] flagship news programme ''[[Newsnight]]'' featured Cuba's Healthcare system as part of a series identifying "the world's best public services". The report noted that "Thanks chiefly to the American economic blockade, but partly also to the web of strange rules and regulations that constrict Cuban life, the economy is in a terrible mess: national income per head is minuscule, and resources are amazingly tight. Healthcare, however, is a top national priority" The report stated that life expectancy and infant mortality rates are nearly the same as the USA's. Its doctor-to-patient ratios stand comparison to any country in Western Europe. Its annual total health spend per head, however, comes in at $251; just over a tenth of the UK's. The report concluded that the population's admirable health is one of the key reasons why Castro is still in power.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/5232628.stm Keeping Cuba healthy] BBC online. 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 poll carried out by [[the Gallup Organization]]'s Costa Rican affiliate — Consultoría Interdisciplinaria en Desarrollo (CID) — found that about three-quarters of urban Cubans responded positively to the question "do you have confidence to your country's health care system".&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;[http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brlatinamericara/300.php?nid=&amp;id=&amp;pnt=300&amp;lb=brla Cubans Show Little Satisfaction with Opportunities and Individual Freedom] World Public Opinion. 10 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Secretary General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]] stated that "Cuba should be the envy of many other nations" adding that achievements in social development are impressive given the size of its gross domestic product per capita. "Cuba demonstrates how much nations can do with the resources they have if they focus on the right priorities – health, education, and literacy."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/sfeature/sf_views_uriarte.html "The Right Priorities: Health, Education, and Literacy.

The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], a non-governmental organization that evaluated Cuba’s healthcare system in 2000-1 described Cuba as "a shining example of the power of public health to transform the health of an entire country by a commitment to prevention and by careful management of its medical resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kff.org/other/mason-essif-cuba-report/|date=30 December 2002|author= Mason Essif|title=Health Care in Cuba|publisher=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the World Bank [[James Wolfensohn]] also praised Cuba's healthcare system in 2001, saying that "Cuba has done a great job on education and health", at the annual meeting of the Bank and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. [[Wayne Smith (diplomat)|Wayne Smith]], former head of the [[US Interests Section in Havana]] identified  "the incredible dedication" of Cubans to healthcare, adding that "Doctors in Cuba can make more driving cabs and working in hotels, but they don't. They're just very dedicated".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43b/185.html Learn from Cuba, Says World Bank] World History Archives.  May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Neil Butler|Dr. Robert N. Butler]], who was president of the International Longevity Center in New York and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author on aging, traveled to Cuba to see firsthand how doctors were trained. He said a principal reason that some health standards in Cuba approach the high American level is that the Cuban system emphasizes early intervention. Clinic visits are free, and the focus is on preventing disease rather than treating it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/weekinreview/27depalma.html?ex=1338004800&amp;en=93765aa2237c194c&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg ‘Sicko,’ Castro and the ‘120 Years Club’] The New York Times.  May 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, London's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper lauded Cuba's public healthcare system for what it viewed as its high quality in a September 12, 2007 article.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Rory (September 12, 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/cuba/story/0,,2167200,00.html "Cuban Healthcare: First World Results on a Third World Budget"]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, members of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Health [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] travelled to Cuba and issued a report that paid tribute to "the success of the Cuban healthcare system", based on its "strong emphasis on disease prevention" and "commitment to the practice of medicine in a community".&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] also drew up an analysis of the key features of Cuba's healthcare system, drawing comparisons with the state funded [[National Health Service]] (NHS). The overall conclusion was that many of the features identified would not have occurred had there not been an obvious commitment to health provision demonstrated by the protection and proportion of the budget given the health care. The study concluded the following.
*There appeared to be little evidence of a divide between the prevention/proactive response and the disease management/reactive response within Cuban healthcare.
*By far the biggest difference was the ratio of doctors per person. In Cuba it was one doctor per 175 people, in the UK the figure was one doctor per 600 people.
*There is a commitment in Cuba to the triple diagnosis (physical/psychological/social) at all levels.

===Criticism===
The preceding study also pointed to problems within Cuba's health system, including:
*Low pay of doctors.
*Poor facilities—buildings in poor state of repair and mostly outdated.
*Poor provision of equipment.
*Frequent absence of essential drugs.
*Concern regarding freedom of choice both for patient and doctor.&lt;ref name="uknhs" /&gt;
Katherine Hirschfeld, an anthropology professor at the [[University of Oklahoma]], did her Ph.D. thesis on the Cuban health system, spending nine months conducting ethnographic work in Cuba in the late 1990s. According to Hirschfeld, "public criticism of the government is a crime
in Cuba", which means that "formally eliciting critical narratives about health care would be viewed as a criminal act both for me as a researcher, and for people who spoke openly with me".&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.miscelaneasdecuba.net/media/pdf/Article-Hirschfeld-Press.pdf |title=Re-examining the Cuban Health Care System: Towards a Qualitative Critique |author=Katherine Hirschfeld |journal=Cuban Affairs |volume=2 |issue=3 |date=July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317225912/http://www.miscelaneasdecuba.net/media/pdf/Article-Hirschfeld-Press.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she was able to hear from many Cubans, including health professionals, "serious complaints about the intrusion of politics into medical treatment and health care decision-making".&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld" /&gt; She points out that "there is no right to privacy in the physician-patient relationship in Cuba, no patients’ right of informed consent, no right to refuse treatment, and no right to protest or sue for malpractice".&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld" /&gt; In her view medical care in Cuba can be dehumanizing.

Hirschfeld explains also that the Cuban Ministry of Health (MINSAP) sets statistical targets that are viewed as production quotas. The most guarded is infant mortality rate. To illustrate this, Hirschfeld describes a case where a doctor said that if the ultrasound examination revealed "some fetal abnormalities", the woman "would have an abortion", to avoid an increase in the infant mortality rate.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld" /&gt;

Hirschfeld referred to well-documented research about the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, showing that "revolutionary" efforts "can also include such practices as deliberate manipulation of health statistics, aggressive political intrusion into health care decision-making, criminalizing dissent, and other forms of authoritarian policing of the health sector designed to insure health changes reflect the (often utopian) predictions of Marxist theory". But, according to Hirshfeld, "the true extent of these practices was virtually unknown in the West", where "social scientists frequently cited favorable health statistics supplied by [these regimes], without critically looking at the ways these were created and maintained by state power".&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld"/&gt;

Hirschfeld concludes that "Cuba’s health indicators are at least in some cases obtained by imposing significant costs on the Cuban population – costs that Cuban citizens are powerless to articulate or protest, and foreign researchers unable to empirically investigate."&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld"/&gt;

Complaints have also arisen that foreign "health tourists" paying with dollars and senior Communist party officials receive a higher quality of care than Cuban citizens. Former leading Cuban [[neurosurgeon]] and [[dissident]] Dr [[Hilda Molina]] asserts that the central revolutionary objective of free, quality medical care for all has been eroded by Cuba's need for foreign currency. Molina says that following the economic collapse known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]], the Cuban Government established mechanisms designed to turn the medical system into a profit-making enterprise. This creates an enormous disparity in the quality of healthcare services between foreigners and Cubans leading to a form of [[tourist segregation|tourist apartheid]]. In 1998 she said that foreign patients were routinely inadequately or falsely informed about their medical conditions to increase their medical bills or to hide the fact that Cuba often advertises medical services it is unable to provide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubacenter.org/media/archives/1998/summer/medicine_today.php3 Cuban Medicine Today by Dr] [[Hilda Molina]] Center for a free Cuba – link fails 16.9.06&lt;/ref&gt; Others makes similar claims, also stating that senior Communist party and military officials can access this higher quality system free of charge.&lt;ref name="unc.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canf.org/Issues/medicalapartheid.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, an account written by Cuban exile and critic of Fidel Castro, [[Carlos Wotzkow]], appeared showing apparent unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the "Clínico Quirúrgico" of Havana; the article claims that health care for Cubans occurs in worse conditions in the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentiuno.com/articulo.asp?articulo=2167 ''El cuento de la Salud en Cuba''],  Publicado el 06.03.2005 11:32 Por Carlos Wotzkow, María Elena Morejón y Equipo Informativo de Gentiuno.com&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in Canadian newspaper ''[[National Post]]'', based upon interviews of Cubans, finds that in reality even the most common pharmaceutical items, such as aspirin and antibiotics are conspicuously absent or only available on the black market. Surgeons lack basic supplies and must re-use latex gloves. Patients must buy their own sutures on the black market and provide bedsheets and food for extended hospital stays.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cubaverdad.net/references/for_cubans_a_bitter_pill.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban government blames the shortages on the embargo and states that those with more severe chronic diseases receive medicines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aegis.com/news/ips/2001/IP010312.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources suggest that those with such diseases lack medicines. It is also suggested that in some cases the local non-dollar stocks have been shipped abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urban-renaissance.org/urbanren/index.cfm?DSP=content&amp;ContentID=6341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y05/jun05/27e7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. State Department has argued that during the economic depression "the Cuban government made a deliberate decision to continue to spend money to maintain its military and internal security apparatus at the expense of other priorities – including healthcare." However, one study found that "the available data show that the fall in Cuba's medicine imports in the '90s didn't correspond to a significant lowering of the government's healthcare spending. Budgetary support for peso-denominated spending – i.e., labor costs of medical professionals, operational costs of hospitals and clinics – has remained strong. Attempts to blame medical shortages in Cuba on resource misallocation are thus misguided, or at least wrongly nuanced."&lt;ref name="lasa.international.pitt.edu"&gt;http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/Lasa2001/DunningThad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent ABC-TV [[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]] report on Healthcare, based on footage taken from within the island, criticized Michael Moore's portrayals of the Cuban Healthcare system in the movie Sicko. In that film, Moore took a number of Americans to a hospital in Havana where they bought affordable drugs, and were given treatments for free that they could not afford in America. The report highlights the dilapidated conditions of some hospitals that are accessible to regular Cubans by pointing to the bleak conditions of hospital rooms and the filthy conditions of the facilities. The report also addressed the quality of care available to Cubans by arguing that patient neglect was a common phenomenon. Finally, in discussing the infant mortality rate, the report highlights the government's alleged efforts to promote abortions of potentially infirm fetuses and other alleged government efforts to manipulate the rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Exclusiva/story?id=3568278 Healthy in Cuba, Sick in America? John Stossel Takes on Michael Moore, Examines Government-Run Health Care By MELISSA SCOTT, Sept. 7, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban medical professionals are not paid high salaries by international standards. In 2002 the mean monthly salary was 261 pesos, 1.5 times the national mean.&lt;ref&gt;Economic crisis and access to care: Cuba's health care system since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nayeri K, Lopez-Pardo CM. p.13 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16320905&amp;dopt=Abstract online]&lt;/ref&gt;
A doctor’s salary in the late 1990s was equivalent to about US$15–20 per month in purchasing power. Therefore, some prefer to work in different occupations, for example in the lucrative tourist industry where earnings can be much higher.&lt;ref name="sixto" /&gt;

Cuban doctors that have been sent on international missions by the Cuban government have reported being paid less than the local doctors and treated poorly by the local government.  They are sometimes monitored by the local government in case of defecting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"On a mission: how Cuba uses its doctors abroad" by Sara Carrillo de Albornoz. This article discusses Cuba's healthcare help abroad, but also critiques that it may be contributing to a shortage of care and resources at home.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and [[National Public Radio]] have all reported on Cuban doctors defecting to other countries when on international missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/02/25/MNGN4O8FAC1.DTL|title=Cuban doctors defect from Venezuela posts|author=Juan Forero|date=25 February 2007|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/02/AR2007020200987.html|title=Cuban Doctors Awaiting U.S. Response|author=Joshua Goodman|date=2 February 2007|publisher=Washington Post}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7492240|title=Cuban Doctors Seek Path to U.S.|author=Juan Forero|date=20 February 2007|publisher=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuban doctors at home have experienced an increased work-load to cover for the doctors abroad, although there is no evidence that this has negatively affected health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A 2018 paper using a [[synthetic control method]] found that infant mortality increased in the first years of the Castro regime relative to other similar countries, but that infant mortality reverted to trend during the 1970s irrespective of foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bologna Pavlik|first=Jamie|last2=Geloso|first2=Vincent|date=2018-06-22|title=The Cuban Revolution and Infant Mortality, 1959-1974|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3201194|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black market healthcare===
The difficulty in gaining access to certain medicines and treatments has led to healthcare playing an increasing role in Cuba's burgeoning [[black market]] economy, sometimes termed "[[sociolismo]]". According to former leading Cuban [[neurosurgeon]] and [[dissident]] Dr [[Hilda Molina]], "The doctors in the hospitals are charging patients under the table for better or quicker service." Prices for out-of-surgery X-rays have been quoted at $50 to $60.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/15194223.htm Miami Herald]. August 04, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Such "under-the-table payments" reportedly date back to the 1970s, when Cubans used gifts and tips in order to get health benefits. The harsh economic downturn known as the "[[Special Period]]" in the 1990s aggravated these payments. The advent of the "dollar economy", a  legalization of the dollar which led some Cubans to receive dollars from their relatives outside of Cuba, meant that a class of Cubans were able to obtain medications and health services that would not be available to them otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlay-online.com/finlayinstitute/healthintransition.htm Cuba's Health in Transition and the Central and Eastern European].

[[File:UgandamarkII.jpg|thumb|200px|A busy Mark II pump in Uganda. Children often bear the responsibility for collecting water. Durability needs to be incorporated into pump design to the handle the heavy use (and abuse).]]
The '''India Mark II'''  is a human-powered pump designed to lift water from a depth of fifty metres or less. The Mark II is world's most widely used water handpump.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, M. (1994): Are handpumps really affordable? Proceedings of the 20th WEDC Conference, WEDC pp. 132-134&lt;/ref&gt;  The pump was designed in the 1970s to serve village water needs in developing countries and rural areas.  The pump is installed on top of a drilled well or [[borehole]] and lifts water from the bottom of the well through repeatedly moving the pump handle up and down.  Several manufacturers, primarily in India, manufacture the pump which now falls under [[public domain]].  By the mid 1990s, five million of the pumps had been manufactured and installed.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, M. (1994): Are handpumps really affordable? Proceedings of the 20th WEDC Conference, WEDC pp. 132-134&lt;/ref&gt;India Mark ll Pumps' bored hole may be fitted with solar thermal siphon pump to run on solar energy. The resulting assembly may be called India Mark IV Solar Pump of Dr.gps-design..

== History ==
[[File:A typical Mark II hand pump in India.jpg|thumb|200px|A typical Mark II hand pump in India.]]
The pump was designed in the 1970s in a joint effort between the Government of India, [[UNICEF]], and [[The World Health Organization]] (WHO) to address the severe drought and a water shortage affecting India during that period and to prevent evacuation of villages to refugee camps.  Prior to the pumps design, poor quality cast-iron replicas of pumps used in Europe and North America to support a single family were used.  While these types of pumps in the US might have been used by a farming family three or four times a day, those in India were used incessantly by an entire community, with women and children lining up to use each pump from dawn till dusk. Not surprisingly, the pumps frequently broke down. When UNICEF did a survey of boreholes and pumps in two Indian states, it found that 75 per cent of the pumps were out of action.
The requirements for the pump included the need for a design simple enough to be manufactured in unsophisticated workshops, easy to maintain, and costing no more than US$200 (in 1970s dollars). The Mark II was based on the Sholapur pump, the most durable pump at that time, designed by Swedish volunteer, engineer, and inventor Oscar Carlsson of the Sholapur Well Service, operating under the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden and the Hindustani Covenant Church of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57723489|title=Water, a matter of life and health: water supply and sanitation in village India|last=Talbot|first=Rupert|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Black, Maggie|year=2004|isbn=0195669312|location=New Delhi|pages=64|oclc=57723489}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ircwash.org/resources/india-handpump-revolution-challenge-and-change|title=India handpump revolution : challenge and change :: IRC|website=www.ircwash.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;In just 20 years, 1 million of the pumps had been manufactured and installed in the developing world.  An Indian magazine listed India Mark II hand pump as one of the defining inventions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Village water supplies" UNICEF  http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/hpump.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanics ==
The pump's primary components consist of the pump handle, the riser main which carries the water to the surface, the pump cylinder which pushes water up the riser main, and the connecting rod which connects the pump handle to the pump cylinder at the bottom of the well.  After a [[borehole]] is drilled, a well casing is inserted into the hole to prevent the erosion of the borehole walls.  The India Mark II needs a borehole with a  minimum diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;cm. The casing has a well screen to allow water to pass into the casing but keeps rocks and dirt out.  A pump cylinder is attached to the bottom of a series of pipes call riser mains or riser pipes and sits below the water surface in the well once installed.  The riser main will carry the water from the pump cylinder to the surface.  Inside the riser main, a series of rods connect the pump handle to the top of the pump cylinder at the bottom of the well.  The reciprocating up and down movement of the pump handle raises and lowers the connecting rod thus raising and lowering the plunger of the pump cylinder.  Two one-way water valves inside the cylinder suck water into the cylinder on the upstroke and force the water into the riser main on the down stroke.  Water flows up the riser main and out of the spout at the top of the well head assembly.

== Reliability ==

While the pump performance is much better than the European designed family pumps that were installed prior to this new design, the India Mark II has several flaws.  Many versions of the pump use cast iron riser mains (the pipe that carries water from the bottom of the borehole to the surface).  These pipes rust quickly (sometimes in just 2 years), and either leak water or separate completely from the pump rendering it useless.   The pump requires routine maintenance and will fall into disrepair if certain procedures are not followed.  A pump cylinder rests at the bottom of the borehole and may needs to be replaced every two years.  To remove the cylinder, the riser main also needs to be lifted from the borehole.  As one can imagine, lifting up to 100&amp;nbsp;ft of iron pipe and cylinder from a well is no easy task and requires special tools, a tripod stand, the replacement parts, and most importantly, the know-how to do it.  In many developing countries and remote villages, these requirements cannot be met and the pumps often remain broken.   Some estimates put the number of broken pumps at 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flyingblueclubafrica.com/business/business-for-business/fairwater-foundation-offers-sustainable-water-pumps-that-last&lt;/ref&gt; 
	Longer lasting materials can be retrofitted to the India Mark II.  PVC riser mains are less expensive and can last longer.  PVC is much lighter, easier to work with and significantly reduce the cost of ownership of the well.  PVC has had its own set of issues.  In deeper wells, the pumping action can flex the PVC and cause cracking.  The connecting rods can also wear through the PVC if the rods are not centred in the riser main.  Riser main stabilizer and connecting rod centralizers can be used to prvent this type of wear.  Ministry of water officials have pushed back on the using of PVC citing the materials have not been tested thoroughly, though several countries have been using PVC successfully for years.  Government corruption may be at the root of the decision.  Iron replacement pipes are often paid for by the NGO.  The sellers of the pipes are often the ministry members themselves, family or close friends.

== Future of the India Mark II ==
Major criticism of the India Mark II is that its design makes it difficult to repair at the village level and hence, without government support, NGO intervention, or community savings systems in place, the pump is more susceptible to extended periods of non-function or permanent failure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lboro.ac.uk/well/resources/well-studies/full-reports-pdf/task0162.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower upfront hardware costs and widespread adoption of the Mark II pump makes replacement parts more accessible.  Unfortunately, higher maintenance costs and frequency of parts that need to be replaced can make the pump financially unsustainable in a poor community.  

More reliable pumps have been developed to be maintained at the local level: [[Village-level operation and maintenance (pumps)|village level operations and maintenance]] (VLOM).  The India Mark III, Afridev, and Bluepump are the most common VLOM pumps.  The pumps incorporate the use of larger PVC riser mains to allow for the pump cylinder to be removed without lifting the rising main out of the borehole.  This makes maintenance on the pumps easier but the initial cost for the pipes can be twice as much.  Routine maintenance is still required and maintaining funds for replacement parts is still necessary.  Without the need for a specialized pump mechanic these newer pump designs can provide longer lasting sustainable access to drinking water.  Unfortunately, some countries have restricted importation and installation of these pumps citing the need to standardize pumps to reduce cost and ensure an adequate supply of replacement parts. The government of Uganda, for example,  enforces the standardization by placing high tariffs on pumps other than a variant of the India Mark II, known as U2.

== Technical Information ==

* Maximum operating depths: 45&amp;nbsp;m (147 feet).
* Minimum Borehole Size 100&amp;nbsp;mm
* Stroke Length 125&amp;nbsp;mm
* Cylinder setting depth range 9-45&amp;nbsp;mm
* Discharge per stroke 0.40&amp;nbsp;L
* Discharge per hour 0.8&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

The India Mark II is a Public Domain design handpump. The international design is maintained by the Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rural-water-supply.net/en/implementation/handpump-overview/india-mark-ii&lt;/ref&gt; however India, Ghana and Uganda have their own national standards for the India Mark II and its variants.

[[File:Jyu-kanbo National Museum of Detention for Hansen's Disease Patients.jpg|thumb|Jyu-kanbo (special hospital ward) National Museum of Detention for Hansen's Disease Patients]]
'''Kusatsu Special Prison''' was a prison present between 1938 and 1947, built in [[Kuryu Rakusen-en Sanatorium]] in [[Kusatsu Onsen]], [[Kusatsu, Gunma|Kusatsu town]], [[Gunma Prefecture]], [[Japan]], where criminals in public leprosariums throughout Japan were imprisoned.  Prisons for conventional crimes had been built earlier in all public leprosariums. 22 out of 93 prisoners died of cold or maltreatment in the cells or after confinement. In Japanese, it was called Tokubetsu Byoshitsu (特別病室,Special Ward) or Jyu Kanbo (重監房,Prison for Severe Crimes).

==Related history==
In 1909, the first public leprosy policy started in Japan, creating public leprosariums (sanatoriums) which accommodated wandering lepers; some of them criminals. In 1915, the treatment of criminals was discussed by leprosarium directors. In 1916, the leprosy prevention law was amended and this time, decisions of confinement and custody could be made by directors of leprosariums, reduction of meals (this was discontinued in 1947) and 30-day confinement in a leprosarium. Between 1912 and 1951, several riots took place in leprosariums.

==The prison==
Kusatsu Special Prison was completed at the end of 1938. There were 8 independent cells; each cell was less than 4.5m in size, with wooden floors with a hole as a latrine. There was a small hole for the distribution of meals. There was no heating system. The cells had tall walls and were physically separate from each other, each cell being a separate building entity. The temperature would often reach -20&amp;nbsp;°C. Administration, maintenance and repression were roles partaken by male nurses.

==Statistics==
*Deaths in prison ;14, Deaths after confinement in prison ;8, Survivors ;71, Total ; 93
**Months of death: Nov-Mar; 18, July-Aug; 3, Sep-Oct; 1, Total 22
**Mean days of confinement: 156 days for deaths within the cells: 239 days for deaths after confinement, 114 days for survivors, Mean, 131.days

==Dispute==
*In March, 1947, Paul Rush, an American colonel physician, visited the sanatorium and heard the complaints of patients, and subsequently the patients sent a complaint letter, but received no response.&lt;ref&gt;The records of Hansen's disease Prison, Michio Miyasaka, Shueicha, 2006.2006.p155. from Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, Aug 3, morning paper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August l, [[Prince Takamatsu]] visited the sanatorium and entered the prison. He asked the sanatorium staff several questions. On August 11, [[Japan Communist Party]] members, in preparation for a coming upper house election, visited the sanatorium and were surprised to see the prison. On Aug. 22, discussions between patients and the sanatorium began.
*When the diet problem was discussed, the director was changed and the responsible section-chief was dismissed.

==Testimony==
*Jun Takada, 19 at that time, testified against the prison.
{{Quotation| Transfer of dead bodies: The season was almost winter, and we had to obey the order of the doctors. It was about 9 or 10 in the morning. I carried about 5 or 6 bodies. The dead body was like a dried frog; he was dead and freezed. It was dark and violet in color.  We covered him with futon, and carried the futon and placed the body on a stretcher. The place was dark and the door was going to close, and we shouted "Don't close".}}

==Kikuchi Medical Prison==
*The necessity of a prison was disputed in the diet and [[Kikuchi Medical Prison]] was built in 1953 in [[Kōshi, Kumamoto|Kōshi]] city, [[Kumamoto Prefecture]].

A '''microbiologist''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μῑκρος}}) is a [[scientist]] who studies [[microscopic]] life forms and processes. This includes study of the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[fungi]], and some types of parasites and their vectors.&lt;ref name=BLSwhat&gt;{{cite web|title=What Microbiologists Do |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-2 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most microbiologists work in offices and/or research facilities, both in private [[biotechnology]] companies as well as in [[academia]]. Most microbiologists specialize in a given topic within [[microbiology]] such as [[bacteriology]], [[parasitology]], [[virology]], or [[immunology]].

Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], often considered to be the first [[list of microscopists|microscopist]] and microbiologist&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Lane|Lane, Nick]] (6 March 2015). "The Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning Little Animal'." ''Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci''. 2015 Apr; 370 (1666): 20140344. [doi:10.1098/rstb.2014.0344]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Duties ==
Microbiologists generally work in some way to increase scientific knowledge, or to utilize that knowledge in a way that improves outcomes in medicine or some industry. For many microbiologists, this work includes planning and conducting experimental research projects in some kind of [[laboratory]] setting.&lt;ref name=BLSwhat/&gt; Others may have a more administrative role, supervising scientists and evaluating their results. Microbiologists working in the medical field, such as [[clinical microbiology|clinical microbiologists]], may see patients or patient samples and do various tests to detect [[pathogen|disease-causing organisms]].&lt;ref name=BLSwhat/&gt;

For microbiologists working in academia, duties include performing research in an academic laboratory, writing [[grant (money)|grant proposals]] to fund research, as well as some amount of teaching and designing courses.&lt;ref name=ASM&gt;{{cite web|title=Careers in Microbiology |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=https://www.asm.org/images/Membership/Careers_Website/Membership/Careers_in_Microbiology_PRINT_Letter_size.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbiologists in industry roles may have similar duties except research is performed in industrial labs in order to develop or improve commercial products and processes. Industry jobs may also include some degree of sales and marketing work, as well as regulatory compliance duties. Microbiologists working in government may have a variety of duties, including laboratory research, writing and advising, developing and reviewing regulatory processes, and overseeing grants offered to outside institutions.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt; Some microbiologists work in the field of [[patent law]], either with national patent offices or private law practices. Here duties include research and navigation of [[intellectual property]] regulations.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt; Clinical microbiologists tend to work in government or hospital laboratories where their duties include analyzing clinical specimens to detect microorganisms responsible for disease. Some microbiologists instead work in the field of [[science outreach]], where they develop programs and material to educate students and non-scientists and stimulate interest in the field of microbiology.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt;

== Education ==
Entry-level microbiology jobs generally require at least a [[bachelor's degree]] in microbiology or a related field.&lt;ref name=BLShow&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become a Microbiologist |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-4 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These degree programs frequently include courses in [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[genetics]], followed by more specialized courses in sub-fields of interest. Many of these courses have laboratory components to teach trainees basic and specialized laboratory skills.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

Higher-level and independent jobs generally require a [[Ph.D.]] as well as several years experience as a microbiologist. This often includes time spent as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] wherein one leads research projects and prepares to transition to an independent career. Postdoctoral researchers are often evaluated largely based on their record of published [[academic paper]]s, as well as recommendations from their supervisors and colleagues.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

In certain sub-fields of microbiology, [[license]]s or [[certification]]s are available or required in order to qualify for certain positions. This is true for clinical microbiologists, as well as those involved in food safety and some aspects of pharmaceutical/medical device development.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

== Job outlook ==
Microbiologists will continue to be needed to advance basic science knowledge and to contribute to development of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products.&lt;ref name=BLSoutlook&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Outlook |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-6 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, job prospects vary widely by job and location.

In the United States, the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] predicts that employment of microbiologists will grow 4 percent from 2014 (22,400 employed) to 2024 (23,200 employed). This represents slower growth than the average occupation, as well as slower growth than life scientists as a whole (6 percent projected).&lt;ref name=BLSoutlook/&gt;

The '''Fire Fighter Near Miss Reporting System''' was launched on August 12, 2005 by the International Association of Fire Chiefs.  It was announced at a press conference in Denver, Colorado, after having completed a pilot program involving 38 fire departments across the country.  The Near Miss Reporting System aims to prevent injuries and save lives of other firefighters by collecting, sharing and analyzing near-miss experiences.  The near-miss experiences are collected by firefighters who voluntarily submit them; the reports are confidential, non-punitive, and secure.  After the reports are compiled, they are posted to the website where firefighters can access them and learn from each other's real-life experiences.  Overall these reports help to formulate strategies, reduce firefighter injuries and fatalities, and enhance the safety culture of the fire service.  The program is based on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), which has been gathering reports of close calls from pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers since 1976.  The reporting system is funded by the International Association of Fire Chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/faq/#question5 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505084131/http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/faq/#question5 |date=May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-miss event==
A near-miss event is defined as an opportunity to improve health and safety practices based on a condition or an incident with potential for more serious consequence.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/faq/#question1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505084131/http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/faq/#question1 |date=May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-miss report==
A near-miss report consists of five sections:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/faq/#question1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505084131/http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/faq/#question1 |date=May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Report of the Week ===
Every Wednesday there is a new Report of the Week.  These reports are available online and can be emailed for free with a Report of the Week subscription.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/newsletter-signup/&lt;/ref&gt;  They are ideal tools used for training and for informational purposes.

The reports chosen are recent and contain discussion questions for further thought.  They are also matched with 5 similar reports from previous years.  These reports give readers insight to what is currently going on, and how people are dealing with their near-misses.  The discussion questions help readers understand what actions need to be taken in order to prevent further near-misses.  Many subscribers use the reports for informal training drills, forward the reports to other fire departments, or use them for their own informational needs.

== Resources ==
The Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System website offers many different resources to its users.  As mentioned above, there is a Report of the Week, which offers a training tool for departments all over the country.  In addition to the Report of the Week, there are illustrated case studies, videos, grouped reports, and photos.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/resources/ |title=Index of /resources |publisher=Firefighternearmiss.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Videos and Photos:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/Resources/Videos_and_Photos/&lt;/ref&gt;  You can find many different visuals here that can help you understand the reports.&lt;br&gt;
Near-Miss Calendar:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/Resources/Calendar_2010/&lt;/ref&gt; The Near-Miss calendar contains case studies and other information about the program.

==Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS)==
The U.S. Navy's [[Human Factors Analysis and Classification System]] (HFACS) was selected as the first tool for analyzing firefighter near-miss reports. HFACS takes four levels of individual and institutional performance into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firefighternearmiss.com/data/Applying_HFACS_to_Aviation_Accidents_Wiegmann_&amp;_Shappell.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unsafe acts
# Preconditions to unsafe acts
# Unsafe supervision
# Organizational influences

===HFACS level 1 - Unsafe acts===
The "unsafe acts" level contains two categories: errors and violations. The determination that an unsafe act has occurred is not an indictment of an individual firefighter or firefighters. So far, statistics have shown that 80% of reported near misses have occurred when firefighters were following established procedures.
Errors are classified as resulting from lack of skill, education or training, poor decision making, or misperception. Each in turn can be broken down into omissions, failure to prioritize, poor technique, misinterpretation of conditions, wrong response to conditions, and decision errors.

===HFACS level 2 - Preconditions to unsafe acts===
The "preconditions to unsafe acts" level focuses on the individuals involved. Was the individual focused or distracted? Was the individual hurried? Was the individual physically ill or otherwise unfit for duty? Was the individual somehow incompatible with the assigned task? The team is also analyzed. For example, are the team members familiar with, and do they practice [[crew resource management]] and personal readiness?

===HFACS level 3 - Unsafe supervision===
The "unsafe supervision" level mirrors the military's emphasis on the officer's role in all aspects of operations. Specifically it looks at factors like inadequate supervision, poor planning, failure to correct problems, and other supervisory problems.

===HFACS level 4 - Organizational influences===
The "organizational influences" level is the final level of evaluation. It acknowledges that a fire departments top management is ultimately responsible for organizational culture, and may have contributed to some degree to a firefighter's actions that led to a near-miss event.

==Error management==
Based on the first year of data, the various working groups of the National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System have offered the following recommendations for error-management and to improve firefighter performance and safety.
*Require a 360-degree evaluation of all structures prior to interior operations.
*Require all officers to perform a risk/benefit analysis. When the risk exceeds the benefit, safety trumps exposure to harm.
*Adopt an error management philosophy at the department level and distinguish between good faith errors and willful disregard for policy.
*Explore and adopt [[crew resource management]] to improve leader performance, crew safety, and incident management.
*Aggressive mentalities need to transition into purposeful action mentalities. Blind "duty to act" mindsets create harmful institutional climates and put firefighters in unnecessary danger.
*Fire departments must share knowledge gained from near-misses that were prevented by following procedure, as well as those that occur due to error.
*The near-miss reporting system should add questions about SOPs/SOGs, supervisor training, and organizational elements to aid in the review process.

'''Nummular keratitis''' is a feature of viral [[keratoconjunctivitis]]. It is a common feature of [[adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis]] (an ocular [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] infection),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdmRAQAAQBAJ|title=Jaypee Gold Standard Mini Atlas Series® Diseases of the Cornea|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as approximately 1/3rd of cases of [[Ophthalmic zoster|Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus]] infections. It represents the presence of anterior stromal infiltrates. Unilateral or bilateral subepithelial lesions of the [[cornea]] may be present. Slit lamp examination reveals multiple tiny granular deposits surrounded by a halo of stromal haze. After healing, residual 'nummular scars' often remain.

An '''outpatient department''' or '''outpatient clinic''' is the part of a hospital designed for the treatment of outpatients, people with health problems who visit the hospital for diagnosis or treatment, but do not at this time require a bed or to be admitted for overnight care. Modern outpatient departments offer a wide range of treatment services, diagnostic tests and minor surgical procedures.

==The department==
The outpatient clinic of a hospital, also called an outpatient department provides diagnosis and care for patients that do not need to stay overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Outpatient+department Segen's Medical Dictionary and Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing] &lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from [[clinic]]s independent of hospitals, almost all of which are designed mostly or exclusively for outpatient care and may also be called outpatient clinics. 

The outpatient department is an important part of the overall running of the hospital. It is normally integrated with the in-patient services and manned by consultant physicians and surgeons who also attend inpatients in the wards. Many patients are examined and given treatment as outpatients before being admitted to the hospital at a later date as inpatients. When discharged, they may attend the outpatient clinic for follow-up treatment.&lt;ref name=Kunders&gt;{{cite book|author=Kunders, G.D.|title=Hospitals: Facilities Planning and Management |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SE8p0Xrn3kwC&amp;pg=PA221 |year=2004 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-050269-7 |pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outpatient department will usually be on the ground floor of the hospital with car-parking facilities nearby. Wheelchairs and stretchers are available for non-ambulatory patients. Patients will register at a reception desk and there is seating for them while they wait for their appointments. Each doctor will have a consulting room and there may be smaller waiting areas near these. Paediatric clinics are often held in areas separated from the adult clinics. Close at hand will be X-ray facilities, laboratories, the medical record office and a pharmacy. In the main waiting area there are a range of facilities for the patients and their families including toilets, [[telephone booth|public telephones]], [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] or snack bar, water dispenser, gift shop, florist and quiet room.&lt;ref name=Kunders/&gt;

Not all hospitals have separate outpatient departments, so outpatients may be treated in the same departments as patients that stay overnight.

The [[Royal College of Physicians]] said that UK outpatient clinics were stuck "in the 18th Century" and an expensive waste of time and money.  There were 127 million appointments in 2017 and about 20% of them were cancelled or the patient did not turn up.  57% of them ran late. They wanted more use of remote monitoring, telephone and video consultations and senior nurses running clinics closer to people's homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHS outpatients service 'stuck in the 18th Century' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/health-46142276 |accessdate=9 November 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Richard Abramson''' (born December 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1949 in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]]) is a [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] [[psychology]] professor, [[expert witness]], [[author]], and [[musician]].

== Life and Career ==
The oldest son of Leonard Abramson and Ethel Esther Sakowitz, Abramson grew up in Norwalk, Connecticut, graduating from Norwalk High School in 1967. He received a bachelor’s degree in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Miami]] in 1971, a master’s degree in psychology from [[Connecticut College]] in 1973, and a Ph.D. in psychology from the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1976. His research focused on the interplay between [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[personality]].  

In 1976, Abramson became an assistant professor of psychology at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. He then moved through the ranks of associate and full professor at UCLA. Abramson taught courses on Art and Trauma (undergraduate), [[Human sexuality|Human Sexuality]] (undergraduate and graduate), Independent Study (undergraduate and graduate), Introduction to Psychology (undergraduate), Personality (undergraduate and graduate), Personality Assessment (graduate), [[Sex and the law|Sex and the Law]] (undergraduate and graduate) and Supervised Doctoral Research (graduate).

Abramson was also a Visiting Professor of Psychology at [[Kyoto University]] in [[Japan]] in 1983, Editor of the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'' from 1988-1992, and Technical Advisor to the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization’s]] Global Programme on AIDS in 1991. He received the Gold Medal Award for Feature Articles in Scholarly Journals in 1997, and [[KPFK]]’s Reading Service Helen Keller Award in 2013.

Abramson is married to Tania Love Abramson. He has two children.

With few exceptions, Abramson rarely conducted traditional psychological [[research]]. Problems were his bailiwick, and criticism his touchstone. He employed methods – [[Mathematical model|mathematical models]], narrative theories, [[Constitutional law|constitutional scholarship]], [[archival research]], [[epidemiology]], psychological [[Interview (research)|interviews]], [[ethnography]], the [[philosophy]] of [[aesthetics]] – that suited the conundrums he grappled with.

Why is [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|severe trauma]] so protracted and unpredictable? Are multiple [[One-night stand|one-night stands]] with a condom riskier than serial [[monogamy]] without them? Can the philosophy of aesthetics be extended to severe trauma? Why is [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] so pleasurable? Why don’t Americans have [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; amendment]] constitutionally protected [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual rights]]? How does a person who is [[Visual impairment|blind]] experience [[sexual attraction]]? Why is [[sexual violence]] so ubiquitous?

==Human Sexuality==
Abramson, along with Donald Mosher, were among the first psychology professors to add scientific rigor to the study of [[human sexuality]]. Though Kinsey conducted research on the way Americans expressed their sexuality, and [[Masters &amp; Johnson]] did the same for the underlying physiology, Abramson and Mosher extended this line of work by introducing psychological variables into the mix, guilt in particular. The experience of sexual guilt, for example, is one of the best ways to account for the variability in human sexual expression. Abramson expanded upon this research by studying this process cross-culturally, in Japan in particular. Many other studies on the psychology of human sexuality followed. Most notable of all, however, is the work he did on sexual pleasure with his former student Steven Pinkerton. Their book ''With Pleasure'' answers the most basic question about sex, namely, why does it feel so good? This book reframed the dialogue and research agenda on the study of sex.

==HIV/AIDS Research==
Having published a series of studies on [[genital herpes]] in the mid-1980s, Abramson was well positioned to transition into research on [[HIV/AIDS]]. Challenging some of the earlier epidemiological scenarios on the proliferation of HIV, Abramson and colleagues (notably [[Steve Pinkerton]], Edward Kaplan and Bruce Rothschild) developed a [[Bernoulli process]] model of HIV infection and risk reduction, a mathematical model of AIDS education, and an alternative mathematical prediction of HIV infection. The importance of condoms were stressed throughout, including (in 1993) a series of challenges to the funding priorities underlying an HIV prevention vaccine to the exclusion of alternative prevention strategies, such as better condoms or HIV preventing gels. Abramson also served as a Technical Advisor to the World Health Organization’s Global Program on AIDS.

==Sex And The Law==
The U.S. Constitution guarantees certain fundamental rights, such as the freedoms of speech and religious expression. But what guarantees our sexual freedoms? The text of the Constitution makes no reference to sex, family, or procreation. Though the right to privacy is tangential to sex, it is not in the Constitution or a putative sexual right either. It is simply a barrier to being observed or intruded upon by the government without just cause. Sexual conduct per se is still perceived as having no Constitutional protection whatsoever.

Abramson is trying to change that through his books and teaching. Arguing that sexual freedom is cut from the same cloth as other freedoms protected by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], Abramson and his former students (Steve Pinkerton and Mark Huppin) argued (in the book ''Sexual Rights in America'') that the freedom to choose how, when and with whom to express sexuality is a quintessential right protected by the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]. The Ninth Amendment states the following: “the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Abramson wryly notes that without sexual rights, there would be no “people.” More importantly, he asserts that the manner in which we make choices about sex (among consenting adults and void of tangible harm) is the way we exercise this fundamental right protected by the Ninth Amendment (and extended to States by the Fourteenth Amendment.)

Abramson extended this argument in a second book titled ''Romance in the Ivory Tower: The rights and liberty of conscience''. He asserted that the choices we make about love and sex are no less intimate or deeply personal as the choices we make about God or religion. Together with the Ninth Amendment, and the right to privacy, the rights and liberty of conscience combine to create a zone of personal autonomy that is immune from governmental intrusion; including decisions or actions related sex, God or love.

To further this area of inquiry, Abramson also created at UCLA the first class in the United States devoted to the study of the interface between sex and the law, as it relates to criminal, civil, and constitutionally relevant litigation.

==Child Sexual Abuse==
Abramson’s 1984 book, ''Sarah: A Sexual Biography'' was one of the first in-depth psychological portrayals of the ravages of [[childhood sexual abuse]]. A true-life story, it was also a testimonial to the psychological survival of the victim. Though Americans have grown accustomed to the enormity of childhood sexual abuse through its depiction in newspapers, novels, memoirs and movies, this was not the case in 1984. When the Los Angeles Times reviewed the book shortly after publication it remarked, “How can so much intimate, destructive violence be part of our here and now, almost before our eyes? No novelist would dare, because fiction can neither resolve, nor even make reasonable, this material.”

Abramson continued to write about the impact of childhood sexual abuse, most notably the nation’s largest [[child pornography]] case which involved over 3000 images of children, discovered at the home of the director of a prominent preschool. Another book he wrote about this subject matter, with co-author Steven Pinkerton (a psychiatry professor at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]]), is A House Divided: Suspicions of mother-daughter incest.  The book details a child sexual molestation case (drawn from his three decades of serving as an expert witness in civil and criminal litigation) gone shockingly awry, and concludes with recommendations for policy changes to minimize false accusations.

==Film==
Together with his former wife photographer Ann Purdy, Abramson wrote and directed the short experimental film ''Regret is My Demon'' that premiered at the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]] in 2008. Composed almost entirely of still photographs with voice-over narration, ''Regret is My Demon'' tells the story of a teenage girl who blames herself for her mother's heroin addiction and untimely death. [[Chris Marker]]'s ''[[La Jetee]]'' (1962), [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" and [[Cindy Sherman]]'s ''Untitled Film Stills'' (1977–1982) are obvious influences. ''Regret is My Demon'' was produced and edited by [http://www.blisss.com/ Blisss Productions].

==Music==
Abramson is the lead singer and lyricist of the band ''[https://crying4kafka.com/ Crying 4 Kafka].'' They have six CDs, all produced by Paul du Gre for the record labels ''Waiting for Godzilla'' and ''Hellflowers in LA.'' Additional songs were produced by Abramson and Ian Putnam for ''Vending Machine Sound''. The CDs and songs are available on [[iTunes]].

Abramson wrote the play ''The Saint of Fucked Up Karma'' (2017). He also composed the music with [[Robin Finck]] of ''[[Nine Inch Nails]]'' and ''Crying 4 Kafka''. ''The Saint of Fucked Up Karma'' was performed as a musical in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Barbara, California]] in 2013.

== Drawing ==
Abramson’s drawings illustrate two books, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Saint-Fucked-Up-Karma-Musical-ebook/dp/B072M8MHBJ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543792419&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Saint+of+Fucked+Up+Karma The Saint of Fucked Up Karma]'' (2017) and Erika Blair’s ''[https://www.amazon.com/Sanctity-Rhyme-Metaphysics-Crying-Kafka/dp/0692096825/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543792436&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Sanctity+of+Rhyme%3A+The+Metaphysics+of+Crying+4+Kafka The Sanctity of Rhyme: The Metaphysics of Crying 4 Kafka]'' (2018)''.''

'''Polluter pays amendment''' was passed negating the "polluter pays" provision of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]] in 2003.. The original provision required those in the [[Everglades Agricultural Area]] (EAA) who cause water pollution to be responsible for paying the costs of that pollution's abatement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.flsenate.gov/data/session/2003/House/bills/analysis/pdf/h1893.nr.pdf|title=2003 House Bills Analysis|last=FL Senate|first=|date=April 18, 2003|website=FL Senate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court concluded that the provision requires "implementing legislation"; the Legislature has not adopted statutes implementing the provision, instead forcing taxpayers to pay 66% of the costs of dealing with contamination in the Everglades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/food/2012/03/florida-everglades-pollution-sugar/|title=In the Everglades, Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Industry’s Mess|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study commissioned by the [[Everglades Foundation]] found that the agricultural industry is responsible for 76 percent of phosphorus contamination in the Everglades (the rest being urban runoff and wastewater), yet pays only 24 percent of the cost of dealing with it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is despite Florida's polluter pays amendment requiring the polluters themselves to be "primarily responsible" for cleanup of the wetlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The [[Everglades Forever Act]] was passed in 1994 as an effort to restore the state's struggling wetlands. In 1996, nearly 70% of Floridians voted to approve the polluter pays amendment to the Constitution. The amendment stated: "Those in the Everglades Agricultural Area who cause water pollution within the Everglades Protection Area or the Everglades Agricultural Area shall be primarily responsible for paying the costs of the abatement of that pollution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sugar farming occurs on approximately 450,000 acres of the EAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dpanther.fiu.edu/sobek/FI12010314/00001|title=Florida sugar farmers : Proud partners in the Everglades restoration|website=dpanther.fiu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida's attorney general Robert A. Butterworth stated in 1996 that "while the Legislature may enact provisions implementing Amendment #5, the amendment itself establishes an obligation on polluters of the Everglades to pay the costs of abating such pollution irrespective of legislative action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myfloridalegal.com/ago.nsf/Opinions/9083F168C353A721852563F600673D09|title=Advisory Legal Opinion - Constitutional Amendment, Everglades Water Pollution|website=myfloridalegal.com|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2003, the Supreme Court deemed the provision "not self-executing and required implementing legislation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; No such legislation has been implemented.

The following year, Judd started presenting the weekend weather for ''[[Seven News]]'' in Perth. Her presenting role drew criticism from some public, who complained that she looked [[anorexic]]. She spoke out against the claims, saying that she had never suffered from an eating disorder and she believed the fuss was due to her relationship with Chris Judd. ''[[Seven News]]'' director Shaun Menegola said it was a shame Judd had been attacked by some viewers and explained that her tall stature meant she looked thinner on camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== The history of the foundation of [[Pasteur Institute of Iran]] ==
One year after [[World War I]] and despite the persistent problems caused by casualties and infectious diseases in the country resulting from war, the Iranian government decided to renew its relationship with France to promote medical sciences and research concerning different types of endemic [[infectious diseases]]. The Iranian delegates met [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux]], the general director of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, in 1919 and this visit laid the foundation of Pasteur Institute of Iran.

On 20 January 1921, Professor René Legroux, the leading delegate of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, signed a memorandum of understanding with the minister for foreign affairs of Iran and as a result, Pasteur Institute of Iran was established. Pasteur Institute of Iran was the tenth Pasteur Institute formed worldwide. 
[[File:Institute of Iran, 1921.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: Dr. René Legroux, Dr. Aliasghar Moadab Nafisi (the Iranian Minister of Health), signing the Memorandum of Understanding to establish Pasteur Institute of Iran, 1921.]] 
Moreover, Pasteur Institute of Iran formally started its activity on 23 August 1921. Following Emil Roux's suggestion, Joseph Mesnard was nominated as the first general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran and he served in this position for five years.
The second French general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran was Joseph Kerandel, who arrived in Tehran in 1926 and stayed in Iran until the end of his life in 1934. He is buried in the Catholic graveyard in Tehran. This dedicated person devoted his life to the development of Pasteur Institute of Iran, complementing the contribution of his Iranian colleagues Dr Abolghasem Bahrami, Dr. Mehdi Ghodsi, Dr. Hassan Mirdamadi, Dr. Hussein Mashuf, Dr. Ahmad Najm Abadi, Dr. Vartani, Dr. Teymour Dolatshahi, among others; all of these activities led to the advancement of Pasteur Institute of Iran.
After Dr. Kerandel’s death, Dr. Hussein Mashuf was nominated general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran. After a year, Professor Legroux was appointed scientific director of Pasteur Institute of Iran on behalf of the Pasteur Institute of Paris. He made several trips to Iran to determine the strategies and supervise the activities of Pasteur Institute of Iran; in his absence, Dr. Abolghasem Bahrami was in charge. 
Due to [[World War II]], the relationship between the Pasteur Institutes in Iran and Paris was interrupted (from 1939 to 1945); however, the institute continued its activities under the direct supervision of Dr. Bahrami and his deputy, Dr. Ghodsi. Before the war, when the number of laboratories was limited and their activities failed to meet the needs of the country, most of the national health issues related to the ministry of health were addressed by Pasteur Institute of Iran; one of its activities was evaluating the [[quarantining]] effectiveness in the country and Pasteur Institute of Iran successfully undertook this important responsibility with the contribution of the authorities at the time (Dr. Ehyaolmolk, Dr. Ehyaolsaltane, Dr. Amiraalam, and Dr. Loghmanolmolk).
After World War II, in order to further develop Pasteur Institute of Iran and establish new departments, Dr. Manuchehr Eghbal, the Minister of Health, invited a group of members of the Pasteur Institute of Paris to come to Iran to revise the structures and suggest new strategies. This team, including Dr. Pasteur Valery Radot, the head of the council of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, and other officials visited Iran in 1946; they also participated in the 25th [[anniversary]] of the [[inauguration]] of Pasteur Institute of Iran.
On the 25 August 1946, the complementary agreement of technical and scientific memorandum of understanding ([[Memorandum of understanding|MOU]]) between the Pasteur Institutes of Iran and Paris was signed. According to this memorandum, Pasteur Institute of Iran was to be formally and financially independent and under the supervision of the minister of health; one of the French experts, Dr. Marcel Baltazard, working in the Pasteur Institute of [[Morocco]], was nominated to be the general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran. According to the new schedule, Pasteur Institute of Iran started a new approach and focusing its activities in the fields of medicine, [[epidemiology]] and research; to this end, one important issue was [[Plague (disease)|plague]] studies.

== The history of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Iran ==
Iranian physicians were familiar with the human plague for a long time. Although there is little information about the situation of plague from earlier centuries, we have more documented evidence from the 19th and 20th centuries. During the [[Qajar dynasty]] (1895 to 1925), [[cholera]] and plague were the most frequently documented outbreaks. Such lethal diseases were not hard to imagine considering the poor hygiene and lack of knowledge about the root of transmission, prevention and effective treatment of that time. Several plague outbreaks took place during the Qajar dynasty in Iran. In 1871, a severe form of plague outbreak happened in [[Saqqez|Saghez]] and [[Baneh County|Bane]] (two cities in [[Kurdistan Province|Kurdistan province]]) and the Iranian and non-Iranian physicians, such as Dr. Johan Louis Schlimmer, the instructor in the Darolfonun School, were appointed to control this disease. Dr. Schlimmer noted his observations in his book, "Schlimmer's [[Terminology]]", published in 1874.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Schlimmer, J.L., ''Terminologie medico-pharmaceutique et anthropologique Francaise-Persane: avec traductions Anglaise et Allemande des termes Français, indications des lieux de provenance des principaux produits animaux et végétaux''. 1874: Lithographie d'Ali Gouli Khan.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Iranian physician who registered his observations about plague using modern medical science was Mohammad Razi Tabatabai, the senior physician in Naser al-Din Shah's army; his book was published under the title "Plague" in 1875. Dr. Joseph Desire Tholozan, (1820 to 1897), the royal physician of Naser Al-din Shah and the head of the ministry of health at that time, evaluated the main and natural foci of plague in Kurdistan between 1870 and 1882 and found certain foci for the disease in various villages of that area.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Theodorides, J., ''Un grand épidémiologiste franco-mauricien: Joseph Désiré Tholoza (1820-1897).'' Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique, 1998. '''91'''(1): p. 104-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Mollaret, H., ''[Tholozan and plague in Persia].'' Histoire des sciences medicales, 1998. '''32'''(3): p. 297-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Akanlu]] and [[Plague (disease)|plague]] ==
In 1946, together with the new program of activities of Pasteur Institute of Iran, the epidemiology department of Pasteur Institute of Iran started its activities under the supervision of Dr. Baltazard, the general director of the institute. They started their mission in Northwest of Iran and attempted to prepare an epidemiological map of infectious diseases of the country using a portable laboratory in a truck.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Baltazard, M., ''L'Institut Pasteur de l'Iran vu par''. 2004, Theran: Fascicule édité par le service de coopération et d'action culturelle de l'ambassade de France en R I d'Iran à l'occasion de l'inauguration du pavillon Baltazard de l'Institut Pasteur d'Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; It later became more practical after they were equipped with professional cars. Although Kurdistan had a history of plague, it was due to the plague outbreak in Kurdistan in the same year that for the first time the research teams were dispatched to an area in which they could control the outbreak via quarantining the foci and epidemiological procedures on the humans and rodents. Studies of the plague foci in this region and the importance of this disease motivated Dr. Baltazard, Dr. Shamsa, Dr. Karimi, Dr. Habibi, Dr. Bahmanyar, Dr. Agha Eftekhari, Dr. Farhang Azad, Dr. Seyyedian and Dr. Majd Teymouri to conduct extensive scientific and epidemiologic studies after educating expert technicians and providing sufficient facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Rezvan H, et al., A preliminary study on the prevalence of anti-HCV amongst healthy blood donors in Iran. Vox Sang, 1994. 67 ((suppl): 100.). 6. Mollaret, H., et al., La peste de fouissement. Bull Soc Pathol Exot, 1963. 56: p. 1186-1193.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nine plague outbreaks in Kurdistan and Azerbaijan between 1946 and 1965, many infected people survived from the disease by the efforts of the dispatched teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran; however, 156 died. In 1952, the first plague laboratory was founded in Akanlu village, near the epicenter of plague in Kurdistan, Iran, on a piece of land bestowed by Manuchehr Gharagozlou, an Iranian friend of Dr. Baltazard. At this research center, currently called "The Research Center for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases", Dr. Baltazard and his perseverant colleagues conducted extensive research on plague and established this center as one of the international references for plague. Since 1952, research teams could base themselves in the area for months at a time and conduct detailed research on rodents under more favorable conditions. They were no longer required to carry their equipment throughout their missions. During those years, the integration of field and laboratory collaborations was a key to effective epidemiological actions and led to great research hypotheses. The extensive research by the teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran showed that rodents of the two types Meriones Persicus and Meriones libycus were the main natural reservoirs, unlike their resistance to plague; accordingly, they first proposed that the main reservoir of a disease should be sought amongst the most resistant, not the most sensitive, and such a theory is now accepted as a scientific fact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also presented their scientific qualifications by publishing several scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;Mollaret, H., et al., ''La peste de fouissement.'' Bull Soc Pathol Exot, 1963. '''56''': p. 1186-1193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOLLARET, H., et al. ''ON THE UREASE OF YERSIN'S BACILLUS''. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baltazard, M., et al., ''C. Interepizootic conservation of the plague in inveterate reservoir. Hypotheses and work. 1963.'' Bulletin de la Société de pathologie exotique (1990), 2004.

'''6'''(10): p. 399-404.&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of this research center, many international scientists visited the center, lecturing, studying and/or researching in their fields. In particular, Dr. Xavier Misonne, a Belgian rodentologist who investigated rodent life in Iran&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Missone, X., ''The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. I. The Land of Iran'', in ''Arts asiatiques''. 1968, Cambridge University Press. p. 294-304.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Dr. Jean Marie Klein, an entomologist, who conducted extensive research on fleas in the Akanlu center, played important roles.&lt;ref&gt;Sureau, P. and J. Klein, ''[Arboviruses in Iran (author's transl)].'' Médecine tropicale: revue du Corps de santé colonial, 1979. '''40'''(5): p. 549-554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sureau, P., et al., ''Isolation of Thogoto, Wad Medani, Wanowrie and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever viruses from ticks of domestic animals in Iran.'' Annales de Virologie, E, 1980. '''131'''(2): p. 185-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the aerial photographs of Kurdistan and Hamadan were obtained from Iran's army and rodents' locations and the infection were mapped and reported and the first foundations of [[Geographic information system|GIS]] were set. The research team carefully concentrated on the [[epizootic]] trend of the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Lo65.jpg|thumb|Figure 3: the aerial photograph of plague susceptible regions of Kurdistan, 1961, the trapping areas of rodents are marked by numbers.]]

Moreover, it should be noted that the achievements of [[Pasteur Institute of Iran]] regarding plague research attracted global attention and such a success motivated them to assign Iranians international plague research. The experts and researchers of Pasteur Institute of Iran, known as [[World Health Organization|WHO]] experts, continued to conduct related research in many neighboring countries such as Turkey, Syria,&lt;ref&gt;Baltazard, M., et al., ''THE INTEREPIZOOTIC PRESERVATION OF PLAGUE IN AN INVETERATE FOCUS.

[[File:Bahman32.jpg|thumb|Figure 4: the expert committee on plague at the WHO offices in Geneva, 1969 (Dr. Mahmud Bahmanyar, the first on the right)]]

In 1972, a WHO meeting on plague was held in this center with many participants from all over the world. Although Dr. Baltazard left Iran in 1962, plague studies continued to be conducted in the following years&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karimi, Y., ''Découverte d'un nouveau mésofoyer de peste sauvage dans l'Azerbaidjan oriental de l'Iran.''

Bulletin de la Societe de Pathologie Exotique et de ses Filiales, 1980. '''73'''(1): p. 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  in such a way that in 1978 a new focus of the disease was reported in the Sarab region in Eastern Azerbaijan by Dr. Yunos Karimi and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Karimi, Y., M. Mohammadi, and M. Hanif, ''Methods for rapid laboratory diagnosis of plague and an introdion of a new plague foci in Sarab (East Azarbaijan).'' Journal of Medical Council, 1978. '''6''' (4): p. 326-322.&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that one of the main responsibilities assigned to Pasteur Institute of Iran and the Akanlu Research Center in the following years was to conduct research about diagnosis and epidemiology of plague.
Between 1978 and 2000,  missions to monitor the plague in Kurdistan and Hamadan; proved plague infection amongst fleas and rodents in the evaluated regions.Unfortunately, plague research was not seriously continued after 1992 and totally discontinued after 2000, resulting in that Akanlu Research Center, the only research center of Pasteur Institute of Iran on plague, was almost forgotten.

== Akanlu Centre and Research on other Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases ==
[[File:Sea234.jpg|thumb|Figure 5: the locations of sampling from domestic animals and small wild animals and regions where positive cases of tularemia were found, WHO bulletin, 1972.|220x220px]]

Pasteur Institute of Iran has been designated to manage the infectious disease situation in Iran and when taking into account all its completed projects, the Research Center for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases can be regarded as the pioneer center for field epidemiology in Iran. The Epidemiology Department of Pasteur Institute of Iran and the Akanlu Research Center did researches on tularemia, recurrent fever, rabies and animal bites in addition to plague studies, the main research field of this center. In addition to close collaborations with other departments of the institute such as parasitology and rabies, the epidemiology department and Akanlu Research Center has conducted research in other fields such as hemorrhagic fevers,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ardoin, A. and Y. Karimi, ''A focus of thrombocytopenic purpura in East Azerbaidjan province, Iran (1974-1975)(author's transl).'' Médecine tropicale: revue du Corps de santé colonial. '''42'''(3): p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehravarana Ahmad , et al., ''Molecular  detection of  Crimean-Congo  haemorrhagic fever  (CCHF)  virus in  ticks from  southeastern Iran.''

Meditsinskaia parazitologiia i parazitarnye bolezni. '''31''': p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; cholera and smallpox. The experts working in this Research Center, as WHO expert, were sent around the world to control outbreaks in addition to performing their important role in controlling a smallpox outbreak in this country.

For instance, Dr. Mansur Shamsa was sent to Pakistan to complete a mission on behalf of WHO and Pasteur Institute of Iran; he played an important role in the control of the outbreak in Pakistan.

== Studies related to Tularemia ==
One of the other research fields of the Research Center for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases has been running researches on tularemia in Iran. Great research by Dr. Shamsa and his colleagues led to the first report of this disease among the domestic livestock and wildlife in Northwest and Eastern Iran. In this study, more than 4500 wild mammals, 200 sheep and cows were traced for the causative agent of tularemia in 47 locations in Iran. As a result, this study greatly contributed to the identification of wild mammals acting as reservoirs for many zoonotic diseases around the country.&lt;ref&gt;Arata, A., et al., ''First detection of tularaemia in domestic and wild mammals in Iran.'' Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 1973. '''49'''(6): p. 597-603.&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies about the epidemiology of tularemia continued in the years thereafter as well. The first report of a human case of tularemia was in 1980 in Marivan, southwestern Kurdistan province.&lt;ref&gt;Karimi Y, Salarkia F, and G. MA, ''Tularemia: first human case in Iran.'' Journal of Medical Council of IRAN 1981. '''8'''(2): p. 134-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New period of center’s activity ==
[[File:RCERID.jpg|thumb|388x388px]]A new period of research activities focused on the center began in 2010. The results of researches in this period were further reports of plague, tularemia and Q fever in Iran. After decades of lack of reporting about these diseases, the surveillance system of these diseases formed again.
The domain of center’s current activities is defined in three fields: research, education and services.
The dedicated laboratories for rodentology studies, serology, molecular studies and culture, seminar halls and guest accommodation (for up to 40 persons) offer a suitable environment for research and education in this region. The center holds the national reference laboratory for plague, tularemia and Q fever, aims to be the WHO collaborating centre in near future and has conducted several studies on emerging and reemerging infectious diseases so far.

=== A -research activities ===

'''Riddoch syndrome''' (also known as the ''Riddoch phenomenon'') is a form of  [[visual  impairment]] often caused by [[lesion]]s in the [[occipital lobe]] which limit the sufferer's ability to distinguish objects. Only moving objects in a [[blind field]] are visible, static ones being invisible to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riddoch |first=George |date=1917 |title=Dissociation of visual perceptions due to occipital injuries, with especial reference to appreciation of movement |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/1/15.short |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=15–57 |doi=10.1093/brain/40.1.15 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moving objects are not perceived to have color or detail.

'''The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the "SPS Agreement")''' governs rules for food safety and animal and plant health standards. The SPS Agreement permits countries to implement measures provided that they are based on science, are applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal and plant life or health and do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or similar conditions prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/sps_e/spsund_e.htm |title=Understanding the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Agreement |website=Wto.org |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A critical feature of the SPS Agreement is that Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (“SPS measures”) must be based on a ‘risk assessment’. Article 2.2 of the SPS Agreement requires SPS measures to be maintained with sufficient scientific evidence. Furthermore, SPS measures must be based on appropriate assessments of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health.&lt;ref&gt;Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement of the World Trade Organisation, Article 5 paragraph 1&lt;/ref&gt; The risk assessment must, but is not limited to, consider: scientific evidence, relevant processes and production methods, relevant inspection, sampling and testing methods, prevalence of specific diseases or pests, existence of pest or disease free areas, relevant ecological and environmental conditions, and quarantine or other treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement of the World Trade Organisation, Article 5 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptionally, Members may adopt provisional measures (not based on a risk assessment) when the relevant scientific evidence is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement of the World Trade Organisation, Article 5 paragraph 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk assessment is defined in para4 of Annex A to the SPS agreement: The evaluation of the likelihood of entry, establishment or spread of a pest or disease within the territory of an importing Member according to the sanitary or phytosanitary measures which might be applied, and of the associated potential biological and economic consequences; or the evaluation of the potential for adverse effects on human or animal health arising from the presence of additives, contaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in food, beverages or feedstuffs.

Risk assessment represents a quantitative or qualitative&lt;ref&gt;Van den Bossche and Zdouc (2013), The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization, 3rd Edition, Cambridge University Press, Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt; estimate of the possible ‘harmful effect of the intake of or exposure to a substance or activity, determined in accordance with scientifically accepted methodology.’&lt;ref&gt;Lowrance W, Of Acceptable Risk: Science and the Determination of Safety, Los Altos, CA, USA: William Kaufmann, 1976, p 9; see also Cunningham R. (2005), The ABCs of GMOs, SPS &amp; the WTO: a critical analysis of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement, 9 SCU Law Review 19, p 28&lt;/ref&gt; The risk to be assessed under article 5.1 must be a specific risk that has “the actual potential for adverse effects on human health in the real world where people live and work and die.”&lt;ref&gt;EC – Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products AB Report, WT/DS26/AB/R paragraph 187&lt;/ref&gt; This can be contrasted with ‘risk management’, which takes into account the result of the risk assessment in addition to the social values and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Bohanes J, “Risk regulation in WTO law: a procedure-based approach to the precautionary principle” (2002) 40 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 323, p 338; see also Cunningham R. (2005), The ABCs of GMOs, SPS &amp; the WTO: a critical analysis of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement, 9 SCU Law Review 19, p 28&lt;/ref&gt; Risk management seeks to establish the level of risk a particular society is willing to take in relation to the potential harm and the corresponding SPS measure.

'''Scaption''' is an abbreviation for '''scapular plane elevation'''. The term does not denote whether the elevation is with an internal, external or neutral [[rotation (anatomy)|rotation]]. The term is widely used in sports training, [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]].

The term was first made public in a 1991 publication of the ''[[American Journal of Sports Medicine]]''. The origins for the word are rather practical: [[Marilyn Pink]] was asked to give a lecture at the [[Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]] on a research project she was conducting. Due to a strict clocking of presentation time, she was forced to shorten a phrase that appeared often in her lecture: "scapular plane elevation". Her colleague and friend, [[Jacquelin Perry]], suggested she simply convert the phrase to "scaption", thus coining the word.

'''Shockoe Slip''' is a district in the downtown area of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The name "slip" referred to a narrow passageway leading from Main Street to where goods were loaded and unloaded from the former [[James River and Kanawha Canal]]. The rough boundaries of Shockoe Slip include 14th Street, Main Street, Canal Street and 12th Street.&lt;ref name="1983 Nomination" /&gt;

Architecturally, many of the buildings in Shockoe Slip were constructed during the rebuilding following the [[Evacuation Fire of 1865]], especially in a commercial variant of the [[Italianate]] style. It is centered on a 1909 fountain, dedicated to "one who loved animals." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shockoe Slip|url=http://www.historicrichmond.com/shockoeslip.html|publisher=Historic Richmond Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings in the district, which historically housed a variety of offices, wholesale and retail establishments, are now primarily restaurants, shops, offices, and apartments.&lt;ref name="1983 Nomination"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shockoe Slip Historic District National Register Nomination – Boundary Increase|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Richmond/127-0219_Shockoe_Slip_HD_1983_Increase.pdf|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shockoe Slip began developing in the late 18th century following the move of the state capital to Richmond, aided by the construction of Mayo's bridge across the James River (ultimately succeeded by the modern 14th Street Bridge), as well as the siting of key tobacco industry structures, such as the public warehouse, tobacco scales, and the Federal [[Customs House]] in or near the district.&lt;ref name="1983 Nomination" /&gt;

On the eve of the fall of Richmond to the Union Army in April 1865, evacuating Confederate forces were ordered to set fire to the city's tobacco warehouses. The fires spread, and completely destroyed Shockoe Slip and several other districts. The district was quickly rebuilt in the late 1860s, flourishing further in the 1870s, and forming much of its present historic building stock.&lt;ref name="1983 Nomination" /&gt;

The district began declining in the 1920s, as other areas of the city rose in prominence with the advent of the automobile. Numerous structures would be demolished and cleared, including (in the 1950s), the Tobacco Exchange, which had been at the heart of the district.&lt;ref name="1983 Nomination" /&gt;

===Redevelopment: 1970s to present===
Beginning in the 1960s and accelerating in the 1970s, Shockoe Slip was redeveloped as a commercial and entertainment district; the nightlife district came just after Richmond passed [[liquor-by-the-drink]] laws, and when the so-called [[fern bar]] became popular across the United States. The restoration came at the time of an increased interest in [[historic preservation]] around the time of the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]], with the district being added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Early pioneer restaurants included [[The Tobacco Company]], Stuffy's Going Bananas, Commercial Cafe and Sam Miller's, the last two being revived restaurant names from Richmond's 19th century.

One of the earliest and oldest of Richmond's artist-run galleries, was Artspace 1306 located at 1306 East Cary Street in Shockoe Slip. Artspace 1306 retained its original name when the gallery moved to North 18th Street in [[Shockoe Bottom]]. Only when Artspace 1306 moved to 6 East Broad Street did the gallery drop the original address from its name. The Broad Street location became the home of another 501 C-3 gallery, Art6 Gallery, when Artspace moved to Plant Zero in the Manchester area of the city.

Shockoe Slip also included some of the earliest rehabilitated downtown apartments; at the time of the restoration asphalt paving was removed to expose historic [[Belgian block]] streets.

Shockoe Slip continues to be a popular place to live and work. [[The Martin Agency]] has maintained its headquarters in Shockoe Slip since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond.com/business/local/article_7ce69038-f788-5b26-9732-70a565f17db1.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 [[digital marketing]] agency Workshop Digital relocated to the Turning Basin Building in Shockoe Slip,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond.com/business/local/article_2f1c3c07-7e28-5526-8b0b-568162459b90.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 [[CarMax]] relocated 125 designers, developers, and programmers to the adjacent Lady Byrd Hat building.&lt;ref&gt;http://wtvr.com/2016/06/22/carmax-shockoe/&lt;/ref&gt; Residential development surrounding the James River continues with the influx of students and professionals and an increased interest in urban living.

Shockoe Slip was the site of the passage of the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]. To commemorate this event the [[First Freedom Center]] opened there in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsleader.com/story/news/2015/01/17/first-freedom-center-opens-downtown-richmond/21920971/ "First Freedom Center opens in downtown Richmond" Associated Press 3:19 p.m. EST January 17, 2015 "The center opened Friday with a commemoration featuring Gov.

'''Stéphane Brosse'''  (20 October 1971{{spaced ndash}}17 June 2012) was a [[France|French]] [[ski mountaineer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120903185151/http://www.milletusa.com/team/stephane-brosse.html Stéphane Brosse], website of his sponsor&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Brosse was born in [[Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin, Savoie]].&lt;ref name="Le ski-alpinisme"&gt;''Stéphane Brosse'' in [https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093732/http://www.ffme.fr/ski-alpinisme/dp01.doc ''Le ski-alpinisme'']&lt;/ref&gt; He started ski mountaineering in 1990 and competed the first time at the [[Miage Contamines Somfy]] race in 1995. In 1996 he became a member of the national team. Together with [[Pierre Gignoux]] he set the record and continued to hold it for the [[Mont Blanc]] course from 30 May  2003. The duo needed a total time of  5h&amp;nbsp;15'&amp;nbsp;47" for the total course, thereof about 4 hours and seven minutes for climbing up, and about one hour and seven minutes for the downhill race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volopress.net/volo/spip.php?article188|title=Mont Blanc: la course contre le record|work=volopress.net|author=Shahshahani Volodia|date=31 May 2003|accessdate=26 December 2012|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="montblanc"&gt;[http://www.ffme.fr/ski-montagne/actualite/2003/06mont-blanc.htm ''Record à ski sur le parcours mythique de Chamonix-Mont Blanc-Chamonix''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613025027/http://ffme.fr/ski-montagne/actualite/2003/06mont-blanc.htm |date=2007-06-13 }} (franz.), Fédération Française de la Montagne et de l'Escalade (FFME), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003 he and [[Lionel Bonnel]] had also held the [[Haute Route|Chamonix-Zermatt Haute Route]] record with 21h&amp;nbsp;11'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffcam.fr/index.php?oidit=T003:483od91d5fkb&amp;insidefile=ffcam_actuDetail.html&amp;moid=4&amp;oid=T005:4aex9qyrq7fs&amp;tplentry=br&amp;function=display Newsreport in the Club alpin français website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A field of applied [[statistics]] of [[Survey (human research)|human research surveys]], '''survey methodology''' studies the [[sample (statistics)|sampling]] of individual units from a [[population (statistics)|population]] and associated techniques of [[survey data collection]], such as [[questionnaire construction]] and methods for improving the number and accuracy of responses to surveys. Survey methodology includes instruments or procedures that ask one or more questions that may or may not be answered.

Researchers carry out '''statistical surveys''' with a view towards making [[statistical inference]]s about the population being studied, and such inferences depend strongly on the survey questions used.  [[Opinion poll|Polls]] about [[public opinion]], public-health surveys, [[market research | market-research]] surveys, government surveys and [[census]]es are all examples of [[quantitative research]] that use survey methodology to answer questions about a  population. Although censuses do not include a "sample", they do include other aspects of survey methodology, like questionnaires, interviewers, and non-response follow-up techniques. Surveys provide important information for all kinds of [[public-information]] and research fields, e.g., [[marketing]] research, [[psychology]], [[Health care provider|health-care provision]] and [[sociology]].

==Overview==
A single survey is made of at least a sample (or full population in the case of a census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should abortion be legal?), behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since [[survey research]] is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system  (see also [[sampling (statistics)]] and [[survey sampling]]). The persons replying to a survey are called [[respondent]]s, and depending on the questions asked their answers may represent themselves as individuals, their households, employers, or other organization they represent.

Survey methodology as a scientific field seeks to identify principles about the sample design, data collection instruments, statistical adjustment of data, and data processing, and final data analysis that can create systematic and random survey errors. Survey errors are sometimes analyzed in connection with survey cost. Cost constraints are sometimes framed as improving quality within cost constraints, or alternatively, reducing costs for a fixed level of quality. Survey methodology is both a scientific field and a profession, meaning that some professionals in the field focus on survey errors empirically and others design surveys to reduce them. For survey designers, the task involves making a large set of decisions about thousands of individual features of a survey in order to improve it.&lt;ref name="Groves 2004"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important methodological challenges of a survey methodologist include making decisions on how to:&lt;ref name="Groves 2004"/&gt;
* Identify and select potential sample members.
* Contact sampled individuals and collect data from those who are hard to reach (or reluctant to respond)
* Evaluate and test questions.
* Select the mode for posing questions and collecting responses.
* Train and supervise interviewers (if they are involved).
* Check data files for accuracy and internal consistency.
* Adjust survey estimates to correct for identified errors.

==Selecting samples==
{{Main|Survey sampling}}
The sample is chosen from the sampling frame, which consists of a list of all members of the population of interest.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaughnessy|first1=J.|last2=Zechmeister|first2=E.|last3=Jeanne|first3= Z.|title=Research methods in psychology|edition=9th|year=2011|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]|location=New York, NY|pages=161–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of a survey is not to describe the sample, but the larger population. This generalizing ability is dependent on the representativeness of the sample, as stated above. Each member of the population is termed an element. There are frequent difficulties one encounters while choosing a representative sample. One common error that results is [[selection bias]]. Selection bias results when the procedures used to select a sample result in over representation or under representation of some significant aspect of the population. For instance, if the population of interest consists of 75% females, and 25% males, and the sample consists of 40% females and 60% males, females are under represented while males are overrepresented. In order to minimize selection biases, [[stratified random sampling]] is often used. This is when the population is divided into sub-populations called strata, and random samples are drawn from each of the strata, or elements are drawn for the sample on a proportional basis.

==Modes of data collection==
{{Main|Survey data collection}}
There are several ways of administering a survey. The choice between administration modes is influenced by several factors, including
# costs,
# coverage of the target population,
# flexibility of asking questions,
# respondents' willingness to participate and
# response accuracy.
Different methods create [[mode effect]]s that change how respondents answer, and different methods have different advantages. The most common modes of administration can be summarized as:&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, G.J. 2008 pp. 183–209"&gt;[[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh, G.J.]] (2008). Chapter 9: Surveys. In [[H.J. Adèr]] &amp; [[G.J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183–209).

==Research designs==
There are several different designs, or overall structures, that can be used in survey research. The three general types are cross-sectional, successive independent samples, and longitudinal studies.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;

===Cross-sectional studies===
In cross-sectional studies, a sample (or samples) is drawn from the relevant population and studied once.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; A cross-sectional study describes characteristics of that population at one time, but cannot give any insight as to the causes of population characteristics because it is a predictive, correlational design.

===Successive independent samples studies===
A successive independent samples design draws multiple random samples from a population at one or more times.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;  This design can study changes within a population, but not changes within individuals because the same individuals are not surveyed more than once. Such studies cannot, therefore, identify the causes of change over time necessarily. For successive independent samples designs to be effective, the samples must be drawn from the same population, and must be equally representative of it. If the samples are not comparable, the changes between samples may be due to demographic characteristics rather than time. In addition, the questions must be asked in the same way so that responses can be compared directly.

===Longitudinal studies===
Longitudinal studies take measure of the same random sample at multiple time points.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;  Unlike with a successive independent samples design, this design measures the differences in individual participants’ responses over time. This means that a researcher can potentially assess the reasons for response changes by assessing the differences in respondents’ experiences. Longitudinal studies are the easiest way to assess the effect of a naturally occurring event, such as divorce that cannot be tested experimentally. However, longitudinal studies are both expensive and difficult to do. It’s harder to find a sample that will commit to a months- or years-long study than a 15-minute interview, and participants frequently leave the study before the final assessment. This attrition of participants is not random, so samples can become less representative with successive assessments. To account for this, a researcher can compare the respondents who left the survey to those that did not, to see if they are statistically different populations. Respondents may also try to be self-consistent in spite of changes to survey answers.

==Questionnaires==
[[File:Questionaire in Thai.png|thumb|A basic [[questionaire]] in [[Thai language]]]]
Questionnaires are the most commonly used tool in survey research. However, the results of a particular survey are worthless if the questionnaire is written inadequately.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Questionnaires should produce valid and reliable demographic variable measures and should yield valid and reliable individual disparities that self-report scales generate.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;

===Questionnaires as tools===
A variable category that is often measured in survey research are demographic variables, which are used to depict the characteristics of the people surveyed in the sample.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Demographic variables include such measures as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, race, and age.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Surveys often assess the preferences and attitudes of individuals, and many employ self-report scales to measure people’s opinions and judgements about different items presented on a scale.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Self-report scales are also used to examine the disparities among people on scale items.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; These self-report scales, which are usually presented in questionnaire form, are one of the most used instruments in psychology, and thus it is important that the measures be constructed carefully, while also being reliable and valid.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;

===Reliability and validity of self-report measures===
Reliable measures of self-report are defined by their consistency.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Thus, a reliable self-report measure produces consistent results every time it is executed.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; A test’s reliability can be measured a few ways.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; First, one can calculate a test-retest reliability.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; A test-retest reliability entails conducting the same questionnaire to a large sample at two different times.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; For the questionnaire to be considered reliable, people in the sample do not have to score identically on each test, but rather their position in the score distribution should be similar for both the test and the retest.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Self-report measures will generally be more reliable when they have many items measuring a construct.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Furthermore, measurements will be more reliable when the factor being measured has greater variability among the individuals in the sample that are being tested.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Finally, there will be greater reliability when instructions for the completion of the questionnaire are clear and when there are limited distractions in the testing environment.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Contrastingly, a questionnaire is valid if what it measures is what it had originally planned to measure.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Construct validity of a measure is the degree to which it measures the theoretical construct that it was originally supposed to measure.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;

It is important to note that there is evidence to suggest that self-report measures tend to be less accurate and reliable than alternative methods of assessing data (e.g. observational studies; for an example, see.&lt;ref&gt;Prince et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composing a questionnaire===

Six steps can be employed to construct a questionnaire that will produce reliable and valid results.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; First, one must decide what kind of information should be collected.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Second, one must decide how to conduct the questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Thirdly, one must construct a first draft of the questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Fourth, the questionnaire should be revised.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Next, the questionnaire should be pretested.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Finally, the questionnaire should be edited and the procedures for its use should be specified.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;

===Guidelines for the effective wording of questions===
The way that a question is phrased can have a large impact on how a research participant will answer the question.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Thus, survey researchers must be conscious of their wording when writing survey questions.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; It is important for researchers to keep in mind that different individuals, cultures, and subcultures can interpret certain words and phrases differently from one another.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; There are two different types of questions that survey researchers use when writing a questionnaire: free response questions and closed questions.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Free response questions are open-ended, whereas closed questions are usually multiple choice.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Free response questions are beneficial because they allow the responder greater flexibility, but they are also very difficult to record and score, requiring extensive coding.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Contrastingly, closed questions can be scored and coded more easily, but they diminish expressivity and spontaneity of the responder.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; In general, the vocabulary of the questions should be very simple and direct, and most should be less than twenty words.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;  Each question should be edited for "readability" and should avoid leading or loaded questions.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Finally, if multiple items are being used to measure one construct, the wording of some of the items should be worded in the opposite direction to evade response bias.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;

A respondent's answer to an open-ended question can be coded into a response scale afterwards,&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, G.J. 2008 pp. 183–209"/&gt; or analysed using more qualitative methods.survey guide to station point to any two station

===Order of questions===
Survey researchers should carefully construct the order of questions in a questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; For questionnaires that are self-administered, the most interesting questions should be at the beginning of the questionnaire to catch the respondent’s attention, while demographic questions should be near the end.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Contrastingly, if a survey is being administered over the telephone or in person, demographic questions should be administered at the beginning of the interview to boost the respondent’s confidence.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Another reason to be mindful of question order may cause a [[survey response effects|survey response effect]] in which one question may affect how people respond to subsequent questions as a result of [[Priming (psychology)|priming]].

==Nonresponse reduction==
The following ways have been recommended for reducing nonresponse&lt;ref name=Lyn2&gt;Lynn, P. (2008) "The problem of non-response", chapter 3, 35-55, in ''International Handbook of Survey Methodology'' (ed.s [[Edith de Leeuw]], [[Joop Hox]] &amp; [[Don A. Dillman]]). Erlbaum. {{ISBN|0-8058-5753-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in telephone and face-to-face surveys:&lt;ref name=Dill&gt;Dillman, D.A. (1978) ''Mail and telephone surveys: The total design method''. Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-21555-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Advance letter. A short letter is sent in advance to inform the sampled respondents about the upcoming survey. The style of the letter should be personalized but not overdone. First, it announces that a phone call will be made, or an interviewer wants to make an appointment to do the survey face-to-face. Second, the research topic will be described.  Last, it allows both an expression of the surveyor's appreciation of cooperation and an opening to ask questions on the survey.
* Training. The interviewers are thoroughly trained in how to ask respondents questions, how to work with computers and making schedules for callbacks to respondents who were not reached.
* Short introduction. The interviewer should always start with a short introduction about him or herself. She/he should give her name, the institute she is working for, the length of the interview and goal of the interview. Also it can be useful to make clear that you are not selling anything: this has been shown to lead to a slightly higher responding rate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edith de Leeuw|De Leeuw, E.D.]] (2001). "I am not selling anything: Experiments in telephone introductions". ''Kwantitatieve Methoden'', 22, 41–48.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Respondent-friendly survey questionnaire. The questions asked must be clear, non-offensive and easy to respond to for the subjects under study.

Brevity is also often cited as increasing response rate.  A 1996 literature review found mixed evidence to support this claim for both written and verbal surveys, concluding that other factors may often be more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE EFFECT OF QUESTIONNAIRE LENGTH ON RESPONSE RATES -- A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE|url=https://www.census.gov/srd/papers/pdf/kb9601.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Section on Survey Research Methods|publisher=American Statistical Association|accessdate=2013-03-19|pages=1020–1025|last=Bogen|first=Karen|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2010 study looking at 100,000 online surveys found response rate dropped by about 3% at 10 questions and about 6% at 20 questions, with drop-off slowing (for example, only 10% reduction at 40 questions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/survey_questions_and_completion_rates/|accessdate=2017-11-08|date=2010-12-10|title=Does Adding One More Question Impact Survey Completion Rate?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other studies showed that quality of response degraded toward the end of long surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.research-live.com/news/news-headlines/respondent-engagement-and-survey-length-the-long-and-the-short-of-it/4002430.article |title=Respondent engagement and survey length: the long and the short of it |publisher=research |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interviewer effects==
Survey methodologists have devoted much effort to determining the extent to which interviewee responses are affected by physical characteristics of the interviewer. Main interviewer traits that have been demonstrated to influence survey responses are race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=M.E|last1=Hill|title= Race of the interviewer and perception of skin color: Evidence from the multi-city study of urban inequality |journal=American Sociological Review|year=2002|volume=67|issue=1|pages=99–108|jstor=3088935|doi=10.2307/3088935}}&lt;/ref&gt; gender,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=F.|last1=Flores-Macias|first2=C.|last2=Lawson|title=Effects of interviewer gender on survey responses: Findings from a household survey in Mexico|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=2008|volume=20|issue=1|pages=100–110|doi= 10.1093/ijpor/edn007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and relative body weight (BMI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Eisinga|first2=M.|last2=Te Grotenhuis|first3=J.K.|last3=Larsen|first4=B.|last4=Pelzer|first5=T.|last5=Van Strien|title=BMI of interviewer effects|journal= International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=2011|volume=23|issue=4|pages=530–543|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edr026}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These interviewer effects are particularly operant when questions are related to the interviewer trait. Hence, race of interviewer has been shown to affect responses to measures regarding racial attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=B.A.|last1=Anderson|first2=B.D.|last2=Silver|first3=P.R.|title=The effects of the race of the interviewer on race-related attitudes of black respondents in SRC/CPS national election studies |journal= Public Opinion Quarterly |year=1988|volume=52|issue=3|pages=1–28|doi=10.1086/269108|last3=Abramson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
interviewer sex responses to questions involving gender issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=E.W.|last1=Kane|first2=L.J.|last2=MacAulay|title= Interviewer gender and gender attitudes|journal= Public Opinion Quarterly |year=1993|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1086/269352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and interviewer BMI answers to eating and dieting-related questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Eisinga|first2=M.|last2=Te Grotenhuis|first3=J.K.|last3=Larsen|first4=B.|last4=Pelzer|title= Interviewer BMI effects on under- and over-reporting of restrained eating. Evidence from a national Dutch face-to-face survey and a postal follow-up |journal= International Journal of Public Health|year=2011|volume=57|issue=3|pages=643–647|doi= 10.1007/s00038-011-0323-z|pmid=22116390|pmc=3359459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While interviewer effects have been investigated mainly for face-to-face surveys, they have also been shown to exist for interview modes with no visual contact, such as telephone surveys and in video-enhanced web surveys. The explanation typically provided for interviewer effects is [[social desirability bias]]: survey participants may attempt to project a positive self-image in an effort to conform to the norms they attribute to the interviewer asking questions. Interviewer effects are one example [[survey response effects]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Urinary incontinence''' ('''UI'''), also known as '''involuntary urination''', is any uncontrolled [[urination|leakage of urine]]. It is a common and distressing problem, which may have a large impact on [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care |edition=9th| publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been identified as an important issue in geriatric health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Venes | first = Donald | title = Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary | publisher = F.A. Davis | location = Philadelphia | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780803629776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[enuresis]] is  often used to refer to urinary incontinence primarily in children, such as [[nocturnal enuresis]] (bed wetting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaldictionaryweb.com/Enuresis-definition/|title=Enuresis|work=medicaldictionaryweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatments include surgery, [[pelvic floor muscle training]], [[bladder training]], and electrical stimulation.&lt;ref name=Sham2012/&gt; The benefit of medications is small and long term safety is unclear.&lt;ref name=Sham2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shamliyan|first1=T|last2=Wyman|first2=J|last3=Kane|first3=RL|date=April 2012|title=Nonsurgical Treatments for Urinary Incontinence in Adult Women: Diagnosis and Comparative Effectiveness|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0042108|pmid=22624162}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more common in older women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urinary Incontinence in Older Adults|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/urinary-incontinence-older-adults|website=National Institute on Aging|accessdate=18 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Urinary incontinence results from both urologic and non-urologic causes. Urologic causes can be classified as either bladder or urethral dysfunction and may include detrusor overactivity, poor bladder compliance, [[urethral hypermobility]] or [[intrinsic sphincter deficiency]]. Non-urologic causes may include infection, medication or drugs, psychological factors, [[polyuria]], [[fecal impaction|stool impaction]], and restricted mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Urological Association - Medical Student Curriculum: Urinary Incontinence|url=http://www.auanet.org/education/auauniversity/medical-student-education/medical-student-curriculum/urinary-incontinence|website=www.auanet.org|accessdate=11 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of urinary incontinence in women are stress urinary incontinence and urge urinary incontinence. Women with both problems have mixed urinary incontinence. After menopause, estrogen production decreases and in some women urethral tissue will demonstrate atrophy with the tissue of the urethra becoming weaker and thinner.&lt;ref name=womengov/&gt; Stress urinary incontinence is caused by loss of support of the urethra which is usually a consequence of damage to pelvic support structures as a result of childbirth. It is characterized by leaking of small amounts of urine with activities which increase abdominal pressure such as coughing, sneezing and lifting. Additionally, frequent exercise in high-impact activities can cause [[athletic incontinence]] to develop. Urge urinary incontinence is caused by uninhibited contractions of the [[detrusor muscle]] . It is characterized by leaking of large amounts of urine in association with insufficient warning to get to the bathroom in time.
* [[Polyuria]] (excessive urine production) of which, in turn, the most frequent causes are: uncontrolled [[diabetes mellitus]], [[primary polydipsia]] (excessive fluid [[drinking]]), [[central diabetes insipidus]] and [[nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]].&lt;ref name=merck&gt;[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec17/ch226/ch226i.html merck.com &gt; Polyuria]: A [[Merck Manual]] of Patient Symptoms podcast. Last full review/revision September 2009 by Seyed-Ali Sadjadi, MD&lt;/ref&gt; Polyuria generally causes [[urinary urgency]] and [[urinary frequency|frequency]], but doesn't necessarily lead to incontinence.
* Enlarged [[prostate]] is the most common cause of incontinence in men after the age of 40; sometimes prostate cancer may also be associated with urinary  incontinence. Moreover, drugs or radiation used to treat prostate cancer can also cause incontinence.
* Disorders like [[multiple sclerosis]], [[spina bifida]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[stroke]]s and [[spinal cord injury]] can all interfere with nerve function of the bladder.
* Urinary incontinence is a likely outcome following a radical prostatectomy procedure.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Wei|last2=Huang|first2=Qing|last3=Liu|first3=Feng|last4=Mao|first4=Qi|date=2014-12-16|title=Effectiveness of preoperative pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2490/14/99|journal=BMC Urology|language=En|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2490-14-99|pmc=4274700|pmid=25515968}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* About 33% of all women experience UI after giving birth; women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a [[Caesarean section]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thom|first1=DH|last2=Rortveit|first2=G|title=Prevalence of postpartum urinary incontinence: a systematic review.|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|date=December 2010|volume=89|issue=12|pages=1511–22|pmid=21050146|doi=10.3109/00016349.2010.526188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
Continence and [[micturition]] involve a balance between [[urethral]] closure and [[detrusor]] muscle activity. Urethral pressure normally exceeds bladder pressure, resulting in urine remaining in the bladder. The proximal urethra and bladder are both within the pelvis. Intra abdominal pressure increases (from coughing and sneezing) are transmitted to both urethra and bladder equally, leaving the pressure differential unchanged, resulting in continence. Normal voiding is the result of changes in both of these pressure factors: urethral pressure falls and bladder pressure rises.

The body stores urine — water and wastes removed by the kidneys — in the [[urinary bladder]], a balloon-like organ. The bladder connects to the [[urethra]], the tube through which urine leaves the body.

During [[urination]], detrusor muscles in the wall of the bladder contract, forcing urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. At the same time, [[sphincter]] muscles surrounding the urethra relax, letting urine pass out of the body. Incontinence will occur if the bladder muscles suddenly contract (detrusor muscle) or muscles surrounding the urethra suddenly relax (sphincter muscles).

[[File:Voiding dysfunction.svg|thumb|330x330px|Voiding dysfunction]]
{{main|Enuresis}}
Urination, or voiding, is a complex activity. The bladder is a balloonlike muscle that lies in the lowest part of the abdomen. The bladder stores urine, then releases it through the urethra, the canal that carries urine to the outside of the body. Controlling this activity involves nerves, muscles, the spinal cord and the brain.

The bladder is made of two types of muscles: the detrusor, a muscular sac that stores urine and squeezes to empty, and the sphincter, a circular group of muscles at the bottom or neck of the bladder that automatically stay contracted to hold the urine in and automatically relax when the detrusor contracts to let the urine into the urethra. A third group of muscles below the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) can contract to keep urine back.

A baby's bladder fills to a set point, then automatically contracts and empties. As the child gets older, the nervous system develops. The child's brain begins to get messages from the filling bladder and begins to send messages to the bladder to keep it from automatically emptying until the child decides it is the time and place to void.

Failures in this control mechanism result in incontinence. Reasons for this failure range from the simple to the complex.

==Diagnosis==
A careful history taking is essential especially in the pattern of voiding and urine leakage as it suggests the type of incontinence faced. Other important points include straining and discomfort, use of drugs, recent surgery, and illness.

The [[physical examination]] will focus on looking for signs of medical conditions causing incontinence, such as tumors that block the urinary tract, stool impaction, and poor reflexes or sensations, which may be evidence of a nerve-related cause.

A test often performed is the measurement of bladder capacity and residual urine for evidence of poorly functioning bladder muscles.

Other tests include:
* [[Stress testing|Stress test]]&amp;nbsp;– the patient relaxes, then coughs vigorously as the doctor watches for loss of urine.
* [[Urinalysis]]&amp;nbsp;– urine is tested for evidence of infection, urinary stones, or other contributing causes.
* [[Blood test]]s&amp;nbsp;– blood is taken, sent to a laboratory, and examined for substances related to causes of incontinence.
* [[Ultrasound]]&amp;nbsp;– sound waves are used to visualize the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.
* [[Cystoscopy]]&amp;nbsp;– a thin tube with a tiny camera is inserted in the urethra and used to see the inside of the urethra and bladder.
* [[Urodynamics]]&amp;nbsp;– various techniques measure pressure in the bladder and the flow of urine.

Patients are often asked to keep a diary for a day or more, up to a week, to record the pattern of voiding, noting times and the amounts of urine produced.

Research projects that assess the [[efficacy]] of anti-incontinence therapies often quantify the extent of urinary incontinence. The methods include the 1-h pad test, measuring leakage volume; using a voiding diary, counting the number of incontinence episodes (leakage episodes) per day; and assessing of the strength of pelvic floor muscles, measuring the maximum vaginal squeeze pressure.

===Types===

[[File:Intoxicated men.jpg|thumb|Urinary incontinence may be caused by [[alcohol intoxication]].]]

* [[Stress incontinence]], also known as effort incontinence, is due essentially to insufficient strength of the pelvic floor muscles to prevent the passage of urine, especially during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or bearing down.
* [[Urge incontinence]] is involuntary loss of urine occurring for no apparent reason while suddenly feeling the need or urge to urinate.
* [[Overflow incontinence]]: Sometimes people find that they cannot stop their bladders from constantly dribbling or continuing to dribble for some time after they have passed urine. It is as if their bladders were constantly overflowing, hence the general name overflow incontinence.
* [[Mixed incontinence]] is not uncommon in the elderly female population and can sometimes be complicated by [[urinary retention]].
* [[Structural incontinence]]: Rarely, structural problems can cause incontinence, usually diagnosed in childhood (for example, an [[ectopic ureter]]). [[Fistula]]s caused by obstetric and gynecologic trauma or injury are commonly known as [[obstetric fistula]]s and can lead to incontinence. These types of vaginal fistulas include, most commonly, vesicovaginal fistula and, more rarely, ureterovaginal fistula. These may be difficult to diagnose. The use of standard techniques along with a [[vaginogram]] or radiologically viewing the [[vaginal vault]] with instillation of contrast media.&lt;ref name="pmid7265431"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macaluso JN, Appell RA, Sullivan JW | title = Ureterovaginal fistula detected by vaginogram | journal = JAMA | volume = 246 | issue = 12 | pages = 1339–40 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 7265431 | doi = 10.1001/jama.246.12.1339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Functional incontinence]] occurs when a person recognizes the need to urinate but cannot make it to the bathroom. The loss of urine may be large. There are several causes of functional incontinence including confusion, dementia, poor eyesight,  mobility or dexterity, unwillingness to toilet because of depression or anxiety or  inebriation due to alcohol.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;{{cite web  | title =Functional incontinence | publisher=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing | work = |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/continence-what-functional.htm | year = 2008 | accessdate=2008-08-29|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080723150611/http://health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/continence-what-functional.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functional incontinence can also occur in certain circumstances where no biological or medical problem is present. For example, a person may recognise the need to urinate but may be in a situation where there is no toilet nearby or access to a toilet is restricted. 
* [[Nocturnal enuresis]] is episodic UI while asleep. It is normal in young children.
* Transient incontinence is a temporary incontinence most often seen in pregnant women when it subsequently resolves after the birth of the child.&lt;ref name="SangsawangSangsawang2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sangsawang|first1=Bussara|last2=Sangsawang|first2=Nucharee|title=Stress urinary incontinence in pregnant women: a review of prevalence, pathophysiology, and treatment|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|volume=24|issue=6|year=2013|pages=901–912|issn=0937-3462|doi=10.1007/s00192-013-2061-7|pmc=3671107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Giggle incontinence]] is an involuntary response to laughter. It usually affects children.
* Double incontinence. There is also a related condition for [[defecation]] known as [[fecal incontinence]]. Due to involvement of the same muscle group ([[levator ani]]) in bladder and bowel continence, patients with urinary incontinence are more likely to have fecal incontinence in addition.&lt;ref name="Shamliyan 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shamliyan|first=T|author2=Wyman, J |author3=Bliss, DZ |author4=Kane, RL |author5= Wilt, TJ |title=Prevention of urinary and fecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Evidence report/technology assessment|date=December 2007|issue=161|pages=1–379|pmid=18457475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is sometimes termed "double incontinence".
* [[Post-void dribbling]] is the phenomenon where urine remaining in the urethra after voiding the bladder slowly leaks out after urination.
* Coital incontinence (CI) is urinary leakage that occurs during either [[coitus|penetration]] or [[orgasm]] and can occur with a sexual partner or with [[masturbation]]. It has been reported to occur in 10% to 24% of sexually active women with pelvic floor disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Karlovsky, Matthew E. MD, [http://www.femalepatient.com/html/arc/sig/uroG/articles/034_08_032.asp Female Urinary Incontinence During Sexual Intercourse (Coital Incontinence): A Review], The Female Patient (retrieved 22 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Climacturia]] is urinary incontinence at the moment of orgasm. It can be a result of radical [[prostatectomy]].

==Screening==
Yearly screening is recommended for women by the [[Women's Preventive Services Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Nancy |last2=Nelson |first2=Heidi D. |last3=Conry |first3=Jeanne M. |last4=Frost |first4=Jennifer |last5=Gregory |first5=Kimberly D. |last6=Kendig |first6=Susan M. |last7=Phipps |first7=Maureen |last8=Salganicoff |first8=Alina |last9=Ramos |first9=Diana |last10=Zahn |first10=Christopher |last11=Qaseem |first11=Amir |title=Screening for Urinary Incontinence in Women: A Recommendation From the Women's Preventive Services Initiative |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |date=14 August 2018 |doi=10.7326/M18-0595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatment options range from conservative treatment, behavior management, bladder retraining,&lt;ref&gt;Bladder retraining [http://www.ichelp.org/page.aspx?pid=368#how ichelp.org] ''Interstitial Cystitis Association'' Accessed July 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interstitial cystitis#Pelvic floor treatments|pelvic floor therapy]], collecting devices (for men), fixer-occluder devices for incontinence (in men), medications and surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Price N, Jackson SR | year = 2004 | title = Clinical audit of the use of tension-free vaginal tape as a surgical treatment for urinary stress incontinence, set against NICE guidelines | url = | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 534–538 | doi=10.1080/01443610410001722590}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of treatment depends on the correct diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maleurinaryincontinence.net/ What is Male Urinary Incontinence?] Retrieved on 2010-03-02&lt;/ref&gt; Weight loss is recommended in those who are [[obese]].&lt;ref name=Qa2014/&gt;

===Behavioral therapy===
Behavioral therapy involves the use of both suppressive techniques (distraction, relaxation) and learning to avoid foods that may worsen urinary incontinence. This may involve avoiding or limiting consumption of caffeine and alcohol. Behavioral therapy is not curative for urinary incontinence, but it can improve a person's quality of life. Behavioral therapy has benefits as both a monotherapy and as an adjunct to medications for symptom reduction.&lt;ref name="Elavsky DrugTopics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elavsky|first1=Megan|title=Urinary Incontinence: What Pharmacists Should Know|journal=DrugTopics|date=February 2018|volume=162|issue=2|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercises===
Exercising the muscles of the pelvis such as with [[Kegel exercise]]s are a first line treatment for women with stress incontinence.&lt;ref name=Qa2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qaseem|first1=A|last2=Dallas|first2=P|last3=Forciea|first3=MA|last4=Starkey|first4=M|last5=Denberg|first5=TD|last6=Shekelle|first6=P|last7=for the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of|first7=Physicians|title=Nonsurgical Management of Urinary Incontinence in Women: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of Physicians.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=Sep 16, 2014|volume=161|issue=6|pages=429–440|pmid=25222388|doi=10.7326/m13-2410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to increase the time between urination, known as [[bladder training]], is recommended in those with urge incontinence.&lt;ref name=Qa2014/&gt; Both these may be used in those with mixed incontinence.&lt;ref name=Qa2014/&gt;

Small vaginal cones of increasing weight may be used to help with exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Use Vaginal Weights|url=http://www.nationalincontinence.com/blog/how-to-use-vaginal-weights/|publisher=National Incontinence|accessdate=10 October 2012 |date=September 4, 2012 |author=Chelsea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herb2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbison|first1=GP|last2=Dean|first2=N|title=Weighted vaginal cones for urinary incontinence.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 July 2013|issue=7|pages=CD002114|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2|pmid=23836411}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to be better than no active treatment in women with stress urinary incontinence, and have similar effects to training of pelvic floor muscles or [[electrostimulation]].&lt;ref name=Herb2013/&gt;

Biofeedback uses measuring devices to help the patient become aware of his or her body's functioning. By using electronic devices or diaries to track when the bladder and urethral muscles contract, the patient can gain control over these muscles. Biofeedback can be used with pelvic muscle exercises and electrical stimulation to relieve stress and urge incontinence.

Time voiding while urinating and bladder training are techniques that use biofeedback. In time voiding, the patient fills in a chart of voiding and leaking. From the patterns that appear in the chart, the patient can plan to empty his or her bladder before he or she would otherwise leak. Biofeedback and muscle conditioning, known as bladder training, can alter the bladder's schedule for storing and emptying urine. These techniques are effective for urge and overflow incontinence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Health |first1=Beaumont |title=Treatment for Incontinence |url=https://www.beaumont.org/treatments/incontinence-treatment |website=www.beaumont.org |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 [[randomized controlled trial]] found no benefit of adding biofeedback to pelvic floor muscle exercise in [[stress urinary incontinence]], but observing improvements in both groups.&lt;ref name="HirakawaT2013Randomized"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirakawa|first=T|author2=Suzuki, S |author3=Kato, K |author4=Gotoh, M |author5= Yoshikawa, Y |title=Randomized controlled trial of pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback for urinary incontinence|journal=Int Urogynecol J.|date=2013-01-11|pmid=23306768|doi=10.1007/s00192-012-2012-8 |volume=24 |pages=1347–1354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2013}} In another [[randomized controlled trial]] the addition of biofeedback to the [[training of pelvic floor muscles]] for the treatment of [[stress urinary incontinence]], improved pelvic floor muscle function, reduced urinary symptoms, and improved of the quality of life.&lt;ref name="FitzFF2012Effect"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitz|first=Fátima Faní|author2=Resende, Ana Paula Magalhães |author3=Stüpp, Liliana |author4=Costa, Thaís Fonseca |author5=Sartori, Marair Gracio Ferreira |author6=Girão, Manoel João Batista Castello |author7= Castro, Rodrigo Aquino  | title=Efeito da adição do biofeedback ao treinamento dos músculos do assoalho pélvico para tratamento da incontinência urinária de esforço [Effect the adding of biofeedback to the training of the pelvic floor muscles to treatment of stress urinary incontinence]|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetrícia [Rev.

Preoperative pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in men undergoing radical prostatectomy was not effective in reducing urinary incontinence.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

Alternative exercises have been studied for stress urinary incontinence in women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bø|first=Kari|last2=Herbert|first2=Robert D.|date=2013-09-01|title=There is not yet strong evidence that exercise regimens other than pelvic floor muscle training can reduce stress urinary incontinence in women: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Physiotherapy|volume=59|issue=3|pages=159–168|doi=10.1016/S1836-9553(13)70180-2|issn=1836-9553|pmid=23896331|quote=There is not yet strong evidence that alternative exercise regimens can reduce urinary leakage in women with stress urinary incontinence. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was insufficient to support the use of Paula method, abdominal muscle training, Pilates, Tai Chi, breathing exercises, postural training, and generalized fitness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Devices===
Individuals who continue to experience urinary incontinence need to find a management solution that matches their individual situation. The use of mechanical devices has not been well studied in women as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipp|first1=A|last2=Shaw|first2=C|last3=Glavind|first3=K|title=Mechanical devices for urinary incontinence in women.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 December 2014|volume=12|pages=CD001756|pmid=25517397|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001756.pub6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[External urine collection device|Collecting systems]] (for men) – consists of a sheath worn over the penis funneling the urine into a urine bag worn on the leg. These products come in a variety of materials and sizes for individual fit. Studies &lt;ref name="pmid20950307"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chartier-Kastler E, Ballanger P, Petit J, Fourmarier M, Bart S, Ragni-Ghazarossian E, Ruffion A, Le Normand L, Costa P | title = Randomized, crossover study evaluating patient preference and the impact on quality of life of urisheaths vs absorbent products in incontinent men | journal = BJU International | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 241–7 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 20950307 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09736.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that urisheaths and urine bags are preferred over absorbent products – in particular when it comes to ‘limitations to daily activities’. Solutions exist for all levels of incontinence. Advantages with collecting systems are that they are discreet, the skin stays dry all the time, and they are convenient to use both day and night.  Disadvantages are that it is necessary to get measured to ensure proper fit and you need a health care professional to write a prescription for them.
*Absorbent products (include shields, undergarments, protective underwear, briefs, diapers, adult diapers and underpants) are the best known product types to manage incontinence. They are generally easy to get hold of in pharmacies or supermarkets. The advantages of using these are that they barely need any fitting or introduction by a health care specialist. The disadvantages with absorbent products are that they can be bulky, leak, have odors and can cause skin breakdown.
*Fixer-occluder devices (for men) are strapped around the penis, softly pressing the urethra and stopping the flow of urine. This management solution is only suitable for light or moderate incontinence.
*Indwelling catheters (also known as foleys) are very often used in hospital settings or if the user is not able to handle any of the above solutions himself. The indwelling catheter is typically connected to a urine bag that can be worn on the leg or hang on the side of the bed. Indwelling catheters need to be changed on a regular basis by a health care professional. The advantage of indwelling catheters are, that the urine gets funneled away from the body keeping the skin dry. The disadvantage, however,  is that it is very common to get urinary tract infections when using indwelling catheters.&lt;ref name="pmid10670503"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cravens DD, Zweig S | title = Urinary catheter management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 369–76 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10670503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Intermittent catheterisation|Intermittent catheters]] are single use catheters that are inserted into the bladder to empty it, and once the bladder is empty they are removed and discarded. Intermittent catheters are primarily used for retention (inability to empty the bladder) but for some people can be used to reduce / avoid incontinence.

===Medications===
A number of medications exist to treat incontinence including: [[fesoterodine]], [[tolterodine]] and [[oxybutynin]].&lt;ref name=Med2012&gt;{{cite journal|title=Systematic Review: Benefits and Harms of Pharmacologic Treatment for Urinary Incontinence in Women|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|url=http://www.annals.org/content/early/2012/04/09/0003-4819-156-12-201206190-00436.full#abstract-1 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-156-12-201206190-00436|pmid=22711079|volume=156|date=June 2012|vauthors=Shamliyan T, Wyman JF, Ramakrishnan R, Sainfort F, Kane RL |pages=861–74, W301–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a number appear to have a small benefit, the risk of side effects are a concern.&lt;ref name=Med2012/&gt; For every ten or so people treated only one will become able to control their urine and all medication are of similar benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shamliyan|first=T|author2=Wyman, JF |author3=Ramakrishnan, R |author4=Sainfort, F |author5= Kane, RL |title=Benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatment for urinary incontinence in women: a systematic review.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=Jun 19, 2012|volume=156|issue=12|pages=861–74|pmid=22711079|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-156-12-201206190-00436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medications are not recommended for those with stress incontinence and are only recommended in those who have urge incontinence who do not improve with bladder training.&lt;ref name=Qa2014/&gt;

===Surgery===
Surgery may be used to help stress or overflow incontinence.&lt;ref name=Mayo2008/&gt; Common surgical techniques for stress incontinence include slings, tension-free vaginal tape, and bladder suspension among others.&lt;ref name=Mayo2008/&gt; However, the use of transvaginal mesh implants and bladder slings is controversial. Due to the risk of debilitating painful side effects such as vaginal erosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lieffcabraser.com/injury/devices/vaginal-mesh/|title=Vaginal Mesh &amp; Bladder Sling Complications and Lawsuits|work=Lieff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein, LLP|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 transvaginal mesh implants were classified as a high risk device by the US Food and Drug Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/31/vaginal-pelvic-mesh-explainer|title=What does pelvic mesh do and why are women suing over it? – explainer|last=Davey|first=Melissa|date=2017-08-31|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urodynamic testing seems to confirm that surgical restoration of vault prolapse can cure motor urge incontinence.

Globally, up to 35% of the population over the age of 60 years is estimated to be incontinent.&lt;ref name="Hannestad"/&gt; 
In 2014, urinary leakage affected between 30% and 40% of people over 65 years of age living in their own homes or apartments in the U.S.&lt;ref name=US2014/&gt; Twenty-four percent of older adults in the U.S. have moderate or severe urinary incontinence that should be treated medically.&lt;ref name=US2014&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES|title=Prevalence of Incontinence Among Older Americans|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_036.pdf|website=CDC|accessdate=23 August 2014|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bladder control problems have been found to be associated with higher incidence of many other health problems such as obesity and diabetes. Difficulty with bladder control results in higher rates of depression and limited activity levels.&lt;ref name="pmid12517660"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nygaard I, Turvey C, Burns TL, Crischilles E, Wallace R | title = Urinary incontinence and depression in middle-aged United States women | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = 149–56 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12517660 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incontinence is expensive both to individuals in the form of bladder control products and to the health care system and nursing home industry. Injury related to incontinence is a leading cause of admission to assisted living and nursing care facilities.  More than 50% of nursing facility admissions are related to incontinence.&lt;ref name="pmid9351481"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thom DH, Haan MN, Van Den Eeden SK | title = Medically recognized urinary incontinence and risks of hospitalization, nursing home admission and mortality | journal = Age and Ageing | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–74 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9351481 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children ===
Incontinence happens less often after age 5: About 10 percent of 5-year-olds, 5 percent of 10-year-olds, and 1 percent of 18-year-olds experience episodes of incontinence. It is twice as common in girls as in boys.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Women===
Bladder symptoms affect women of all ages. However, bladder problems are most prevalent among older women.&lt;ref name="pmid11412210"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milsom I, Abrams P, Cardozo L, Roberts RG, Thüroff J, Wein AJ | title = How widespread are the symptoms of an overactive bladder and how are they managed? A population-based prevalence study | journal = BJU International | volume = 87 | issue = 9 | pages = 760–6 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11412210 | doi = 10.1046/j.1464-410x.2001.02228.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women over the age of 60 years are twice as likely as men to experience incontinence; one in three women over the age of 60 years are estimated to have bladder control problems.&lt;ref name="Hannestad"&gt;2.  Hannestad Y.S., Rortveit G., Sandvik H., Hunskaar S. A community-based epidemiological survey of female urinary incontinence: The Norwegian EPINCONT Study. [[J Clin Epidemiol]] 2000; 53: 1150–7&lt;/ref&gt; One reason why women are more affected is the weakening of pelvic floor muscles by pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/an-emotional-burden-rarely-discussed/ |title=An 'Emotional Burden' Rarely Discussed|publisher=''New York Times'' |author=Judith Graham|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men===
Men tend to experience incontinence less often than women, and the structure of the male [[urinary tract]] accounts for this difference. It is common with [[prostate cancer]] treatments. Both women and men can become incontinent from neurologic injury, [[congenital defect]]s, [[stroke]]s, [[multiple sclerosis]], and physical problems associated with [[Senescence|aging]].

While urinary incontinence affects older men more often than younger men, the onset of incontinence can happen at any age. Estimates in the mid-2000s suggested that 17 percent of men over age 60, an estimated 600,000 men, experienced urinary incontinence, with this percentage increasing with age.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Stothers, L., Thom, D., Calhoun, E., "Chapter 6: Urinary Incontinence in Men," Urologic Diseases in America Report 2007, National Institutes of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The management of urinary incontinence with pads is mentioned in the earliest medical book known, the [[Ebers Papyrus]] (1500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ed|first=Horst-Dieter Becker ...|title=Urinary and fecal incontinence : an interdisciplinary approach ; with 89 tables|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=3540222251|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incontinence has historically been a taboo subject in Western culture. However, this situation changed some when [[Kimberly-Clark]] aggressively marketed [[adult diaper]]s in the 1980s with actor [[June Allyson]] as spokeswoman. Allyson was initially reticent to participate, but her mother, who had incontinence, convinced her that it was her duty in light of her successful career. The product proved a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Terry|title=Now Splinter Free: How Marketing Broke Taboos|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/now-splinter-free-how-marketing-broke-taboos-1.4149558|accessdate=10 June 2017|agency=Pirate Radio|publisher=CBC Radio One|date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5100">A '''uterine contraction''' is a [[muscle contraction]] of the [[uterine smooth muscle]].

==Throughout menstrual cycle==
The uterus frequently contracts throughout the entire [[menstrual cycle]], and these contractions have been termed ''endometrial waves'' or ''contractile waves''.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq016 | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = S. | last3 = Knoll | first3 = A.

During the [[luteal phase]], the frequency and amplitude decrease, possibly to facilitate any [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].

If implantation does not occur, the frequency remains low, but the amplitude increases dramatically to between 50 and 200 mmHg producing labor-like contractions at the time of [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt; These contractions are sometimes termed ''menstrual cramps'',&lt;ref name=medicinenet&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/page3.htm medicinenet.com &gt; Menstrual Cramps] Retrieved January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although that term is often used for [[menstrual pain]] in general. These contractions may be uncomfortable or even painful, but they are generally significantly less painful than contractions during labour. A hot water bottle or exercising has been found to help.{{Cn|date=December 2012}}

A shift in the myosin expression of the [[uterine smooth muscle]] has been hypothesized to avail for changes in the directions of uterine contractions that are seen during the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt;

==Childbirth==
[[File:Courtesy Bellyband with chip Shima Seiki Haute Technology Laboratory DSCF2178.jpg | thumb | right | Knitted Bellyband with conductive thread and RFID chip to monitor contractions]]
A contraction refers specifically to the motion of the [[uterus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Uterine+Contraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the process of [[childbirth]]. Contractions, and labour in general, is one condition that releases the hormone [[oxytocin]] into the body.  Contractions become longer as labour intensifies.

Prior to actual labour, women may experience [[Braxton Hicks contractions]], sometimes known as "false labour."

Since every [[pregnancy]] is different, a doctor, [[midwife]] or other competent professional should always be consulted before any action is taken to reduce the pain. Some popular methods may be harmful to the mother and/or the baby, or may actually worsen the pain or lengthen the labour.

Uterine contractions during childbirth can be [[monitoring (medicine)|monitored]] by [[cardiotocography]], in which a device is fixated to the skin of the mother or directly to the fetal scalp. The pressure required to flatten a section of the uterine wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.btconnect.com/MalcolmBrown/entries/TOCODYNAMOMETER.html Tocodynamometer]. By Dr. Malcolm C Brown. Copyright 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

A type of monitoring technology under development at [[Drexel University]] embeds conductive threads in the knitted fabric of a bellyband. When the fibers stretch in response to a contraction, the threads function like an antenna, and send the signals they pick up to an embedded RFID (radio frequency identification device) chip that reports the data.&lt;ref name="Reyes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes|first1=Juliana|title=Drexel’s wearable-tech lab is making ‘a radio out of fabric’ for pregnant women|url=https://technical.ly/philly/2014/08/21/drexel-wearable-tech-pregnant-belly-band/|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=Technically Philly|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''water crisis in Honduras''' is the problem of physical and economic [[water scarcity]] in [[Honduras]].

==Water crisis problem==
There is a prevalent [[water crisis]] in many developing nations. As cities and slums grow at an alarming rate, the lack of access to clean water and [[sanitation]] kills thousands, as well as reducing the quality of life of many Hondurans.

==Demographics==
As of 2010, Honduras is a country that has a population of around 7.6 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compassion.com/about/where/honduras.htm |title=Honduras Facts |website=Compassion.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which about more than 50% live in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/web/guest/country/statistics/tags/honduras |title=Statistics |publisher=Rural Poverty Portal |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Guacirope River Basin is in the South of Honduras. It is an area that faces extreme [[drought]] due to high temperatures and low annual [[rainfall]]. This is a deviation from coastal regions of Honduras that enjoys high annual rainfall and relatively cool temperatures.&lt;ref name="onedrop.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onedrop.org/en/projects/projects-overview/honduras.aspx |title=Water Projects in Honduras: Water and Food Security |publisher=One Drop |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem==
Water coverage in Honduras has is about 80% of its total population and about 70% in rural areas. The current level of water sanitation and its quantity is insufficient where close to 90% of the [[water supply]] is intermittent and unreliable. 
In the rural areas, 44% of the water is up to health standards due to absence of water [[quality control]] and monitoring. Sanitation coverage in Honduras is improving, reaching 68% of the total population but only 50% of the rural populace&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterforpeople.org/programs/central-america/honduras.html ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, this area suffers from extensive [[deforestation]], which reduces the soil’s [[Water retention curve|water retention]] rate which in turn leads to poor returns on crop cultivation, health issues and [[poverty]]. The lack of infrastructure and resources to collect rainwater in the Guacirope River basin exacerbates this problem.

==Current situation==
In 1998, Honduras was hit by [[Hurricane Mitch]] which left 75% of the country without safe [[drinking water]], and the country has not yet recovered from the damage to the [[infrastructure]] it has caused. Currently, infrastructure and basic [[healthcare]] is lacking and repair works are still ongoing.&lt;ref name="water.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.org/projects/honduras/ |title=Honduras Water Crisis: Clean Water Scarcity In Honduras |website=Water.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, 1.2 million people in Honduras have no access to improved water sources. A [[military coup]] in 2009 has led to political and economical turmoil, further worsening the water situation in the country. Coupled with the lack of infrastructure, the health standards in Honduras are dire.&lt;ref name="water.org"/&gt;

A severe lack of water has led to much hardship amongst the locals, especially in the rural areas. [[Diarrhea]] and [[hepatitis]] are some of the illnesses which are rampant, especially among the young which can be fatal in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thewe.cc/weplanet/news/water/dying_for_clean_water.html ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rural villages, women spend up to 6 man-hours to fetch clean water which could otherwise be used for educational and developmental purposes. 
Lack of access to clean water contributes largely to the poverty and poor health of the Hondurans. Despite the graveness of the crisis, the government is unable to implement useful programs to ease the [[destitution]] in the country, especially those living in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.onedrop.org/en/UnderstandTheWaterCrisis/water-crisis.aspx |title=Our Unique Approach for a Sustainable Access to Safe Water |publisher=One Drop |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One Drop NGO==
===Introduction===
One Drop Foundation is a [[non-governmental organisation]] (NGO) that aim to fight poverty by providing access to water to those in need. Another goal of said NGO is to raise awareness about the water crisis to communicate the need for mobilization in order to ensure that all individuals have access to sufficient amount of safe water in both the present and future. To achieve these, One Drop is actively involved in fundraising through events such as LA SOIRÉE ONE DROP and making use of popular media platform like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]] and [[Flickr]]. One Drop is currently undertaking nine projects in both developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onedrop.org/en/DiscoverOneDrop_Canada/WhoWeAre.aspx |title=An Organisation Thriving to Give Access to Safe Water |publisher=One Drop |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
One Drop Foundation was founded by [[Guy Laliberté]] on October 29, 2007, in [[Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]].

One Drop has projects in Nicaragua and Honduras.

Currently{{when|date=January 2017}}, One Drop is assessing the situation in [[India]], [[Haiti]] and [[El Salvador]].

===Approach===
One Drop utilises a trident approach – Technical, Microfinance, Social Arts and Popular Education.

The Technical approach targets to improve access to water and promote responsible use of this resource.

The Microfinancial approach entails granting [[loan]]s to communities in order to launch income-generating initiatives and ensure the longevity of projects.

The Social Arts and Population Approach aims to raise awareness, educate and mobilize communities on water-related issues so as to promote the sound management of water, One Drop makes use of social arts and popular education.

===Mission and values===
One Drop is guided by its objectives to improve access to safe water in order to increase the level of health and agricultural output, establishing a high standard of [[food security]], improving household incomes, increasing awareness with regards to water-related issues through educational shows and workshops, promoting [[gender equality]] and to embody [[leadership]] skills in youth so that they can lead the change.

A comprehensive and transparent website listing out its activities makes it a reliable platform for future partners and [[donation]]s from people traversing the globe. The website also has a news section that features activities and functions they engage in. It features live photos, lists out the duration of the project, tasks of representatives and how it has helped benefit the lives of the people. This gives partners and donors an intuitive feel and further enhances its [[credibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onedrop.org/en/DiscoverOneDrop_Canada/MissionAndValues.aspx |title=Developing Projets for a Sustainable Access to Safe Water |publisher=One Drop |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One Drop in developing countries===
====Honduras====
Guacirope River Basin is an area stretched by extreme drought due to high temperatures and low annual precipitation. The mountain areas of Guacirope River Basin, faces extensive deforestation diminishing the soil’s capacity to retain water. This results in low agricultural yields, poor health, poverty and susceptible to the immense weather. The venue is also undernourished in resources, materials and infrastructures needed to collect rainwater.&lt;ref name="onedrop.org"/&gt;
The Honduras project which is currently ongoing, will directly impacts 1,000 families and will ultimately benefit over 15,000 men, women and children.

[[Image:VerticalDO2.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Maxillary and mandibular record bases with notched wax rims.]]
'''Wax rims''' are devices that are used in [[dentistry]] to help in the fabrication of removable prostheses, such as [[dentures|complete]] and [[Removable partial denture|partial]] dentures.

When placed in the mouth, wax rims allow the dentist to record a measured [[vertical dimension of occlusion|vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO)]] because the patient will be unable to close further than the wax will allow.  The wax is built up or removed until the appropriate VDO has been established.  The rims are then notched in order to allow an index of the relationship of the maxillary rim to the mandibular rim with an impressionable medium, such as Alluwax or Regisal.

Phemba are iconic examples of [[Kingdom of Kongo#Art_of_the_Kongo_Kingdom|Kongo art]] and  according to Thompson (1981) "reflect the degree to which women are treasured in Kongo culture, not just for their fecundity, but as seers and guardians of the spirit".&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2018}} 
Kongo societies are [[matrilineal]].&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In special cases, communities honored women by commissioning stone icons depicting a mother and child to be placed on their tombs. This was also considered dangerous, as it represented an insertion of the source of life - the mother - into the world of the dead.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art, Washington|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kikongo]] word ''phemba'' translates to "the white",&lt;ref&gt;Herbert M. Cole, ''ICONS'' (1989), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the white earth ([[Kaolinite]]) that is a sign of fertility in the region. The name is interpreted by  [[John M. Janzen]] (1979) as denoting "'the one who gives children in-potentia.' A phemba child is a magically conceived [[nkisi]] child, a fragile emissary of the spirit world."&lt;ref name="African Religions"&gt;{{cite book|title=African religions: a symposium|year=1979|publisher=NOK Publishers|location=New York|edition=2nd printing, corr.|editor=Newell S. Booth,}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phemba statuary falls into two groups: mothers cradling or holding their babies, and mothers nursing.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;
The very different styles of phemba sculptures illustrate regional and even personal variations on the same theme.
Oral tradition holds that the phemba cult was established by a famous midwife.
