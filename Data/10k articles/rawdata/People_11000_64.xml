'''Agwé''' (also spelt '''Goue''', '''Agoueh''', or '''Agive'''), is a [[loa]] who rules over the sea, fish, and aquatic plants, as well as the patron loa of fishermen and sailors in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], especially in [[Haiti]]. He is considered to be married to [[Erzulie Freda]] and [[La Sirene]]. He goes by several titles, including  ''koki la me'' ("Shell of the Sea"), ''koki dore'' ("Golden Shell"), "The Angel in the Mirror", "The Eel", and "The Tadpole in the Pond".

==Agwe Family==
===Rada===
'''Met Agwe''' is the Loa of direction. His territory is the winds and the currents, waves and depths of the oceans. He helps sailors find their bearings when lost at sea. He provides inspiration and guidance whenever an individual needs them in times of turmoil, loss, or indecision. He lives in a glorious palace under the seas. Patron of sailors, sea travelers and pirates.
("Master Agwe")

'''Agwe Arroyo''' or '''Agwe Tawoyo''' / '''Agwe 'Woyo''' ("Agwe of the Streams") is captain of ''Immamou'', the ship that carries the dead to ''Guinee'', the afterlife. He cries salt-water tears for the departed. He assisted the souls of those that suffered crimes against humanity during the trans-atlantic slave trade.

'''Papa Agwe''' is envisioned as a handsome African man with green eyes, sometimes lighter skin, often wearing a naval officer's or sailor's uniform. He is considered to be a gentleman who commands respect and embodies several ideals of masculinity including bravery, reserve and provision.

===Petro===
'''Agwe Flambeau''' ("Agwe of the Torch") is from a realm of boiling water, like a hot springs or an underwater volcanic eruption. He is appealed to give rivals bad luck in fishing or sailing. He is also invoked to avoid or remove bad luck at sea, to avoid sinking or drowning, or to stop or prevent rough seas and bad storms.

'''Agwe Ge-Rouge''' ("Agwe of the Red Eyes")

==Worship==
His colours are blue, white, and occasionally sea-green or brown. His ''veve'' (ritual symbol) is a boat with sails. His symbols are painted shells, painted oars, and sealife like the seahorse and starfish. He is syncretised with the Catholic saint [[Ulrich of Augsburg]] and occasionally the archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], both of whom are depicted holding fish. His holy day is Thursday.

He is saluted or signaled with blowing on a conch shell and/or volleys of gunfire. When he possesses a devotee he often pushes himself around the temple on a chair (his boat) with a cane (his oar), shouting naval commands and saluting members of the congregation. His ''chevals'' ("horses", or possessed devotees) need to be kept moist with wet sponges or damp towels and have to be kept from running into the sea, where Agwe belongs.

===Offerings===
Small offerings to Agwe are poured or dropped overboard in deep ocean water. Large offerings to Agwe are left on constructed rafts (''barques d'Agwe'') which are floated or towed out to sea. If the raft sinks, it is accepted; if it returns to shore it is rejected. After the offering is left, the supplicants cannot look back at that place or it will anger Agwe. ''Chevals'' must be prevented from falling or leaping into the sea and drowning, as it would offend Agwe. Nothing toxic (lead pipes, cement bags, garbage) must be used to weigh down the raft; if it will hurt or pollute the sea, it will anger Agwe.

His offerings include: 
*Beverages: [[champagne]], [[Rum#Naval rum|naval rum]], or [[anisette]]. Coffee with sugar and cream.
*Items: mirrors, a telescope, toy ships or scale ship models, oars or paddles, sea shells, turquoise beads or jewelry, fish-shaped sculptures or jewelry, fish hooks and nets, nautical uniforms or medals.  
*Food: Savoury exotic foods, melon, boiled cornmeal, rice cooked in coconut milk, rice cooked with lima beans, boiled or fried ripe bananas, [[Cake#Special-purpose cakes|white cake]], [[cane syrup]], [[almond oil]], [[olive oil]].  
*Sacrificial Animals: White roosters, male ducks, and white rams or goats whose wool has been dyed with indigo. They are afterwards prepared, cooked, and then placed in serving dishes or on plates as a sacrifice (as King of the Seas, he doesn't get hot food at home).

He is rarely offered seafood. If it is offered (perhaps to celebrate a bountiful year, good fortune, or a joyous occasion) it must be prepared and then cooked in a pan or oven. Then (to be fit for the table of the King of the Sea) it must be served on a white china dish with blue patterns.

==See also==
Agwe's ship is crewed by other Loa as well:
:[[Agassou]], Papa Agwe's First Lieutenant, shown in the form of a crab.
:[[Silibo]], the patron of the Sacred Baths.
:[[Oya]]-[[Iansan]], the loa of strong winds and stormy weather. She is also a Petro warrior loa as ''Ogou Yamsan'' - one of the [[Ogoun]] Family - a riotous sailor or marine who revels in stormy sailing and war at sea.
:[[Ogoun|Ogou Balendjo]], Ogou in his aspect of the healer.

At Agwe's ceremonies, they arrive first to make sure the place is fit for "The Admiral".

==Pop Culture==
''Agwe'' is also a character in the [[Musical (theater)|musical]] ''[[Once on This Island]]'' as the god of water. A recent appearance of Agwé on stage was [[Once On This Island]] where he was one of the four gods: Asaka ([[Azaka Medeh|Azaka]]) Mother of Earth, Agwé God of Water, [[Erzulie]] Goddess of Love and Papa Gé ([[Ghédé|Papa Ghede]]) Demon of Death.

[[Image:Antoine Joseph Santerre.jpeg|thumb|right|250px]]
'''Antoine Joseph Santerre''' (16 March 1752 in [[Paris]]{{snd}}6 February 1809) was a businessman and general during the [[French Revolution]].

==Early life==
The Santerre family moved from [[Saint-Michel, Aisne|Saint-Michel-en-Thiérache]] to [[Paris]] in 1747 where they purchased a brewery known as the ''Brasserie de la Magdeleine''. Antoine Santerre married his third cousin Marie Claire Santerre, daughter of a wealthy bourgeois brewer, Jean François Santerre, from the Cambrai in March 1748. The couple had six children, Antoine Joseph being the 3rd. The others were Marguerite, born in 1750; Jean Baptiste, born in 1751; Armand Théodore, born in 1753; followed by François and Claire. The future general's father died in 1770, his mother just months later. His elder brother and sister, Marguerite and Jean Baptiste took charge of the household and family business, helping their mother raise the younger children, they never married. Armand Théodore went into the sugar business, and owned a factory in Essonnes, the other members of the family remained in the brewery business. François, known as François Santerre de la Fontinelle, had breweries in Sèvres, Chaville and Paris and Claire, the youngest, married a lawyer.{{sfn|Carro|1847|pp=2-3}} Antoine Joseph was sent to school at the collèges des Grassins, followed by history and physics under M.M. Brisson and the abbot Nollet. His interest in physics led advances in beer production that pushed breweries out of their infancy.{{sfn|Carro|1847|p=4}}
In 1770 Antoine Joseph was emancipated, and 2 years later, with his inheritance he purchased with his brother François Mr. Acloque's brewery at 232 Faubourg St. Antoine for 65,000 French Francs. In that same year he married his childhood sweetheart, the daughter of his neighbour, Monsieur Francois, another wealthy brewer. Antoine Joseph was 20 years old and Marie François was sixteen. Marie died the following year from an infection derived from a fall during her 7th month of pregnancy.
Years later Antoine Joseph married Marie Adèlaïde Deleinte with whom he had three children, Augustin, Alexandre and Theodore.

==Military life==
His generosity won great popularity in the Faubourg St. Antoine. When the [[French Revolution]] erupted in 1789, he was given command of a battalion of the Parisian [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] and participated in the [[storming of the Bastille]]. After the [[Champ de Mars Massacre]] on 17 July 1791, a warrant was issued for his arrest and Santerre went into hiding. He emerged again the following year to lead the people of the Faubourg St. Antoine, the eastern units, in the [[10 August (French Revolution)|assault on the Tuileries Palace]] by the Paris mob,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} which overwhelmed and massacred the [[Swiss Guard]] as the royal family fled through the gardens and took refuge with the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]]. [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was officially removed as king soon after.

Santerre was appointed by the [[National Convention]] to serve as the jailer of the former king. He notified Louis that the motion had passed for his execution, and the next day, at eight o'clock on a 21 January morning, Santerre arrived at the convicted man's room and said, "Monsieur, it's time to go". He escorted Louis XVI through the some eighty thousand armed men and countless citizens down the streets of Paris to the [[guillotine]]. There are differing accounts of his conduct at the execution itself. According to some, he ordered a drum roll halfway through the king's speech in order to drown out his voice. Others say that it was actually General J.F. Berruyer – the man in command of the execution – who ordered the drum roll, and that Santerre only relayed the order. Santerre's family maintained, however, that he actually silenced the drums so that Louis could speak to the people.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Santerre was promoted to General of a division of the Parisian National Guard in July 1793. When the [[War in the Vendée|revolts broke out in the Vendée]], Santerre took command of a force sent in to put a stop to the rebellions. He was not as successful as a military commander in the field; his first military operation saw the defeat of the Republican forces at [[Saumur]]. After the battle, reports circulated that Santerre himself had been killed; the [[Monarchism|Royalists]] even composed a humorous epitaph about his death. Nor was Santerre popular among the ''[[sans-culottes]]'' he commanded. Wounded soldiers returning to Paris reported that he was living in Oriental luxury and complained that their defeat was due either to his treason or his incompetence. Some demanded that he be relieved of his command or even sent to the guillotine. On the other hand, Santerre was not in supreme command, and not considered responsible for the outcome of the war.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In October, Santerre returned to Paris, where his popularity in the Faubourg St. Antoine was undiminished. Nevertheless, his report on this expedition, in which he drew attention to the plight of the Republican army in the Vendée, aroused suspicion. Accused of being a Royalist due to his lack of glory during the battles in the Vendée, he was arrested in April 1794 and was imprisoned until the fall of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]. Upon his release, he resigned his command and attempted to return to business, but his brewery was ruined. He died in poverty in Paris on 6 February 1809.

'''Dr. William "Bill" Horton''' is a [[fictional character]] from the American NBC daytime soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. He is a surgeon, and is one of the five children of the show's original couple, [[Dr. Tom Horton|Dr Tom]] and [[Alice Horton]]. Bill was a main character on ''Days of Our Lives'' for its first fifteen years. The role is most associated with actor [[Edward Mallory]], who portrayed the character for the greatest time.

==Casting==
[[Paul Carr (actor)|Paul Carr]] originated the role, playing Bill from December 22, 1965 to January 3, 1966. The character was re-introduced on June 21 1966, when [[Edward Mallory]] began an almost fourteen year run as Bill, playing him through to April 14, 1980. The character returned in the late eighties, when [[Christopher Stone (actor)|Christopher Stone]] played Bill for a six-month stint from September 11 1987 to March 17 1988. Mallory reprised playing Bill in guest appearances from July 1 to 3, 1991, and then again in a short-term recurring capacity from October 15, 1992 to January 5, 1993. Stone also returned for a short stint from March 10 to July 19, 1994. Then, after a character-absence of nearly sixteen years, and after the deaths of the previous actors, [[John H. Martin]] appeared as Bill from June 15 to 28, 2010, for the funeral of Bill's mother, [[Alice Horton]].

==Storylines==
Named after his grandfather, Bill Horton is the youngest son of the Horton children; his siblings include [[Tom Horton Jr.]], [[Mickey Horton]], [[Addie Horton]], and [[Marie Horton]]. Bill (Paul Carr), an aspiring surgeon, initially appears at Christmas 1965, on vacation from medical school.

In June 1966, Bill (now Edward Mallory) takes his first job at Salem University Hospital, where his father works. Here he meets [[Laura Horton|Dr. Laura Spencer]], a young psychiatric intern, and begins dating her. His brother Mickey is also interested in Dr. Spencer. Although this causes problems with Mickey, Laura and Bill soon become engaged. Bill is stricken with bone tuberculosis of the hand and it appears as though he will never be able to be a surgeon. Bill is devastated and leaves Salem, to sort out his future and eventually take a medical position in another town.

In late 1967 Bill returns to Salem along with his friend Dr. Mark Brooks (later revealed to be his brother [[Tommy Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Tommy]]) and a little boy named Timmy McCall. Bill was living with the McCall family when Timmy's mother Mary died. Before passing Mary made Bill promise to become Timmy's guardian. Bill had met Mark Brooks through Mary, and it was Mark who encouraged Bill to undergo therapy to regain control of his hand. When Timmy McCall needed his appendix removed Bill performed the surgery, and then knew he would be able to return to Salem and continue his surgical career.

While Bill was out of town, his brother Mickey, and his ex-fiancé Laura became closer and became engaged. After Mickey and Laura wed, Bill is consumed with jealousy, and one night, while drunk, Bill rapes Laura in her office. When he awakes the next morning Bill cannot remember anything that happened; and Laura tells him she turned him away, in order to prevent a feud between Mickey, her husband, and Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.com/specials/specials_detail_4589.html|title=Bill Horton, A History|last=|first=|date=|website=daysofourlives.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027011924/http://daysofourlives.com/specials/specials_detail_4589.html|archive-date=2010-10-27|dead-url=Yes|access-date=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laura soon becomes pregnant. Tom finds out about the pregnancy from a lab report and also discovers that Mickey is sterile. Laura explains to Tom that Bill raped her while he was drunk and that she didn't tell Mickey in order to prevent any fighting between the two. Tom agrees to keep the secret. Bill has also read the report about Mickey's infertility, but keeps it to himself because he feels it best that no one know. Laura soon delivers the baby, [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael William Horton]] (known later as Mike), on September 28, 1968.

Everyones happiness is ruined when Bill learns that Kitty Horton, Tommy's ex-wife, has a tape recording of Laura and Tom talking about Michael in which they reveal Bill is Michael's natural father. Bill goes to Kitty's apartment, and ransacks it and fights with Kitty before finding the tape and leaving. Shockingly, Kitty is killed later that night, and Bill is charged with Kitty's murder. Mickey, who is a lawyer, defends Bill in court. Bill refuses to tell anyone why he was at Kitty's place that night, and eventually he is found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to three years in prison.

In prison Bill meets [[Doug Williams (Days of Our Lives)|Doug Williams]], and his stories of Salem and a rich widowed [[Susan Martin (Days of Our Lives)|Susan Martin]], would send Doug to Salem after he is released. Near the end of 1970, Bill is released from prison and later begins seeing his brother's secretary [[Linda Patterson]].

In 1972 Bill and Laura begin to fall in love when Laura learns the true reason Bill went to jail. Laura plans to divorce Mickey and marry Bill. When the two are overheard talking by young Mike, Mike assumes they are having an affair and runs out into the street and is hit by a car. Mike survives, but afterwards he tells his "Uncle Bill" that he hates him and needs to stay away from his family.

In 1973 Mickey suffers a massive coronary, but with Bill's skilled hands he manages to save his brothers life. Soon after his operation Mickey suddenly disappears from Salem. With Mickey out of town Bill is free to pursue Laura, but her marriage to Mickey still stands in the way. Mickey is discovered to be alive, but he has amnesia, and he grants Laura a divorce so he could remain with [[Maggie Horton|Maggie Simmons]].

On December 4, 1975, after years of pursuing one another, Bill and Laura Horton marry. In January 1976 the truth about Mike's parentage comes out when Mike is injured while repairing a truck on Maggie Simmons' farm. Mickey and Laura both donate blood to save Mike's life, but neither match. Mickey finds out through Bill's medical records that Bill is a match, and Mickey's memory quickly floods back. Mickey is enraged and buys a gun and goes after Bill. Mickey waits for Bill to come home, and when he does they both fight over the gun. Bill ends up being shot in the arm, and Mickey suffers a mental breakdown. Mickey is admitted to Belview Sanitarium for one year following the incident. Bill's gunshot injury causes nerve damage and impaired feeling and use of his right hand, and he has to quit being a surgeon. Laura gives birth to their daughter [[Jennifer Rose Horton]] on September 11, 1976. After the birth, Laura falls into a deep depression, but she overcomes it with Bill and [[Marlena Evans|Dr. Marlena Evans]] help.

In 1977, Bill begins retraining as an anesthesiologist, and becomes friends with the Head of [[Anesthesiology]], [[Kate Winograd|Dr. Kate Winograd]], and they start falling for each other. When a young inexperienced resident surgeon panics in the operating room and walks out, Bill is forced to perform life-saving brain surgery with the assistance of Kate. Thanks to the physiotherapy Bill has been doing for his hand, Bill is able to do the surgery and save the life of the patient, Fred Barton. However, Barton is paralyzed from the waist down, and sues the hospital, Bill and Kate. (The young surgeon who walked out lies, and said Bill threw him out of the operating room). Bill and Kate are fired, and Barton sues for $2 million. Their joint situation causes Bill and Kate to become close to each other, and Laura is jealous. Bill and Laura's marriage is in trouble, and Bill moves out of their home, and stays at the Salem Inn. Bill tries to pursue a relationship with Kate, but Kate does not want to be his mistress. Barton's paralysis turns out to be psychological, and when he walks into the courtroom, the case against Bill and Kate is thrown out. Bill embraces and kisses Kate in celebration, but Bill later apologises to Kate for his behavior, saying he loves Laura. Kate leaves town, and Bill and Laura repair their marriage.

In 1979 Laura's mentally-ill mother kills herself, and Laura is traumatized and begins having hallucinations of her mom. Laura herself has a mental breakdown, and when she hallucinates her mom telling her to join her, Laura [[overdoses]] and tries to hang herself. Bill and Alice rescue her in the nick of time. Bill is forced to commit his wife to a sanitarium. In 1980, Bill leaves Salem to be nearer to the sanitarium, and leaves his daughter Jennifer in the care of Tom and Alice.

Bill (now Christopher Stone) returns in 1987 and begins dating [[Janice Barnes]]. He eventually breaks things off when his guilt about Laura grows too strong. Bill focuses his attention on his daughter Jennifer and tries to put an end to his daughter's relationship with [[Frankie Brady]]. Jennifer retaliates by becoming engaged to Frankie, but breaks it off when she fears she may become schizophrenic like her mother and grandmother.

Bill returns briefly in 1994 when Laura comes home from the sanitarium. Bill also wants to meet his son [[Lucas Roberts|Lucas]], his illegitimate son with [[Kate Roberts (Days of Our Lives)|Kate Roberts]], but is coldly greeted by the young man who is angry because he grew up without a dad. Bill relocates to Africa to be a volunteer doctor. Jennifer and her partner [[Jack Deveraux]], and their daughter [[Abigail Deveraux|Abigail]] join him in Africa for a while.

Bill (John H. Martin) and his now ex-wife Laura visit Salem again in June 2010 when they receive news that Bill's mother, Alice Horton, is extremely ill.

The '''business career of Mitt Romney''' began shortly after he finished graduate school in 1975.  At that time, [[Mitt Romney|Romney]] entered the [[management consulting]] industry, and in 1977 secured a position at [[Bain &amp; Company]]. Later serving as its chief executive officer, he helped bring the company out of financial crisis&lt;!-- this is supported by detailed sources in body of article --&gt;. In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off [[Bain Capital]], a [[private equity]] investment firm that became highly profitable and one of the [[List of private equity firms#Largest private equity firms|largest such firms]] in the nation&lt;!-- this is supported by detailed sources in body of article --&gt;. The fortune he earned from his business career is estimated at $190–250&amp;nbsp;million.

==Entry into management consulting at Boston Consulting Group: 1975–1977==
[[Image:The Boston Consulting Group logo.png|thumb|right|400px|Logo of Boston Consulting Group]]After he received a [[JD/MBA|joint]] [[Juris Doctor]] and [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1975, Mitt Romney was recruited by several firms and chose to remain in Massachusetts to work for [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG), reasoning that working as a [[management consultant]] to a variety of companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MrPowerPoint"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kranish, Scott Helman ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP3-rXn0H8sC&amp;pg=PT221 The Real Romney]'', page 97 (HarperCollins 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a major company directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/sunday-review/consultant-nation.html | title=Consultant Nation | author=[[David Leonhardt|Leonhardt, David]] | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romney had his pick of jobs at the nation’s biggest and most prestigious consulting firms, and at that time BCG was neither. Its idiosyncratic founder, [[Bruce Henderson]], was regarded as outside the mainstream of corporate consulting, and BCG was routinely disparaged by faculty and students at Harvard Business School.&lt;ref name=Barbaro /&gt;  But BCG was a pioneering upstart that fostered camaraderie among its employees, who traveled around the country to advise clients, and that is where Mitt Romney chose to start his career.&lt;ref name=Barbaro&gt;Michael Barbaro.

==Management consulting at Bain &amp; Company: 1977–1984==
[[File:Horizontal RED LG DIGITAL.png|left|thumb|246x246px|Logo of Bain &amp; Company]]
In 1977, he was hired by [[Bain &amp; Company]], a management consulting firm in Boston that had been formed a few years earlier by [[Bill Bain (consultant)|Bill Bain]] and other former BCG employees.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nykr2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hewitt-48"&gt;Hugh Hewitt.  ''A Mormon in the White House?: 10 Things Every Conservative Should Know About Mitt Romney'', pp. 48–49 (Regnery Publishing 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Bain would later say of the thirty-year-old Romney, "He had the appearance of confidence of a guy who was maybe ten years older."&lt;ref name="howmakemoney"&gt;{{Cite news|first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|title=Romney's Fortunes Tied to Business Riches |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/us/politics/04bain.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other consulting firms, which issued recommendations and then left, Bain &amp; Company had a practice&lt;!-- "Bain way" --&gt;, that Romney learned, of immersing itself in a client's business and working with them until changes were implemented.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nykr2007"/&gt;

[[File:Bain Capital.png|thumb|right|246px|alt=Plain logo consisting of white serif letters against dark blue background|Logo of Bain Capital]]Bain Capital was founded in 1984 by [[Bain &amp; Company]] partners Mitt Romney, T.

[[File:Staples Savi Ranch.jpg|thumb|left|x200px|Staples store in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda, CA]]]]While Bain Capital was founded by Bain executives, the firm was not an affiliate or a division of Bain &amp; Company but rather a completely separate company.  Initially, the two firms shared the same offices – in an office tower at [[Copley Place]] in Boston&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kranish, Scott Helman ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP3-rXn0H8sC&amp;pg=PT221 The Real Romney]'', page 133 (HarperCollins 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; – and a similar approach to improving business operations. However, the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the Bain &amp; Company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/22/business/big-consultants-woo-employees-by-offering-a-piece-of-the-action.html Big Consultants Woo Employees by Offering a Piece of the Action].  New York Times, October 22, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  Bain Capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of Bain &amp; Company. Bain Capital's original $37 million fund was raised entirely from private individuals in mid-1984.&lt;ref name=bain_fundinguniverse /&gt;  The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain &amp; Company, but Romney later persuaded Bill Bain to give that up.&lt;ref name="nyt060407db"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/romneys-presidential-run-throws-spotlight-on-bain-capital/ | title=Romney's Presidential Run Puts Spotlight on Bain Capital | author=Sorkin, Andrew Ross | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 4, 2007 | authorlink=Andrew Ross Sorkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bain Capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital.  By 1985, things were going poorly enough that Romney considered closing the operation, returning investors' money back to them, and having the partners go back to their old positions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kranish, Scott Helman ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP3-rXn0H8sC&amp;pg=PT221 The Real Romney]'', page 138 (HarperCollins 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by 1986, very few had been done.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/specials/romney/articles/part3_main/ | title=The Making of Mitt Romney: Part 3: Reaping profit in study, sweat | author=Gavin, Robert | author2=Pfeiffer, Sacha | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Bain Capital focused on [[venture capital]] opportunities.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;  One of Bain's earliest and most notable venture investments was in [[Staples, Inc.]], the [[office supply]] [[retailer]].  In 1986, Bain provided $4.5 million to two supermarket executives, Leo Kahn and [[Thomas G. Stemberg]], to open an office supply supermarket in [[Brighton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;"Growth in Office-Supply 'Supermarkets' Threatens Tough War for Market Share".

Bain invested the $37 million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by 1989 was generating an annualized return in excess of 50 percent.  By the end of the decade, Bain's second fund, raised in 1987 had deployed $106 million into 13 investments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/magazine/counselor-to-the-king.html Counselor To The King].  New York Times, September 24, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  As the firm began organizing around funds, each such fund was run by a specific general partnership – that included all Bain Capital executives as well as others – which in turn was controlled by  Bain Capital Inc., the management company that Romney had full ownership control of.&lt;ref name="nyt-whenback"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/us/politics/when-did-romney-step-back-from-bain-its-complicated.htm?_r=1 | title= When Did Romney Step Back From Bain?

In 1987, former [[Herman's World of Sporting Goods]] CEO Jack Smith made a pitch to Romney, and Bain joined several other backers to help Smith open nine sporting-goods mega stores. Kmart bought the [[Sports Authority]] chain for $75 million.&lt;ref name=Notte /&gt;

[[File:Sports Authority in Concord.JPG|thumb|right|Sports Authority store in [[Concord, California|Concord, CA]]]]Romney discovered few investment opportunities himself (and those that he did, often failed to make money for the firm).&lt;ref name="real-155"/&gt; Instead, he focused on analyzing the merits of possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved.&lt;ref name="real-155"&gt;Michael Kranish, Scott Helman ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP3-rXn0H8sC&amp;pg=PT221 The Real Romney]'', pp. 141 and 145 (HarperCollins 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain &amp; Company, but Romney persuaded Bain to give that up.&lt;ref name="nyt060407db"/&gt; Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself.&lt;ref name="nyt-depagr"/&gt; Viewed as a fair manager, he received considerable loyalty from the firm's members.&lt;ref name="nym-onep"/&gt;
Romney's wary instincts were still in force at times, and he was generally data-driven and averse to risk.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nym-onep"/&gt;

He wanted to drop a Bain Capital [[hedge fund]] that initially lost money, but other partners prevailed and it eventually gained billions.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt; Romney was on the board of directors of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated).&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt; In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once acquired.&lt;ref name="blum"/&gt; Beginning in 1989, the firm, which began as a [[venture capital]] source investing in [[start-up companies]], adjusted its strategy to focus on [[leveraged buyout]]s and [[growth capital]] investments in more mature companies.&lt;ref&gt;"Venture-Capital Funds Grow Larger and Larger – But Start-Up Companies Find They're Still Left Out in the Cold".  The Wall Street Journal, September 7, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets, partner with existing management to apply Bain methodology to their operations (rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios), and sell them off in a few years.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="howmakemoney"/&gt; Existing CEOs were offered large equity stakes in the process, owing to Bain Capital's belief in the emerging [[agency theory]] that CEOs should be bound to maximizing [[shareholder value]] rather than other goals.&lt;ref name="nym-onep"/&gt; By the end of 1990, Bain had raised $175 million of capital and financed 35 companies with combined revenues of $3.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/30/business/business-people-bain-names-chief-executive-and-begins-a-reorganization.html Bain Names Chief Executive And Begins a Reorganization].  New York Times, January 30, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary return to Bain &amp; Company: 1991–1992==
In 1990, Romney was asked to return to Bain &amp; Company, which was facing financial collapse.&lt;ref name="atl-pappu"/&gt; He was announced as its new CEO in January 1991&lt;ref name="bg-leave1b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-leave1"/&gt; but drew only a symbolic [[One-dollar salary|salary of one dollar]]&lt;ref name="atl-pappu"/&gt; (he remained managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time).&lt;ref name="bg-leave1b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-leave1"/&gt; His turnaround of Bain &amp; Company has been identified as a primary example of Romney's turnaround talents from the business world, and Romney says there was no upside for him personally: "There was no particular reason to do it other than a sense of obligation and duty to an organization that had done great things for me and which employed a thousand people."&lt;ref name=things&gt;Hugh Hewitt.  ''A Mormon in the White House?: 10 Things Every Conservative Should Know About Mitt Romney'', pp. 48–58 (Regnery Publishing 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, once Romney took up the challenge, his stake in success became enormous, and his reputation would have been diminished if Bain &amp; Company went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com" /&gt;  He proceeded to apply the "Bain way" to Bain &amp; Company itself.&lt;ref name=things /&gt;

Bringing along two lieutenants from Bain Capital, Romney began a traveling campaign to rally employees at all Bain offices globally.  Romney also negotiated a complex settlement between the Bain partnership and the firm's lenders, including a $10 million reduction in the $38 million Bain owed the Bank of New England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Romney also imposed a new governing structure that included Bain and the other founding partners giving up control, and increasing fiscal transparency.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MrPowerPoint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atl-pappu"/&gt; Within about a year, he had led Bain &amp; Company through a successful turnaround and returned the firm to profitability without further layoffs or partner defections.&lt;ref name="MrPowerPoint"/&gt; He turned Bain &amp; Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.&lt;ref name="bgseries3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap022407"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070224/NEWS/702240385/1052/RSS01 | title=Romney urges states to divest from Iran despite links to business interests there | author=Johnson, Glen | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]] | location=Worcester | date=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Hewitt.  ''A Mormon in the White House?: 10 Things Every Conservative Should Know About Mitt Romney'', p. 51 (Regnery Publishing 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the techniques that Romney employed during this temporary mission at Bain &amp; Company were as follows: at the outset, he demanded unanimous approval from the partners at Bain &amp; Company for his designation as CEO, and also demanded that each partner commit to staying at least a year so as to give the turnaround a fair chance.  He limited partner meetings to Saturdays, so that all of the weekdays could be devoted to taking care of client business.  Romney reduced the company's physical space, evaluated which partners were producing and which were not, arranged bridge financing, and focused on hiring top talent from top schools, while rescinding prior offers that were not up to standard.&lt;ref name=things /&gt;

Although in the role for just two years before returning to Bain Capital, Romney's work had three profound impacts on the firm. First, ownership was officially shifted from the owners to the firm's 70 [[Partner (business rank)|general partners]]. Second, transparency in the firm's finances increased dramatically (e.g. partners were able to know each other's salaries&lt;ref name="american.com" /&gt;). Third, Bill Bain relinquished ownership in the firm that carried his name.
Within a year, Bain bounced back to profitability without major partner defections,&lt;ref name="american.com" /&gt; and the groundwork was laid for a period of steady growth.

==Back at Bain Capital for the rest of the 1990s==
[[Image:Brookstone Outlet Store, Kittery ME.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Brookstone outlet store in [[Kittery, Maine]]]]After Romney and Bain took over [[Brookstone]] in 1991, they replaced Brookstone's CEO in 1993, shifted to more Brookstone-branded items, moved more catalog content onto the company's website in 1996, and, instead of selling gifts began offering more practical items.  Brookstone survived while its competitor, [[Sharper Image]], declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=Notte /&gt;

In July 1992 (while Romney was still rescuing Bain &amp; Company), Bain Capital acquired [[Ampad]] from [[Mead Corporation]], which had acquired the company in 1986.  Mead, which was experiencing difficulties integrating Ampad's products into its existing product lines, generated a cash gain of $56 million on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/03/business/company-news-mead-corp-to-lay-off-1000.html Mead Corp. to Lay Off 1,000].

Under Bain's ownership, the company also made a number of acquisitions, including writing products company SCM in July 1994, brand names from the American Trading and Production Corporation in August 1995, WR Acquisition and the Williamhouse-Regency Division of Delaware, Inc. in October, 1995, Niagara Envelope Company, Inc. in 1996, and Shade/Allied, Inc. in February 1997.&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/american-pad-paper-company?cat=biz-fin |title=American Pad &amp; Paper Company Profile |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ampad's revenue began to decline in 1997 and the company laid off employees and closed production facilities to maintain profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/daily/26/ampad.pdf |title=Ampad: A controversial deal |newspaper=The Boston Globe |author=James Abundis and Robert Gavin |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ampad transaction is one of Romney's few regrets from his Bain years.&lt;ref name=Notte&gt;Jason Notte.

Bain bought 93% of Domino's in 1998, and installed personnel who substantially boosted profits.&lt;ref name=Notte /&gt;  As for Bain's purchase of film studio Artisan Entertainment in the late 1990s, Romney refused to get personally involved with it, because of its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] films.&lt;ref name=Notte /&gt;

In July 1996, when partner Bob Gray’s teenage daughter went missing in New York City, Romney shut down the Boston office and sent 56 employees to search for her, also setting up a toll-free tip line, and hiring private investigators.  The search took Romney into contact with runaways on the seediest streets of New York, and a traced telephone call helped to locate the daughter, who had travelled to New Jersey for a concert without telling her parents.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kranish, Scott Helman ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP3-rXn0H8sC&amp;pg=PT221 The Real Romney]'', page 221 (HarperCollins 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, an affiliate of Bain Capital called Brookside Capital Partners Fund bought about 6 percent of Global Tech, a Chinese appliance-maker.  Romney was the sole shareholder, sole director, president and chief executive officer of Brookside.&lt;ref&gt;Viser, Matt.

By the end of the decade, Bain Capital was on its way to being one of the top private equity firms in the nation,&lt;ref name="nyt060407db"/&gt; having increased its number of partners from 5 to 18, having 115&amp;nbsp;employees overall, and having $4&amp;nbsp;billion under its management.&lt;ref name="howmakemoney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blum"/&gt;  The firm's average annual return on investments was 113&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name="MrPowerPoint" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7751688.html|title=Business record helps, hinders Romney|first=Thomas|last=Farragher|first2=Scott Bernard|last2=Nelson|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 24, 2002|page=A1}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had made between 100 and 150&amp;nbsp;deals where it acquired and then sold a company.&lt;ref name="vf-excerpt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-dade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-bc"/&gt;  Bain Capital's approach of applying consulting expertise to the companies it invested in became widely copied within the private equity industry.&lt;ref name="blum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune-2007"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/07/09/100121803/index.htm | title=The Republicans' Mr. Fix-it | author=Vickers, Marcia | magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Steven Kaplan (economist)|Steven Kaplan]] of the [[University of Chicago]] would later say, "[Romney] came up with a model that was very successful and very innovative and that now everybody uses."&lt;ref name="nym-onep"/&gt;  Kaplan argues that, "Bain Capital and Romney delivered spectacularly well for their customers, better than other [private equity] firms that on average outperformed the public markets. Today, those customers include the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas."&lt;ref&gt;Steven N. Kaplan.

In contrast to economist Kaplan, the author and polemicist [[Matt Taibbi]] of ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' paints a less favorable portrait of Romney's business career (Taibbi also disparages Romney as “self-righteously anal, thin-lipped, [and] Whitest Kids U Know”).  According to Taibbi, toward the middle of his career at Bain Capital, Romney moved away from helping startups, and moved toward [[leveraged buyout]]s which involved borrowing money to take over established companies in order to extract as much value as possible from those targeted companies.  Taibbi calls this “financial piracy”, while acknowledging that Romney’s leveraged buyouts were not [[hostile takeover]]s, and also conceding that some of Bain’s work was not "evil" (such as Bain's successful turnaround of Experian).  Taibbi blames the [[Internal Revenue Code|U.S. tax code]] for making leveraged buyouts possible by allowing companies like Bain to deduct interest on debt they use to acquire targets, and also by allowing individuals like Romney to pay much less than the ordinary tax rate on income.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Taibbi.

'''Carmen Lind Pettersen''' (6 March 1900–1991) was a [[Guatemalans|Guatemalan]] painter. Known for watercolors of the landscape and traditional costumes of Guatemala and her book, which is the most complete reference work on the textiles of the Guatemalan high plateau. Her works were often listed in Guidebooks for the country and in 1976, she was awarded the [[Order of the Quetzal]] for her artistic merit and has paintings in the permanent collection of the [[Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing]].

==Early life==
Carmen Dorotea Gehrke de María y Campos was born and baptized 6 March 1900, in Sagrario Parish, of [[Guatemala City]], Guatemala to María Magdalena Soledad Isabel de María y Campos Hoffmann and Arthur Henry Theodore Gehrke (aka Arturo Enrique Teodoro Gehrke).{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Guatemalan Baptismal Records|1900|p=221}} Her father was a British agent for the import-export company Rosing Brothers and Company, while her mother was from [[Veracruz]], Mexico. When the couple immigrated to Guatemala, they settled with two children, Enelda Francisca and Arthur Richard in the Jocotenango neighborhood of Guatemala City. While in Guatemala, the family grew, adding Carmen and another son, Conrad in 1903. In 1904, Arthur was transferred with Rosing Brothers to London.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}

In 1909, Gehrke entered the [[Tunbridge Wells Girls' Grammar School]], a boarding school, in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], where she began studying painting and developed an interest in nature, spending hours in [[Kew Gardens]].{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} In 1917, she began studying at the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]] on Regent Street in London. Near the end of the war, she met Leif Lind Pettersen, who was visiting from Guatemala with his uncle Walter Lind.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} Walter Lind (born Lind Pettersen) was an Englishman, born to Norwegian parents, who also worked in Guatemala for Rosing Brothers and owned a coffee plantation.{{sfn|Ones Rosales|2015|p=129}} [[1917 Guatemala earthquake|Earthquakes]] in Guatemala between 1917 and 1918 had devastated the country and in 1923, Arthur was asked to return to the country. He traveled with María and his two daughters, and the family took up residence on one of Walter Lind's farms, known as Helvetia, as Guatemala City was uninhabitable. Gehrke and Leif Lind Pettersen renewed their friendship, which quickly turned into a romance and the couple were married in 1925 in [[Retalhuleu]]. At the time of their marriage, Leif was suffering from [[malaria]] and immediately after the ceremony, Carmen took him to Guatemala City to recover.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}}

==Career==
After Leif’s recovery, the couple bought a coffee farm known as "La Colonia" near [[El Tumbador]]. They managed it for several years, until 1929 when the plummet in coffee prices due to the [[Great Depression]] forced them to sell and buy a ''[[cinchona]]'' farm known as El Zapote, in the [[Escuintla Department]] on the slopes of the [[Volcán de Fuego]]. This turned out to be a precipitous purchase, as during [[World War II]], the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese captured Indonesia]], cutting off the supply to the seeds of the ''cinchona'', which were needed to make [[quinine]]. The demand and Leif's agreement with the United States government and Merck and Company, soon made their farm one of the largest in the area producing chinchona.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}

In the 1930s, Lind Pettersen began gardening on the farm and painting the landscapes she saw, focusing on the diversity of the trees and flora of the Guatemalan coastal piedmont, which few had painted or studied.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} Her works documented the era of transformation of jungles to rural coffee plantations, showing agricultural migration as well as environmental change.{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} Studying design at Kew Gardens, in 1958 with the help of Venancio Tubac Salazar, she created a botanical garden which became the largest in the region.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} It featured three lagoons, which became a haven for migrating coastal [[herons]], as well as large trees which were filled with parrots and other tropical birds. As an observer of her world, she began to study the costumes of the farm workers and domestics that helped on the farm. Noticing that over time the dress styles were changing, Pettersen began to draw and catalogue them. A friend sent her a collection of Mayan costumes, which Pettersen duplicated in watercolor, having her employees and friends pose as models. The work took six years to complete,{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} and she is now known mostly for these watercolors of the traditional costumes of Guatemala.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} In 1976, Lind Pettersen published ''Maya of Guatemala: Vida y Traje/Life and Dress'', a bilingual book, which is the most complete reference work on the textiles of the Guatemalan high plateau.{{sfn|Cazali|2017}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2017}} That same year, she received the [[Order of the Quetzal]] for her artistic merit of preserving the cultural heritage.{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}}

In 1984, Pettersen began losing her sight{{sfn|Cazali|2017}} and rather than give up art, began teaching. She held an exhibit of her works in 1986 at the [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"|National School of Visual Arts]]{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}} and was listed in guidebooks for Guatemala as a reference for the study of textiles and for her watercolors with works on display in the 1990s at the Ixchel Museum and the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno "Carlos Mérida"]].{{sfn|Koose|1989|pp=40–41}}

==Death and legacy==
Lind Pettersen died in 1991. She has over sixty paintings in the permanent collections of the [[Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing]] in Guatemala City. After her death, the garden she developed on their farm became a nature reserve and is opened once a month to the public. In 2017, the Ixchel Museum hosted an exhibit of around thirty of her works throughout the month of February.{{sfn|Sandoval|2017}}

'''Armelia Carol Ohmart''' (July 3, 1927 – January 1, 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Voice of the Theatre|publisher=Alex Film Society|location=Los Angeles, California|p=5|title=Guests of the House: Carol Ohmart|author=Harris, Linda|date=October 28, 2006|volume=12|issue=3|url=http://www.alexfilmsociety.org/newsletters/HouseOnHH_VOT_WEB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''Carol Ohmart''', was an American actress and former model who appeared in numerous films and television series from the early 1950s until the 1970s. Over the duration of her career, she would appear in several notable [[horror film|horror]] and [[film noir]]s, including lead roles in ''[[The Wild Party (1956 film)|The Wild Party]]'' (1956) and [[William Castle]]'s ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959).

Born to a [[Mormonism|Mormon]] family in [[Salt Lake City]], Ohmart spent the majority of her early life in [[Seattle]] and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. After graduating high school, she returned to Utah where she won the title of [[Miss Utah]], and subsequently placed fourth in the [[Miss America]] pageant. Her appearance in pageants led to modeling work, which included posing for artist [[Milton Caniff]]. 

Ohmart made her feature film debut in [[Michael Curtiz]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Hour]]'' in 1956, followed by various television appearances, as well as roles in several horror films, such as ''House on Haunted Hill'' (1959) and ''[[Spider Baby]]'' (1968). Her final film appearance was in ''The Spectre of Edgar Allan Poe'' (1974), after which she formally retired from acting, dedicating her time to studying [[New Age]] philosophy and spiritualism. Ohmart spent the majority of her later life in Seattle, before dying of natural causes in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]] in 2002, aged 74.

==Early life==
Ohmart was born Armelia Carol Ohmart on July 3, 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographical Summaries of Notable People: Carol Ohmart|url=https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-10182-558221/carol-ohmart-in-biographical-summaries-of-notable-people|accessdate=February 22, 2018|via=[[MyHeritage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], into a [[Mormon]] family. Her parents were C. Thomas Ohmart, a dentist who was first a professional actor, and his wife, Armelia Ohmart. Her family relocated to [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] shortly after Ohmart's birth.{{efn-lr|Public records for King County, Washington, show Armelia Carol Ohmart, age 2, a resident of Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1930," database with images, [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XC3H-NJ5 FamilySearch] (accessed February 23, 2018), Armelia C Ohmart in household of C Thomas Ohmart, Seattle, King, Washington, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 98, sheet 14A, line 6, family 229, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 2497; FHL microfilm 2,342,231.&lt;/ref&gt;}} At age twelve, Ohmart sang on [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]] in San Francisco, California.

==Career==
=== Television ===
Ohmart was seen on early television doing commercials, appearing on NBC's ''Bonny Maid Versatile Varieties''&lt;ref name=dh/&gt; (1949–51), which aired Friday nights at 9 p.m. Ohmart was seen pitching floor wax along with [[Anne Francis]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]], the other two hosts of the show.&lt;ref name="unlimited"/&gt; She also worked on ''[[The 20th Century Fox Hour]]''.&lt;ref name=asw&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prickette|first1=James|title=Actors of the Spaghetti Westerns|date=2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781469144290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Q1SAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA1952&amp;dq=%22Carol+Ohmart%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX86PTmovOAhUkzIMKHVdTAOsQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Carol%20Ohmart%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Ohmart moved to New York in 1955 where she worked as an understudy on Broadway. She had steady work in television until the early 1970s, with guest roles in ''[[Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[Ripcord (TV series)|Ripcord]]'', ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[Perry Mason]]'' [[Tombstone Territory]] and ''[[Barnaby Jones]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Film===
Dubbed a "female Brando" by the press,&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacon|first1=James|title=Female Bombshell|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5982668/the_daily_herald/|work=The Daily Herald|date=July 3, 1955|location=Utah, Provo|page=14|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=July 23, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramount Pictures]] signed her in 1955 and promoted her as the next [[Marilyn Monroe]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|2010|p=245}} Ohmart had top billing in ''[[The Scarlet Hour]]'', a Paramount film made by the distinguished director [[Michael Curtiz]] about a married woman who persuades her lover to commit a jewelry robbery.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Ohmart recalled of the film: "It was the wrong vehicle to launch me as a star. [[Frank Tashlin]], one of the film's three screenwriters, told me that it had been earlier turned down by [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Foolishly, Paramount let its new leading lady portray a lush, an adulteress wife and a suicide by the film's end."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; After nearly $2 million spent promoting her, Ohmart was released from her contract. She co-starred with [[Anthony Quinn]] in a 1956 crime drama, ''[[The Wild Party (1956 film)|The Wild Party]]''.{{sfn|Maltin|1994|p=1452}}

After marrying [[Wayde Preston]], she briefly retired from acting, only to return a year later, in films and television. Producer [[Jack M. Warner|Jack Warner]] offered her a supporting role in ''[[Born Reckless (1958 film)|Born Reckless]]'' (1958). Although she did not like the script, she took the role. One of her most noted roles was in [[William Castle]]'s ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959), playing a murderous wife.&lt;ref name="unlimited"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.briansdriveintheater.com/carolohmart.html|title=Carol Ohmart at Brian's Drive-In Theater|website=Briansdriveintheater.com|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, she returned to New York City to appear in an off-Broadway production titled ''Banderol''.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; This was followed by a supporting part in the [[Denis Sanders]]-directed ''[[One Man's Way]]'' (1964).&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Ohmart took a hiatus from appearing in films for several years, selling real estate and becoming involved in studying [[spiritualism]], and ended up in debt.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; In 1967, she appeared in the exploitation film ''Caxambu!'', followed by a lead role in the cult horror film ''[[Spider Baby]]''; according to director [[Jack Hill]], Ohmart was enthusiastic about the project, asking, "Do you think we can win an Academy Award for this?" Her last film role was in 1974's ''The Spectre of Edgar Allan Poe''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Personal life==
Ohmart married three times, most notably to actor [[Wade Preston]]. They wed in 1956 and were divorced in 1958.&lt;ref name=fga/&gt; Her first marriage, in 1949, was to actor Ken Grayson; it was annulled in 1951.&lt;ref name=fga&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=Laura|title=Carol Ohmart: "I've Found My Peace"|journal=Films of the Golden Age|date=Summer 2015|issue=81|pages=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, she married William Traberth in [[Wyoming]], a veteran and former firefighter, and retired in [[Sequim, Washington]], a suburb of Seattle.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; She changed her name to Kariomar S. Traberth, taking her husband's surname, and was guarded about her private life.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; 

Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Ohmart dedicated much of her time studying [[spiritualism]] and [[New Age]] philosophy, which served as a basis for various poems and short stories she wrote.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Around 1973, while filming an episode of ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'' in Los Angeles, Ohmart was attacked and beaten by three men on a street in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; After being discharged from the hospital over her injuries, Ohmart was prescribed pain killers, which marked the beginnings of a years-long addiction to prescription medication.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

In 1989, Ohmart agreed to be the subject of an extensive profile in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Rediscovering the Last Starlet : A mysterious phone call leads to Carol Ohmart|date=January 8, 1989|accessdate=February 22, 2018|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-08/entertainment/ca-255_1_carol-ohmart|author=Barrios, Gregg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the profile, Ohmart revealed that she had an estranged relationship with her mother, who did not know of her daughter's whereabouts for the last ten years of her life, up until her death in 1987. Ohmart recalled: {{quote|Until I became of legal age, I was terrorized. It was hammered into me that God's command was to love your mother or God will kill you...I forgave her, but I haven't forgotten. How could I? I tried to be a dutiful daughter, I wrote her all those (hundreds of) letters, but she never let me live my own life. She tried to live through me. I appreciated her supporting me during the lean years, but she wasn't doing it for me, it was for her own selfish ends, to keep me taking orders. She controlled my life.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;}}

==Death==
Ohmart died in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]] on January 1, 2002, aged 74, of natural causes.&lt;ref name="restingplaces"&gt;Wilson, Scott.

[[File:TB107 in 1900 or 1901.jpg|thumb|Her Majesty's Torpedo Boat 107, launched 1900 or 1901, that was to come under the command of Crawford]]
Captain '''Charles Wispington Glover Crawford''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (1873 – 16 October 1934) was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer who commanded the [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] flotilla of motor torpedo boats. In his spare time he was a noted [[philatelist]]. He signed the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abps.org.uk/Awards/Roll_of_Distinguished_Philatelists/RDP_Background_20111231_LR.pdf Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011]'', Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/6OlHSBOTl Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval career==
Crawford was educated for a naval career and joined the {{HMS|Britannia|1860|2}} at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in 1886. He became a [[midshipman]] on {{HMS|Northumberland|1866|6}} in 1888 and later that same year joined {{HMS|Canada|1881|6}} at [[Bermuda]]. In 1893 he became [[Lieutenant (Royal Navy)|lieutenant]], and in the middle of 1902 he was posted as first lieutenant and torpedo officer to the [[protected cruiser]] [[HMS Highflyer (1898)|HMS ''Highflyer'']], flag ship of the [[East Indies Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Saturday |date=5 July 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36812}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently attained the rank of [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] and in 1905 was given the command of a Royal Navy motor [[torpedo boat]] HMTB ''107'' launched in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/navy_list_1908_other_lists.htm Navy List 1908 Other Lists &amp;ndash; Crew Lists], battleships-cruisers.co.uk, retrieved 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford was also given command of the Devonport flotilla of the 160 footer torpedo boats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleetorganization.com/1906rntorpedoboats.html Torpedo Boats in Home Waters], RN June 1906, retrieved 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled widely and was in charge of [[wireless telegraphy]] in [[Somaliland]] in actions against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], known as the "Mad Mullah" by the British.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; He retired in 1910 but was recalled to active service on the outbreak of the First World War. He was involved with the landing of the naval division at [[Dunkirk]] and the evacuation of [[Ostend]] for which he was [[mentioned in dispatches]].&lt;ref name=LP&gt;"The Late Captain C.W.G. Crawford, C.B.E., R.N.", R.B.Y., ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. XLIII, No. 514, October 1934, pp. 205&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he was awarded the honour of being made a commander of the order of the British Empire in recognition of his work during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritishLGDecorations1919a.htm 31432 - 1 JULY 1919], Naval History.net, retrieved 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philately==
Crawford first became interested in stamps as a boy and formed a collection with his step-father. During his naval career he often sent stamps home from the various ports that he visited. His philatelic interests were broad but he was a particular expert on the stamps of the Australian States and New Zealand. He was elected to the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]] in June 1918 and was a member of their [[Philatelic expertisation|Expert Committee]]. He was convenor of the Queensland Reference List Committee who were charged with reporting on the [[Postage stamp paper|papers]], [[Stamp separation|perforations]] and [[Plating (philately)|plates]] of that territory.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;&lt;ref name=abps&gt;[http://www.abps.org.uk/Home/Who_Was_Who/index.xalter#C Who Was Who in British Philately], [[Association of British Philatelic Societies]], 2014. Retrieved 11 August 2014. [https://www.webcitation.org/5zDx9UBpl Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Crawford died at his home in [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]] on 16 October 1934 after having suffered two heart attacks in August of that year. He was buried at [[Morden Cemetery]] on 19 October and was survived by his wife.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;

'''Devon Harris''' (born 1964) is a [[Jamaica]]n retired [[bobsled]]der and military officer. He was one of the founding members of the [[Jamaica national bobsled team]], which first competed in the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].  Nicknamed "Pele" after the [[Pelé|famous football star]], Harris went on to compete in the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] and the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].

Harris grew up in the [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] ghetto of Sunrise Drive in Olympic Gardens (known as "Waterhouse," or "Firehouse," because it was a volatile area). A graduate of Drews Ave Primary School, Ardenne High School, and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], Harris had been an avid [[Association football|football]] player and [[track and field]] participant, with his dream being to represent Jamaica in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in the 800m and 1500m events.  Since the idea for a Jamaican Bobsled Team was pitched to the [[Jamaica Defence Force]], Harris, as a lieutenant in the Second Battalion, first came across the proposal in a weekly army publication called "Force Orders" in September 1987.  The text had called for those who wished to "undergo rigorous and dangerous training" to represent Jamaica in the Winter Olympics.  Harris initially thought the idea was ridiculous, but was eventually convinced to participate by his colonel, Lt. Col Alan Douglas.  At the team selections, Harris ended up with the fastest push time.

Harris returned to the military after Calgary and later became a civilian in 1992 after his second Olympics in Albertville, France. He  also competed in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He now works as a motivational public speaker and writer.

Harris wrote the 2008 children's book, ''Yes, I can! : the story of the Jamaican bobsled team'', illustrated by [[Ricardo Cortes (illustrator)|Ricardo Cortes]] and in 2010 published his semi-autobiographical motivational book; Keep On Pushing: Hot Lessons From Cool Runnings

In 2006, Harris founded the Keep On Pushing Foundation which supports the education of kids in disadvantaged communities

== Early life ==
Rehm was born in Washington, D.C. According to Rehm's [[autobiography]], ''Finding My Voice'', her father's family were [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians from Ottoman [[Mersin, Turkey|Mersin]], a city on the southern coast of [[Anatolia]]. According to Rehm, the family were [[Arabs]], and her mother was an educated woman who was fluent in both [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic]]. Rehm's father immigrated to America in 1911, following his older brothers. He returned to Mersin to marry her mother, but found that she and her family were living in [[Alexandria]], Egypt. He brought her to America in 1929; family memories of how the two met vary.&lt;ref name=FindingMyVoice&gt;{{cite book|last=Rehm|first=Diane|title=Finding My Voice|year=1999|publisher=Capital Books, Inc.|location=Herndon, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 interview in ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]'', she describes her father as coming from [[Beirut]], Lebanon.&lt;ref name=HarrisWashingtonian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Shane|title=What Made Me: NPR's Diane Rehm|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/what-made-me-nprs-diane-rehm/|accessdate=11 June 2015|work=[[Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehm attended William B. Powell Elementary and [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Washington D.C.)|Roosevelt High School]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Weeks" /&gt; Upon graduation, she was employed by the city's highways department, where she became a radio [[dispatcher]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Personal life ==
Rehm married John Rehm, her second husband, in 1959; he was working at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], she was working as a secretary.&lt;ref name="Rosenwald" /&gt; John Rehm died June 23, 2014 after he stopped eating and drinking to end his suffering from Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=john-b-rehm&amp;pid=171467459|title=JOHN B. REHM|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Rehm became a staunch advocate for [[medical aid in dying]], arguing that no one should suffer needlessly in the way that her husband did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/diane-rehm-my-husbands-slow-deliberate-death-was-unnecessary-n150096 |title=Diane Rehm: My Husband's Slow, Deliberate Death Was Unnecessary |work=[[NBC News]] |date=July 8, 2014 |first=Maggie |last=Fox |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/npr-host-diane-rehm-emerges-as-a-key-force-in-the-right-to-die-debate/2015/02/14/12b72230-ad50-11e4-9c91-e9d2f9fde644_story.html |title=NPR host Diane Rehm emerges as key force in the right-to-die debate |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 14, 2015 |first=Michael S. |last=Rosenwald |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has two adult children, David and Jennifer.&lt;ref name="Gatewood" /&gt;On October 14, 2017 Diane Rehm and John Hagedorn were married at the Washington National Cathedral. 

Rehm has [[spasmodic dysphonia]], a neurological condition that affects the quality of her voice.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weeks|first1=Linton|title=Diane Rehm finds a voice of her own|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/daily/rehm0823.htm|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Rehm began her radio career in 1973&lt;ref name="Gatewood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkwomen.com/0904/coverstory/0904_coverstory.html |title=Networking: Whos Whos, Whats What for Business Executives, "The Diane Rehm Show," A WOMAN'S VOICE |publisher=Networking Magazine |author=Gatewood, Miranda |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328080345/http://www.networkwomen.com/0904/coverstory/0904_coverstory.html |archivedate=March 28, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a volunteer for WAMU's ''The Home Show.'' In 1979, she took over as the host of WAMU's morning talk show, ''Kaleidoscope'', which was renamed ''The Diane Rehm Show'' in 1984.

Rehm has interviewed many political and cultural figures, including [[John McCain]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Madeleine Albright]]. She has said that her most touching interview was with [[Fred Rogers]] of the [[PBS]] program ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', conducted just before his death.&lt;ref name="Gatewood" /&gt; Rehm has described her interviews with [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] to have been "amazing experiences."&lt;ref name="Ruben"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rehm is the queen of talk radio |publisher=The Beacon |date=January 2010 |author=Ruben, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written three autobiographical books. The first, ''Finding My Voice'', dealt with her traditional upbringing in a [[Christian Arab]] household, her brief first marriage and divorce, her 50-year marriage to John Rehm, raising her children, the first 20 years of her radio career, and her battles with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[osteoporosis]], and [[spasmodic dysphonia]].&lt;ref name="wamu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wamu.org/programs/dr/diane_rehm/finding_my_voice.php |title=The Diane Rehm Show: Finding My Voice |publisher=WAMU 88.5 FM, American University Radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812140031/http://www.wamu.org/programs/dr/diane_rehm/finding_my_voice.php |archivedate=August 12, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with John Rehm she co-wrote ''Toward Commitment: A Dialogue about Marriage'', which was published in 2002.

National Public Radio. December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporation for Public Broadcasting report ==
In 2005, a private study funded by the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] reported that Rehm booked 22 [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] guests for every 5 [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] guests.  The study was criticized as a politicized attempt to, in Rehm's word, "scare" journalists with the accusation of [[liberal bias]]. One criticism of the study concerned its criteria of what constituted "liberal" – a category which included seemingly moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] such as Senator [[Chuck Hagel]] and former Representative [[Bob Barr]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063002029.html |title=CPB Liberal Bias Study Flawed, Critics Say |website=Washingtonpost.com |date=July 1, 2005|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was commissioned by [[Kenneth Tomlinson]], whose appointment to the chairmanship of the CPB by George W. Bush had been criticized by liberals as politically motivated. Tomlinson hired Indiana consultant [[Frederick W. Mann]], a conservative thinker previously associated with the [[Young America's Foundation]], which has described itself as "the principal outreach organization of the Conservative Movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/node/868 |title=Kenneth Tomlinson &amp; the Mann Report |website=Project for Excellence in Journalism|date=March 13, 2006|accessdate=May 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509160659/http://journalism.org/node/868 |archivedate=May 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on the study by the CPB's Inspector General, Kenneth Konz, criticized Tomlinson's methods; the report led to Tomlinson's immediate resignation in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110302235.html |title=Kenneth Tomlinson Quits Public Broadcasting Board |website=Washingtonpost.com |date=2005-11-04 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Rehm personally "called Mann's findings 'unprofessional and simplistic.'  [and] added 'I've been booking shows for 25 years. I don't think they have any idea what it takes to achieve the professionalism and expertise and the right people to express a variety of points of view. . . . What [Kenneth Tomlinson]'s doing, I think, is trying to scare public broadcasters.' "&lt;ref name="Washington Post" /&gt;

== Documentaries ==
Rehm has been featured in three political [[Documentary film|movie documentaries]]: ''[[Man from Plains|Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains]]'', ''[[I.O.U.S.A.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2274266/ |title=Diane Rehm |author= |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dinesh D'Souza|Dinesh D'Souza's]] ''[[2016: Obama's America]]'' which used her quote, "And then you've got the cover of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, a cover story by Dinesh D'Souza.  I think nothing has turned my stomach so much in recent years as reading that piece."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2010-09-17/news-roundup-hour-1/transcript |title=News Roundup: Hour 1 |author= |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
===2015 Bernie Sanders interview===
On June 10, 2015, Rehm interviewed [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]], and stated that Sanders had [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] with [[Israel]]; this was not true.&lt;ref name="DHarsanyiFed06102015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harsanyi |first=David |date=June 10, 2015 |title=NPR's Diane Rehm Has A List Of Troublesome Jews She Wants You To Know About |url=http://thefederalist.com/2015/06/10/nprs-diane-rehm-has-a-list-of-troublesome-jews-she-wants-you-to-know-about/ |newspaper=[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]] |location=[[Alexandria, Virginia]] |access-date=June 10, 2015 |quote=Much like the "Israel-firster" attack, assuming that people who support Israel must be in possession of dual citizenship is a longstanding smear used by anti-Semites and other anti-Israel advocates to chill speech and question the allegiance of American Jews.

Rehm apologized for her exchange with Sanders in a statement released later that day. "On today's show I made a mistake. Rather than asking if Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders whether he had dual U.S./Israeli citizenship, as I had read in a comment on Facebook, I stated it as fact. I want to apologize as well to all our listeners for having made an erroneous statement. I am sorry for the mistake.

'''Dieter Martin Gruen''' (born November 21, 1922)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/dieter-gruens-interview Manhattan Project Voices: Dieter Gruen's Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; is a German-born American scientist, who was a senior member of the [[Materials Science]] Division at [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. He received [[B.S.]] (1944, cum laude) and [[M.S.]] (1947) degrees in chemistry from [[Northwestern University]] and the [[Ph.D.]] (1951) in [[chemical physics]] from the [[University of Chicago]].

Gruen made contributions in a broad range of topics in the chemistry of materials: the definitive establishment of the [[Electron configuration|5f]] character of the [[actinides]] by the measurement and [[ligand]] field interpretation of [[magnetic]] moments at low temperatures; the creation of a solution chemistry in [[fused salt]]s using [[spectroscopy]] to determine [[oxidation]] states, complex [[ion]]s, and coordination equilibria of transition metal ions; the elucidation of the interactions of reactive [[molecular]] and atomic species with [[noble gas]] matrixes; the rational design of metal [[alloy]] [[hydrides]] for energy storage and heat pump applications; the determination of the energetics and depth of origin of sputtered species; ultrasensitive detection of atoms and molecules using laser [[Fluorescence]] and [[resonance]] ionization [[mass spectrometry]]; the discovery and development of a new chemical vapor deposition process for the synthesis of phase-pure [[nanocrystalline]] diamond films.

==Early career==

Shortly after receiving the [[baccalaureate degree]], Gruen joined the team engaged in the large-scale electromagnetic separation of [[uranium-235]], which was a part of the [[Manhattan Project]] during the [[second World War]].

The safe management of fission energy depends in large part on a knowledge of the chemical properties of the actinide elements, many of which are man-made. Gruen contributed seminal studies that led to a detailed elucidation of the 5f electronic structure of several of these elements, using low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. In order to investigate the range and stability of the oxidation states of actinide and other transition elements in fused salt solutions, he pioneered the field of absorption spectroscopy in high-temperature liquids. A novel solution chemistry was discovered that led, for example, to an understanding, on the basis of ligand field theory, of complex ions and coordination complexes in these highly ionic liquids. The approach introduced by Gruen was fruitful not only in helping to provide a fundamental understanding of fused salt chemistry, but also in its implications for the eventual development of a [[homogeneous]] [[thermal]] breeder reactor based on fused salt solutions containing the relatively plentiful element [[thorium]]. Such a development would constitute an energy supply for the indefinite future.

Gruen went on to explore many high-temperature [[gaseous species]] by using a variety of techniques, including matrix isolation spectroscopy methods. Closed-cycle refrigerators were first introduced by him for these investigations, which gave detailed insight into guest [[molecule]] and guest atom-noble gas matrix interactions.

==Solar energy==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2013}}
In order to convert solar energy efficiently, a variety of approaches are being developed. The one chosen by Gruen was a [[heat pump]] driven by solar energy inputs. A novel concept was elaborated, which utilized a pair of metal [[alloy]] hydrides whose hydrogen dissociation temperatures could be adjusted by varying the alloy composition. This, as all of Gruen's work, was motivated by a desire to achieve fundamental understanding, in this case of the science underlying the heats of formation of alloy hydrides. The specific problem to which the basic knowledge was applied, namely the actual operation of a hydride heat pump demonstrated that solar inputs at modest temperature can be used for space heating and air conditioning. The synthesis of the metal alloy hydrides provided an early example of a field that has come to be known as "materials by design."

==Fusion  research==
Gruen became interested in the challenging materials problems associated with attempts to harness here on earth the fusion reactions that power the sun. Among these problems is the introduction of metal impurities into the [[thermonuclear plasma]] by sputtering processes of the metal walls surrounding the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. He conceived the idea of using laser fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the kind and quantity of sputtered metal atoms and to gain fundamental insights into the energetics and depth of origin of the sputtered species. The basic findings emanating from these experiments made possible the use of laser fluorescence as a powerful plasma diagnostic technique. These early laser fluorescence methods evolved under his leadership into a highly sensitive new surface science technique called [[SARISA]]: Surface Analysis by Resonance Ionization of Sputtered Atoms. Recent measurements using an advanced form of this apparatus have been made by his colleague [[Michael J. Pellin]] (B.S., Northwestern University; Ph.D., University of Illinois). These have yielded isotope [[ratio]]s of heavy elements in [[presolar]] SiC grains found in [[meteorite]]s, data that are important for an understanding of the origin of the presolar [[nebula]] from which the sun condensed five billion years ago.

==Diamond films==
Gruen conceived, starting in 1991, a radically new method for making diamond films by a [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) process that does not require the use of atomic hydrogen in contradistinction to traditional CVD methods that do. By fragmenting fullerene molecules (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) in noble-gas microwave discharges, he was able to produce the carbon dimer, C2, a new nucleation and growth species, which condenses to form nanocrystalline diamond films. This unique material has been shown by Gruen and his colleagues to be extraordinarily useful in a number of tribological, microelectronic, and telecommunication applications, many of which will lead to substantial energy savings.

Certain classes of meteorites ([[carbonaceous chondrite]]s) also contain substantial amounts of presolar nanocrystalline diamond grains. It is possible that the carbon dimmer nucleation and growth mechanism experimentally and theoretically established by Gruen and his colleagues was also operative in the presolar nebula and thus was involved in the formation of the diamond grains found in meteorites. Indeed, the cosmic synthesis of nanocrystalline diamond may be occurring today in so-called [[protoplanetary nebulae]], a relatively brief stage in the evolution of [[red-giant star]]s, which our own sun will enter in the far distant future.

==Memberships==
Gruen was a visiting scientist at the invitation of [[Nobel laureate]] [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]], a delegate to the [[United Nations Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy]], and a visiting professor at both the [[Norwegian Technical University]] and the [[Hebrew University]]. He was on the board of the [[Seaborg Institute for Transactinium Science]] and on visiting committees for the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]. He has been on the editorial boards of the [[Annual Review of Materials Science]], the [[Journal of Applied Physics]], and [[Applied Physics Letters]]. Gruen is a frequently invited lecturer at national and international conferences and has been the organizer of numerous conferences and symposia. Gruen is the author or co- author of more than 350 publications and editor of several books and monographs. He holds approximately 30 U.S. patents. Among those that have been licensed are some in the nanocrystalline diamond film area and one concerning the use of intense ultraviolet laser radiation for the ablation of biological tissue. The process is used worldwide for the treatment of certain [[cardiovascular]] diseases.

==Personal life==
Gruen's wife Dolores, a psychologist who received her Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]], died on March 19, 2015, at the age of 90.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?pid=174441368&lt;/ref&gt; The Gruens had been married for 66 years at the time of her death. Dr. Gruen has two daughters, Erica and Karen, and a son, Jeffery. Dr. Gruen also has nine grandchildren (Daniel, Miriam, Anna, Lev, Zohara, Micah, Aleya, Benjamin, and Moshe Aaron) and one great-grandchild, Julia Devorah.

'''Timoteo "Dino" Saluzzi''' (born May 20, 1935 Campo Santo, [[Salta Province]], Argentina) is an Argentinian bandoneon player. He is the son of [[Cayetano Saluzzi]]&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=dino-saluzzi-p7475/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Dino Saluzzi: Biography |first=Steve |last=Leggett |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate =16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the father of guitarist [[José Maria Saluzzi]].&lt;ref name=discogs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/328170-Dino-Saluzzi |title=Dino Saluzzi |work=Discography |publisher=[[Discogs.com]] |accessdate=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Dino played the [[bandoneón]] since his childhood. Other than his father, he was influenced by Salta musicians such as Cuchi Leguizamón, and by the lyrical strain of the [[tango music|tango]] of Francisco de Caro and Agustin Bardi. Dino described the vividness of his musical sketches as "an imaginary return" to the little towns and villages of his childhood.

For much of his youth, Saluzzi lived in [[Buenos Aires]], playing with the Radio El Mundo orchestra.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; He would play in orchestras for a living, while touring with smaller, sometimes jazz-oriented ensembles, developing a personal style that made him a leading bandoneonist in Argentine folklore and avant-garde music (especially since [[Ástor Piazzolla]] did not participate in projects other than his own). His record career doesn't start until the 70s, along with [[Gato Barbieri]], when he signed a couple of crazy lyricism albums under the name of Gaucho. Over this decade, he worked on many tours in South America and specially in Japan, but always associated to other names, as [[Mariano Mores]] or Enrique Mario Franchini.

Through word-of mouth publicity (mostly from expatriate musicians) he was invited to several [[Europe]]an music festivals, and landed a contract with the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label. Several records have resulted, including ''Kultrum'', 1982. From the beginning of the 1980s onwards, there were collaborations with European and American jazz musicians including [[Charlie Haden]], [[Tomasz Stanko]], [[Charlie Mariano]], [[Palle Danielsson]], and [[Al Di Meola]].

ECM brought Saluzzi together with Charlie Haden, [[Palle Mikkelborg]] and [[Pierre Favre]] for ''Once Upon A Time ... Far Away In The South'', and subsequently with [[Enrico Rava]] for ''Volver''. Rava had worked extensively in Argentina, and Haden's sympathy for Latin American music was well-known; furthermore Palle Mikkelborg and Dino Saluzzi had worked together productively in [[George Gruntz]]'s band: there was a common ground on which an artistic exchange of ideas could take place. Saluzzi later played with 'Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra', and the 'Rava Saluzzi Quintet' also toured.

In 1991, Saluzzi recorded an album with his brothers Felix and Celso and his son José María on [[guitar]], kicking off his "family project", which has since toured many countries. ''Mojotoro'' drew upon the full range of South American musics: tango, folk, candina music, candombe, the milonga music of the la Pampa province...

Anja Lechner and Dino have toured widely as a duo, too and US jazz magazine "Down Beat" declares the album that recorded together, ''Ojos Negros'' album of the year (best of 2007 list).

Dino Saluzzi symphonic works were presented with Anja Lechner and Metropole Orkest at Muziekgebouw, Amsterdam in February, 2009. Soloist: Dino Saluzzi - bandoneon; Guest: Anja Lechner - cello; Conductor: Jules Buckley.

'''Dositheos''' (occasionally also known as '''Nathanael''',&lt;ref&gt;William Benjamin Smith, "The Meaning of the Epithet Nazorean", ''Monist'' XV:27, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; both meaning "gift of God") was a [[Samaritan]] religious leader, founder of a Samaritan sect, often assumed to be a [[gnostic]]. He is reputed to have known [[John the Baptist]], and been the teacher of [[Simon Magus]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Dead Sea Scrolls and Prmitive Christianity", [[Jean Danielou]], p. 95-96, 1958, Mentor edition 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian and Jewish sources==

He lived probably in the first century of the common era. According to [[Pseudo-Tertullian]],&lt;ref&gt;"Adversus Omnes Hæreses," i.&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first to deny the [[Prophet]]s, a heresy that gave rise to the party of the [[Sadducees]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Jerome]] gives the same account.&lt;ref&gt;"Contra Luciferianos," xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippolytus I]] begins his enumeration of the 32 heresies by mentioning Dositheos; hence the sect is made to appear older than the Sadducees,&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Clement of Rome]], "Recognitiones," i. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the heresy is based the system of [[Philastrius|Philaster]].&lt;ref&gt;"De Hæresibus," §§ 4, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not mentioned by the two early patristic authors [[Justin Martyr]] or [[Irenaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Dositheans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samaritan chronicler [[Abu al-Fatḥ]] of the fourteenth century, who used reliable native sources, places the origin of the Dosithean sect in the time before [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Abu al-Fath," Annales," ed. [[Eduard Vilmar]], 1865, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The rabbinical sources also&lt;ref&gt;Tan., Wayesheb, 2; Pirḳe R. El. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; contain obscure references to Dositheos and [[Sabbæus]] as the two founders respectively of the Samaritan sects of the Dositheans and [[Sabuæans]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], "Hæres." 11, 12, 13 [14].&lt;/ref&gt; These have been identified with the Samaritans Sabbæeus and Theodosius, of whom [[Josephus]] relates&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." xiii. 3, § 4; compare "Chronicon Paschale," in [[Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', xcii. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; that they defended before the Egyptian king [[Ptolemæus Philometor]], against [[Andronicus ben Meshullam|Andronicus]], the advocate of the Jews, the sanctity of [[Mt. Gerizim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Graetz|Grätz]], "Gesch." 4th ed., iii. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samaritan chronicles (the ''Book of Joshua'' and Abu al-Fath's ''Annales'') recount a similar discussion between [[Zerubbabel]] and [[Sanballat the Horonite|Sanballat]]. As Josephus says that the Samaritans had two advocates, he doubtless meant the two apostles Dositheus and Sabbæus, whose doctrine, including the sanctity of Mt. Gerizim, rejection of the prophetical books of the [[Old Testament]] and denial of the resurrection, was on the whole identical with that of the Samaritans.

According to [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]],&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', iv. 22, § 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Dositheus lived later than Simon Magus, the first heresiarch of the Church; other authors speak of him as the teacher of Simon,&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Rome, l.c. ii. 8; several passages in [[Origen]]; Epiphanius, l.c.&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time confounding him with Simon Magus, connecting his name with Helena, and stating that he was the "being".&lt;ref&gt;ἑστώς = "stans".&lt;/ref&gt; Origen says that Dositheus pretended to be the Christ (Messiah), applying {{bibleref|Deut|18:15|49}} to himself, and he compares him with [[Theudas]] and [[Judas the Galilean]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Contra Celsum," i. 57, vi. 11; in Matth. Comm. ser. xxxiii.; "Homil." xxv. in Lucam; "De Principiis," iv. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Origen also says that Dositheus' disciples pretended to possess books by him, and related concerning him that he never suffered death, but was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;"In Joann." xiii. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; To this must be compared the story of Epiphanius&lt;ref&gt;"Hæres." 13.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding his death by starvation in a cave. Epiphanius adds that while some of the Dositheans lead loose lives, others preserve a rigid morality, refrain from the use of meat, observe the rite of [[circumcision]], and are very strict in keeping the Sabbath and in observing the laws of [[Levitical purity]]. These statements may, however, refer to another Dositheus, who belonged to the [[Encratites]].&lt;ref&gt;Harnack, "Gesch. der Altchristlichen Litteratur bis Eusebius," i. 152, Leipsic, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;

Origen says&lt;ref&gt;"Contra Celsum," vi. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; that the Dositheans were never in a flourishing state and that in his time, they had almost entirely disappeared, scarcely thirty of them being left. The [[Midrash]], however, speaks of Dositheans, with whom [[Rabbi Meïr]] had dealings,&lt;ref&gt;Pesiḳ., ed. Buber, 59b. Pesiḳ. R. 16; Midr. Mishle xiii. 25, Yalḳuṭ § 950.&lt;/ref&gt; and two names, "Dosion and Dosthion," are also mentioned,&lt;ref&gt;Ab. R. N., ed. Schechter, p. 37; compare "Shibbole ha-Leḳeṭ," ed. Buber, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; which either refer to two Dosithean sectarians or form a double designation for the heretic Dositheus. Yet the fact that the patriarch [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] (who probably lived 582-603) disputed successfully against the Samaritan followers of Dostan (Δοσϑήν) or Dositheus, and wrote a work expressly against them ([[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], "Bibliotheca," cod. 230), shows that the Dositheans existed and even exercised a certain power in the sixth century. Origen possibly refers to a Christian sect of the Dositheans, who in fact left no traces, while the Samaritan sect certainly continued to exist. In Egypt especially, the sect was probably numerous enough to induce the Christian patriarch of Alexandria to engage in polemics against it.

==Arabic sources==

In Egypt the Arabic writers may have become acquainted with the Dositheans, though some may have survived also in Syria and Palestine, as is evident from the rabbinical sources. [[Al-Masudi]], of the tenth century, says that the Samaritans were divided into two sects, that of the Kushan, or ordinary Samaritans (="Kuthim"), and that of the Dostan (Dositheans; compare Δοσϑήν). [[Al-Shahrastani]] &lt;ref&gt;ed. Cureton, i 170; Haarbrücker's transl., i. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; calls them "Kusaniyyah" and "Dusitaniyyah." Abu al-Fatḥ&lt;ref&gt;l.c.; compare p. 151, and "Chronique Samaritaine," ed. Neubauer, p. 21, Paris, 1873, "Dosthis".&lt;/ref&gt; says of the Dostan, the Samaritan Dositheans, that they abolished the festivals instituted by the Mosaic law, as well as the astronomical tables, counting thirty days in every month, without variation. It reminds one of the Sadducees,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Geiger]], "Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel," p. 149; see [[Judah Hadassi]], "Eshkol ha-Kofer," § 97.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a further proof that the Dositheans were their spiritual descendants. The statement that the festivals were abolished, probably means that the Dositheans celebrated them on other days than the Jews; but as, according to a trustworthy statement of Epiphanius, the Dositheans celebrated the festivals together with the Pharisaic Jews, an approximation may well be assumed toward the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], a sect with which the Samaritans had much in common in later times. The determination of the months by means of the testimony of witnesses may also have been a Karaite custom although that practise may go back to a time before the opposite view of the Pharisees existed. 

Under the [[Abbasid]] califs the Samaritans persecuted the Dositheans, although they themselves had to suffer much. Under Ibrahim (218-227 of the Hegira) the synagogue of the Samaritans and Dositheans at Nablus was burned by heretics, but it was subsequently rebuilt. [[Yusuf ibn Dasi]], governor of Palestine, entirely forbade the worship of the Dositheans; and the sect may in consequence have been absorbed by the Samaritans.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lowy, ''The Principles of Samaritan Bible Exegesis'' (1977), pp. 260-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund Gurney''' (23 March 1847 &amp;ndash; 23 June 1888) was an [[England|English]] [[psychologist]] and  [[parapsychologist]]. At the time the term for research of paranormal activities was "psychical research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Gurney, Edmund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Gurney was born at [[Hersham]], near [[Walton-on-Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], from 1866, where he took fourth place in the classical tripos and obtained a fellowship in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GNY864E|name=Gurney, Edmund}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work for the tripos was done, said his friend [[Frederic William Henry Myers|F. W. H. Myers]], in the intervals of his practice on the piano.  Dissatisfied with his own executive skill as a musician, he wrote ''The Power of Sound'' (1880), an essay on the philosophy of music.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) pp.29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

He then studied medicine with no intention of practising, devoting himself to physics, chemistry and physiology. In 1880 he passed the second M.B. Cambridge (medical science).&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881 he began the study of law at [[Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref name="Hall 1964 p.35"&gt;Hall (1964) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to [[Parapsychology|psychical research]], he asked whether there is an unexplored region of human faculty transcending the normal limitations of sensible knowledge. Gurney's purpose was to approach the subject by observation and experiment, especially in the [[hypnotism]] field. He wanted to investigate the persistence of the conscious human personality after the death of the body. Three of his sisters died when their barge overturned in the [[Nile River]] during a tour of [[Egypt]] in 1875. Their passing profoundly affected him and his research was partially fueled by a desire to find some meaning to their deaths.

==Experimental work==

Gurney began at what he later saw was the wrong end by studying, with Myers, the [[séance]]s of professed spiritualistic mediums (1874–1878). Little but detection of imposture came of this. In 1882 the [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded. Paid mediums were discarded, at least for the time, and experiments were made in [[telepathy|thought-transference]] and hypnotism. Personal evidence as to uninduced [[hallucination]]s was also collected. 

The first results are embodied in the volumes of ''[[Phantasms of the Living]]'', a vast collection ([[Frank Podmore]], Myers and Gurney), and in Gurney's essay, ''Hallucinations''. Evidence for the process called telepathy was supposed to be established by the experiments chronicled in the ''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research'', and it was argued that similar experiences occurred spontaneously, as, for example, in the many recorded instances of deathbed [[Wraith (entity)|wraith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Burnett Tylor|Tylor]], ''Primitive Culture'', i. chapter xi., especially pp. 449-450, 1873. [[Andrew Lang|Lang]], ''Making of Religion'', pp. 120-124, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The dying man was supposed to convey the hallucination of his presence as one living person experimentally conveys his thought to another, by thought-transference.

Gurney's hypnotic experiments were undertaken in the years 1885 to 1888. Their tendency was, in Myers's view, to prove that there is sometimes, in the induction of hypnotic phenomena, some agency at work which is neither ordinary nervous stimulation nor suggestion conveyed by any ordinary channel to the subject's mind. These results, if accepted, would corroborate the idea of [[telepathy]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gurney, ''Hypnotism and Telepathy'', ''Proceedings S. P. R.'' vol. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments by [[Joseph Gibert]], [[Paul Janet]], [[Charles Richet]], Méricourt and others were cited as tending in the same direction.

Other experiments dealt with the relation of the memory in the hypnotic state to the memory in another hypnotic state, and of both to the normal memory. Gurney's research into psychic matters was respected by contemporaries.  However, it has since then been argued to be deeply flawed: Gurney trusted in the assistance of one [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]], a theatrical performer and producer.  Smith was the one handling the actual experiments into telepathy, hypnotism, and the rest, and Gurney fully accepted his results.  According to Hall, in the spring of 1888 Gurney discovered that Smith had used his knowledge of theatrical trickery and stage illusion to fake tests and results; so that the value of the tests (with which Gurney was building up his reputation) were worthless.  [[Douglas Blackburn]], Smith's principal partner in the mentalist performances&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; and experiments, publicly admitted fraud in 1908 and again in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) pp.120-121&lt;/ref&gt; although Smith denied it.&lt;ref name=oppenheim144/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) pp.122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

He died at [[Brighton]] on 23 June 1888, from the effects of an overdose of [[chloroform]].  At the inquest [[Arthur Thomas Myers]], the brother of F.W.H. Myers, testified to having prescribed chloroform for [[neuralgia]],&lt;ref name=oppenheim144&gt;Oppenheim (1985) p.144&lt;/ref&gt; and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.&lt;ref name=doctorz/&gt;  It was widely thought at the time that Gurney might have committed suicide,&lt;ref name=doctorz&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hughlings Jackson's Dr Z: the paradigm of temporal lobe epilepsy revealed | first1=David C. | last1=Taylor | first2=Susan M. | last2=March | journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]] | year=1980 | volume=43 | pages=758–767 | url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/43/9/758.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1136/jnnp.43.9.758 | pmc=490665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alice James]] recorded this in her diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=William and Henry James: selected letters | author1=William James | author2=Henry James | editor1=Elizabeth M.

==Works==
In addition to his work on music and his psychological writings, he was the author of ''Tertium Quid'' (1887), a collection of essays,&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; the title a protest against one-sided ideas and methods of discussion.&lt;ref name="Epperson 1997 p.20"&gt;Epperson (1997) p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1877 Gurney married Kate Sara Sibley.&lt;ref name="Epperson 1997 p.20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1964) p.33&lt;/ref&gt;  They had one daughter, Helen, born in 1881.&lt;ref name="Hall 1964 p.35"/&gt;  After Gurney's death, Kate married [[Archibald Grove]], a journalist and politician, in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Epperson (1997) p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Men and Women of the Time.

==Background and development==
The Gormogon was introduced as a [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]] in the third-season premiere, "[[The Widow's Son in the Windshield]]", and has made appearances in the form of teeth marks on bones examined by the Jeffersonian scientists. He makes his first on-screen appearance in "[[The Knight on the Grid]]" (episode 8), although his former master, Arthur Graves, appears earlier in that episode, and his late [[apprentice]], Jason Harkness ([[Andrew James Allen]]), appeared in the season premiere. Before the season finale "The Pain in the Heart", reviewers and fans speculated that the audience has actually already met him, perhaps being [[psychologist]] [[Lance Sweets|Dr. Lance Sweets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=West|first1=Abby|title=Bones: Will the real Gormogon killer please stand up?|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2007/11/bones-mini-tv-1.html|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228041830/http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2007/11/bones-mini-tv-1.html|archivedate=December 28, 2008|date=November 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief was partially validated later in the season when the show's [[executive producer]], [[Hart Hanson]], stated in an interview with [[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]] suggested that either the Gormogon or his apprentice is someone the fans are fond of.  In the season finale, this statement is confirmed when [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|Dr. Brennan]] finds that [[Zack Addy]] had lied about some of his earlier conclusions, leading [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|Dr. Brennan]] and [[Seeley Booth|Agent Seeley Booth]] to realize that Zack must be the apprentice.  The team finally tracks down the Gormogon with the information provided by Zack as to the location of the Gormogon's home, and Booth kills him; he has not been given a name, and he has been described by Sweets as "a nobody, an invisible man, angry at history for not seeing him". The [[stunt performer]] — Laurence Todd Rosenthal — who played the current (and presumably last) Gormogon, went uncredited; the character had no spoken dialogue and appeared on screen only briefly.

==Modus operandi==
When particles left on a victim's skull led [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|Dr. Temperance Brennan]] and [[Seeley Booth]] to a [[bank vault|vault]] in an old bank, they discover tapestries, paintings, books, and other artifacts related to a number of mystical orders and traditions, including [[Kabbalah]], [[Freemasonry]], and [[Gnosticism]]. One of these tapestries included the imagery of the wolf, a symbol of freedom and power, which reflected in the killer's dentures, which were made exclusively with real canine teeth only (canines being symbolic of the wolf). The key feature of the vault is a silver skeleton arranged in a "widow's son" pose, a position known to the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] as one of sacrifice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Parts of the silver skeleton had been replaced with actual bone, which bear teeth marks from two different individuals, suggesting [[endocannibalism|ritualistic consumption of flesh]]. The vault also yields a tapestry whose pattern corresponds to specific locations in [[Washington, D.C.]] and to [[tarot cards]] showing different [[archetypes]], such as the Musician, the Bishop, and the Corruptor. The map provides a [[schematic]] for the Gormogon's activities, including the atomic location of the sculpture and of another, older sculpture and the residence of the Gormogon's old master, and the order of archetypes which are being integrated, via their bones, into the sculpture.

==Inspiration==
The [[Gormogons]] were an anti-[[Freemasonry|Masonic]] order of the 18th century. They are mentioned in scattered writings of the era, and accusations of association with them may have been used as a political weapon, as the very existence of the order involved a rejection of Masonic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gormogons|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/gormogons.html|website=Grand Lodge of British Colombia and Yukon|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only the name has any relevance on the show, as [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Hodgins]] borrows it to refer to the killer for his dual reverence for and apparent dislike of secret societies and fraternal orders, including the [[Knights of Columbus]]. Hodgins' and Sweets' understanding of typical practices among orders, such as the master-apprentice relationship, ritualistic meals, and [[sacred geometry]] inform the ongoing investigation of the murders.

==Known victims==
Two skeleton sculptures have been found, one of which was constructed by Arthur Graves and the current Gormogon, the other by Jason Harkness and the current Gormogon. The former was completely made of bone, while the latter was still mostly [[silver]]. Not all the victims have yet been identified, but at least one bone in each sculpture was added for its significance to its owner. The three victims named below all lost their fathers at young ages, making them "widows' sons" and thus doubly symbolic as a sacrifice to the Gormogon. They were all involved with a trip to the Anatolian region of [[Turkey]], and associated with the [[Knights of Columbus]].
* Gavin Nichols, a violinist. His little finger, essential for his art, is added to the silver skeleton, and he corresponds to the Musician tarot card on the Gormogon's schematic.
* Father Douglas Cooper, a bishop. His kneecaps, essential in prayer, are added (by Brennan) to the silver skeleton, and he corresponds to the Bishop tarot card on the Gormogon's schematic.
* Mr. Porter, a lobbyist. As would be expected judging by his profession, his [[human mandible|mandible]], being a component associated with speech, is sent to Brennan. He corresponds to the Corruptor tarot card on the Gormogon's schematic.  When Dr. Addy is revealed as the current apprentice of the Gormogon, it is established that ''he'' had killed Porter.  Later on in the fourth season, it is revealed that Zack is, in fact, ''not'' the original killer, but an "accessory" to the killing. Porter's actual killer is the Gormogon's second apprentice, who the Gormogon had killed before recruiting Zack, contrary to Zack admitting to the murder in the season 3 finale. In season 12's "The Day in the Life", Zack is exonerated for his murder by the Jeffersonian team.
* The Apprentice, the Gormogon's apprentice before Zack. Murdered by the Gormogon to make way for Zack to take his place as "there can only ever be two." His body was eventually located in "The Steal in the Wheels" and used to exonerate Zack for the murder of Mr. Porter.
* An unnamed [[SWAT]] officer, potentially. When Booth and SWAT stormed the Gormogon's home, he threw a knife into the officer's chest, apparently killing (or at least wounding) him.
* An unknown victim. When Booth and SWAT stormed the Gormogon's home, he was seen eating a piece of meat, which was most likely human. Zack told them that if they smelled meat cooking, it would mean the Gormogon had claimed another victim. The identity of this person has not been revealed.

* 3.01 – "The Widow's Son in the Windshield"
* 3.04 - "The Secret in the Soil" (Hodgins mentions 'German guy' responsible for 'Widow's Son killings' and Zack asks for more details)

'''Herve Yamguen''' (born 1971 in [[Douala]]) is a [[Cameroon]]ian [[Painting|painter]] and [[sculptor]].
Autodidact, he launched himself in painting, sculpture and he discovered a passion for the writing which enables him to wonder about its daily live. He currently works on plays.

He grew in Douala where he lives and works in one of the most popular districts of the city, ''New Bell''. It is this environment which nourishes the imaginary of Hervé whose plastic work turns around the face, the body and the place of it in the world.

== Works ==
[[File:Hervé Yamguen.JPG|thumb|Hervé Yamguen,''oublie ton corps à la vie'', 2007]]
Herve Yamguen was born into a family with deeply rooted traditions, who initially refused to accept his choice to become an artist. From childhood, he was attracted by the way in which artists interpret reality in their works. He realizes that ''making art'' guides one out of ignorance and lets one wonder about the human being. He started painting at the age of 17 and fully embraces the profession of artist by the late 1980s, after refusing to enter the monastery. After that his family encouraged him to continue on his path of artist.
Self-taught, he learned by reading about art history, which led him to develop his singular vision of art. Subsequently, he received a year of training (2000-2001) at [[École des Arts Décoratifs]] (ESAD) in Strasbourg, France. He has done many study and production residencies in Cameroon and abroad.

Hervé Yamguen is also known for his writing (several publications) about the [[visual art]]s (drawing, painting, sculpture). He has made a few forays into photography, performance, installation and has regularly done stage designs for the theater. The themes present in his work are [[eroticism]], the questioning of the human-plant-animal and bird. Through these themes,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iam-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_MAGAZINE_01_CAMEROON_SAMPLER.pdf|format=PDF|title=Intense Art Magazine|website=Iam-africa.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he tells the story of humans and invites one to look at life with wonder; the small details of daily life that represent the beauty of the world and make life more pleasurable. Yamguen is inspired by the work (technical, power of the work, style) of several writers and artists who work on wonder, whimsy and imagination: [[Matisse]], [[Picasso]], [[Henri Michaud]], and the surrealist poets. The artist wants to invite the public to reflect on his humanity in order to become better.
According to him, the reception of his work is not enthusiastic: either it is too risqué or inaccessible.

Hervé Yamguen is one of the members of the Cercle Kapsiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eternalnetwork.org/scenographiesurbaines/index.php?cat=doualacollectif|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113222847/http://www.eternalnetwork.org/scenographiesurbaines/index.php?cat=doualacollectif|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-11-13|title=eternalnetwork.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the cercle, it took part in Scénographies Urbaines, (Urban Scenographies) in January 2003, a project born from the meeting of Cameroonian artists. The idea consists of a residence of artists from all over the world located in the popular district of ''New Bell''in Douala: the project aimed at leading artists to express themselves and exchange with the inhabitants of the district of Douala whose reputation was not the best.
The stereotypes had to be broken to create new words. The communication had to be reinvented.
It is during the workshop in the district New Bell that the Kapsiki circle ([[Hervé Youmbi]], Hervé Yamguen, [[Blaise Bang]], [[Salifou Lindou]], [[Jules Wokam]]) and the collective Skurk (J-C Lanquetin, François Duconseille) invited other artists from [[Cameroon]], [[France]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Lebanon]], to share with the district’s population details of their lives.

He exposed in 2003 a work at the Mam gallery within the framework of the project ''Pièce Unique'', initiated by the French Cultural centre of Douala. He also published a long poem '' Le temps de la saison verte'' (The time of the green season), in 1998. A new book is published by the French Cultural centre of Douala.

Recently inducted as a notable in the village of his father (Bandja-Balassie in the upper Nkam), he reconnects with the codes of the rituals and customs, while maintaining his posture of contemporary artist.

His work has been shown in various countries around the world. In France and Germany repeatedly and recently in Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal (2015 and 2016). Beside his work as a creative, Yamguen has served other functions in the art world. He taught fine arts at the secondary level (in 2005 and 2006 in Douala). He was the artistic director of the three editions (2011, 2012 and 2013) of the Marché des Arts Plastiques de Bali (a district in Douala).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1205">'''Eze Igwegbe Odum''' (sometimes called '''Chief Igwebe Odum''') was an [[Aro Igbo]] politician born in the Nigerian town of [[Mbaukwu]] in present day [[Awka South]] LGA in [[Anambra state]]. Igwegbe Odum, was not Aro by origin, but a migrant like many settlers in [[Arondizuogu]]. Along with his brothers, he fled to [[Arondizuogu]] in the late 19th century.  His life story became the subject of [[Omenuko]] [http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol14num1/njoku.pdf] the earliest [[Igbo people|Igbo]] novel written by [[Peter Nwana]].  Odum died in 1940. He was also a brother-in-law to [[Ojiako Ezenne]] of Adazi. Igwegbe Odum never made it back to his homeland of Mbaukwu. Along with his brothers, he settled in Ndiuche in [[Arondizuogu]]. Their lineage include the legendary [[K.O. Mbadiwe]] and his brother [[Green Mbadiwe]].

'''Iranian Kazakhs''' live mainly in the [[Golestān Province]] in northern [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anobanini.ir/travel/fa/golestan/cat-227 |title=گلستان |publisher=Anobanini.ir |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ethnologue.org, however, there were 3000 [[Kazakhs]] living in Iran in 1982 in the city of [[Gorgan]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/IR/languages |title=Iran |publisher=ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golestanstate.ir/layers.aspx?quiz=page&amp;PageID=23 پایگاه اطلاع رسانی استانداری گلستان] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111141238/http://www.golestanstate.ir/layers.aspx?quiz=page&amp;PageID=23 |date=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Iranian Kazakhs might have been slightly higher, because many of them returned to [[Kazakhstan]] after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], from where they had immigrated to Iran after the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution]] (1917).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jolay.blogfa.com/85093.aspx قزاق] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025195710/http://jolay.blogfa.com/85093.aspx |date=October 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the city of [[Gorgan]] contains 5000 ethnic Kazakhs, who speak [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Persian language|Persian]] on varying levels.&lt;ref name="inform1"/&gt;

==Origins==
The first Kazakhs arrived from the territory of [[Turkmenistan]] into the northeastern city of [[Gorgan]] in 1929. Since then, Kazakh immigration has experienced three distinct waves. The first occurred with the creation of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The second wave occurred with the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], which saw the population of Kazakh-Iranians swell significantly. Unlike the previous wave of immigration, these individuals were acculturated with the [[Russians|Russian]] language, rather than [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]. The final wave has been ongoing since 2007 and consists of economic migrants arriving from the western provinces of [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]] and [[Mangystau Province|Mangystau]] to the cities of [[Gorgan]], [[Bandar Torkaman]] and [[Gonbad-e Qabus (city)|Gonbad-e Qabus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Есенгуль КАПКЫЗЫ |url=http://rus.azattyq.mobi/a/kazakhs_in_iran/1874963/p1.html |title=В Иране вновь пытаются открыть Казахский культурный центр |publisher=Rus.azattyq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Snider''' (January 1, 1811 – October 25, 1866) was an American mechanical engineer and inventor. He invented and patented a method of converting existing [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s into [[breech-loading rifle]]s, notably the [[Snider-Enfield]].

Originally from [[Montgomery, Georgia]], Snider later moved to [[Philadelphia]], but died in poverty in Kilburn, London, England while attempting to recover promised compensation from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/snider.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was survived by his wife Angelina and several sons, and is buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=92|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snider worked for the Pennsylvania Institute for the Blind, and in 1833, he produced the first raised print book in the United States. His method, which involved carving the letters into a sheet of copper by hand, was soon abandoned.

'''James Richard Arnold''' (May 5, 1923&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; January 6, 2012) was the [[Harold C. Urey]] Professor of Chemistry (emeritus), and a noted pioneer in the field of planetary and space [[chemistry]] at the [[University of California at San Diego]] (UCSD), where an endowed lectureship has been established in his name.

Arnold received his education at [[Princeton University]], where he enrolled as an undergraduate at age 16. He earned his doctorate there in 1946 at 23, for work on the [[Manhattan Project]] (his thesis is still classified).&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; Concerns about nuclear fallout and war prompted him to be an early member of the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]]&lt;ref name="aas"&gt;[https://aas.org/obituaries/james-r-arnold-1923-2012, James R. Arnold (1923 - 2012)], Athena Coustenis for the American Astronomical Society&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[World Federalist Movement|World Federalist]], through which he met his wife Louise in 1950.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt;

As a [[Postdoctoral researcher]] under [[Willard Libby]] at the [[University of Chicago]], Arnold helped develop the techniques for [[Radiocarbon Dating|Carbon-14 dating]], working with archeological samples from Egypt and other samples with known ages. For this work, Libby was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1960/libby-lecture.pdf Radiocarbon Dating], Willard F. Libby, Nobel Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

After his postdoc, Arnold returned to Princeton as a faculty member, working on using [[cosmic rays]] to measure the age of rocks.,&lt;ref name="aas"/&gt; and where he began his work on extraterrestrial material, including cosmic rays. It was at Princeton that Masatake (Masa) Honda and [[Devendra Lal]] first joined his work, an association amongst them that would last the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt;

In 1957, [[Roger Revelle]] was working to start [[UCSD]] near the campus of [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]. He recruited Arnold and a few others to be the founding faculty. The recruitment of [[Harold C. Urey]] convinced Arnold to accept and move west in 1958, leaving Princeton to become the founding chair of the UCSD Department of Chemistry and help found the campus and recruit faculty.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/22/local/la-me-james-arnold-20120122 "James Arnold dies at 88; pushed to unlock secrets in moon rocks"], Elaine Woo, obituary in ''The Los Angeles Times'', Jan 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calspace"&gt;[http://calspace.ucsd.edu/casgc/JArnoldLecture/JRA_Biography.htm CalSpace Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[NASA]] consultant for many years, helping set scientific research priorities,&lt;ref name="aas"/&gt; starting just three months after NASA was founded.&lt;ref name="ucsd"&gt;[http://physicalsciences.ucsd.edu/news/2012/jimarnold.html "Jim Arnold, founding chemistry chair, 1923-2012"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330073125/http://physicalsciences.ucsd.edu/news/2012/jimarnold.html |date=2015-03-30 }}, Obituary, UCSD Division of Physical Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; He played a major role in establishing and reforming the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] for handling lunar samples returned during the [[Apollo program]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/jim_arnold_founding_chemist_at_uc_san_diego_dies_at_88/], UC San Diego, Obituary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lnews/lnjul94/hist25.htm 25 Years of Curating Moon Rocks], Judy Allton&lt;/ref&gt; including being one of the "[[Four Horsemen (NASA)|Four Horsemen]]", along with Bob Walker, [[Paul Werner Gast]], and [[Gerald J. Wasserburg|Gerry Wasserburg]].&lt;ref name="ucsd"/&gt;

Arnold performed his own research on lunar rocks and cosmic rays.&lt;ref name="aas"/&gt; Under the name SHRELLDALFF (from the initials of its members), his team produced important early papers, and he continued long afterwards with lunar studies, including measurements of the bombardment of the lunar surface by cosmic rays, helping to plot the energy output of the Sun over millions of years.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; For his work he was awarded the [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4012/vol4/appa.htm SP-4012 NASA Historical Data Book: Volume IV, "NASA Resources 1969-1978," Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of then-Governor [[Jerry Brown]], he founded the University of California's California Space Institute (CalSpace) in 1979, and was its first director for ten years,&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: "Jim Arnold, First Director of CA Space Institute, Dies at 88", ''Scientific Computing'' [http://www.scientificcomputing.com/news-DS-Jim-Arnold-First-Director-of-CA-Space-Institute-Dies-at-88-011612.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asteroid 2143,  "[[Jimarnold]]", was named for Arnold by its discoverers, [[Eleanor Helin|E. F. Helin]] and [[Eugene Shoemaker|Gene Shoemaker]], in 1980 for his work on computer models of meteorite travel.&lt;ref name="aas"/&gt;

Arnold was  a member of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and a Foreign Fellow of the [[Indian National Science Academy]].

Arnold was also known for wild shirts, a relief from the formal dress required at Princeton.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/109/12/4339.full "James R. Arnold: From the Manhattan Project to the moon and beyond"] Obituary, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;
He was married to Louise Arnold for 60 years, and they had three sons, Bob, Ted, and [[Ken Arnold|Ken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Susan|title=Jim Arnold, Founding Chemist at UC San Diego Dies at 88|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressreleases/jim_arnold_founding_chemist_at_uc_san_diego_dies_at_88/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Martin Tovar y Tovar 07.JPG|thumb|José Félix Ribas]]
'''José Félix Ribas''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse ˈfeliks ˈriβas}}; [[Caracas]], 19 September 1775 &amp;ndash; [[Tucupido]], 31 January 1815), was a [[Venezuela]]n independence leader and [[hero]] of the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]].

==Early life==

Ribas was the last of eleven sons, born to a prominent [[Caracas]] family. In his early years, he received a quality education and attended the city's seminary. After finishing his studies, he began working in the agrarian sector. At the age of 21 he married María Josefa Palacios, the aunt of [[Simón Bolívar]]. He soon became interested in Republican ideals and sympathetic to the revolutionary independence movement.

Ribas became involved in the [[Conspiracy of 1808]], but was taken prisoner after its failure. In his defense, he stated that on the day of the action, he was just heading to a public square to spend time. Actually, Ribas was frequenting the square to meet with other republicans to plan an uprising. He was later freed by the authorities.

When the [[Supreme Junta|Revolution of 19 April 1810]] was taking place, it was reported that Ribas was seen travelling throughout the entire city, encouraging people to join-in the demonstrations against Spanish rule. In the aftermath he joined the interim government on April 25, taking charge of the municipality of Caracas.

==Military career==

Apart from his political functions in the interim government, and despite having no military background, Ribas was named Colonel of the Barlovento Battalion which he helped set up with his own funds. He also maintained some contact with [[Francisco de Miranda]], and offered him all possible support when Miranda arrived in the country. Along with other fellow Republicans, he became a member of the [[Sociedad Patriótica]] organized by [[Francisco de Miranda]], in contradistinction to the New Venezuelan Congress which was ruled mostly by the landed few. The Sociedad Patriótica was modeled after a French [[Jacobin Club]], encouraging the practice of oratory on equality of rights to all citizens.

During a brief period of Venezuelan independence (the [[Second Republic of Venezuela]] under the stewardship of Simón Bolívar), Ribas fought in numerous battles of the "[[Admirable Campaign|Campaña Admirable]]"; however the most crucial episode was the [[Battle of La Victoria (1814)|battle of ''La Victoria'']] (12 February 1814) in which he and his comrades succeeded in foiling the advance of  [[José Tomás Boves]]'s formidable [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist]] forces (commanded in this battle by proxy [[Francisco Tomás Morales]], while Boves recovered from wounds). Ribas won this victory with inexperienced troops, composed mainly of youths, students, and seminary candidates that Ribas has succeeded in recruiting. Ribas told his young soldiers, his charges, before a crucial battle that "We have no choice between victory or death, we must achieve victory" ("No podemos optar entre vencer o morir, es necesario vencer"). After many hours of fierce resistance, Republican reinforcements arrived under the command of [[Vicente Campo Elías]]. It is in honor of this episode of Venezuelan history that modern Venezuelan citizens now celebrate the "Día de la Juventud" ("Day of Youth"). each 12 February.

== Capture and death after Urica and Maturín ==

He fought vigorously in the [[Battle of Urica]] in which the republican forces lost but his royalist nemesis Boves was killed. After this battle, his forces assisted in offering a last desperate resistance to Morales at the [[Battle of Maturín]]; however this effort also was defeated. Ribas, together with a nephew and a faithful servant, was forced to flee from the victorious royalists. However, he was ultimately betrayed to the royalists by a slave. He was captured and executed by beheading. Ribas's lopped off head, after having been fried in cooking oil, was sent to [[Caracas]]. There, it was placed in public display within a small cage with the intention of demoralizing the patriots.

== Legacy ==
Almost two centuries later, Ribas' deeds were commemorated by the [[Hugo Chávez]] government when it named one of the [[Bolivarian Missions]] "[[Mission Ribas|Missión Ribas]]" in his honor. There are also two Venezuelan municipalities named after him, [[José Félix Ribas Municipality, Aragua]] state; and [[José Félix Ribas Municipality, Guárico|José Félix Ribas Municipality]], [[Guárico]] state.

==Personal life==
Noorjahan Kakon Bibi was born, as Kaket Hennyata (other sources state Kaket Hanchiata) in a [[Khasi people|Khasi]] family at Nayrai Khasia Palli, [[Meghalaya]], [[India]]. Her sister was married to a member of the border guards, She got married to Shaheed Ali of Dirai village in 1970. After her marriage, her name was changed to Noorjahan Begum but she was mostly known as Kakon Bibi. She gave birth to a baby girl Sakhina on 16 March 1971. Because of [[discrimination against girls in India]], her husband was displeased and they got separated. Later she was married to Abdul Majid Khan, and they had a son who died at birth Majid was living in EPR camp where he also worked.&lt;ref name="mzamin" /&gt; After two months, she brought Sakhina from her previous home. But she couldn't find her husband, Abdul Majid Khan, after returning. Hearing that Majid had been transferred to a camp of [[Dowarabazar Upazila]] she went there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=বীরপ্রতীক উপাধির স্বীকৃতি চান কাকন বিবি |trans-title=Kakon Bibi wants to recognize the title of Bir |url=http://www.jugantor.com/old/bangla-face/2014/12/16/190261 |newspaper=Jugantor |date=16 December 2014 |language=bn |access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberation war==
A war was happening in the Dowarabazar area when Kakon went to there to search for her husband. She went to Tengratilla camp. Their Pakistani Army captured her in a bunker and she faced inhuman physical and mental torture for many days. She left her hope for finding husband and joined Muktibahini (the [[guerrilla warfare|gerrila]] [[resistance movement]] formed by the [[Bangladesh Armed Forces|Bangladesh military]], paramilitary and civilians during the War of Liberation. Freedom fighter Rahmat Ali introduced her to sector five commander, [[Mir Shawkat Ali]]. Shawkat called Kakon Bibi his sister of religion. With his influence, she started working as a secret agent under a disguise of a beggar.

In April 1971 Kakon Bibi was captured by the [[Razakar]]s while spying in [[Bangla bazar]] in the region of [[Dowarabazar Upazila]]. They tortured her immensely including burning with a hot iron rod. Sexual torture was also intensified. Later they took her to the Pakistani camp in Tengratilla. There, she told the Pakistani commander that she is the wife of Pakistani soldier Abdul Majid Khan and she came in search of him. The Pakistani commander believed her. Rather, she was proposed to work for the Pakistanis. She agreed and began to help freedom fighters providing information in a more effective way. This was primarily achieved through receiving an identification card from the Pakistani commander. With that ID card she started going to the Pakistani camp more often and with greater ease and supplied the freedom fighters with important information.

Later Kakon took part in nearly 20 battlefronts.&lt;ref name="Constitutional recognition of indigenous people demanded"/&gt; In November, she was engaged in a front war in Tengratilla where she was deeply injured. The injury marks were visible on her knee till her death.&lt;ref name="mzamin" /&gt;

==Death==
Kakon Bibi was hospitalised in 2017 after a heart attack. She died of pneumonia at [[Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College|Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College and Hospital]] on 21 March 2018. At the time of her death, Kakon Bibi's age could not be verified.

'''Lilah Denton Lindsey''' (October 21, 1860 - 1943), an American philanthropist, civic leader, women's [[community organizer]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]] worker, and teacher.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linda D|first1=Wilson|title=LINDSEY, LILAH DENTON (1860–1943)|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=LI008|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first [[Muscogee|Creek]] woman to earn a college degree,{{sfn|Buchanan|1955|p=193}}{{sfn|Thurman|1982|p=145}} and served as president of the [[Indian Territory]] [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).

==Early years and education==
Lilah Denton was born near Blue Creek, [[Coweta, Oklahoma|Coweta]] District, [[Muscogee|Creek Nation]], [[Indian Territory]]. Her father, John Denton, was a [[Cherokee]] and her mother, Susan (McKellop), was a Creek. Both were born in [[Alabama]] of Scotch ancestry, and as children came during the early 1830s to the Creek Nation of Indian Territory. Susan was of a missionary family, and becoming a physician, she practiced in the Creek Nation in the early days. Lindsey was the youngest in a family of six children, four of whom died in infancy, and one at the age of 12 years.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024}}

Lindsey acquired her first education in the old Admission School of the Creek Nation. Her mother had been educated in the same school, and Lindsey sought every opportunity to study. At that time, Muscogee girls were not allowed to enter schools until the age of 12, and one of her early disappointments was when she was taken at the age of eight to the mission school but was not allowed to enter. Her first teacher at [[Tullahassee Mission Site|Tullahassee Mission]] was Eliza J. Baldwin, and who more than any other one person was instrumental in directing the education of Lindsey and encouraging her interest in the broad field of philanthropy which she made her life work.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024}} 

At the age of 16, Lindsey's parents both died, and through the influence of friends she went to [[Hillsboro, Ohio]], having previously attended a seminary at [[Fulton, Missouri]]. At Hillsboro, she entered the Highland Institute, and was graduated with honors in the class of 1883. She was the first Creek Indian girl to graduate from that institution. While there, she was urged to take a medical course in order that she might practice among her own people, since she possessed, partly as an inheritance from her mother, a natural ability for such work, and she became an excellent nurse. In her childhood, Lindsey spoke only the [[Muscogee language]], and while in school, devoted herself assiduously to the learning of the English language. The spring before her graduation from Hillsboro, she was appointed by the Home Mission Board of schools at [[New York City]] to teach at the [[Wealaka, Indian Territory|Wealaka Mission]] in [[Oklahoma]], to which point the old Tullahassee Mission had been transferred.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024}}

==Teacher==
Her natural ability and her love for teaching soon gave her a high standing as an able educator in the old Indian Territory. She taught for a time at the Presbyterian Mission in Wealaka, also at the Coweta Mission, and for about three years at [[Tulsa]]. Altogether, she spent about 10 years in the mission schools.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024}} 

In 1884, at the Wealaka Mission Miss Denton was married to Col. Lee W. Lindsey (born 1845, [[Ohio]]. He served in an [[List of Ohio Civil War units|Ohio regiment of cavalry]] during the [[American Civil War]], and after peace was restored, went south and lived for several years in [[Alabama]], and superintended the quarrying of stone for the building of the first machine shops at [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. He became a building contractor, and during the 1870s, moved to the Creek Nation of Indian Territory. Colonel Lindsey completed the walls and enclosure of the old council house of the Creek Nation at Okmulgee. They moved to Tulsa, establishing a home there in 1886, and for many years, was one of the central figures in [[Northeastern Oklahoma]].{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024}} 

After her marriage and at the solicitation of her friends she was induced to accept the position of teacher in the national schools of Oklahoma, and the State Board of Education, having full confidence in her ability, did not require an examination, which was otherwise obligatory upon all teachers.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024}} 

==Organizer==
In the 28 years that Lindsey has made her home in Tulsa, her interests varied. She was a leader in many woman's organizations in Tulsa. She did individual charity work on a large scale for years. She visited the sick, personally secured donations for the needy, and practically did the work of a humane officer. She organized the [[Humane society]]. Her interest in charitable work attracted the attention of state officials. [[Oklahoma Governor]] [[Charles N. Haskell]] appointed her as the Oklahoma delegate to the International [[Tuberculosis]] Conference held at Washington, and she was sent to numerous state charity associations. She secured the donation of a tract of land for the [[National Florence Crittenton Mission|Florence Crittenton Home for Fallen Girls]] at Tulsa, but failing health prevented her from completing its construction.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024-25}}

For years, Lindsey was one of the active factors in the [[Presbyterian World Mission|Women's Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions]] of the Southwest. She was an ardent church worker and at one time was the oldest in member of the [[First Presbyterian Church (Tulsa)|First Presbyterian church in Tulsa]]. She became a member of the WCTU and organized a union in her city. From that time until statehood, she was president of the Indian Territory WCTU and has later served as vice-president of the Oklahoma organization, president of the [[Tulsa County]] and the local union, and for one year edited the official organ of the Indian Territory WCTU. At the World's Convention of the WCTU held in [[Boston]], Lindsey was introduced to the assembly of women from all nations as a 'real native of America.' Lindsey organized both the [[Knights of the Maccabees|Maccabees]] and the [[Woman's Relief Corps]] at Tulsa. She was a member of the executive board of the latter organization and one year audited the books in [[Atlantic City]]. She attended nine national [[Grand Army of the Republic]] assemblies.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024-25}}

Lindsey established Tulsa's first woman's club, because she organized the Tulsa WCTU, the National WCTU being the first woman's club ever organized in America. She gave to Tulsa and Oklahoma their first police matron. Realizing what the office might be made to accomplish with girls taken into court, Lindsey found a woman broad enough and womanly enough with ability to fill the position. When she met with the council to propose that such an office be created, she had the preliminaries so well planned that the office was created and the woman she desired appointed and commissioned to begin work the following morning. She also served as vice-president of the Women's National Rivers and Harbors Congress.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024-25}} 

One of the things in which she was intimately interested was the preservation of old Native American landmarks, especially the Creek Capitol Building at [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma |Okmulgee]], which she hoped to see made into a museum for the preservation of Creek relics. Her husband built the stone wall about this building and set out the trees around it, and she taught a term of school in one of its rooms.{{sfn|Thoburn|1916|p=1024-25}}

'''Ma Guoliang''' ({{zh||s=马国良|t=馬國良|p=Mǎ Guóliáng|w=Ma Kuo-liang}}) was a [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslim military officer in the [[Qing dynasty]], the son of General [[Ma Zhanao]] and younger brother of General [[Ma Anliang]] and older brother of Ma Suiliang (Ma Sui-liang) 馬遂良.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/33588/11/15301511.pdf 甘、寧、青三馬家族世系簡表]&lt;/ref&gt; He helped crush a rebel Muslims in the [[Dungan revolt (1895–1896)]] along with his brother Ma Anliang, holding them off at Jishi pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=ma+anliang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gMwMFtA3op&amp;sig=w_PGN0cI0LeR80GUe0wDXNe6tC4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rUohTIz0CMLflgeV7rlH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&amp;q=ma%20guoliang%20jishi%20pass&amp;f=false|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|year=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=155|isbn=0-295-97644-6|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sons were Ma Tingbin (Ma T'ing-pin) 馬廷斌 aka Ma Quanqin [[w:zh:馬全欽|馬全欽]], and Ma Jieqin [[w:zh:馬介欽|馬介欽]].

In 1917 Ma Anliang ordered Ma Guoliang to suppress a rebellion of Tibetans in [[Xunhua]] who rebelled because of taxes Ma Anliang imposed on them. Ma Anliang did not report it to the central government in Beijing and was reprimanded for it, and [[Ma Qi]] was sent by the government to investigate the case and suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref name=zsy&gt;赵颂尧，马安良其人与民初的甘肃政争，西北民族大学学报(哲学社会科学版) 1989年第02期&lt;/ref&gt;

Ma Guoliang's son Ma Quanqin later defected to the Communists in 1949 and became a member of the Communist party.

'''Marianne Lamont Horinko''' served as Acting Administrator of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) from July 14, 2003 to November 5, 2003 during the first term of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]].  Prior to this appointment Horinko was Assistant Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) at EPA, having been confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on October 1, 2001.  She continued on as Assistant Administrator until June 1, 2004.

Horinko, an author and speaker on environmental cleanup policy, is currently the President of the Horinko Group, an environmental consulting firm focused on sustainability. She made an unsuccessful bid for a [[Virginia]] state Senate seat in late 2009.

==Education==
Horinko graduated from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[analytical chemistry]] in 1982 and from [[Georgetown University Law Center]] with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="EPA01"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070707175156/http://www.epa.gov/history/admin/oswer/horinko.htm Marianne Horinko EPA Biography], March 25, 2004. Retrieved 2010-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and civic service==
Horinko was an attorney at [[Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius]], involved in the areas of pesticides and hazardous waste counseling, [[Clean Water Act]] and [[Superfund]] litigation, and environmental audits in connection with business transactions.  She was responsible for both the Superfund Settlements Project and the Information Network for Superfund Settlements, a policy group of over 120 companies, law firms, and other organizations headquartered in ML&amp;B's Washington office.

During the [[George H. W. Bush]] Administration, Horinko was Attorney Advisor to Don Clay, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response.  In that capacity she was responsible for [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) regulatory issues and Superfund reauthorization.&lt;ref name="EPA01" /&gt; Clay was a career EPA employee who was elevated to the assistant administrator position by [[William K. Reilly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/history/publications/reilly/11.htm "Top EPA personnel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002171703/http://epa.gov/history/publications/reilly/11.htm |date=2006-10-02 }} segment of EPA oral history interview with W.K. Reilly, July 29, 1993. Retrieved 2010-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

After EPA, Horinko was president of Clay Associates, Inc., a national environmental policy consulting firm. She was responsible for launching the RCRA Policy Forum, a membership organization composed of federal and state governments, environmental groups, [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] staff, and industries interested in furthering constructive dialogue to improve the nation's waste programs.&lt;ref name="EPA01" /&gt; Through July, 1998, Don Clay was serving as president of Don Clay Associates Inc., "a Washington, D.C.-based public policy consulting firm devoted to solid and hazardous waste regulation and environmental cleanup issues." At that time, he took the position of director of regulatory affairs with [[Koch Industries]], one of the companies DCA had been advising, to be based in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/6853131-1.html "Former EPA Assistant Administrator Joins Koch Industries; Don Clay to Help Further Environmental..."], ''Business Wire'', July 8, 1998. Retrieved 2010-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back at EPA during her tenure as Assistant Administrator, Horinko refocused the goals of her office around five major priorities: Homeland Security/Emergency Response; One Cleanup Program; Land Revitalization; Energy Recovery, Recycling &amp; Waste Minimization; a Retail Environmental Initiative (the Resource Conservation Challenge) and Workforce Development.  Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, she spent her first few months at EPA in the role of assisting in environmental cleanup activities at [[Ground zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]] in lower [[Manhattan]], [[the Pentagon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attack]] at the [[Hart Senate Office Building]].&lt;ref name="EPA01" /&gt;

In 2003, as national program manager, Horinko oversaw EPA's response to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]]. The [[Brownfield land|Brownfields]]  program was signed into law by President Bush in 2002. Under her leadership, the budget for the Brownfields program was doubled.&lt;ref name="EPA01" /&gt;

In mid-May, 2004, in the leadup to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], Horinko was questioned in the media relative to an EPA rule about industrial laundry and toxic waste, on the one hand, and gifts to the Bush campaign, particularly by [[Cintas Corporation]] founder and [[Bush Pioneer]] fundraiser [[Richard T. Farmer]], on the other. Cintas, headquartered in the greater [[Cincinnati]] area in the [[United States presidential election, 2004#Battleground states|electoral-battleground state of Ohio]], was then the biggest company in the industrial laundry business. "In a summary of the rule, the EPA said it would improve 'clarity and consistency' of regulation, 'provide regulatory relief, and save affected facilities over $30 million'" by allowing industrial shop towels to be washed in water that would then go into municipal waste-water treatment systems. At the time, "3 billion of the [towels were being used to] sop up more than 100,000 tons of hazardous solvents such as [[benzene]], [[xylene]], [[toluene]] and [[methyl ethyl ketone]]" per year. Horinko "said Farmer's campaign contributions had nothing to do with the agency's decision," and Farmer likewise denied he had lobbied EPA directly or contributed to the campaign for the purpose of affecting the EPA ruling. However, Farmer said in the report that he did complain about the rule to [[Ohio]] [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican]] [[U.S. Senate|Sen.]] [[George V. Voinovich]] and [[House of Representatives of the United States|Rep.]] [[Rob Portman]], a fellow Bush Pioneer and chairman of Bush's campaign in Ohio. And, "[a]bout the same time in 2002 that Farmer was making his calls and the [[Trade association|trade groups]] were contacting members of Congress, he made a major contribution. On March 19, 2002, Farmer gave $250,000 to the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31714-2004May16.html "The Bush Money Machine: An Industry Gets Its Way: Fundraiser Denies Link Between Money, Access: EPA Rule on Hazardous Waste Favored Ohio Businessman Who Is a Big GOP Donor"] by [[James V.

The question of whether the [[historical Jesus|historical]] [[Jesus]] was in good [[mental health]] has been explored by multiple psychologists, philosophers, historians, and writers. &lt;br&gt;The first to openly question Jesus' sanity was French [[psychologist]] {{ill|Charles Binet-Sanglé|fr}}, the chief physician of [[Paris]] and author of the book ''La Folie de Jésus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binet-Sanglé |first=Charles |title=La folie de Jésus |publisher=A. Maloine |location=Paris |year=1908-1915 |language=fr |volume=1–4 |oclc = 4560820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SN"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Havis |first=Don |title=An Inquiry into the Mental Health of Jesus: Was He Crazy? |magazine=Secular Nation |publisher=[[Atheist Alliance International|Atheist Alliance Inc.]] |publication-place=Minneapolis |date=April–June 2001 |url=http://sfatheists.blogspot.com/2003/07/inquiry-into-mental-health-of-jesus.html |access-date=September 5, 2018 |issn=1530-308X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; This view finds both supporters and opponents.

==Opinions challenging the sanity of Jesus==
Charles Binet-Sanglé diagnosed Jesus as suffering from "religious paranoia":&lt;ref name="Gettis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gettis |first=Alan |title=The Jesus delusion: A theoretical and phenomenological look |journal=[[Journal of Religion and Health]] |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |date=June 1987 |pages=131-136 |doi=10.1007/BF01533683 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27505915?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents |access-date=September 7, 2018 |issn=1573-6571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, the nature of the hallucinations of Jesus, as they are described in the orthodox Gospels, permits us to conclude that the founder of Christian religion was afflicted with religious paranoia. (vol. 2, p. 393)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His view was shared by the New York [[psychiatrist]] [[William Hirsch]] who, in 1912, published his study "Religion and Civilization – Conclusions of a Psychiatrist",&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, William, ''Religion and Civilization – Conclusions of a Psychiatrist'', Truth Seeker, New York 1912&lt;/ref&gt; enumerating a number of Jesus' mentally aberrant behaviours. Hirsch agreed with Binet-Sanglé in that Jesus had been afflicted with hallucinations, and pointed to his "megalomania, which mounted ceaselessly and immeasurably".&lt;ref name="SN" /&gt; Hirsch concluded that Jesus was "paranoid" – pure and simple, adding that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But Christ offers in every respect an absolutely typical picture of a wellknown mental disease. All that we know of him corresponds so exactly to the clinical aspect of paranoia, that it is hardly conceivable how anybody at all acquainted with mental disorders, can entertain the slightest doubt as to the 
correctness of the diagnosis. (p. 103)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jesus' mental health was also questioned by the British psychiatrists [[William Sargant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Sargant |first = William |title = The movement in psychiatry away from the philosophical |journal = [[The Times]] |page = 14 |date = 22 August 1974 |issn = 0140-0460 |quote = &amp;nbsp;Perhaps, even earlier, Jesus Christ might simply have returned to his carpentry following the use of modern [psychiatric] treatments.&amp;nbsp; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Raj Persaud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/health-a-madman-can-look-a-lot-like-a-messiah-there-is-no-easy-way-for-cult-followers-to-tell-if-1457692.html |title = Health: A madman can look a lot like a messiah: There is no easy way for cult followers to tell if their leader is sane, says Raj Persaud |website = The Independent |accessdate = 2018-10-25 |last = Persaud |first = Raj |date = 27 April 1993 |quote = &amp;nbsp;Two thousand years ago Jesus received a crown of thorns.

The Gospel of Mark (Mark 3:21) reports the opinion of members of Jesus' family who believe that Jesus "is beside himself". Some psychiatrists and writers explain that they saw Jesus as mad, insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=September 2011 |pages=410–426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |cid= |url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214  |access-date=2018-11-01 |issn=1545-7222 |quote=Mark 3:21 confirms a occasion where Jesus' friends and family viewed him as mad or "beside himself." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirsch |first=William |title=Religion and Civilization – Conclusion of a Psychiatrist |publisher=Truth Seeker |location=New York |date=1912 |page=135 |quote=That the other members of his own family considered him insane, is said quite plainly, for the openly declare, "He is beside himself." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kashmar |first=gene |title=All the obscenities in the Bible |publisher=Kas-Mark Publishing Co. |location=Brooklyn Center, MN |date=1995 |page=157 |quote=He was thought to be insane by his own family and neighbors in 'when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself ...

[[Władysław Witwicki]], a rationalist philosopher and psychologist, in the comments to his own translation of the Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] ("{{ill|Dobra Nowina według Mateusza i Marka|pl}}")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Witwicki |first=Władysław |title=Dobra Nowina według Mateusza i Marka = The Good News according to Matthew and Mark |publisher=Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe |location=Warszawa |year=1958 |language=pl |oclc=681830910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to Jesus the [[subjectivism]], increased sense of his own power and superiority over others, [[egocentrism]] and the tendency to subjugate other people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Szmyd |first=Jan |title=Psychologiczny obraz religijności i mistyki: z badań psychologów polskich = Psychological picture of religiousness and mysticism: from the research of the Polish psychologists |publisher=Wydawn.

In 1998–2000 [[Poles|Pole]] Leszek Nowak (born 1962)&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Polish philosopher and lawyer [[Leszek Nowak]] (1943–2009) also from Poznań.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Poznań]] authored a study in which, based on his own history of [[religious delusion]] of mission and overvalued ideas, and information communicated in the Gospels, made an attempt at reconstructing Jesus' psyche&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Nowak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160514125307/http://www.opracowanie.eu/index_2.htm Prywatna Witryna Internetowa Leszka Nowaka] at [[Internet Archive]] (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; with the view of [[Portraits of the historical Jesus#Apocalyptic prophet|Jesus as apocalyptic prophet]],&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of fragments of the New Testament books for Jesus as apocalyptic prophet: Leszek Nowak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160523101437/http://www.opracowanie.eu/pomylka_2.htm "A great mistake and disappointment of early Christianity"] at [[Internet Archive]] (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; taking into account the hypothesis of "suicide by proxy".&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Nowak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160706022513/http://www.opracowanie.eu/prowokator.htm "Prowokator" ("Instigator")] at [[Internet Archive]] (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; He does so in chapters containing, in sequence, an analysis of character traits of the "savior of mankind", a description of the possible course of events from the period of Jesus' public activity, a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] explanation of [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]].

In 2011, a team of psychiatrists, [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychologists]], [[neurologists]] and [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrists]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]] published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to religious delusion and [[hyperreligiosity]].&lt;ref name="JNCN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=September 2011 |pages=410–426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |cid= |url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214  |access-date=September 5, 2018 |issn=1545-7222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They compared the thought and behavior of the most important figures in the [[Bible]] ([[Abraham]], [[Moses]], Jesus Christ and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]])&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; with patients affected by mental disorders related to the [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria ([[DSM-IV-TR]]),&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and concluded that these Biblical figures "may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations",&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; such as schizophrenia, [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]]-[[visual hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[Geschwind syndrome]] and abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE). The authors suggest that Jesus sought to condemn him to death ("suicide by proxy").&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

==Opinions defending the sanity of Jesus==
The opinions of William Hirsch, Charles Binet-Sanglé and others questioning Jesus' mental health were in turn challenged by [[Albert Schweitzer]] in his doctoral thesis entitled ''The Psychiatric Study of Jesus: Exposition and Criticism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schweitzer |first=Albert |translator-last=Joy |translator-first=Charles R. |title=The Psychiatric Study of Jesus: Exposition and Criticism |publisher=Peter Smith |location=Gloucester, Mass |year=1975 |isbn=0844628948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SN" /&gt; (''Die psychiatrische Beurteilung Jesu: Darstellung und Kritik'', 1913)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schweitzer |first=Albert |title=Die psychiatrische Beurteilung Jesu: Darstellung und Kritik |publisher=J.C.B.

'''Myrtle Claire Bachelder''' (March 13, 1908 – May 22, 1997) was an American chemist and [[Women's Army Corps]] officer, who is noted for her secret work on the [[Manhattan Project]] atomic bomb program, and for the development of techniques in the chemistry of metals.

==Early life and career==
Myrtle C. Bachelder was born on March 13, 1908, in [[Orange, Massachusetts]]. She earned a bachelor of science degree from [[Middlebury College]] in 1930, and became a high school science teacher and athletics coach in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley Falls, Massachusetts]]. She received her master of education degree from [[Boston University]].{{sfn|Bell|1993|p=29}}&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-05-26/news/9705260114_1_manhattan-project-atom-bomb |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |title=Myrtle C. Bachelder |date=May 26, 1997 |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mocavo.com/records/SSDI/2cbf0af365190dae4c19869ab1db6244 |title=Myrtle Bachelder |publisher=Mocavo |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II: the atomic bomb==
During [[World War II]], Bachelder enlisted in the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC) in November 1942, at the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] headquarters. After spending time in training at military bases in several U.S. states, she received orders assigning her to the Company 'D' WAC Detachment of the [[Manhattan District]], [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. Her secret assignment was to lead a group of 15 to 20 women from the WAC, stationed in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], to [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill, Oklahoma]], and from there to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. She and the women under her command arrived at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] on October 21, 1943.{{sfn|Bell|1993|p=29}}{{sfn|Howes|Herzenber|2003|pp=149-150}}

"Manhattan" was the code name for the special military division dedicated to developing an atomic weapon. In [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|the clandestine laboratory]] at the remote Los Alamos desert site, Bachelder was responsible for the analysis of the [[spectroscopy]] of [[Isotopes of uranium|uranium isotopes]]. Since the [[uranium-235]] isotope is [[fissile]], whereas the [[uranium-238]] isotope is not, Bachelder's role in the project was a crucial task: to ensure the purity of the sub-critical material, and therefore the [[nuclear explosion]], of the world's first atomic bombs.{{sfn|Howes|Herzenber|2003|pp=149-150}}

[[File:bachelder1946.jpg|thumb|right|Bachelder (center) at Los Alamos in 1946, with Captain Arlene Scheidenhelm, Director of WAC, Manhattan District (left), and First Lieutenant Marguerite Carrera, Commanding Officer, WAC Los Alamos detachment (right)]]
These methods were used during the preparation of [[plutonium-239]], the fissile material used in the construction of the atomic bomb for the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]], on July 16, 1945. Analogous methods were used for the uranium weapon, code-named "[[Little Boy]]", which destroyed [[Hiroshima]], Japan on August 6, 1945, and for the plutonium bomb which [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|destroyed Nagasaki, Japan]] on August 9, 1945, leading to the [[Japanese surrender]].
The secret program was under the general direction of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Bachelder described as:
{{quote|A "pencil and paper man", immersed in physics theory, who was more than a little amazed by the Los Alamos lab machinery. Bachelder recalled Oppenheimer standing in front of her lab's most important and expensive instrument punching buttons at random&amp;nbsp;... He asked "What does this do?" Then he'd punch another button&amp;nbsp;... He might have wrecked the machine if he hadn't finally been persuaded to leave it alone.&lt;ref name="Check1"&gt;"Los Alamos Aide Recalls Dawn of Atomic Age". Brett Staples, [[Chicago Sun-Times]], November 19, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contribution to post-war developments in nuclear energy==
The conclusion of the Second World War was also the dawning of a new "Atomic Age", in which the peacetime potential of nuclear energy began to be explored. Bachelder was among the scientists who opposed the May-Johnson Bill of October 1945, a Congressional bill proposed by the [[Interim Committee]], which would have maintained military control over nuclear research. The bill was defeated in Congress and superseded by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|McMahon Atomic Energy Act]]. In January 1947, the newly formed [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] approved the declassification of 270 previously secret documents. These included discoveries related to [[X-radiation]] and purification of [[uranium ore]]s, which had been made by Bachelder during the course of the war effort. At this time, the rarity and importance of Bachelder's achievements as a [[Women in science|woman in science]] were also acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic Boiler Hints Now Off Secret List, Women Among Authors".

==Scientific research and later career==
After leaving the Army, Bachelder became a research chemist at the [[University of Chicago]], where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction had been achieved in 1942. [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]] [[James Franck]] had been Director of the Chemistry Division of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] during the earlier phases of the Manhattan Project. Bachelder joined the University's Institute for the Study of Metals (renamed as the [[James Franck Institute]] in 1967), and she conducted further research in metallochemistry.&lt;ref name="indium"&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.C. |last=Bachelder |first2=P M. |last2=Sparrow |title=Determination of Antimony in Indium Antimonide |journal=[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]]  |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=149–150 |doi=10.1021/ac60121a043 |issn=0003-2700 |date=January 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="impurities"&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.C. |last=Bachelder |title=Effect of Constituent Materials upon Spectrographic Measurement of Seven Impurity Elements. |journal=[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]] |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1366–1369 |date=November 1949 |doi=10.1021/ac60035a018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Myrtle C. |last=Bachelder |title=A diagnostic test on the mastery of chemical calculations.

Among other achievements, Bachelder developed methods for the purification of the rare elements [[tellurium]] and [[indium]].&lt;ref name="indium"/&gt; Other aspects of her broad scientific expertise found application in the field of [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeology]], when she determined the chemical composition of brass cannons found in the [[Aegean Sea]] on sunken ships.&lt;ref name="impurities"/&gt; She also made contributions to [[astrochemistry]], when [[NASA]] asked her to analyze the chemistry of [[Moon rock]]s which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]] from 1969 to 1972.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt;

Bachelder retired from the Franck Institute in 1973, and was subsequently active as an official of the [[AARP|American Association of Retired Persons]] (AARP).&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt; She died in Chicago on May 22, 1997.&lt;ref name="SSN"/&gt;

==Reflections==
Bachelder believed that her role in the development of the atomic bomb, and the subsequent use of atomic weapons against Japan, had been justified in order to end the Second World War and to avoid greater loss of life that would have been entailed in a U.S. land invasion and extended conflict with Japan. Later, during the period of the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]], Bachelder stated that, although she supported nuclear arms control:
{{quote|Opponents of nuclear weapons should resist the urge to take the 1940s bomb-building effort out of its proper historical context — "One cannot pull that activity out of that time, set it down in the 1980s, and pass judgement."&lt;ref name="Check1" /&gt;}}

==Childhood==
Bin Laden was born the grandson of [[Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden]], the founder of one of the wealthiest non-royal families in Saudi Arabia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070319_103225_103225|title=Happy 50th, Osama: More than five years since 9/11, bin Laden, at mid-life, terrorizes us still|author=Michael Petrou|date=2007-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527192942/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070319_103225_103225|archivedate=2012-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the son of [[Osama bin Laden]], whose partisan activities shaped his childhood. Bin Laden accompanied his father on his exile to [[Sudan]] from 1991 to 1996, and then to [[Afghanistan]] after that.&lt;ref name="Schemm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2008/01/17/ap/international/d8u7uoi00.txt |title=Bin Laden Son Wants to Be Pe Activist |publisher=Bismarck Tribune |author=Paul Schemm |date=2008-01-17 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he trained in [[al-Qaeda]] camps beginning at the age of 14, but after training with al-Qaeda for six years and sharing a house with al-Qaeda's second-in-command [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], he left al-Qaeda in 2000 because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians and his father Osama did not object.&lt;ref name="CNN1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/01/21/binladen.son/index.html|title=Bin Laden's son to father: Change your ways|author=Aneesh Raman|date=2008-01-21|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/22/wosama122.xml|title=

In 2010, Omar bin Laden told [[ABC News]] that Osama had severely beaten him when he was a child for smiling too widely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/omar-bin-laden-mental-illness-caused-genes-stress/story?id=11624890&amp;singlePage=true Omar Bin Laden: Mental Illness Caused by Genes or Stress? - ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-9/11==
Bin Laden ran his own company in [[Jeddah]] prior to 2006 as a contractor and scrap metal dealer.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; Jeddah, a major city and important transit port for Saudi Arabia, is the site of the headquarters of the [[Saudi Binladen Group]] and has been reported to be "truly" ruled by [[Bakr bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Georg Mascolo and Erich Follath|title = Osama's Road to Riches and Terror|date=2005-06-06|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,359690,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage to Zaina Mohamed Al-Sabah===
Omar married Jane Felix-Browne, who also goes by the name Zaina Mohamed Al-Sabah, a parish councillor from [[Moulton, Cheshire|Moulton]], near [[Northwich]] in [[Cheshire]] in the [[United Kingdom]], on September 15, 2006.&lt;ref name="AnonBBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/6292072.stm|title=Councillor weds Bin Laden's son|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage was conducted in September 2006 in Islamic ceremonies in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia, after which the couple spent a few months together in Jeddah before Zaina returned to Britain for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19706669/|title=U.K. divorcee reportedly marries bin Laden son| date= 2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008h48b BBC One - Mr and Mrs Bin Laden&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that  Felix-Browne met bin Laden while she was undergoing treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-11-osama-marriage_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=British woman says she wed Osama's son | date=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://despardes.com/NewsExplorer/2007/20070712-bin-laden-marries.html|title=Brit bin Laden "Bahu" Raises Eyebrows}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met on a horseback ride at the [[Giza pyramids]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Schemm" /&gt; She is his second wife and 24 years older than he is, with five grandchildren.&lt;ref name="AnonBBC" /&gt;  She was aware when she married Omar that he had been  married and divorced, with a two-year-old son.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

After their wedding, Al-Sabah described the stress of bin Laden's family background: "Omar is wary of everyone. He is constantly watching people who he feels might be following him. Not without reason he is fearful of cameras. He is the son of Osama. But when we are together he forgets his life." The couple announced their divorce in September 2007, which was said to be in response to threats to their "lives and liberty" from two unspecified sources known to them in Saudi Arabia. At the time, Al-Sabah said she did not regard herself as divorced and that as the divorce was done under duress did not have legal standing under [[Sharia]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Briton to divorce bin Laden's son|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7003047.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-09-18|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks, Zaina and Omar decided not to part.

In January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-507873/Bin-Ladens-son-wants-visa--grandmother-bride-live-Cheshire-surrogate-baby.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Bin Laden's son wants a visa - so he and his grandmother bride can live in Cheshire and have a surrogate baby | date=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; bin Laden applied for a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[European Economic Area Family Permit|spousal immigration visa]] which would have permitted him to reside indefinitely at his wife's home in [[Moulton, Cheshire]], a process which required him to provide original documentation of his divorce from his first wife. The couple stated their desire to have a child using a [[surrogate mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23046270-401,00.html|title=Bin Laden's son applies for British visa|date=2008-01-14 | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One report stated the visa application was denied because Omar failed to provide his father's permanent address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbs2chicago.com/watercooler/Osama.bin.Laden.2.286421.html |title=British Divorcee Marries Son Of Osama Bin Laden |publisher=CBS |date=2007-07-11 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a later report by ''[[The Times]]'' of Omar's appeal stated that the visa had been denied by an entry clearance officer at the UK embassy in Cairo because Omar's entry would cause "considerable public concern."  The officer was quoted, "I note that statements made during recent media interviews indicate evidence of continuing loyalty to your father, and your presence in the UK could, therefore, cause considerable public concern." This written statement was shown to [[The Associated Press]] by the couple's legal firm, but Britain's [[Home Office]] declined to comment to the press on an individual case. In April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-563042/Bin-Ladens-son-plans-legal-challenge-battle-UK-visa.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Bin Laden's son plans legal challenge to battle for UK visa | date=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; bin Laden and Al-Sabah said they planned to appeal the ruling, calling it "unjust and arbitrary", stating that Al-Sabah requires medical attention in Britain and that her appeal to live with him in Saudi Arabia could take years to process. As of April 2008, bin Laden has a house in Cairo.

In April 2010, bin Laden was denied a visa to promote his book ''[[Osama bin Laden: A Family Portrait]]'' in France and elsewhere in Europe.
Specifically, the countries of the [[Schengen Area|Schengen zone]], a block of 25 nations across Europe including Germany, France and Spain, rejected his request for a visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/world/europe/16briefs-francebrf.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | title=France: Bin Laden Son Is Denied Visa | date=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/story/18048686/bin-ladens-son-denied-visa-for-european-book-tour Bin Laden's Son Denied Visa for European Book Tour - FOX 13 News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===North African horse race===
[[File:Dakar traces mauritanie.jpg|thumb|[[Dakar Rally]] track through the [[Mauritania]]n [[Sahara]], 2005]]
In January 2008, an [[Associated Press]] interview in [[Cairo]] featured bin Laden with [[cornrows]] and a black leather biker jacket promoting a {{convert|3000|mi|km|sing=on}} horse race for peace across North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20080117/API/801170791|title=Bin Laden Son Wants to Be Peace Activist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[PETA]] president [[Ingrid E. Newkirk]] called for the cancellation of the race in an "urgent letter" from the organization, predicting that the gruelling race would lead to fatalities among the horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2008/February/middleeast_February43.xml&amp;section=middleeast|title=PETA urges Laden’s son to cancel horse race|date=2008-02-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628161824/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2008%2FFebruary%2Fmiddleeast_February43.xml&amp;section=middleeast|archivedate=2008-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3314629.ece|title=People: Kylie Minogue, James Blunt, Emma Thompson | work=The Times | location=London | date=2008-02-06 | accessdate=2010-05-20}} (''Collection of news shorts'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Omar described the race as an equine counterpart to the cancelled 2008 [[Dakar rally|Paris-Dakar car rally]], saying, "I heard the rally was stopped because of al-Qaida.  I don't think they are going to stop me."&lt;ref name="Schemm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23073535-663,00.html|title=Omar Osama bin Laden organising horse race for peace | work=Herald Sun | first=Paul | last=Schemm | date=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The race was canceled after the killings of four French tourists near [[Aleg]], [[Mauritania]] on [[Christmas Eve]] 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7159420.stm|title=Tourists shot dead in Mauritania|publisher=BBC|date=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the murders race organizers received threats directly from heavily armed and organized groups linked to al-Qaeda, which led them to cancel the race on January 4, 2008, and soon after to plan the 2009 event for South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=99&amp;id=3180745&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines|title=Terror threat leads to cancellation of Dakar Rally}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/rally/42490/|title=Dakar Rally to Relocate to South America?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119170257/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/rally/42490/|archivedate=2008-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police in [[Guinea-Bissau]] said that two of five men arrested for the crime on January 11, 2008, admitted their involvement with al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12305244.htm|title=Bissau extradites al Qaeda suspects to Mauritania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to his father and al-Qaeda===
Omar said that his father felt that he was just trying to defend the Islamic world,&lt;ref name="Schemm" /&gt; and that his father was not a terrorist "because history tells you he's not".&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;  In an interview with [[ABC News]], he said, "My father is a very kind man. And he very sorry when he did something like 11th September."  Osama ordered the attacks "Because he believes if he put two buildings down, maybe some people, little will die, but millions other will (be) save(d). He believed that. ... I believe he did wrong".&lt;ref name="Watt" /&gt;  In a January 21, 2008, [[CNN]] interview, he said "I try and say to my father: 'Try to find another way to help or find your goal. This bomb, these weapons, it's not good to use them on anybody".  Regarding the September 11 attacks, he said,  "I don't think 9/11 was right personally, but it happened.  I don't think ... [the war] in Vietnam was right. I don't think what's going on in Palestine is right. I don't think what's going on in Iraq is right.  If we make what is right and not right, we will make a very big list."&lt;ref name="CNN1" /&gt;

Bin Laden stated that he had not been in contact with his father since leaving Afghanistan in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01182008/news/worldnews/bin_laden_son__i_am_for_peace_618930.htm |title=Bin Laden son: I am for peace |publisher=New York Post |date=2008-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120111906/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01182008/news/worldnews/bin_laden_son__i_am_for_peace_618930.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said, "The last time I saw my father was in 2000, 2001. I was in Saudi Arabia and felt a terrible sorrow for all the victims [of the September 11 attacks]", "My father has a kind heart", and "I do not believe my father is dead, otherwise I would have known it; the world would have known it."&lt;ref name="news24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2264941,00.html|title=Bin Laden wants to meet pope|date=2008-02-05|access-date=2008-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122121101/http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2264941,00.html|archive-date=2008-11-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked whether he would tell the Americans if he found out where his father was living, he said with a smile, "Actually, I would hide him.  Because he is my father."&lt;ref name="Watt" /&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Omar has stated a desire to become an "ambassador of peace" between Muslims and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,1704818,00.html|title=Friday, Jan. 18, 2008 - Quotes of the Day | work=Time | accessdate=2010-05-20|date=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Omar said that his father offered a truce to Europe in a 2004 videotape and a conditional truce with the United States in a [[19 January 2006 Osama bin Laden tape|2006 videotape]].  "My father is asking for a truce but I don't think there is any government (that) respects him. At the same time they do not respect him, why everywhere in the world, they want to fight him?

After arriving in [[Rome]] from [[Switzerland]] amid heavy security on February 2, 2008, bin Laden said in a television interview that night "I would very much like to meet the [[Pope]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]], but I have been told that it is not easy."&lt;ref name="news24" /&gt;

===Asylum petitions===
On November 3, 2008, [[Spain]]'s Interior Ministry, upon recommendation by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] denied, for "insufficient evidence of danger or threat to [his] life", Omar's [[Right of asylum|political asylum]] petition, after he was refused a UK visa. Omar had 24 hours to appeal, after he made his claim at Madrid's [[Barajas International Airport]] upon a stopover on a flight from [[Cairo, Egypt]] to [[Casablanca, Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7712224.stm  news.bbc.co.uk, Bin Laden son asylum bid rejected]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/world/europe/06briefs-ASYLUMDENIED_BRF.html  nytimes.com, Spain: Asylum Denied to One of bin Laden’s Sons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/11/05/osama.son.spain/?iref=mpstoryview edition.cnn.com, Bin Laden son loses asylum plea]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden and his wife arrived in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] (where, as a Saudi citizen with a Saudi passport, he would have right of entry), on November 9, 2008, after deportation by Egypt per its denial of their entry.

Omar filed another British visa petition in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL9718792.html africa.reuters.com, Bin Laden son, rejected by Egypt, arrives in Qatar]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200811/200811100005.html english.chosun.com, Egypt Refuses Entry to Bin Laden's Son]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/388702/1/.html www.channelnewsasia.com, Osama bin Laden's son in Qatar after being deported from Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book===
Bin Laden and his mother [[Najwa bin Laden]] published a book authored in late October 2009, titled ''[[Growing Up bin Laden]]''. According to media coverage, the book details that "the kids grew up in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Afghanistan without laughter or toys, were routinely beaten, and lost their pets to painful death from poison gas experiments by their father's fighters." It states that Osama bin Laden tried to persuade his son to volunteer for suicide missions and exposed him to dangerous conditions visiting training camps in Afghanistan and sending him to the front lines of the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan civil war]]. The book describes the family living in [[Jeddah]] without air conditioning or refrigeration, treating [[asthma]] with [[honeycomb]]s and onions, and eventually moving to stone huts in [[Tora Bora]] without electricity or running water in 1996.

Subsequent correspondence with the Associated Press indicated that 25 bin Laden family members had moved to Iran, following U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1932318,00.html|title=Growing Up bin Laden: Osama's Son Speaks|publisher=Time Magazine|date=2009-10-07|author=Andrew Lee Butters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/item_FotvaRLEtYyNGoPTTlcLwK|title=Tales from the Bin Laden clan:Wife and son bare secrets of terror kingpin|date=2009-10-11|author=[[Susannah Cahalan]]|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Osama-bin-Ladens-family-parenting-exposed-in-sons-book/tabid/417/articleID/136255/Default.aspx?ArticleID=136255|title=Osama bin Laden's family, parenting exposed in son's book|date=2010-01-06|author=Donna Abu-Nasr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/son_of_osama_bin_laden_describ.html|title=Son of Osama bin Laden describes brutal childhood|publisher=Associated Press|date=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Growing Up Bin Laden:Osama's Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret World'', [[Jean Sasson]], Omar bin Laden, and Najwa bin Laden (St. Martin's Press) 2009.  {{ISBN|978-0-312-56016-4}}, {{ISBN|0-312-56016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of his father===
{{Further information|Death of Osama bin Laden}}
Bin Laden published a complaint on May 10, 2011, that the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Burial at sea|burial at sea]] of his father [[Osama bin Laden|Osama]] deprived the family of a proper burial. He made several other claims regarding the mission that killed his father, such as stating that no one living at the compound was armed; {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} he also requested that the UN and other international groups investigate the killing of Osama as a criminal matter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/world/asia/binladen-statement.html "Statement From the Family of Osama bin Laden"].

'''Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr.''' (23 February 1915 – 1 November 2007) was a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]]. He is best known as the pilot who flew the [[B-29 Superfortress]] known as the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' (named after his mother) when it dropped [[Little Boy]], the first of two [[atomic bombs]] used in warfare, on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]].

Tibbets enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938. After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic. In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the [[340th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], which was equipped with the [[Boeing B-17]]. In July 1942, the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the [[Eighth Air Force]], and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight [[heavy bomber]] mission against [[Occupied Europe]] on 17 August 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Mark W. Clark]] and [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the [[Twelfth Air Force]].

Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], which would conduct the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. After the war, he participated in the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear weapon]] tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] in the early 1950s. He commanded the [[308th Armament Systems Wing|308th Bombardment Wing]] and [[6th Air Division]] in the late 1950s, and was [[military attaché]] in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for [[NetJets|Executive Jet Aviation]], serving on the founding board and as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.

== Early life ==
Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in [[Quincy, Illinois]], on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to [[Davenport, Iowa]], and then to Iowa's capital, [[Des Moines]], where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to [[Hialeah, Florida]], to escape from harsh [[midwest]]ern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by [[Barnstorming|barnstormer]] [[Doug Davis (aviator)|Doug Davis]], dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the [[Hialeah Park Race Track]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153–155}}{{sfn|Marx|1967|p=79}}

In the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets's family to return to [[Alton, Illinois]], where he graduated from [[Western Military Academy]] in 1933. He then attended the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]],{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153–155}} and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] in 1934.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's [[Opa-locka Airport]] with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at [[Eastern Airlines]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati]] after his second year to complete his [[pre-med]] studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the [[United States Army]] and become a pilot in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153–155}}

== Early military career ==
Because he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Aviation Cadet Training Program]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=41}} On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky|Fort Thomas]], [[Kentucky]], and was sent to [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] and received his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating#Air Corps, World War II, Cold War and Post-Cold War changes|pilot rating]] in 1938 at [[Kelly Air Force Base|Kelly Field]] in San Antonio.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153–155}}

After graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the [[16th Electronic Warfare Squadron|16th Observation Squadron]], which was based at [[Lawson Field]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] supporting the [[Infantry School]] at nearby [[Fort Benning]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153–155}} It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a [[department store]] in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], Georgia. The two quietly married in a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] seminary in [[Holy Trinity, Alabama|Holy Trinity]], [[Alabama]] on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=52–53}} They had two sons.

While Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning,  he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]]{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=65}}  and served as a personal pilot for [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[George S. Patton Jr.|George S.

In December 1941, he received orders to join the [[29th Bombardment Group]] at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Field]], [[Florida]], for training on the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] while listening to the radio during a routine flight.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=65}} Due to fears that German [[U-Boats]] might enter [[Tampa Bay]] and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=66–67}} Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at [[Pope Air Force Base|Pope Army Airfield]], [[North Carolina]], with 21 [[B-18 Bolo]] medium bombers.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153–155}} The B-18s were used as an intermediate trainer, which pilots flew after basic flight training in a [[Cessna UC-78]] and before qualifying in the B-17.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=70}}

In February 1942, Tibbets reported for duty with the 29th Bombardment Group as its engineering officer. Three weeks later he was named the commanding officer of the [[340th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], equipped with the B-17D.&lt;ref name="USAF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/Biographies/Display/tabid/225/Article/105458/brigadier-general-paul-w-tibbets-jr.aspx |title=Brigadier General Paul W.

In July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group of the [[Eighth Air Force]] to be deployed to England, where it was based at [[RAF Polebrook]].{{sfn|Goldberg|1948|pp=639–645}} It had been hastily assembled to meet demands for an early deployment, and arrived without any training in the basics of high altitude daylight bombing. In the first weeks of August 1942, under the tutelage of [[Royal Air Force]] veterans, the group received intensive training for its first mission. The group commander,  [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Cornelius W. Cousland,{{sfn|Goldberg|1948|pp=656–657}} was replaced by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Frank A. Armstrong Jr.]], who appointed Tibbets as his deputy.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=79}}

Tibbets flew the lead bomber ''Butcher Shop''&lt;ref name="Rouen Raid"&gt;{{cite web|title=VIII Bomber Command 1 - 17 August 1942|url=http://www.americanairmuseum.com/mission/1492|publisher=American Air Museum in Britain|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first American daylight heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a [[marshalling yard]] in [[Rouen]] in [[Occupied France]], with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, ''Red Gremlin'', nor his regular crew, which included [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] [[Thomas Ferebee]] and navigator [[Theodore Van Kirk]], who later flew with him in ''Enola Gay''.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=81–82}} On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of [[Lille]]. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=155–156}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=96–99}}

On that first mission, Tibbets saw in real-time that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians.  At the time, he thought to himself, "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed.  Those are not soldiers."  But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor.  This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program and ended up in drug sales.  The reason why they had failed the program was because "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities".  It dawned on Tibbets that:{{quote| I am just like that if I get to thinking about some innocent person getting hit on the ground. I am supposed to be a bomber pilot and destroy a target. I won’t be worth anything if I do that... I made up my mind then that the morality of dropping that bomb was not my business. I was instructed to perform a military mission to drop the bomb. That was the thing that I was going to do the best of my ability. Morality, there is no such thing in warfare. I don’t care whether you are dropping atom bombs, or 100-pound bombs, or shooting a rifle. You have got to leave the moral issue out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/general-paul-tibbets-%E2%80%93-reflections-hiroshima |title=General Paul Tibbets - Reflections on Hiroshima |publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation |access-date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the leadup to [[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of [[North Africa]], the commander of the Eighth Air Force, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Carl Spaatz]] was ordered to provide his best two pilots for a secret mission. He chose Tibbets and Major Wayne Connors. Tibbets flew Major General [[Mark W. Clark]] from [[RAF Polebrook|Polebrook]] to [[Gibraltar]] while Connors flew Clark's chief of staff, Brigadier General [[Lyman Lemnitzer]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=102–105}} A few weeks later Tibbets flew the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], there.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=107–109}}  "By reputation", historian [[Stephen Ambrose]] wrote, Tibbets was "the best flier in the Army Air Force."{{sfn|Ambrose|1998|p=40}}

Tibbets had flown 25 combat missions against targets in France&lt;ref name="USAF" /&gt; when the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to North Africa as part of Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle]]'s [[Twelfth Air Force]]. For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He claimed that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing  his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions,{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=157–158}} was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel [[Lauris Norstad]], Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force.&lt;ref name="USAF" /&gt; Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to [[colonel]], but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers. He was told that Norstad had vetoed the promotion, saying "there's only going to be one colonel in operations."{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=129}}

Tibbets did not get along well with Norstad, or with Doolittle's chief of staff, Brigadier General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]]. In one planning meeting, Norstad wanted an all-out raid on [[Bizerte]] to be flown at {{convert|6000|ft}}. Tibbets protested that [[flak]] would be most effective at that altitude. When challenged by Norstad, Tibbets said he would lead the mission himself at 6,000 feet if Norstad would fly as his co-pilot. Norstad backed down, and the mission was successfully flown at {{convert|20000|ft}}.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=129–132}}

== War against Japan ==
[[File:Tibbets-wave.jpg|thumb|upright|Tibbets waves from ''Enola Gay'' before the Hiroshima bombing mission.|alt=A man waves from the cockpit window of a plane with the words "Enola Gay" written on it]]
When [[General (United States)|General]] [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry H. "Hap" Arnold]], the Chief of [[United States Army Air Forces]], requested an experienced bombardment pilot to help with the development of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bomber, Doolittle recommended Tibbets.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=133}} Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943. At the time, the B-29 program was beset by a host of technical problems, and the chief test pilot, [[Edmund T. Allen]], had been killed in a crash of the prototype aircraft.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=140}}

Working with [[Spirit AeroSystems|the Boeing plant]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]], Tibbets test-flew the B-29 and soon accumulated more flight time in it than any other pilot. He found that without defensive armament and armor plating, the aircraft was {{convert|7000|lb}} lighter, and its performance was much improved. In simulated combat engagements against a [[P-47]] fighter at the B-29's cruising altitude of {{convert|30000|ft}}, he discovered that the B-29 had a smaller turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=158–159}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=149–150}}

After a year of developmental testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the [[17th Air Division|17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy)]], a B-29 training unit based at [[Grand Island Army Airfield|Grand Island Army Air Field]], Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29.&lt;ref name="USAF" /&gt; Tibbets taught two [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]], [[Dora Dougherty Strother|Dora Dougherty]] and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=152–155}}

On 1 September 1944, Tibbets reported to [[Colorado Springs Army Airfield]], the headquarters of the [[Second Air Force]], where he met with its commander, Major General [[Uzal Ent]], and three representatives of the [[Manhattan Project]], Lieutenant Colonel [[John Lansdale Jr.]], [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], and [[Norman F. Ramsey Jr.]], who briefed him on the project.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=583–584}} Tibbets was told that he would be in charge of the [[509th Composite Group]], a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of [[materiel|military stores]]. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: [[Great Bend Army Airfield]], Kansas; [[Mountain Home Army Airfield]], Idaho; or [[Wendover Army Air Field]], Utah.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=157–163}} Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=167–168}}

When the operation was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel [[Roscoe C. Wilson]] were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the [[atomic bomb]]. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|p=160}}

Tibbets was promoted to colonel in January 1945{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=165}} and brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover. He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. In order to disguise all the civilian engineers on base who were working on the Manhattan Project, Tibbets was forced to lie to his wife; he told her that the engineers were "sanitary workers." At one point, Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to unplug a drain.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=173}}

On 6 March 1945 (concurrent with the activation of [[Project Alberta]]), the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Its purpose was to provide "skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers"{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|p=1}} and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% rejection rate. The 509th Composite Group reached full strength in May 1945.{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|pp=12–13}}

With the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to [[Tinian]], an island in the northern [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of [[Project Alberta]]. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island:{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=25}} the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], and [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R. Purnell]] of the [[Military Policy Committee]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=100}}

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945, to its port of embarkation at [[Seattle]], Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS ''Cape Victory'' for the Marianas, while the group's materiel was shipped on the SS ''Emile Berliner''.{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|pp=15–18}} An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field, Tinian]], between May 15 and 22,{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|pp=19–22}} where it was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945.&lt;ref name="509timeline"&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = | url =http://www.childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C.htm| title = 509th Timeline: Inception to Hiroshima| publisher=Children of the Manhattan Proj ect| accessdate =26 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060617223231/http://childrenofthemanhattanproject.org/CG/CG_09C.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Alberta's "Destination Team" also sent most of its members to Tinian to supervise the assembly, loading, and dropping of the bombs under the administrative title of 1st Technical Services Detachment, Miscellaneous War Department Group.{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|p=25}}&lt;ref name="comp1tsd"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07a2.htm| title = 509th CG Activation and Organization| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate =5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 1945, Tibbets formally named his B-29 ''[[Enola Gay]]'' after his mother.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382–383}} ''Enola Gay'' had been personally selected by him while it was still on the [[assembly line]] at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] plant in [[Bellevue, Nebraska]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191–192}} The regularly assigned aircraft commander, [[Robert A. Lewis]], was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382–383}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=702–704}}

At 02:45 the next day—in accordance with the terms of [[Operations Order No. 35]]—the ''Enola Gay'' departed North Field for [[Hiroshima, Japan]], with Tibbets at the controls. Tinian was approximately {{convert|2,000|mi|km}} away from Japan, so it took six hours to reach Hiroshima. The atomic bomb, code-named "[[Little Boy]]", was dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets recalled that the city was covered with a tall [[mushroom cloud]] after the bomb was dropped.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=705–711}}

Tibbets was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] by Spaatz immediately after landing on Tinian.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=101}} He became a celebrity, with pictures and interviews of his wife and children in the major American newspapers. He was seen as a national hero who had ended the war with Japan. Tibbets later received an invitation from President [[Harry S. Truman]] to visit the [[White House]].{{sfn|Stelpflug|2007|p=163}} The 509th Composite Group was awarded an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] in 1999.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=221}}

Tibbets was interviewed extensively by Mike Harden of the ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'', and profiles appeared in the newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: "I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did&amp;nbsp;... I sleep clearly every night."&lt;ref name="BBC_death" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miami_Herald" /&gt; "I knew when I got the assignment," he told a reporter in 2005, "it was going to be an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Columbus Dispatch |title=Still No regrets for Frail Enola Gay Pilot |date=6 August 2005 |first=Mike |last=Harden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-war military career ==
The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at [[Roswell Army Airfield]], New Mexico.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=21}} Colonel [[William H. Blanchard]] replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the [[509th Bombardment Wing]], the successor to the 509th Composite Group.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=62}} Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Pacific, but he and his ''Enola Gay'' crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=260–261}}

Tibbets then attended the [[Air Command and Staff School]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at [[the Pentagon]].&lt;ref name="USAF" /&gt; When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General [[Thomas S. Power]], was posted to London as air attaché, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be [[jet aircraft]] and thus became involved in the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] program.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=266–267}} He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita  from July 1950 until February 1952.

After his retirement from the Air Force, Tibbets worked for [[Executive Jet Aviation]] (EJA), an air taxi company based in [[Columbus, Ohio]], and now called [[NetJets]]. He was one of the founding board members and attempted to extend the company's operations to Europe, but was unsuccessful. He retired from the company in 1968, and returned to Miami, Florida, where he had spent part of his childhood. The banks foreclosed on EJA in 1970, and [[Bruce Sundlun]] became president. Sundlun lured Tibbets back to EJA that year. Tibbets succeeded Sundlun as president on 21 April 1976, and remained in the role until 1986.

In 1976, the United States government apologized to Japan after Tibbets re-enacted the bombing—complete with a mushroom cloud—in a restored B-29 at an [[air show]] in Texas. He said that he had not intended for the re-enactment to insult the Japanese people.&lt;ref name="BBC_death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hiroshima bomb pilot dies aged 92|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7073441.stm|publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=1 November 2007|accessdate=1 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="French-born wife" /&gt; In 1995, he denounced the 50th anniversary exhibition of the ''Enola Gay'' at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which attempted to present the bombing in context with the destruction it caused, as a "damn big insult",&lt;ref name="BBC_death" /&gt; due to its focus on the Japanese casualties rather than the brutality of the Japanese government.&lt;ref name="BBC_death" /&gt; He was inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="NAHF" /&gt;

Tibbets's grandson [[Paul W. Tibbets IV]] graduated from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the [[393d Bomb Squadron]], flying the [[B-2 Spirit]] at [[Whiteman AFB]], Missouri. The squadron was one of the two operational squadrons that had formed part of the 509th Composite Group when Tibbets commanded it. Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the [[United States Strategic Command]] at [[Offutt Air Force Base]] in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America's strategic nuclear forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=66381 |title=Face of Defense: Grandson Carries on Grandfather's Service |first=Stefan |last=Bocchino |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] |accessdate=4 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713171954/http://www.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=66381 |archivedate=13 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the [[509th Bomb Wing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/grandson-enola-gay-pilot-command-bomb-wing-31544676 |title=Grandson of Enola Gay Pilot Takes Command of B-2 Bomb Wing |first=Maria |last=Sudekum |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=5 June 2015 |accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rita Gorgon and Mieczysław Ettinger (trial 1933).JPG|right|thumb|300px|Gorgonowa with her attorney, Mieczysław Ettinger, during the trial in 1933]]
'''Rita Gorgonowa''' (real name '''Emilia Margerita Gorgon''', née '''Ilic''') was a [[governess]], and main character of one of the most infamous crime stories of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Born on 7 March 1901 in [[Knin]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], she was found guilty of murder of Elzbieta Zaremba, daughter of Henryk Zaremba, an architect from [[Lwow]]. The murder, which took place on 30 December  1931, and the subsequent trial, were regarded as the biggest crime story of Poland at that time. Gorgonowa, who had a son and two daughters, died in unknown circumstances: her post-1939 fate has not been established.

== Early life ==
Emilia Margerita Ilic was either of Serbian or Croatian origin. Her father was a physician, who died when she was three. Her mother later remarried.

At the age of 15, Margerita married a Colonel of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], Erwin Gorgon. Probably in 1918 she gave birth to a son and settled in Lwow with her husband's family. In 1921, Erwin Gorgon left Poland and, in search of work, emigrated to the [[United States]]. Soon afterwards, Rita was forced by her in-laws to leave their house, as they had wrongly accused her of immoral behaviour{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Gorgonowa, who was regarded as a very attractive woman, left her son with the in-laws and supported herself by working as a governess.

== Working with the Zaremba family ==
In 1924, Gorgonowa became a governess at the house of the 41-year-old architect Henryk Zaremba. She lived at his villa in Brzuchowice, located 7 kilometers from Lwow. Prior to employing Gorgonowa, Zaremba had separated from his wife, who had been confined to an asylum as she suffered from mental problems{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Zaremba and his ex-wife had two children: a daughter, Elzbieta (Lusia), born in 1914 and a son, Stanislaw, born 1917.

In addition to her governess duties, Gorgonowa ran the house. After about a year, Gorgonowa and Zaremba began an affair which eventually let to daughter Romana's birth in 1928. Gorgonowa later claimed that she was hoping to marry the wealthy architect. Meanwhile, the close relationship between her father and her governess was noticed by teenage Lusia, who often argued about this with her father.

== Murder ==
In the night of 30–31 December 1931, Elzbieta (Lusia), who was sleeping in her bed, was hit in the head by a blunt object, probably an [[ice pick]], and died on the spot. The murder was discovered by Stanislaw Zaremba, who was awakened by a dog, and alarmed residents of the house. Doctor Ludwik Csala was called for, together with a police officer, who scanned the room.

Since circumstantial evidence pointed at Gorgonowa, she was immediately arrested. Also, Henryk Zaremba, suspected of cooperation with murderers, was locked for six weeks. Furthermore, police detectives interviewed a gardener and a teenage boy from Brzuchowice, who was secretly in love with Lusia.

During the interrogation, Gorgonowa maintained her innocence. Police specialists came to the conclusion, that the murder had been carried out by a resident of the house, as there were no footsteps on the windowsill and in the snow around the building. Furthermore, no traces of a break-in were found, and family dog Lux did not bark that night. According to official police report, Gorgonowa crossed the corridor from her room to Lusia's room, killing the girl. She then opened the window, and penetrated her victim's vagina with a finger, trying to make it appear as a rape. Upon leaving Lusia's room, Gorgonowa noticed Lux the dog, whom she hit in the head. The canine wailed, waking Stas Zaremba, who was sleeping in the dining room. The boy entered the corridor, noticing a person dressed in a sheepskin, standing next to a Christmas tree. Stas later claimed that it was Rita.

Unable to get back to her bedroom, Gorgonowa ran out through front door. While entering her bedroom, she broke a small window, cutting her finger. She then changed her nightdress and joined other residents of the house, who had been alarmed by Stas. On 31 December Gorgonowa threw the ice pick into a pool, losing a candle. Later on, a bloodstained handkerchief was found, also traces of blood were found on Rita's sheepskin. The blood on the handkerchief and the sheepskin was type A, while Gorgonowa's blood was type 0. Nevertheless, findings of police experts were undermined by famous scientist from Lwow, [[Ludwik Hirszfeld]].

== Trial ==
On 14 May 1932, after a short trial, District Court at Lwow sentenced Rita Gorgonowa to death. Due to a number of legal mistakes and appeals of her defence (Mieczyslaw Ettinger of [[Warszawa]], Jozef Wozniakowski of Kraków and Maurycy Axer of Lwow), the verdict was later changed by the Supreme Court. While in prison, Margerita gave birth to daughter Ewa, on 20 September 1932. In the meantime her case was moved to the District Court in [[Kraków]], which on 29 April 1933 sentenced Rita to eight years. Gorgonowa was to be released on 24 May 1940 but due to the [[German Invasion of Poland]] she was released on 3 September 1939.

Further fate of Rita Gorgonowa is unknown. Her daughters claim that she survived [[World War II]]. According to some sources, she moved to [[Silesia]] or ran a newsstand in [[Opole]]. Other sources claim that she left Poland and settled in [[South America]].

In 1977, a feature film ''The Case of Gorgonowa'' was made by director [[Janusz Majewski (director)|Janusz Majewski]], with [[Ewa Dalkowska]] playing the role of Rita. In 2014 Rita's daughter Ewa and daughter in-law Margarita Ilic-Lisowska declared their intention to re-open the trial and change of the verdict.

His father is Soleyman ibn Esmaeel Bahrani Tubeli Katkatani (Tubel is one of the Bahrain cities and Katkatan is a village of it) and their ancestry reach to [[Musa ibn Ja'far]] (seventh Shia imam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawzahnews.com/TextVersionDetail/380625|title= به یاد عالمی که۵۲ اثر در هفت علم تألیف کرد |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions about Allameh Bahrani==
*Rovzatol'Jannat author writes: "This noble scholar work on Hadiths and news that no one work on it except the great Islamic scholar [[Allameh Majlesi]]. Bahrani has written many books, but I'm not seeing a book about his fatwas and religious orders, he is only collected and compiled. In all of his book that reached to me, he dont preferred the spoken statement or an argument or comments and promises to others. Bahrani after Sheikh Mohammed ibn Majed, appointed as reference of religious affairs and he carried out judicial and arbitration and probate matters in best way, he was also very active in enjoining good and forbidding wrong, and developing justice."
*He is also known as the "Queen of justice" between Islamic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=|title= دائرةالمعارف تشیع، ج۳، ص۱۰۶ و ۱۰۷ |author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shukri Mohammed Ghanem''' ({{lang-ar|شكري محمد إمحمد غانم}} October 1942 &amp;ndash; 29 April 2012) was a [[Libya]]n politician who was the [[List of heads of government of Libya|General Secretary]] of the [[General People's Committee of Libya]] (prime minister) from June 2003 until March 2006 when, in the first major government re-shuffle in over a decade, he was replaced by his deputy, [[Baghdadi Mahmudi]]. Ghanem subsequently served as the Minister of Oil until 2011. On 29 April 2012, his body was found floating on the [[New Danube]], [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=8289|title=Former Libyan PM, Oil Exec Ghanem Dies in Austria|work=[[Tripoli Post]]|date=29 April 2012|accessdate=30 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507061014/http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=8289|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ajdeath&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/04/201242918484367273.html|title=Ex-Libyan oil minister's body found in Danube|work=Al Jazeera|date=30 April 2012|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] he reportedly "fled",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Live blog|work=Al Jazeera|date =21 February 2011|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/02/17/live-blog-libya|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the city of [[Ra's Lanuf]] was recaptured by pro-government forces, [[Associated Press|AP]] reported on 13 March that he asked [[Eni|Eni SpA]] for help with putting out a fire at the [[Ra's Lanuf Refinery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianbusiness.com/markets/market_news/article.jsp?content=D9LU9JB00 Libya oil minister seeks help from Italy's Eni in extinguishing fire at Ras Lanouf facility]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May, Al Arabiya and the NTC reported that Shukri Ghanem defected to [[Tunisia]]. The next day Tunisian security officials confirmed he had indeed defected into Tunisia.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576328542926545706?mod=asia_home|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal| first1=Richard|last1=Boudreaux|title=Oil Chief Leaves Libya As Regime Is Targeted|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ghanem was born in [[Tripoli]] on 9 October 1942.&lt;ref name=trevor/&gt; He studied economics at [[Garyounis University]] in [[Benghazi]] and graduated in 1963.&lt;ref name=trevor/&gt; He also held PhD in international economics from the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]] and Harvard University in 1975.&lt;ref name=tel30apr12/&gt;

==Career==
Ghanem was previously in charge of the [[OPEC]] secretariat, and was the Director of its Research Division. He served as Deputy Director and Director of Foreign Trade at the Ministry of Economy in Libya; was Director of Marketing of Libya's [[National Oil Corporation]] (NOC); was Director of Economic Affairs and Under Secretary and Chief Advisor at the Ministry of Petroleum in Libya. In 2003, Ghanem was appointed General Secretary of the General People's Committee or Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=tel30apr12&gt;{{cite news|title=Shukri Ghanem|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9237196/Shukri-Ghanem.html|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, Ghanem was appointed Chairman of Libya's NOC. He tendered his resignation from NOC in August 2009 amidst probable disagreements within the Libyan government over the development of the oil sector.

After defection to Vienna in 2011, he served as a consultant for a Vienna-based company until his death.&lt;ref name=dmail30apr12/&gt;

==Post Lockerbie bombing raproachment==
[[Libya]] had been diplomatically isolated and subject to international sanctions since the November 1991 [[indictment]] of two Libyans for the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] on 21 December 1988 (the [[Lockerbie bombing]]). Following Ghanem's appointment as prime minister, Libya successfully sought re-entry into the international community and the lifting of sanctions. Ghanem was seen as the main spokesman and architect of this rapprochement, which included paying [[United States dollars|$]]2.16 billion compensation in August 2003 to the families of the 270 people who died in the bombing, and renouncing [[weapons of mass destruction]].

In February 2004, Ghanem was interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 ''Today'' program.&lt;ref name=bbcradio4&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomson|first=Mike|title=The Libyan Prime Minister|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/misc/libya_20040224.shtml|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=BBCRadio 4|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stirred controversy in the interview by repudiating Libya's responsibility both for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and the 1984 murder of British [[woman police constable|WPC]] [[Yvonne Fletcher]] (who was shot and killed in April 1984 outside the Libyan Embassy in London). This incident led to the severing of UK/Libya diplomatic relations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the problems we [Libya] have been facing because of the sanctions, the loss of money, we thought that it was easier for us to buy peace and this is why we agreed a compensation," Ghanem said in the interview.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked whether the payment of compensation meant that Libya did not accept any guilt or responsibility, Ghanem replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I agree with that, and this is why I say we bought peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under pressure from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Ghanem's comments were quickly retracted by [[Gaddafi]].

It is unclear whether Shukri Ghanem's dismissal as prime minister in 2006 was a consequence of those controversial remarks he made two years earlier.

In junior high and high school he played Football, Basketball and ran track for five years and was a starter in football from his sophomore year through senior playing both ways, as quarterback and free safety.

Although he was college material, only Georgia offered him football scholarship where became a starter in his sophomore year. Huntsville Independent School District 1976–1980.

== College career ==

Hoage attended the University of Georgia, where he played for coach [[Vince Dooley]]'s [[Georgia Bulldogs football]] team from 1980 to 1983.  As a junior and again as a senior, was a recognized as a consensus first [[All-American]].  Coach Dooley called Hoage "the best defensive player I've ever coached and maybe the best one I've ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosida.com/news.asp?id=440 Academic All-America Hall of Fame Class Inducted]&lt;/ref&gt;  He finished fifth in the voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heisman.com/winners/m-rozier83.html 1983 Heisman Trophy voting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030194828/http://www.heisman.com/winners/m-rozier83.html |date=2006-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from Georgia in 1985 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in genetics with a 3.85 grade point average.  Terry's college roommate, [[Mike Hubbard (politician)|Mike Hubbard]], became the first Republican Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives in 136 years.

== Professional career ==

Hoage was selected by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the third round (sixty-eight pick overall) of the [[1984 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/schools/GA Draft history for UGA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111203052/http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/schools/GA |date=2006-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His NFL career spanned 13 seasons and six teams: the New Orleans Saints, [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Washington Redskins]], [[Houston Oilers]], [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Arizona Cardinals]]. His professional football career ended in 1996. Hoage scored his only NFL touchdown in the first game of the 1988 season when he rushed for a 38-yard touchdown against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frank |first= Reuben|date=September 6, 2018|title=Roob's 10 observations: Nick Foles' strange career, Jason Peters' age, 2018 predictions  |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/eagles/roobs-10-observations-nick-foles-strange-career-jason-peters-age-2018-predictions-repeat-super-bowl-nfl |work=CSNPhilly |location=Philadelphia |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life after football ==
After retiring from football, Hoage interned at [[Merrill Lynch]], passed the [[Series 7 exam]], and seemed on his way to a career in finance. However, as he would recall in a 2012 interview, "I absolutely hated it. The coat and tie. Going to the office. It didn't fit my personality at all." He and his wife Jennifer, along with their two children, then moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where he started a construction company, but were still not satisfied with their family life. They then moved to [[Templeton, California]], a small [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] town. He had one further opportunity to become involved in the game, but turned down [[Jeff Fisher]]'s offer of a coaching position with the [[Tennessee Titans]]. Hoage then began farming a small piece of land in the area.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepostgame.com/blog/chompions/201203/former-georgia-great-terry-hoage-wins-losing-game-wine-making |title=Former Georgia Great Terry Hoage Wins At The Losing Game Of Wine Making |first=Adam |last=Watson |work=The Post Game |publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]] |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Hoages discovered a {{convert|26|acre|m2|adj=on}} vineyard in [[Paso Robles, California]] that had just come on the market. Terry called in Justin Smith, a friend and winemaker who would go on to produce a wine named by ''[[Wine Spectator]]'' as Wine of the Year, to evaluate the land. [[Yahoo! Sports]] writer Adam Watson said that Hoage's involvement with Smith was "the equivalent of shopping for a computer with a young Bill Gates." When Smith indicated that the property had world-class potential, the Hoages bought the property, moved onto it, and enlisted Smith to help them get started in the business. The association with Smith gave the Hoages credibility as they started their business, and they took over the winemaking in 2004.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

They were named among the Top New California Wine Producers in 2008 by ''Wine Spectator''.  The vineyard is operated as '''Terry Hoage Vineyards''' and produces Rhone varietal wines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terryhoagevineyards.com/ Terry Hoage Vineyards]&lt;/ref&gt; Hoage produces roughly 2,000 cases a year. The vineyard's first wine was The Hedge a Syrah.  The "Hedge" refers both to a pruning technique and the fabled Hedges of the University of Georgia's [[Sanford Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Sports Illustrated, July 2, 2007, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoage dedicated his first vintage of The Hedge to his former coach, Vince Dooley. Hoage's later wines have been marketed with names of a similar concept, playing off both his football and winemaking careers. "46" refers to the [[46 defense]] created by [[Buddy Ryan]], for whom Hoage played eight seasons, and [[California State Route 46|Highway 46]], that runs into Paso Robles. "Skins" refers both to the Redskins and grape skins. "5 Blocks" comes from Hoage's five blocked field goals at Georgia, plus the specific area of grapes used.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;
