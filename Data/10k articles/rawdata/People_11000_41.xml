      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5024">'''Abdul Halim''' or '''Abdel Halim''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الحليم}}) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Halim]]''. The name means "servant of the all-clement", ''Al-Halīm'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt; {{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''u''. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part can be transliterated Halim, Haleem or Haliem, and the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

==Early life==
Kim Aerim was born in Sinelnikovo, a Korean village in Siberia. At the time, the area was a hotbed of Korean [[nationalism]]. In 1869, her father, Kim Du Suh, had emigrated to Russia, adopting the name Piotr Kim and converting to Orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref name=Lankov/&gt; He worked as a translator. Later he went to [[Manchuria]] to work as an interpreter on the railway. In 1895, Alexandra joined him in China. Soon after her arrival in China, Kim Du Suh died. Alexandra was adopted by Jozef Stankevich, a Russian friend of her father.&lt;ref name=Lankov/&gt; She attended a girls school in [[Vladivostok]], [[Siberia]]. After finishing her education, she began working as a teacher in a primary school. She got married to Stankevich's son.&lt;ref name="kimsoft"&gt;[http://www.kimsoft.com/war/r-13-4.htm 13.4.

==Political activism==
Kim gave up teaching and moved back to Vladivostok, where she took part in political activities for the cause of Korean migrants.

Her marriage did not last long. She divorced her husband and shifted to the [[Urals]] region. In the Urals she began political activism. In 1916, she joined the [[RSDLP (Bolshevik)|Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)]]. In 1917, [[Lenin]] sent her back to Siberia to mobilize Koreans there against the counter-revolutionary forces and the Allied Expeditionary Forces.

In [[Khabarovsk]] she was in charge of external affairs at the Far-Eastern Department of the Party. There she met with [[Yi Dong-Wi]], [[Kim Rip]] and other Korean independence fighters. Together they founded the [[Korean Socialist Party]] in Khabarovsk on April 28, 1918.&lt;ref name="kimsoft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/1632.html Association for Asia Research- Who were the Soviet Koreans?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture==
Kim was captured, along with many other Korean communists, by [[Whites (Russia)|White]] forces and Japanese troops on September 4, 1918. She was executed on September 16, 1918. Reportedly, her last words were "Freedom and Independence for Korea!"&lt;ref name="kimsoft"/&gt;

== Background ==

Geiser was born in the former [[Yugoslavia]], in the village of [[Selci Đakovački]] (part of [[Đakovo]]) in eastern [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="2006memo"/&gt;  In September 1942, shortly following the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] by [[Nazi Germany]], Geiser, an ethnic German, was drafted into the [[Waffen SS]].  He was 17 years old at the time.&lt;ref name="pittsburghlive"/&gt;

== SS career ==

Once in the SS, he was chosen to be a member of the SS-Totenkopfverbände, the so-called "Death's Head Battalion" that most concentration camp guards belonged to.  He was sent to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] near [[Oranienburg]] for training, where he was told that as a matter of policy prisoners attempting escape were to be shot.&lt;ref name="us_v_geiser"/&gt;  While there, he served as a perimeter guard and escorted prisoners to and from labor sites.  Later, he served at the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in a similar capacity, escorting prisoners to the Arolsen subcamp as necessary and finally aiding with the evacuation of Arolsen's prisoners back to Buchenwald when the subcamp was closed near the war's end.&lt;ref name="us_v_geiser"/&gt;

== Life after World War II ==

After World War II ended, Geiser lived in Germany for three years before moving to Austria in 1948 to be with his girlfriend, Theresia (1925-2011&lt;ref&gt;Dates of birth and death for Theresia Geiser per the United States [[Social Security Death Index]]&lt;/ref&gt;). He married Theresia in Austria before immigrating to the United States in 1956. After arriving in the United States, Geiser settled in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]], about 75 miles (120&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Pittsburgh]], and worked as a steel worker for Sharon Steel Corporation before retiring in 1987, raising three children in the process. He became naturalized as a United States citizen on March 27, 1962.&lt;ref name="sharonherald2"&gt;{{cite web

== Loss of US citizenship, deportation, and death ==

By the late 1990s, Geiser was under investigation by the United States government's [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]] for his World War II-era activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

United States]]'', which specifically established the precedent that voluntary or involuntary assistants of Nazi persecutions were not eligible for US visas, and therefore that the revocation verbiage of the law applies.

Geiser claimed—and the US government did not dispute—that during his career as an SS guard he was never personally directly responsible for the death of an inmate, and that he in fact was friendly with some of them.&lt;ref name="pittsburghlive"/&gt;  On these grounds he appealed the decision, arguing that the term "persecution" was ambiguous and required clarification, and that in particular it did not apply to him.&lt;ref name="us_v_geiser"/&gt;

The US 3rd circuit court of appeals heard and rejected this argument in 2008.&lt;ref name="us_v_geiser"/&gt;  "Without Anton Geiser and other members of the SS Death's Head guard battalions, the Nazi concentration camp system could not have accomplished its diabolical objectives," said [[Eli Rosenbaum|Eli M. Rosenbaum]],&lt;ref name="prnewswire"/&gt; Director of Human Rights Enforcement Strategy and Policy in the Human Rights and Special Prosecution Section (HRSP), echoing the court's opinion: "As an armed concentration camp guard in World War II, Geiser 'personally advocated or assisted in the persecution of a group of persons because of race, religion, or national origin.' RRA [Refugee Relief Act of 1953] § 14(a).  Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's order granting the Government's motion for summary judgment and revoking Geiser's citizenship."&lt;ref name="us_v_geiser"/&gt; The United States Supreme Court declined to hear Geiser's appeal in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Bill Dauterive''' {{IPAc-en|d|oʊ|ˈ|t|r|iː|v}} (born '''William Fontaine de La Tour Dauterive''', otherwise known as French for "William Fountain of the Tower of the High Bank"; June 22, 1957) is a [[fictional character]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[animated series]] ''[[King of the Hill]]''. He is the Hills' overweight, divorced, and clinically depressed neighbor, voiced by [[Stephen Root]] and named for series producer [[Jim Dauterive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Tribal Television: Viewing Native People in Sitcoms |author=Dustin Tahmahkera |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2014 |isbn=9781469618685 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Stephen Root used his background in Southern theater to help him develop the voice of Bill. Root attended the [[University of Florida]], and had performed in Southern plays in [[New York City]] prior to being chosen for the role. He originally auditioned for the role of [[Dale Gribble]], which "didn't feel right" so he then auditioned for Bill.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/random-roles-stephen-root,2110/|title=Random Roles: Stephen Root|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|date=December 20, 2007|publisher=AV Club|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Bill is indicated as coming from an upper-class [[Cajun]] family in [[Louisiana]] (the family lived on a vast estate called the Chateau D'Haute Rive ("castle on the high bank") until his cousin Gilbert was forced to sell it). He speaks fluent Cajun [[French language|French]] and plays the [[accordion]] skillfully, which surprises him just as much as it does everyone else. His father was [[child abuse|abusive]], spanking him regularly, locking him in a rabbit hutch and making him wear dresses (Bill attempts to justify these actions when he mentions them), As of the season 2 episode "The Final Shinsult," Bill's father is presumably still alive (though slowing down in his later years), based upon Bill's remark to Hank that his father "can't even load a hunting rifle anymore," with Bill further commenting that he has to "practically put it in his hands and pull the trigger." By the time of the season 4 episode "A Beer Can Named Desire," Bill's only living male relative is his [[dandy|dandified]] cousin Gilbert, who still lives in Louisiana. By season 11, the two are guardians of the family's secret [[barbecue sauce]] recipe, which Gilbert refuses to allow Bill to sell. (However, Bill eventually gives the recipe to [[Bobby Hill (King of the Hill)|Bobby Hill]] so he can pass it on to his children, thus keeping the Dauterive tradition alive). Though Bill says he never had any children of his own, there is an opened possibility of him getting one or both of his dead cousins' widows pregnant during his stay at the family mansion while Hank was trying to win money by throwing a football into a big Alamo beer can at the New Orleans Superdome during halftime of the Cowboys-Saints game.

Although overweight, balding, and emotionally needy in his later years, Bill was a muscular, confident athlete with long flowing hair in his youth. Nicknamed "The Billdozer", he held Arlen High's career touchdown record until a young athlete named Ricky Suggs broke it years later. Ricky, however, is simply allowed to score the record-breaking touchdown by the other team due to a [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]], rather than playing injured as Bill would have; to regain his honor Bill rejoins the team to score one last touchdown and re-tie the record (he had [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] eligibility due to joining the Army during his senior year). Bill's bright future was derailed when he attended a [[Molly Hatchet]] concert and found his future wife Lenore passed out in his lap in 1991; she would go on to cheat on and humiliate Bill before finally leaving him a broken shell of his former self. Although there appear to be several factors, it can generally be assumed that her leaving him was the major cause of his downward spiral. In the episode "Order of the Straight Arrow," Bill says "I'm so depressed, I can't even blink", upon the reminiscence of his childhood days as an Arrow Scout and remembering his wishes to be a free spirited pilot like his father. Bill's negative self-concept is clearly displayed in the episode "A Firefighting We Will Go"; Bill, Dale, [[Hank Hill|Hank]], and [[Boomhauer]] recall an evening's events, and, while the other three characters imagine themselves in a positive light, Bill imagines himself as being balder, fatter, and more of a glutton than he is in reality. Despite all of this, Bill is loyal and brave in the face of adversity, rescuing the Hills from their house after smelling a gas leak and resuscitating both [[Peggy Hill|Peggy]] and Hank on their front lawn afterwards.

Bill is often a foil for his friends, who verbally and emotionally put him down on a regular basis, either because they don't realize how hurtful their remarks are or because Bill is too dimwitted to mind very much. He is the first person to be mentioned when any character refers to losers or bemoans a misfortune for fear their lives will be ruined, like his. For example, Hank, while telling Peggy that a lawn makes a man and gives him a purpose, says "Without my lawn, I am Bill," which disgusts Peggy as the thought of being with Bill nauseates her to no end. Bill, like [[Dale Gribble]] and Jeff Boomhauer, has a strong admiration for Hank and often seeks his advice before doing anything, and for his help when in trouble. He occasionally gets dragged into Dale's crazy schemes, and often is the one who accidentally ruins them. Of all his acquaintances, Boomhauer seems to be the one who gives him the most respect, possibly because Bill once helped a brokenhearted Boomhauer get over a girl who dumped him. Dale is the one who seems to disrespect him the most, often insulting his misfortune and lifestyle. Bill has an obsessive crush on Peggy, and frequently makes bumbling, inappropriate remarks about her. Although Bill always speaks highly of Peggy and looks to her as the epitome of desire, she looks at him in total contrast—speaking of him as absolute zero.

Although Bill's friends are often disgusted or frustrated at his stupidity and the number of times he has wrecked their plans, they were devastated when it appeared that he had sacrificed himself to save them when they were stuck on a military target zone, with Hank saying that he was a good friend – sweet, loyal, and brave. During their high school years as they have one last blowout in Bill's honor as he's being shipped off a drunken Hank stirs up a fight with a thug at a bar, but Bill intervenes and saves Hank. On some occasions, Bill will fight back, and relentlessly, if pushed enough; upon the words of a fraudulent and condescending doctor who would sarcastically and falsely told him he would lose his legs from diabetes shortly after his diagnosis, and had toyed with Bill's social life and the friends he made along the way, he would exact a beating on him, alongside Hank.

When examining Bill's Army medical history, Dale discovered that Bill was unknowingly made part in an experiment called "Operation: Infinite [[Walrus]]", to create a hybrid soldier capable of operating in freezing cold waters. It is assumed that the experimental drugs are the cause of his weight gain, excessive body hair, baldness, and terrible body odor and breath until it's revealed that he was in the control group given a [[placebo]]. Bill is also shown to have a severe but easily treatable foot fungus, which actually comes in handy once to help Hank get revenge on a fraudulent [[mold]] inspector. Bill was diagnosed with diabetes and was told he would lose his ability to walk, but then later this was contradicted by the inept diagnosing doctor, who says that he only said Bill was ''likely'' to lose his ability to walk from diabetes. Originally the doctor made it seem like Bill would ultimately need to use a wheelchair. (Later, Bill beats him up for this, with Hank standing guard.) Ironically, this "diagnosis" leads Bill to a depressed slump, where he meets Thunder, a wheelchair-using muscle man who plays a wheelchair-friendly version of [[Rugby football|Rugby]]. This then leads Bill to get into better shape while playing the sport and this "cured" his diabetes.

Bill's personal hygiene and other habits are shown to be very poor. As previously mentioned he has severe foot fungus, terrible breath and body odor (when opening the hatch of a tank Bill had stolen, Hank believed there was a dead animal inside due to the smell). Various comments indicate that he doesn't shower or brush his teeth on a regular basis. Bobby states that he has dandruff in spite of being bald. He is regularly shown eating food he finds in or under his couch, and has even been shown to eat food without dishes (as in one episode where he was cooking himself spaghetti, where he broke his only plate and was forced to eat the spaghetti off of his counter and drink the jar of sauce he was going to serve with it). He dumps garbage directly out his kitchen window despite having a garbage can. He has been shown to fall asleep while eating snacks, which attracts animals into his bedroom, though he seems incredulous or apathetic to this. His bathroom is described as disgusting, when asked if they would rather endure a dangerous and painful stunt (ex. stick a wasp up your nose) or shower in Bill's bathroom, his friends always choose the former. When assigned tasks to get his house ready for a family reunion after Nancy and Peggy are assigned the bathroom, both are horrified and desperately try to change assignments. He also has a foot fetish, finding Peggy's unnaturally over-sized feet very appealing, and even tries to take her discarded full-body cast as she convalesces following a disastrous skydive.

Bill is also portrayed as being the poorest of Hank's friends. However, he resides in a similar looking house as all the other members of the main cast (one episode reveals he won it in his divorce). Moreover, although Bill is portrayed as poor he is often seen spending money on extravagant, or needless items. This is likely because he generally does not date nor has any family leaving him with extra income. Moreover, while Dale and Nancy can not afford a plastic surgery in the episode Trouble With The Gribbles Bill offers to pay for it himself, signifying that he may be wealthier then the Gribble family.

Despite being physically out of shape, a target of many pranks, and incompetent in many areas Bill is shown to be a great barber at his local army base, so much so that when in episode "Hank's Bad Hair Day", when the army eliminates barbers,
the base commander makes sure to keep Bill as the base's barber, making him perhaps the only military barber remaining in the army.

== Physical appearance ==
Bill Dauterive is overweight and balding, and often falls victim to [[Dale Gribble|Dale]]'s harassment. Possibly because of low self-esteem and depression, Bill does not regularly brush his teeth, shower, or exercise, only doing these things when dating a woman. When introducing himself to a lawnmower focus group in "Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men", he states that he is 5 ft. 8 in. (173 cm). Although currently overweight Bill is shown to be in incredible shape when first joining the army and when met by old friends they are generally surprised to see how out of shape he became. He is depicted as not meeting the Army's Physical Fitness Standards, however he manages to pass by accidents such as the instructor failing to score him and not wanting to redo the test, or injuring himself prior to the test. In the episode "Tankin' to the Streets", Dale suggests that Bill's weight problems stem from a military program designed to create walrus like soldiers to fight the Russians in the Arctic, however Bill was a member of the placebo group. The likely source of his weight problems comes from depression due to his wife leaving him.

Despite being the most overweight out of the show's main characters Bill does on occasion show glimpses of the athleticism he once possessed. In the episode "Bills are Made to be Broken", Bill is allowed to return to high school to regain his touchdown record because he never graduated and manages to score despite the best efforts of the defense. Also in the episode "Bulk and the Body Buddies", Bill is shown to be able to bulk up and gain muscle relatively fast when he allows a group of muscle builders to work out in his garage. Although Bill is typically easily bullied by his friends, the times he does decide to stand up to himself people generally back away from him suggesting he is physically intimidating despite being overweight, while Dale routinely threatens individuals to no effect due to his small stature.

Bill is also shown as being very tough, while Dale trembles at even the thought of pain, Bill is typically shown working through injuries. In the episode Bill of Sales, he is shown to be a competent sales man and Peggy uses him to win a sales contest, it is shown that Bill works hardest when he is insulted so Peggy continues to push him until he begins to bleed, although Bill continued to work Peggy fired him so that he could get better.

== Romantic relationships ==
Bill Dauterive's ex-wife was named Lenore, who was seen and voiced in the episode "[[Hank and the Great Glass Elevator]]", attempting to worm her way back into Bill's life when he became high profile while dating former Texas governor [[Ann Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED81D7BE95D0C6B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Dallas Morning News Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; During the early seasons, he often pined for Lenore to return after she ran out on him, but he was somewhat successful in getting over her in the episode "Pretty Pretty Dresses" after Hank resorts to pretending to be Lenore. Bill then finally symbolically confronts Lenore for leaving him, and after being told "I don't love you anymore" he becomes enraged and yells "You don't deserve William Fontaine dela Tour Dauterive!". During "[[Hank and the Great Glass Elevator]]", Lenore tries ordering Bill around in front of Ann Richards but he finally tells her off by mooning her. Other relationships include Luanne's mother Leanne Platter ("Leanne's Saga"), which ended when she reverted to her drunken violent ways and stole his truck, and Kahn's mother Laoma Souphanousinphone ("Maid in Arlen"), which was broken up by interference from Kahn, who convinced Bill that his mother was in love with [[astronaut]] [[Harrison Schmitt]], but they then found out Kahn had been lying because seeing the two of them together disgusted him, and reunited with Kahn grudgingly saying they seemed right together (the show originally intended for Bill and Laoma to remain together, but the writing staff changed that plan and simply wrote her out of the series so Bill could remain hilariously unlucky in love, although their relationship is briefly mentioned in one subsequent episode). He also had a brief, mostly sexual, relationship with two of his cousins' widows ("A Beer Can Named Desire"). In the episode "The Untitled Blake McCormick Project," Bill dates a woman named Charlene, and she even moves in with him, however Charlene's past with [[John Redcorn]] complicates matters.  In a later season, he dated Reverend Karen Stroup for a time and even moved her in with him. When Reverend Stroup and Bill began dating, her congregation showed massive disapproval of their Reverend dating anyone, especially Bill. This meant that they had to carry out their relationship in secret. To Bill, this was exciting. He enjoyed the fact that they were having a relationship that was viewed as immoral by their peers. Unfortunately for Bill, when the pressure became too much for Stroup, she stepped down from her Reverendcy so that they could date like normal people. Bill ultimately broke up with Stroup because he found the relationship was no longer exciting when it was not a secret. Due to his ability to keep going after virtually any rejection, Bill is the one able to snap Boomhauer out of his depression when rejected by a woman he truly had feelings for.

Peggy Hill has said and done many cruel things to Bill, both to his face and behind his back with no regards to his feeling. But despite Bill's complete infatuation with Peggy, she seems to loathe him just as much. She brings him endless heartache, though it's not always intentional. For example, during a game of baseball, she once accidentally threw a bean-ball at his head, knocking him to the ground. She then mistakenly threw another at his crotch, putting him in excruciating pain and humiliation. She stole his prized American flag and accidentally destroyed it, driving him to absolute tears.  Another time, angry at his endless pursuit of her, she hit him once at a game, she inadvertently wound up knocking him off the bleachers—his arm later in a sling. She, Dale and Minh studied him to make money for their investing endeavors, but eventually dropped him when he became conscious of it all--deepening his depression. Despite all of this, she says she considers him "a friend."

== Work  ==
Bill holds the fictional [[military occupational specialty]] "barber" in the United States [[Army]] under Ft. Blanda's H company, 10th infantry. His rank has been revealed through dialogue, in scenes of him wearing obsolete olive drab fatigues as being sergeant, and he appears to wear the insignia of E-5 on his Class A uniform in the episode "Old Glory". He has never deployed in his Army career. He briefly served as a recruiter when his position was eliminated for being wasteful, but it was secretly restored when Hank donated a new chair, with a cover job as an electrician. He speaks four to six languages (English, French, and Tagalog for sure), of which he used at least four in the army. It is revealed in one episode that as an athletic young man entering the army, he wanted to serve in the armored cavalry in a tank crew. He also was briefly a [[cosmetologist|professional hair stylist]] with [[Luanne Platter|Luanne]] at the trendy salon Hottyz until it was discovered he wasn't [[homosexual]]. Bill and Luanne eventually worked for Hank's barber, Jack, which brought in a young adult clientele and saved Jack from going out of business.

Several times throughout the series Bill is revealed to be very talented at cutting hair. When Hank receives a bad hair cut, Bill is able to fix it quite easily. He revealed to Hank that he dyed the hair of 53 officers who serve at Ft. Blanda. When given other military duties such as recruiting, he has no success. While working at Hottyz, a high style salon, Bill and Luanne pitch together to host a chair. Luanne increases her sex appeal and Bill pretends to be gay so he won't offend women. They quickly rise to become "first chair." On another episode, it is revealed that the General of the base at won't allow anyone besides Bill cut his hair. 

When he is engaged by other pursuits, such as when he toured with a choir group called the Harmonoholics or when he decided to run his own [[halfway house]], Bill uses up all his personal and sick days from the army almost to the point of going [[AWOL]]; otherwise he doesn't use them at all. He is described as being nice but often depressed and lonely; his overwhelming need to make people like him makes him easily taken advantage of, particularly by Dale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvah.com/programs/kingofthehill/BillDauterive.shtml|title=Bill Dauterive Himself on King Of The Hill|publisher=[[WVAH]]|accessdate=2009-07-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204084036/http://www.wvah.com/programs/kingofthehill/BillDauterive.shtml|archivedate=2008-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is overwhelmingly patriotic. When an American Flag is due to be disposed of by burning (as is principal practice), he offers to take the flag and hoist it over his home. When Kahn dares to so much as attempt to lower the flag, Bill lunges at Kahn fiercely. When the flag is destroyed, Bill cries terribly. 

In the episode "Bill of Sales" it is also suggested that Bill has emotionally masochistic tendencies—explaining his lust for Peggy. No one finds Bill more repellent than she does—and everyone finds Bill very repellent. After learning this, Peggy's attempt to, in her words, "'motivate' him, business term, with a little 'praise', my term, he goes plumb loco, Spanish term." Hank's response, "You must have confused him; being dumped on is all Bill knows" leads Peggy to conclude that "Bill has had a hard life and he likes it that way" and subsequently refers to him as a "nut job". She manages to persuade him to go back to work for her by verbally abusing him. However, she soon fires him out of feelings of guilt for taking advantage of his low self-esteem. It's also during this episode that Bill shows exceptional skills as a salesman, helping Peggy achieve her sales quotas quickly. However, it could be seen as Bill didn't want to betray Hank (afraid that Peggy was coming onto him), and the reason for going back to help Peggy was fear she didn't want to even talk to him anymore.

According to ''Drawn to Television'' by M. Keith Booker, Bill "is a lonely figure who adds a touch of pathos to the humor of King of the Hill, which is often bittersweet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker |first=M. Keith |title=Drawn to Television |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|pages=72|isbn=978-0-275-99019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jim Bawden of the [[Toronto Star]] describes Bill as a "sad sack".  Voicing Bill and a couple other characters on the show is Stephen Root's favorite job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Television/article/268287|title=Root having a hoot|last=Bawden|first=Jim|date=October 20, 2007|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chingiz Ildyrym oglu Sultanov''' ({{lang-az|Çingiz İldırım oğlu Sultanov}}) (1890–1937) better known as '''Chingiz Ildyrym''', was an Azerbaijani [[Bolshevik]] [[revolutionary]], innovator and the first [[Minister of Defense (Azerbaijan)|People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs of Azerbaijan]] after the [[Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|Sovietization of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name=kommunist&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kommunist.az/index.php?adid=20090815200811&amp;lang=1| title= İldırımlı yollarla|trans-title=On path of a lightening| accessdate= 2010-07-16| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111004155655/http://www.kommunist.az/index.php?adid=20090815200811&amp;lang=1| archivedate= 2011-10-04| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ildyrym was born to the family of a landowner in [[Qubadli]] settlement of Zangezur [[uyezd]] of [[Elisabethpol Governorate]] (present day [[Azerbaijan]]) on July 10, 1890. He studied at a local school established by his father, continued his [[secondary education]] in [[Shusha]] and then [[Vladikavkaz]] completing it in 1909. He was then admitted to [[Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University]] to study mount-mining. While a student, he lost his father and had to work around the clock to be able to support himself. In 1916, he graduated from the university with a specialty in [[Metallurgy]] Engineering and got a job at ''Ayvaz'' plant. Involved in public protests after Russia's [[February Revolution]], he took a part in the gathering to meet [[Vladimir Lenin]] returning from Finland at [[Saint Peterburg]] railway station on April 3, 1917. Impressed by his speech, Ildyrym decided to commit himself to the [[communist]] movement.&lt;ref name=kommunist/&gt;

==Political career==
Having joined the ranks of the [[Bolshevik]]s, Ildyrym proposed to create Muslim Labor Red Army, then called ''[[Ildyrymmiye]]'', which would defend the Bolshevik governments in regions of Azerbaijan. The first Ildyrymmiye was established in June 1918 in [[Petrograd]] and [[Şimal|Simal]]. The same year, Ildyrymmiye army of 2,000 Azerbaijanis fought against the [[White Army]] in [[Astrakhan]] during the Russian Civil War but due to involvement of [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Dashnak]]s siding with Bolsheviks in massacres  of Azerbaijanis during [[March Days]] of 1918, Bolsheviks lost their support among Azerbaijanis and the army soon dissolved. In 1919, he returned to Shusha and continued propagating communism. During the existence of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], Ildyrym served as Deputy Commander of [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces#Navy|Azerbaijani Navy]] and chief of the harbor under [[Musavat]]'s leadership although he was a Bolshevik.&lt;ref name=kommunist/&gt; In 1919, he established a special navy expedition to handle transportation of oil to Russia.&lt;ref name="petr"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mirpeterburga.ru/online/history/archive/44/history_spb_44_51-60.pdf | title= Azerbaijanis in Saint Petersburg in 20th-21st centuries| accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, when the 11th Red Army was invading Baku, Ildyrym played an important role in overthrowing the ADR government. With a number of soldiers, he entered Baku Navy school and disarmed the cadets. Later in the day, he captured positions in [[Bailov]], completely taking over the shipyard. All prisoners held in Bailov prison were let free, among them well known revolutionaries Rahim Huseynov, [[Dadash Bunyadzade]] and [[Gasim Ismayilov]]. Once the center of Baku was taken, the Bolsheviks led by Ildyrym surrounded the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] with artillery and presented an ultimatum to Musavat government. On early morning hours of April 28, 1920, after debates in the parliament, the government agreed to terms of the Bolsheviks and ADR ceased to exit.&lt;ref name=kommunist/&gt; With the establishment of Communist regime in Azerbaijan, Chingiz Ildyrym was appointed the first People's Commissar for [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces|Military and Naval Affairs of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name=petr/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1924, Ildyrym worked as Commissar of Public Roads and presented innovative ideas for road construction in Azerbaijan later applied elsewhere in USSR. He built the first [[Railway electrification system|electrified railway]] in the USSR on the Baku-[[Sabunchi]] route.&lt;ref name=petr/&gt; The construction of the [[Baku]]-[[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] railway, stretching 407&amp;nbsp;km in 1924, was his best and most well known project.&lt;ref name=kommunist/&gt;

In 1924-1928, Ildyrym worked as Deputy Chairman of Supreme Agricultural Council. During his term in the entity, he started [[electrification]] policies in Azerbaijan. As a result, 19 electric stations (1500&amp;nbsp;hp) were built in 1924-1927. This stimulated increase in manufacturing abilities of Azerbaijan and in 1927, steel manufacturing department was established at Lieutenant Schmidt (presently Sattarkhan) Plant. In 1925, 65% of the drilling equipment for [[Azerbaijani Oil|Azerbaijani oil fields]] were switched to electric power.&lt;ref name=kommunist/&gt; 

In 1929, Ildyrym was appointed project manager for construction of [[Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works]] and from 1934, he was managing construction of one of centers of Soviet [[metallurgy]], [[Krivoy Rog]].&lt;ref name=kommunist/&gt; During the time of construction boom, Ildyrym was sent to the [[United States]] to arrange shipments of necessary materials for construction of the plant in [[Magnitogorsk]].&lt;ref name=azad&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.pseudology.org/goroda/Magnitka.htm| title= Начальник "Магнитки" |trans-title=Chief of Magnitka| accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and execution==
On July 7, 1937, Ildyrym was arrested by [[NKVD]] and charged with an alleged anti-revolutionary plot. He was held prisoner in [[Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Baku]] and [[Moscow]]. In Moscow, he was first jailed in high security [[Lefortovo Prison]] and then moved to a more severe location - [[Sukhanovka]], infamous for political prisoners. He was sentenced to death by NKVD and his family was notified he had been sentenced to 10 years without permission to communicate with the outside world. He was [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] in the summer of 1937.&lt;ref name=azad/&gt;

'''Christopher Horace Steele-Perkins''' (born 28 July 1947) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[photographer]] and member of [[Magnum Photos]], best known for his depiction of Africa, Afghanistan, England, and Japan.

==Life and career==
Steele-Perkins was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Burma]] in 1947 to a British father and a Burmese mother; but his father left his mother and took the boy to England at the age of two.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise noted, biographical information comes from the profile of Steele-Perkins in ''Contemporary Authors'' vol.&amp;nbsp;211 (Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2003; {{ISBN|0-7876-6635-1}}), pp.&amp;nbsp;378&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up in Burnham-on-Sea.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/10/teds-back-in-town-chris-steele-perkins-photographs-show-teddy-boys&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Christ's Hospital]] and for one year studied chemistry at the [[University of York]] before leaving for a stay in Canada. Returning to Britain, he joined the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], where he served as photographer and picture editor for a student magazine. After graduating in psychology in 1970 he started to work as a freelance photographer, specializing in the theatre, while he also lectured in psychology.

By 1971, Steele-Perkins had moved to London and become a full-time photographer, with particular interest in urban issues, including poverty. He went to [[Bangladesh]] in 1973 to take photographs for relief organizations;&lt;ref name="inourtime"&gt;William Manchester et al., ''In Our Time: The World as Seen by Magnum Photographers'' (New York: Norton, 1989; {{ISBN|0-393-02767-8}}), p.453.&lt;/ref&gt; some of this work was exhibited in 1974 at the Camerawork Gallery (London). In 1973&amp;ndash;74 he taught photography at the Stanhope Institute and the [[University of East London|North East London Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="inourtime" /&gt;

In 1975, Steele-Perkins joined the Exit Photography Group with the photographers Nicholas Battye and Paul Trevor, and there continued his examination of urban problems: Exit's earlier booklet ''Down Wapping''&lt;ref&gt;The booklet states that "Exit is a collective of four photographers: Nicholas Battye, Diane 'Hank' Olson, Alex Slotzkin and Paul Trevor."&lt;/ref&gt; had led to a commission by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] to increase the scale of their work, and in six years they produced 30,000 photographs as well as many hours of taped interviews.&lt;ref name="bjp-survival"&gt;[http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=429391 "Tales of Survival"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''British Journal of Photography,'' 10 January 2007. Accessed 2009-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the 1982 book ''Survival Programmes.'' Steele-Perkins' work included depiction from 1975 to 1977 of street festivals, and prints from ''London Street Festivals'' were bought by the [[British Council]] and exhibited with [[Homer Sykes]]' ''Once a Year'' and [[Patrick Ward (photographer)|Patrick Ward]]'s ''Wish You Were Here''; Steele-Perkins' depiction of [[Notting Hill]] has been described as being in the vein of [[Tony Ray-Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;David Alan Mellor, ''No Such Thing as Society: Photography in Britain 1967&amp;ndash;1987: From the British Council and the Arts Council Collection'' (London: Hayward Publishing, 2007; {{ISBN|978-1-85332-265-5}}), p.52. Mellor talks of the "international touring exhibition ''England at Play''; this may have been an alternative English title for ''Il Regno Unito si diverte'' and it is the subtitle of Ward's book ''Wish You Were Here.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele-Perkins became an associate of the French agency [[Viva (photo agency)|Viva]] in 1976, and three years after this, he published his first book, ''The Teds,'' an examination of [[Teddy Boy|teddy boys]] that is now considered a classic of documentary and even fashion photography.&lt;ref name="guard-top10"&gt;Documentary:
[http://www.magnumphotos.com/archive/c.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.BookDetail_VPage&amp;pid=2K7O3R15SPN1 Page about ''The Teds''], Magnum Photos. Accessed 2009-03-23. Fashion: Max Décharné, "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/22/top10s.london.fashion Max Décharné's top 10 London fashion books]", ''The Guardian,'' 22 November 2005. Accessed 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt; He curated photographs for the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] collection, and co-edited a collection of these, ''About 70 Photographs.''

In 1977 Steele-Perkins made a short detour into "conceptual" photography, working with the photographer Mark Edwards to collect images from the ends of rolls of films taken by themselves and others. These were exposures taken after loading a fresh film and without focusing or aiming. These frames serve to wind the fogged film leader along and to bring unexposed film from the cassette into place for the first exposure. To be sure of having unfogged film in place the photographer winds on a few more frames than are needed and it's these that sometimes showed surprising images. Forty were exhibited in "Film Ends".&lt;ref name="ca211"&gt;Profile in ''Contemporary Authors'' vol.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work documenting poverty in Britain took Steele-Perkins to [[Belfast]], which he found to be poorer than [[Glasgow]], [[London]], [[Middlesbrough]], or [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], as well as experiencing "a low-intensity war".&lt;ref name="warpeace"&gt;"[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4285953.ece War and Peace: Life in Belfast after the Troubles]", ''Times'' (London), 12 July 2008. Accessed 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed in the Catholic [[Falls Road, Belfast|Lower Falls]] area, first [[squatting]] and then staying in the flat of a man he met in Belfast. His photographs of Northern Ireland appeared in a 1981 book written by Wieland Giebel. Thirty years later, he would return to the area to find that its residents had new problems and fears; the later photographs appear within ''Magnum Ireland.''&lt;ref name="warpeace" /&gt;

Steele-Perkins photographed wars and disasters in the third world, leaving Viva in 1979 to join [[Magnum Photos]] as a nominee (on encouragement by [[Josef Koudelka]]), and becoming an associate member in 1981 and a full member in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Miller, ''Magnum: Fifty Years at the Front Line of History'' (New York: Grove, 1998; {{ISBN|0-8021-3653-2}}), p.268.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work in Britain, taking photographs published as ''The Pleasure Principle,'' an examination (in colour) of life in Britain but also a reflection of himself. With [[Philip Marlow (photographer)|Philip Marlow]], he successfully pushed for the opening of a London office for Magnum; the proposal was approved in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Magnum,'' pp. 268&amp;ndash;70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steele-Perkins made four trips to [[Afghanistan]] in the 1990s, sometimes staying with the [[Taliban]], the majority of whom "were just ordinary guys" who treated him courteously.&lt;ref&gt;"Witness: The Taliban are seen as extremists, but photographer Chris Steele-Perkins has captured their humanity", ''Scotland on Sunday,'' 23 September 2001; quoted in the ''Contemporary Authors'' vol.&amp;nbsp;211 profile of Steele-Perkins.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[James Nachtwey]] and others, he was also fired on, prompting him to reconsider his priorities: in addition to the danger of the front line:

&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . you never get good pictures out of it. I've yet to see a decent front-line war picture. All the strong stuff is a bit further back, where the emotions are.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Miller, ''Magnum,'' p.304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A book of his black and white images, ''Afghanistan,'' was published first in French, and later in English and in Japanese. The review in the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' read in part:

{{quote
 |text=These astonishingly beautiful photographs are more moving than can be described; they hardly ever dwell on physical brutalities, but on the bleak rubble and desert of the country, punctuated by inexplicable moments of formal beauty, even pastoral bliss .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. the grandeur of the images comes from Steele-Perkins never neglecting the human, the individual face in the great crowd of history.
 |sign=[[Philip Hensher]]&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hensher, ''The Spectator,'' 19 May 2001; quoted in the ''Contemporary Authors'' vol.&amp;nbsp;211 profile.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book and the travelling exhibition of photographs were also reviewed favorably in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]], [[The Observer|Observer]], [[Library Journal]],'' and London ''[[Evening Standard]].''&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Afghanistan'' by John F. Riddick in the ''Library Journal,'' December 2001; Nick Redman, "9 to 5, Afghan Style," ''Evening Standard,'' 6 April 2001; [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]], "The Guide Thursday: Exhibitions: Chris Steele-Perkins", ''The Guardian,'' 17 August 2000.

With his second wife the [[Television presenter|presenter]] and writer Miyako Yamada ({{nihongo2|山田美也子}}), whom he married in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~genbakue/news/news22.html Kyapa-shō kameraman ga shuzai] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120805205322/http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~genbakue/news/news22.html |date=5 August 2012 }}", Hibakusha ga egaita genbaku no e o machikado ni kaesu kai, n.d. {{ja icon}} [http://www.prixpictet.com/2009/bio/648 Biography] for the 2009 [[Prix Pictet]] shortlist. Both accessed 2010-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Steele-Perkins has spent much time in Japan, publishing two books of photographs: ''Fuji,'' a collection of views and glimpses of the mountain inspired by [[Hokusai]]'s ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]''; and ''Tokyo Love Hello,'' scenes of life in the city. Between these two books he also published a personal visual diary of the year 2001, ''Echoes.''

Work in [[South Korea]] included a contribution to a [[The Hayward|Hayward Gallery]] touring exhibition of photographs of contemporary slavery, "Documenting Disposable People", in which Steele-Perkins interviewed and made black-and-white photographs of Korean "[[comfort women]]". "Their eyes were really important to me: I wanted them to look at you, and for you to look at them", he wrote. "They're not going to be around that much longer, and it was important to give this show a history."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Farah Nayeri, "[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aI2.NshQG2oI&amp;refer=home 'Comfort Women', exploited maids show slavery's face in photos]", Bloomberg News, 8 October 2008.

Steele-Perkins returned to England for a project by the [[Side Gallery]] on Durham's closed coalfields (exhibited within "Coalfield Stories"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amber-online.com/exhibitions/coalfield-stories Exhibition notice], Side Gallery.

In 2008 Steele-Perkins won an [[Arts Council England]] grant for "Carers: The Hidden Face of Britain", a project to interview those caring for their relatives at home, and to photograph the relationships.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/documents/news/phpcIwvHE.pdf Grants for the Arts: December 2008 Awards]" (PDF file), Arts Council England.

After a two-year apprenticeship with [[Kenzo Tange|Kenzo Tange Associates]] in [[Tokyo]], followed by four years working in [[Berlin]] on commercial and master planning projects. In the late 1990s she was employed by Lockheed Martin Space Operations, to support the NASA’s Mars exploration research efforts at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]], where she lived with her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/pressroom/pressreleases/2007/20070328_parsons_taste.html|title=The New School.

Kennedy. “ISS TransHab: A Space Inflatable Habitation Module” Proceedings of Space 2000: The Seventh International Conference and Exposition on Engineering, Construction, Operations and Business in Space (2000); American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston VA&lt;/ref&gt; The module, known as [[TransHab]] ("transit habitat"), was designed to provide living quarters for astronauts aboard the space station, including a [[common room]], gymnasium, shower, etc. Budget considerations and delays, as well as politics, meant that the module failed to develop beyond the design stage.&lt;ref name="nasa2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:H.R.1654.ENR: |title=National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |author=106th Congress |date=24 January 2000 |accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the TransHab project, Adams worked on crew cabin architecture and systems design for the X-38 Crew Return Vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMSPACE08_1872/PV2008_7834.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbital SpacePlane and International Space Station [ISS].

In 2003 and 2004, Adams collaborated with UNDP Senior Water Policy Advisor Ingvar Andersson to organize the "Water for Two Worlds" summit at Columbia University and the UN, bringing representatives of NASA, the European Space Agency, the Columbia Earth Institute and other clean water advocacy groups to design an approach for transferring water cleansing techniques developed for spaceflight to applications that meet the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/news/2004/images/water_lenton.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510112943/http://earth.columbia.edu/news/2004/images/water_lenton.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Adams was named an Emerging Explorer by [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/field/explorers/constance-adams/|title=Find a National Geographic Explorer|first=National Geographic|last=Society|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217212212/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/field/explorers/constance-adams/|archivedate=17 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 2004 to 2010, Adams worked with the International Space Station Program Office and the Japanese Space Agency to integrate the H-II Transfer Vehicle to the ISS.
Partnered with Synthesis International, URS and Foster+Partners, Adams worked on the design of the world's first commercial spaceport terminal, the [[Spaceport America]] Terminal Facility, for the New Mexico Spaceport Authority and tenant Virgin Galactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/spaceport-america/|title=Spaceport America – Foster + Partners|first=Foster + Partners /|last=www.fosterandpartners.com|website=www.fosterandpartners.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514004124/http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/spaceport-america/|archivedate=14 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was considered one of the first experts in spaceport planning,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Constance, and Georgi Petrov. “Spaceport Master Planning: Principles and Precedents” AIAA-2006-7325, 2nd AIAA International Space Architecture Symposium, San Jose, CA, USA, September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and lectured widely in design as well as science topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jason.org/live/live.aspx?eid=6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420070418/http://www.jason.org/live/live.aspx?eid=6 |archivedate=20 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.jason.org/public/WhatIs/CurrOIPMeet.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303035344/http://www.jason.org/public/WhatIs/CurrOIPMeet.aspx |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }};&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuddles_and_Dimples_from_The_Dandy.jpg|thumb]]
'''''Cuddles and Dimples''''' is a British comic strip published in the comic book magazine ''[[The Dandy]]''. It was first published in 1986. The stories' protagonists are two toddler brothers who like to cause double the trouble wherever they go. The artist when the strip first started was [[Barrie Appleby]], who continued until 2004 with a strip by [[Gordon Bell (comics)|Gordon Bell]] in the 1994 annual and a sole strip by [[Nigel Parkinson]] in 2003, who took over the strip next year as part of the revamp at that time.

==History of the comic==

Cuddles and Dimples actually started out as two separate [[comic strip|strips]]. While Dimples started out in ''The Dandy'' on 27 October 1984, Cuddles had already been in ''[[Nutty]]'' since March 1981. When ''Nutty'' merged with ''The Dandy'' in 1985, Cuddles did not follow, instead becoming the cover character of [[Hoot (comic book)|''Hoot'']]. ''Hoot'' combined with ''The Dandy'' the following year, and the first ''Cuddles and Dimples'' story showed Cuddles' family moving to Dandytown, where he met Dimples. This took place in issue 2345, dated 1 November 1986. By late 1987, without explanation, one set of parents disappeared (Cuddles'), and the toddlers were said to be twins. Grounds for this change had been somewhat prepared previously by a short-lived spin-off strip called "That's Our Granny" which established that the two boys shared a grandmother.

For many years, the characters appeared in the centre pages (with full colour) of ''The Dandy''. When they first appeared, they appeared in pages 16 and 17 of the then 20-page comic with red and black as the only colours.

The characters took over the front page of ''The Dandy'' from issue 3008 (July 1999) until October 2000, when they got 'thrown out' for misbehaving too much (in reality, readers wanted Desperate Dan back on the cover). They were both preceded and succeeded on the cover by [[Desperate Dan]].
By the time of the revamp in October 2004, Cuddles and Dimples were assigned to [[Nigel Parkinson]] to freshen up their look (prior to the new look, the strip had been reprinted since early 2004). Dimples was made the older brother and now has a patch of Brown Hair. He also became vaguely intelligent. Cuddles look was toned down from the grotesque little monster he was before, and was made the younger, more naive and disgusting brother. Both of them appeared slightly less childish; for example, they no longer called their parents "Mumsie and Daddums", instead calling them Mum and Dad. Their parents were also revamped, dad being a pot-bellied balding idiot and mum an up-to-date babe or a [[Yummy Mummy (slang)#Yummy mummy|yummy mummy]]. The strip was axed with ''The Dandy''{{'}}s revamp in October 2010; however, they returned in reprints from February 2012 onwards.

'''Dennis Bardens''' (born 19 July 1911 in [[Midhurst|Midhurst, Sussex]] — 7 February 2004 [[London]]) "played a brief, but crucial, role in broadcasting history"&lt;ref name="GuardianObit" /&gt; as the founder of the BBC television programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', a show which would later inspire the American television show ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Dennis Bardens was a freelance London journalist for most of his career.

==Biography==

According to his obituary Bardens journalistic career involved work at all the major London newspapers, and even a stint as a spy during World War II.&lt;ref name="GuardianObit"&gt;{{cite news | first=Hills | last=Car | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Dennis Bardens, Occult writer who founded Panorama | date=2004-02-21 | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | url =https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/21/guardianobituaries.media | work =The Guardian | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-04 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of The Guardian:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Meanwhile, Bardens was proving himself as a journalist, working, during the 1930s, for the Sunday Chronicle, Sunday Express and Daily Mirror. In 1940, he became a distinguished reporter of the Blitz. After discharge from the Royal Artillery on medical grounds, he spent two years with the Ministry of Information, and was in charge of coordinating plans for newspaper services in Britain in the event of a German invasion. In 1943, he was transferred to liaison work with the Czechoslovak government in exile, which included, at the end of the war, secret service work in Czechoslovakia."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the war Bardens published history and biography in addition to his occasional journalism. These include, the following, which is not an inclusive list.

:Elizabeth Fry (1961)
:Churchill in Parliament (1969)
:Portrait of a statesman: the personal life story of Sir Anthony Eden (1955)
:Lord Justice Birkett (1962)	
:Princess Margaret (1965)
:A History of [[Barrow Hepburn &amp; Gale]] (1947)

Dennis Barden's books also demonstrate his interest in psychic phenomena, an interest he shared with his good friend, [[Austin Osman Spare]]. Bardens wrote ''Ghosts and Hauntings'' 1965, Mysterious Worlds (1970) and ''Psychic Animals: An Investigation of Their Secret Powers'' (1990).

Bardens was a member of [[The Ghost Club]] and [[Ghost Club Society]], as well as [[International Pen]], the [[Society of Authors]] and the [[National Union of Journalists]].

'''Georg Paul Thomann''' (March 13, 1945 – July 21, 2005), purported to be a renowned [[Austrians|Austrian]] conceptual artist of the late 20th century. In reality, he was the [[List of fictitious people|fictitious creation]] of the Austrian art group [[monochrom]].

Art group [[monochrom]] was chosen to represent the Republic of [[Austria]] at the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]], [[São Paulo]] ([[Brazil]]) in 2002. However, the political climate in Austria (at that time, the center-right [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] had recently formed a coalition with [[Jörg Haider]]'s radical-right [[Austrian Freedom Party]]) gave the left-wing art group concerns about acting as wholehearted representatives of their nation. Monochrom dealt with the conundrum by creating the persona of Georg P. Thomann, an irascible, controversial (and completely fictitious) artist of longstanding fame and renown. Through the implementation of this ironic mechanism – even the catalogue included the biography of the non-existent artist – the group solved with pure fiction the philosophical and bureaucratic dilemma attached to the system of representation presented to them by the Biennial.

A further development related to Georg Paul Thomann took place once the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] was underway. The artist [[Chien-Chi Chang]] was invited as the representative of [[Taiwan]], but the country's name was removed by the administration from his cube overnight and replaced by the label, "Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei". As the members of monochrom discovered, China had threatened to retreat from the Biennial (and create massive diplomatic problems) if the organizers of the Biennial were thought to be challenging the "[[One-China policy]]". Chang's open letter remained unanswered. Under the guise of Thomann, monochrom invited artists from several countries to show their solidarity with Chang by taking the adhesive letters from their countries' name tags and giving them to Chang so that he could remount "Taiwan" outside his room. Monochrom wanted to show that artists do not necessarily have to internalize the fragmentation and isolation imposed by the rat-race of art markets and exhibitions as society-controlling imperatives. Several Asian newspapers reported about the performance. One Taiwanese newspaper headlined: "Austrian artist Georg Paul Thomann saves 'Taiwan'".

In 2005 monochrom released a press info that "Austrian artist and writer Prof. Georg Paul Thomann died in a tragic accident at the tender age of 60." On July 29, 2005 they staged his funeral in [[Hall in Tirol]]. Thomann's gravesite remains in Hall. Georg Paul Thomann's tombstone shows an engraved [[URL]] of the Thomann project page.

Georg Paul Thomann is featured in [[RE/Search]]'s "Pranks 2" book.

Artist Hadas Emma Kedar created a short documentary film called "The Thomann In(ter)vention". It was released in March 2018.

'''George  Horace  Gallup''' (November 18, 1901 – July 26, 1984) was an American pioneer of survey sampling techniques and inventor of the [[Gallup poll]], a successful [[statistics|statistical method]] of [[survey sampling]] for measuring [[opinion polls|public opinion]].

==Life and career==
[[File:George Gallup 2001 Romania stamp.jpg|thumb|235px|George Gallup on a 2001 Romania stamp]]
[[File:Grave of George H. Gallup.jpg|thumb|right|Grave in Princeton Cemetery]]
Gallup was born in [[Jefferson, Iowa]], the son of Nettie Quella (Davenport) and George Henry Gallup, a dairy farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/4459|title=George Horace Gallup (1901-1984) - Find A Grave...|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teen, George Jr., known then as "Ted", would deliver milk and used his salary to start a newspaper at the high school, where he also played football. His higher education took place at the [[University of Iowa]], where he was a football player, a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and editor of ''[[The Daily Iowan]]'', an independent newspaper which serves the university campus. He earned his B.A. in 1923, his M.A. in 1925 and his Ph.D. in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Everett M.|title=Iowa School of Journalism|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/simon052/93043281.html|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then moved to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], where he served as head of the Department of Journalism at [[Drake University]] until 1931. That year, he moved to [[Evanston, Illinois]], as a professor of journalism and advertising at [[Northwestern University]]. The next year, he moved to [[New York City]] to join the advertising agency of Young and Rubicam as director of research (later as vice president from 1937 to 1947). He was also professor of journalism at [[Columbia University]], but he had to give up this position shortly after he formed his own polling company, the American Institute of Public Opinion (Gallup Poll), in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Gallup Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Fi-Gi/Gallup-George.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallup is often credited as the developer of public polling. In 1932, Gallup did some polling for his mother-in-law, [[Ola Babcock Miller]], a candidate who was a long-shot from winning a position as [[Iowa Secretary of State]]. With the Democratic landslide of that year, she won a stunning victory, furthering Gallup's interest in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uipress.lib.uiowa.edu/bdi/DetailsPage.aspx?id=271|title=Miller, Eunice Viola Babcock – The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa -The University of Iowa|website=uipress.lib.uiowa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, his new organization achieved national recognition by correctly predicting, from the replies of only 50,000 respondents, that [[Franklin Roosevelt]] would defeat [[Alf Landon]] in the U.S. Presidential election. This was in direct contradiction to the widely respected ''[[Literary Digest]]'' magazine whose poll based on over two million returned questionnaires predicted that Landon would be the winner. Not only did Gallup get the election right, he correctly predicted the results of the ''Literary Digest'' poll as well using a random sample smaller than theirs but chosen to match it.

Twelve years later, his organization had its moment of greatest ignominy, when it predicted that [[Thomas Dewey]] would defeat [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 election]], by five to fifteen percentage points. Gallup believed the error was mostly due to ending his polling three weeks before Election Day.

In 1947, he launched the [[Gallup International Association]], an international association of polling organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3n5BA5Z_Of0C&amp;pg=PA111| author=Wolfgang Donsbach and Michael W. Traugott| title=The SAGE handbook of public opinion research| publisher=Social Science| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, with [[Claude E. Robinson]], he founded [[Gallup and Robinson]], Inc., an [[advertising research]] company.

In 1958, Gallup grouped all of his polling operations under what became [[The Gallup Organization]].

Gallup died in 1984 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his summer home in [[Sigriswil|Tschingel ob Gunten]], a village in the [[Bernese Oberland]] of [[Switzerland]]. He was buried in [[Princeton Cemetery]]. His wife died in 1988, and their son, writer and pollster [[George Gallup, Jr.]], died in 2011.&lt;ref name=dfp&gt;{{cite news|title=N.Y.

'''Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin''' ({{IPAc-en|r|æ|ˈ|s|p|j|uː|t|ɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rasputin "Rasputin"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-rus|Григо́рий Ефи́мович Распу́тин}} {{IPA-ru|ɡrʲɪˈɡorʲɪj jɪˈfʲiməvʲɪtɕ rɐˈsputʲɪn|}}; {{OldStyleDate|21 January|1869|9&amp;nbsp;January}}&amp;nbsp;– {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1916|17 December}}) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[mysticism|mystic]] and self-proclaimed holy man who befriended the family of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]], the last [[List of Russian rulers|monarch of Russia]], and gained considerable influence in late imperial Russia.

Born to a peasant family in the Siberian village  of [[Pokrovskoye, Tyumen Oblast]], Rasputin had a religious conversion experience after taking a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897. He has been described as a monk or as a "strannik" (wanderer, or [[pilgrim]]), though he held no official position in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. After traveling to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or the winter of 1904–5, Rasputin captivated some church and social leaders. He became a society figure, and met the Tsar in November 1905.

In late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a healer for the Tsar and his wife [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra]]'s son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei]], who suffered from [[hemophilia]] and was Nicholas' only heir ([[Tsarevitch]]). At court, he was a divisive figure, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, and by others as a religious [[charlatan]]. The high point of Rasputin's power was in 1915, when Nicholas II left St Petersburg to oversee Russian armies fighting [[World War I]], increasing both Alexandra and Rasputin's influence. As Russian defeats in the war mounted, however, both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. In the early morning of {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1916|17 December}}, Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative noblemen who opposed his influence over Alexandra and the Tsar.

Historians often suggest that Rasputin's terrible reputation helped discredit the tsarist government, and thus helped precipitate the overthrow of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]], which happened a few weeks after he was assassinated. Very little about Rasputin's life and influence is certain, however, as accounts have often been based on hearsay, rumor, and legend.

==Early life==
[[File:Gorskii 04663u.jpg|thumb|Pokrovskoye in 1912]]
[[File:Raspoutine et ses enfants.jpg|thumb|Rasputin with his children]]

Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of [[Pokrovskoye, Tyumen Oblast|Pokrovskoye]], along the [[Tura River]] in the [[Tobolsk Governorate]] (now [[Tyumen Oblast]]) in [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Wilson|1964|p=23-26}} According to official records, he was born on {{OldStyleDate|21 January|1869|9 January}} and christened the following day.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=7}} He was named for [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]], whose feast was celebrated on January 10.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14}}

There are few records of Rasputin's parents. His father, Efim (sometimes spelled Yefim), was a peasant farmer and church elder who had been born in Pokrovskoye in 1842, and married Rasputin's mother, Anna Parshukova, in 1863. Efim also worked as a government courier, ferrying people and goods between [[Tobolsk]] and [[Tyumen]]{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=6}}{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14}} The couple had seven other children, all of whom died in infancy and early childhood; there may have been a ninth child, Feodosiya. According to historian Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin was certainly close to Feodosiya and was godfather to her children, but "the records that have survived do not permit us to say more than that."{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=6}}

According to historian [[Douglas Smith (writer)|Douglas Smith]], Rasputin's youth and early adulthood are "a black hole about which we know almost nothing", though the lack of reliable sources and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about his parents and his youth after Rasputin's rise to fame.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14-15}} Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was never formally educated, and he remained illiterate well into his early adulthood.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=14}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=9}} Local archival records suggest that he had a somewhat unruly youth – possibly involving drinking, small thefts, and disrespect for local authorities – but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy, or bearing false witness, all major crimes that he was later rumored to have committed as a young man.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=16-17}}

In 1886, Rasputin travelled to [[Abalak, Russia|Abalak]], where he met a peasant girl named Praskovya Dubrovina. After a courtship of several months, they married in February 1887. Praskovya remained in Pokrovskoye throughout Rasputin's later travels and rise to prominence, and remained devoted to him until his death. The couple had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood: Dmitry (b. 1895), Maria (b. 1898) and Varvara (b. 1900).{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=17-18}}

==Religious conversion==

In 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons for doing so are unclear: according to some sources, Rasputin left the village to escape punishment for his role in a horse theft.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=14}} Other sources suggest that he had a vision – either of the [[Virgin Mary]], or of [[Simeon of Verkhoturye|St. Simeon of Verkhoturye]] – while still others suggest that Rasputin's pilgrimage was inspired by his interactions with a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=20-21}} Whatever his reasons, Rasputin's departure was a radical life change: he was twenty-eight, had been married ten years, and had an infant son with another child on the way. According to Douglas Smith, his decision "could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis."{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=21}}

Rasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk's cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 was transformative.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=22}} There, he met and was "profoundly humbled" by a ''starets'' (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write, but he later complained about the monastery itself, claiming that some of the monks engaged in homosexuality and criticizing monastic life as too coercive.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=23-25}} He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently than he had before.  He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=17}}

Rasputin would spend the years that followed living as a ''Strannik,'' (a holy wanderer, or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of different holy sites.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=23,26}} It is possible that Rasputin wandered as far [[Mount Athos|Athos]], Greece – the center of Orthodox monastic life – in 1900.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=25-26}}

By the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of [[acolytes]], primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Efim's root cellar – Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time – the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing him before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs that the villagers had not heard before, and even that Rasputin had joined the [[Khlysty]], a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to included self-[[flagellation]] and sexual orgies.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=28}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=19-20}} According to historian Joseph Fuhrmann, however, "repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect," and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=20}}

==Rise to prominence==
[[File:Makarij, Theofan of Poltava and Rasputin, 1909 03.jpg|thumb|Makary, [[Theofan (Bystrov)|Theofan of Poltava]] (Feofan) and Rasputin]]

Word of Rasputin's activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=28}} Sometime between 1902 and 1904, he travelled to the city of [[Kazan]] on the [[Volga river]], where he acquired a reputation as a wise and perceptive ''starets,'' or holy man, who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=50}} Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with some of his female followers,{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=25}} he won over the father superior of the Seven Lakes Monastery outside Kazan, as well as a local church officials [[Archimandrite]] Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave him a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary at the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]], and arranged for him to travel to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or in the winter of 1904–1905.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=50-525}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=47-8}}

Upon meeting Sergei at the Nevsky Monastery, Rasputin was introduced to a number of different church leaders, including [[Theofan (Bystrov)|Archimandrite Feofan]], who was the inspector of the theological seminary, was well-connected in St. Petersburg society, and later served as confessor to the Tsar and his wife.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=29}}{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=66}} Feofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home, and became one of Rasputin's most important and influential friends in St. Petersburg.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=29}}

According to Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg for only a few months on his first visit and returned to Prokovskoye in the fall of 1903.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=30}} Historian Douglas Smith, however, argues that it is impossible to know whether Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg or returned to Prokovskoye at some point between his first arrival there and 1905.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=65}} Regardless, by 1905 Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the "Black Princesses," [[Princess Milica of Montenegro|Militsa]] and [[Princess Anastasia of Montenegro|Anatasia]] of [[Montenegro]], who had married the Tsar's cousins ([[Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich]] and [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich]]), and were instrumental in introducing Rasputin to the Tsar and his family.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=66}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=29-30,39}}

Rasputin first met the Tsar on November 1, 1905, at the [[Peterhof Palace]].  The tsar recorded the event in his diary, writing that he and Alexandra had "made the acquaintance of a man of God – Grigory, from Tobolsk province."{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=65}} Rasputin would not meet the Tsar and his wife again for some months: he returned to Prokovskoye shortly after their first meeting and did not return to St. Petersburg until July 1906.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=69-76}} On his return, Rasputin sent Nicholas a telegram asking to present the tsar with an icon of [[Simeon of Verkhoturye]]. He met with Nicholas and Alexandra on July 18 and again in October, when he first met their children.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41}} At some point, the royal family became convinced that Rasputin possessed the power to heal Alexei, but historians disagree over when: according to Orlando Figes, Rasputin was first introduced to the Tsar and Tsarina as a healer who could help their son in November 1905,{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=30}} while Joseph Fuhrmann has speculated that it was in October 1906 that Rasputin was first asked to pray for the health of Alexei.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41-42}}

==Healer to Alexei==
[[File:Ρασπούτιν.jpg|thumb|Alexandra Feodorovna with her children, Rasputin and the nurse Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova (1908)]]

Much of Rasputin's influence with the royal family stemmed from the belief by Alexandra and others that he had eased the pain and stopped the bleeding of the Tsarevich – who suffered from hemophilia – on several occasions. According to historian [[Marc Ferro]], the Tsarina had a "passionate attachment" to Rasputin as a result of her belief that he could heal her son's affliction.{{sfn|Ferro|1995|p=137}} [[Harold Shukman]] wrote that Rasputin became "an indispensable member of the royal entourage" as a result.{{sfn|Shukman|p=370}}

Rasputin had been rumored to be capable of faith-healing since his arrival in St. Petersburg,{{sfn|Massie|p=163}} and the Tsarina's friend [[Anna Vyrubova]] became convinced that Rasputin had miraculous powers shortly thereafter. Vyrubova would become one of Rasputin's most influential advocates.{{sfn|Massie|p=168}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=46}}

It is unclear when Rasputin first learned of Alexei's hemophilia, or when he first acted as a healer for Alexei. He may have been aware of Alexei's condition as early as October 1906,{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41-42}} and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for Alexei when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|43}}

During the summer of 1912, Alexei developed a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the royal hunting grounds at [[Spala]], which caused a large [[hematoma]].{{sfn|Massie|p=192}} In severe pain and delirious with fever, the Tsarevich appeared to be close to death.{{sfn|Massie|p=193-195}} In desperation, the Tsarina asked Vyrubova to send Rasputin (who was in Siberia) a telegram, asking him to pray for Alexei.{{sfn|Massie|p=195}} Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the Tsarina that "God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much."{{sfn|Massie|p=195}} The next morning, Alexei's condition was unchanged, but Alexandra was encouraged by the message and regained some hope that Alexei would survive. Alexei's bleeding stopped the following day.{{sfn|Massie|p=195}}

Historian [[Robert K. Massie]] has called Alexei's recovery "one of the most mysterious episodes of the whole Rasputin legend."{{sfn|Massie|p=195}} The cause of his recovery is unclear: Massie speculated that Rasputin's suggestion not to let doctors disturb Alexei had aided his recovery by allowing him to rest and heal, or that his message may have aided Alexei's recovery by calming Alexandra and reducing the emotional stress on Alexei.{{sfn|Massie|p=197-8}} Alexandra, however, believed that Rasputin had performed a miracle, and concluded that he was essential to Alexei's survival.{{sfn|Massie|p=198}}

Some writers and historians, such as Ferro, have claimed that Rasputin stopped Alexei's bleeding on other occasions through [[hypnosis]].{{sfn|Ferro|1995|p=137}}

==Controversy==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Rasputin Photo.jpg|thumb|Rasputin among admirers, 1914]]

The royal family{{snd}}and especially Alexandra's{{snd}}belief that Rasputin possessed the power to heal Alexei brought him considerable status and power at court.{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=31}} The Tsar appointed Rasputin his ''lampadnik,'' or lamplighter, who was charged with keeping the lamps that burned in front of religious icons in the palace lit and thus had regular access to the palace and royal family.{{sfn|Ferro|1995|p=138}} By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to the royal family to ask a special favor of the Tsar – that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Novyi (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that the Tsar viewed – and treated – Rasputin favorably at that time.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=41-42}} Rasputin used his status and power to full effect, accepting bribes and sexual favors from admirers{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=31}} and working diligently to expand his influence. He soon became a controversial figure; he was accused by his enemies of religious heresy and rape, was suspected of exerting undue political influence over the tsar, and was even rumored to be having an affair with the Tsarina.{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=32-33}}

Even before Rasputin's arrival in St. Petersburg in 1903, alternative religious movements such as [[spiritualism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] had become increasingly popular among the city's aristocracy, and many of them were intensely curious about the [[occult]] and the supernatural more generally.{{sfn|Figes|1998|p=29}} While fascinated by him, the Saint Petersburg [[elite]] did not widely accept Rasputin. He did not fit in with the royal family, and he and the Russian Orthodox Church had a very strained relationship. The [[Holy Synod]] frequently attacked Rasputin, accusing him of a variety of immoral or evil practices. Because Rasputin was a court official, though, he and his apartment were under 24-hour surveillance, and, accordingly, there exists some credible evidence about his lifestyle in the form of the famous "staircase notes" – reports from [[police]] [[Espionage|spies]], which were not given only to the Tsar but also published in [[newspapers]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Rasputindaughtercropped.jpg|thumb|left|Rasputin with his wife and daughter [[Maria Rasputin|Matryona]] (Maria) in his St. Petersburg apartment in 1911]]

According to Rasputin's daughter, Maria, Rasputin did "look into" the [[Khlysty]] sect, but rejected it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} One Khlyst practice was known as "rejoicing" (радение), a [[ritual]] which sought to overcome human sexual urges by engaging in group sexual activities so that, in consciously sinning together, the sin's power over the human was nullified.{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=40}} Rasputin is said to have been particularly appalled by the belief that grace is found through [[self-flagellation]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Like many spiritually minded Russians, Rasputin spoke of [[salvation]] as depending less on the clergy and the church than on seeking the spirit of God within. He also maintained that [[sin]] and [[repentance]] were interdependent and necessary to salvation. Thus, he claimed that yielding to [[temptation]] (and, for him personally, this meant sex and alcohol), even for the purposes of humiliation (so as to dispel the sin of [[vanity]]), was needed to proceed to repentance and salvation.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Rasputin was deeply opposed to war, both from a moral point of view and as something which was likely to lead to political catastrophe. During the years of [[World War I]], Rasputin's increasing drunkenness, sexual promiscuity and willingness to accept [[bribes]] (in return for helping petitioners who flocked to his apartment), as well as his efforts to have his critics dismissed from their posts, made him appear increasingly cynical. Attaining [[divine grace]] through [[sin]] seems to have been one of the central secret doctrines which Rasputin preached to (and practiced with) his inner circle of society ladies.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

During World War I, Rasputin became the focus of accusations of unpatriotic influence at court. The unpopular Tsarina, meanwhile, who was of [[English people|Anglo]]-[[Germany|German]] descent, was accused of acting as a [[secret agent|spy]] in German employ.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} When Rasputin expressed an interest in going to the front to bless the troops early in the war, the Commander-in-Chief, [[Grand Duke Nicholas]], promised to hang him if he dared to show up there. Rasputin then claimed that he had a revelation that the Russian armies would not be successful until the Tsar personally took command. With this, the ill-prepared Tsar Nicholas proceeded to take personal command of the Russian army, with dire consequences for himself as well as for Russia.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} While Tsar Nicholas II was away at war, Rasputin's influence over Tsarina Alexandra increased.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He soon became her [[confidant]] and personal adviser, and he convinced her to fill some governmental offices with his own handpicked candidates. To advance his power further in the highest circles of Russian society, Rasputin cohabited with upper-class women in exchange for granting political favors.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Rasputin listovka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Caricature of Rasputin and the Imperial couple (1916)]]

World War I, the ossifying effects of [[feudalism]], and a meddling government [[bureaucracy]] all contributed to Russia's declining economy at a very rapid rate. Many at the time laid the blame with Alexandra and with Rasputin, because of his influence over her. Here is an example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Vladimir Purishkevich]] was an outspoken member of the [[Duma]]. On November 19, 1916, Purishkevich made a rousing speech in the Duma, in which he stated, "The tsar's ministers who have been turned into [[marionettes]], marionettes whose threads have been taken firmly in hand by Rasputin and the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna — the evil genius of Russia and the Tsarina ... who has remained a German on the Russian throne and alien to the country and its people." [[Felix Yusupov]] attended the speech and afterwards contacted Purishkevich, who quickly agreed to participate in the murder of Rasputin.{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=434}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rasputin's influence over the royal family was used against him and the [[Romanov]]s by politicians and journalists who wanted to weaken the integrity of the [[dynasty]], force the Tsar to give up his absolute political power and separate the Russian Orthodox Church from the state. Rasputin unintentionally contributed to their propaganda by having public disputes with [[clergy]] members, bragging about his ability to influence both the Tsar and Tsarina, and also by his dissolute and very public lifestyle. Nobles in influential positions around the Tsar, as well as some parties of the Duma, clamored for Rasputin's removal from the court. Perhaps inadvertently, Rasputin had contributed to the diminishing respect the Tsar's subjects had for him.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Assassination attempt==
On {{OldStyleDate|12 July|1914|29 June}} a 33-year-old peasant woman named [[Khioniya Guseva|Chionya Guseva]] attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=106-7}} Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear that he would survive.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=108}}  After surgery{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=332}} and some time in a hospital in [[Tyumen]],{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=360-1}} however, he did recover.

Guseva was a follower of [[Iliodor]], a former priest who had supported Rasputin before denouncing his sexual escapades and self-aggrandizement in December 1911.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=82}} A radical conservative and anti-semite, Iliodor had been part of a group of establishment figures who had attempted to drive a wedge between the royal family and Rasputin in 1911. When this effort failed, Iliodor had been banished from St. Petersburg and was ultimately [[defrocking|defrocked]].{{sfn|Smith|2017}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|1990|p=82-4}} Guseva claimed to have acted alone, having read about Rasputin in the newspapers and believing him to be a "false prophet and even an Antichrist."{{sfn|Radzinsky|2010|p=256}} Both the police and Rasputin, however, believed that Iliodor had played some role in the attempt on Rasputin's life.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} Iliodor fled the country before he could be questioned about the assassination attempt, and Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions due to insanity.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}

According to his daughter Maria, Rasputin was very much changed by the experience and began to drink alcohol.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Death==
[[File:Prince Felix Yusupov.jpg|thumb|[[Felix Yusupov]] (1914) married [[Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia|Irina Aleksandrovna Romanova]], the Tsar's niece.]]
[[File:BasementYusupovpalace.jpg|thumb|Basement of the Yusupov Palace on the Moika in St Petersburg, where Rasputin was murdered]]

Having decided that Rasputin's influence over the Tsarina had made him a threat to the empire, a group of nobles led by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]], the Grand Duke [[Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Dmitri Pavlovich]], and the right-wing politician [[Vladimir Purishkevich]] concocted a plan to kill Rasputin in December 1916, apparently by luring Rasputin to the Yusupovs' [[Moika Palace]].{{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=197}}{{sfn|Moorehead|1958|p=107-108}}

Rasputin was murdered during the early morning on {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1916|17 December}}, at the home of Felix Yusupov.  He died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead.  Beyond this, little is certain about his death, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation.  According to historian Douglas Smith, "what really happened at the Yusupov home on 17 December will never be known."{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590, 595}} The story of Rasputin's death that Yusupov recounted in his memoirs, however, has become the most frequently told version of events.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590-592}}

According to Yusupov, he invited Rasputin to his home shortly after midnight and ushered him into the basement. Yusupov offered Rasputin tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. At first, Rasputin refused the cakes, but then began to eat them. To Yusupov's surprise, Rasputin did not appear to be affected by the poison.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590}} Rasputin then asked for some [[Madeira wine]] (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting.  Taking a revolver from Dmitry Pavlovich, Yusupov returned to the basement and, referring to a crucifix that was in the room, told Rasputin that he'd "better look at the crucifix and say a prayer," then shot him once in the chest.  Believing him to be dead, they then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat, in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=590-1}}  Upon returning to the Moika Palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=591}} Suddenly, Rasputin leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who – with some effort – freed himself and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed and made it into the palace's courtyard before being shot by Purishkevich and collapsing into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped Rasputin's body in cloth, drove it to the [[Bolshoy Petrovsky Bridge|Petrovsky Bridge]] and dropped it into the [[Malaya Nevka River]].{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=591-2}}

News of Rasputin's murder spread quickly, even before his body was found. According to Douglas Smith, Purishkevich spoke openly about Rasputin's murder to two soldiers, and to a policeman who was investigating reports of shots shortly after the event, but urged them not to tell anyone else.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=597-8}} An investigation was launched the next morning, as rumors that Rasputin had been killed were already circulating.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=599}} One newspaper, the ''Stock Exchange Gazette,'' even ran a report of Rasputin's death "after a party in one of the most aristocratic homes in the center of the city" on the afternoon of {{OldStyleDate|30 December|1916|17 December}}.

[[File:PolshoiPetrovskyMost.jpg|thumb|left|The wooden [[Bolshoy Petrovsky Bridge]], from which Rasputin's body was thrown into the [[Malaya Nevka River]]]]
[[File:Dead Rasputin.jpg|thumb|left|Rasputin's body with bullet wound in forehead]]

When two workmen noticed blood on the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot was found on the ice below, river police began searching the area for Rasputin's body.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=600}} His body was found under the river ice on January 1 [O.S. 19 December], approximately 200 meters downstream from the bridge.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=606}} An autopsy was conducted by Dr. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon. The report that Kosorotov wrote was later lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds - one of which had been sustained at close range, and to the forehead - a slice wound to his left side, and many other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=608-610}} Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body, but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=610}} According to both Douglas Smith and Joseph Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs, and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=611}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=217-219}} Contrary to some later accounts that claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, Kosorotov found his genitals intact.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=610}}

Rasputin was buried on January 2 [O.S. December 21] at a small church that Anna Vyrubova had been building at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. The funeral was attended only by the royal family and a few of their intimates. Rasputin's wife, mistress, and children were not invited,{{sfn|Rollins|1982|p=197}} although his daughters met with the Royal family at Vyrubova's home later that day.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=612}} His body was exhumed and burned by an attachment of soldiers shortly after the Tsar abdicated the throne in March 1917,{{sfn|Rollins|1982|p=197}} in order to prevent his burial site from becoming a shrine or a rallying point for supporters of the old regime.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=650}}

Some writers – including Oleg Shishkin, Andrew Cook,{{sfn|Cook|2005}} Richard Cullen, and [[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Michael Smith]]{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=203}}{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2010}} – have suggested that agents of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Intelligence Service]] (BSIS) were involved in Rasputin's assassination.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=226}} According to this theory, British agents were concerned that Rasputin was urging the tsar to make a separate peace with Germany and withdraw from the war, and that this would allow Germany to transfer a large number of troops to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=226}} The theory suggests, in other words, that British agents played an active role in Rasputin's assassination in order to keep Russia in the war and force Germany to keep defending the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. While there are several variants of this theory, in general they suggest that British intelligence agents under the command of [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]], and in particular [[Oswald Rayner]] – who had attended [[Oxford University]] with Yusopov – were directly involved in planning and carrying out the assassination, {{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=226-7}}{{sfn|Miller|2004}} or that Rayner had personally shot Rasputin.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2012|p=227-229}} However, historians do not seriously consider this theory. According to historian Douglas Smith, "there is no convincing evidence that places any British agents at the murder scene."{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=631-2}} Historian [[Keith Jeffrey]] has stated that if British Intelligence agents had been involved in the assassination of Rasputin, "I would have expected to find some trace of that" in the MI6 archives, but that no such evidence exists.{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2010}}

==Daughter==
Rasputin's daughter, [[Maria Rasputin]] (Matryona Rasputina) (1898–1977), emigrated to [[France]] after the [[October Revolution]], and then to the [[United States|U.S.]] There she worked as a [[dancer]] and then a [[Lion taming|lion tamer]] in a circus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cp0Die6QcuIC&amp;pg=PA162 Women of the American Circus, 1880-1940, p. 162 by Katherine H. Adams, Michael L. Keene]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Issei Sagawa'''|佐川 一政|Sagawa Issei|extra=born April 26, 1949}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.learning-history.com/issei-sagawa/|title=Issei Sagawa: Cannibal Killer|website=Learning History|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Pang''', is a Japanese man who, while living in [[Paris]] in 1981, killed and [[cannibal]]ized a Dutch woman named Renée Hartevelt. After his release from two years of pre-trial detention upon being found [[legally insane]], he became a minor celebrity in Japan and made a living through public interest.

==Early life==
Sagawa was born in [[Kobe]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan, to wealthy parents. He was born prematurely, reportedly small enough to fit in the palm of his father's hand, and immediately developed [[enteritis]], a disease of the small intestine. He eventually recovered after several injections of potassium and calcium in saline.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

Sagawa first experienced cannibalistic desires while in the first grade, after seeing a male's thigh.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt; In a 2011 interview with ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', Sagawa reported that as a youth he partook in [[bestiality]] with his dog and experienced cannibalistic desires for women.&lt;ref name="vicevid"/&gt;

At 23, in [[Tokyo]], Sagawa followed a tall German woman home, then broke into her apartment while she was sleeping with intent to cannibalize her by tearing and walking away with a small part of her flesh. She awoke and, Sagawa claims, pushed him to the ground. He was captured by police and charged with attempted rape. He did not confess his true intentions to authorities.&lt;ref name="vicevid"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BosZxa1bYcE|title=Interview with a Cannibal|work=Vice Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, at the age of 27, Sagawa emigrated to France to pursue a Ph.D. in literature at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; He claims that while residing in Paris, "Almost every night I would bring a prostitute home and then try to shoot them, but for some reason my fingers froze up and I couldn't pull the trigger."&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/whos-hungry-502-v16n1|title=Who's Hungry?|last=Kosuga|first=Tomokazu|author2=Lena Oishi, Lena|date=January 1, 2009 |work=Vice Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing of Hartevelt==
On June 11, 1981, Sagawa, then 32, invited his Sorbonne classmate Renée Hartevelt to dinner at his apartment under the pretext of translating poetry for a school assignment. He planned to kill and eat her, having selected her for her health and beauty; characteristics he believed he lacked. He is weak, ugly, and small (he is 1.448&amp;nbsp;m (4&amp;nbsp;ft 9&amp;nbsp;in) tall)&lt;ref name="Ramsland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/sagawa/1.html?sect=3 |title=The Cannibal Celebrity: Issei Sagawa |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[TruTV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717083659/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/sagawa/1.html?sect=3 |archivedate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims he wanted to absorb her energy. She was 25 years old and 1.78 m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 10 in).&lt;ref name="Luzajic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gremolata.com/Articles/571-The-Sweetest-Taboo-An-Anthropology-of-Anthropophagy.aspx |title=The Sweetest Taboo: An Anthropology of Anthropophagy |last=Luzajic |first=Lorette C. |publisher=Gremolata|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125235315/http://www.gremolata.com/Articles/571-The-Sweetest-Taboo-An-Anthropology-of-Anthropophagy.aspx|archivedate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she arrived, she began reading poetry at a desk with her back to him. He shot her in the neck with a rifle. Sagawa said he fainted after the shock of shooting her, but awoke with the realization that he had to carry out his plan.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; He raped her corpse but was unable to bite into her skin, so he left the apartment and purchased a butcher knife.&lt;ref name=nc&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=September 20, 2007|title=Issei Sagawa: Celebrity Cannibal|journal=New Criminologist, the On-line Journal of Criminology|publisher=New Criminologist|url=http://www.newcriminologist.com/article.asp?nid=17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714172725/http://www.newcriminologist.com/article.asp?nid=17|archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For two days, Sagawa ate various parts of her body, saving other parts in his refrigerator. He then attempted to dump her body in a lake in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], but was seen in the act and arrested by French police.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/12/07/vbs.japanese.cannibal/|title=Murderer, cannibal, celebrity: Inside the mind of Issei Sagawa|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was caught, he was carrying two suitcases. Those suitcases contained the dismembered body parts of Renée Hartevelt.

Sagawa's wealthy father provided a lawyer for his defense, and after being held for two years awaiting trial Sagawa was found [[Insanity defense|legally insane]] and unfit to stand trial by the French judge, [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], who ordered him held indefinitely in a mental institution.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; After a visit by the author [[Inuhiko Yomota]], Sagawa's account of his kill was published in Japan under the title ''In the Fog''.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Sagawa's subsequent publicity and macabre celebrity likely contributed to the French authorities' decision to deport him to Japan, where he was immediately committed to Matsuzawa hospital. Examining psychologists there all declared him sane and found sexual perversion was his sole motivation for murder.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Because charges in France had been dropped, the French court documents were sealed and were not released to Japanese authorities; consequently Sagawa could not legally be detained in Japan. He checked himself out of the hospital on August 12, 1986, and remained free.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Sagawa's continued freedom has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

==Post-release==
Between 1986 and 1997 he was frequently invited to be a guest speaker and commentator.&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;Kushner, Barak. (1997). "Cannibalizing Japanese Media: The Case of Issei Sagawa". Journal of Popular Culture, vol. 31 (3), p.&amp;nbsp;55-57&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he appeared in [[Hisayasu Sato]]'s exploitation film ''Uwakizuma: Chijokuzeme (Unfaithful Wife: Shameful Torture)''&lt;!--the original title; "the bedroom" doesn't quite catch the plot--&gt; as a sado-sexual voyeur.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756028/ |title=Issei Sagawa |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=September 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagawa has written books about his kill, as well as ''Shonen A'', a book on the 1997 [[Kobe child murders]].&lt;ref name="Books"&gt;[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2795905 Issei Sagawa] at [[Goodreads]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2018|sure=yes}} He has also written restaurant reviews for the Japanese magazine ''Spa''.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Henshall, Kenneth G. ''Dimensions of Japanese society: gender, margins and mainstream''. rev.ed. Palgrave Macmillan, London 1999 p.207&lt;/ref&gt; Sagawa can no longer find publishers for his writing and he has struggled to find employment. He was nearly accepted by a French-language school because the manager was impressed by his courage in using his real name, but employees protested and he was rejected.

In 2005 Sagawa's parents died. He was prevented from attending their funeral, but repaid their creditors and moved into public housing. He received welfare benefits for a time.&lt;ref&gt;『週刊新潮』2006年2月23日号。&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Vice Magazine|''Vice'' magazine]] in 2011, he said that being forced to make a living while being known as a murderer and cannibal was a terrible punishment.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt; In 2013 he was hospitalized from a [[cerebral infarction]] which permanently damaged his nervous system. Since being released he has been under the full-time care of his brother.

==In popular culture==
* Three documentary films featuring Sagawa have been produced: ''Excuse Me for Living'' ([[Channel 4]], UK, 1993, 60 minutes);  ''The Cannibal That Walked Free'' ([[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], UK, 2007, 46 minutes) and ''Interview with a Cannibal'' (''Vice'', US, 2011, 34 minutes).
* A 1986 short film by Olivier Smolders, ''Adoration'', is based on Sagawa's story,&lt;ref name="Knoll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=10425|title=Bard of Brooklyn|last=Knoll|first=Paul|date=April 25, 2007|publisher=[[Metro Times]]|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is a 1986 short documentary, ''Cannibal Superstar'', released by the TV channel [[Viasat Explorer]]. ''VBS Meets: Issei Sagawa'', a short documentary about him, aired on [[VBS.tv]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exabep/vbs-meets-issei-sagawa|title=VICE MEETS ISSEI SAGAWA|website=[[vice.com]]|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Too Much Blood]]", a song on the [[Rolling Stones]]' 1983 album ''[[Undercover (The Rolling Stones album)|Undercover]]'', is about Sagawa and violence in the media. His crime also inspired [[the Stranglers]]' 1981 song "[[La Folie (song)|La Folie]]". The [[Noise metal|Noise]] [[Black Metal]] band [[Gnaw Their Tongues]] also released an EP titled ''[[Issei Sagawa (EP)|Issei Sagawa]]'' in 2006.
* Sagawa's crimes, and his later career as an actor, were discussed in the 2015 documentary ''[[Fear Itself (film)|Fear Itself]]'' by filmmaker [[Charlie Lyne]].
* Verena Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor co-produced a film about Sagawa called ''Caniba'', which was shown at the 2017 Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals to mixed reviews from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Guy|last=Lodge|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/caniba-review-1202563494/|title=Film Review: 'Caniba'|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 19, 2017|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jackson family''' is an American family of musicians from [[Gary, Indiana]]. Performing as members of [[The Jackson 5]] and as solo artists, the children of [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Walter]] and [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine Esther Jackson]] were successful in the field of [[popular music]] from the late 1960s onwards.  As a group, the eldest sons [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]], [[Michael Jackson|Michael]], and later with the inclusion of [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy]]. The members who managed to be solo icons in music are [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Janet Jackson]]. The Jackson 5 became known as the "[[List of honorific titles in popular music|First Family of Soul]]"&lt;ref name="takiff"&gt;Moreover, as a unit, they were one of the few black groups to achieve "teen idol" status among music fans of all races, with hits such as ''[[I Want You Back]]'', ''[[ABC (song)|ABC]]'', ''[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]'', ''[[Dancing Machine]]'', ''[[Blame It on the Boogie]]'', ''[[Heartbreak Hotel]]'', and ''[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]''.{{Cite news |last=Takiff | first=Johnathan| title=Victory at Hand | newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | page=49 | date=1984-08-31 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rpruter" /&gt; (a title first held by the [[Five Stairsteps]]).&lt;ref name="rpruter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|year=1992|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kkcmS0AzMEC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=%22five+stairsteps%22+%22first+family+of+soul%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22five%20stairsteps%22%20%22first%20family%20of%20soul%22&amp;f=false|title=Chicago Soul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued success of Michael and Janet's careers as solo artists led the Jacksons to become known as the "Royal Family of Pop".&lt;ref&gt;When a brother and sister want to spend some time together it rarely requires a journey to a galaxy far, far away, but if they're reigning members of the royal family of pop, and the meeting is a music video, it's got to be out of this world. The siblings in question are Michael and Janet Jackson, and their first video collaboration, "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]," is the space odyssey that earned a record 11 nominations at this year's MTV Video Music Awards, winning for Best Dance Video, Best Choreography, and Best Art Direction, the latter a nod to the talents of production designer Tom Foden. {{Cite news |last=Boepple | first=Leanne | title=Video/production design: Scream | newspaper=Theatre Crafts International |volume= 29|issue=9 | page=52 | date=November 1995|issn=1063-9497 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All nine of the Jackson siblings have gold records to their credits with La Toya holding the distinction of being the first Jackson sister to attain one (awarded by France's SNEP for "[[Reggae Night]]", a song she co-wrote for [[Jimmy Cliff]]), and now to [[Janet Jackson]] for being the first black woman to receive the [[Billboard Icon Award]]. 

The Jackson family has been the subject of controversy linked to the [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|Jordan Chandler Case]]. But the most controversial facts of Jackson's private life are accusations made by his sons against family patriarch [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]] claiming that he was harassed by his father as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, J. Randy (2004). The Magic and the Madness. Terra Alta, WV: Headline. p. 20-22. {{ISBN|0-330-42005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, La Toya; Patricia Romanowski (1991). La Toya: Growing up in the Jackson Family. [S.l.]: Dutton Publishing. pp. 18–20. {{ISBN|0-451-17415-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these circumstances and other problems, the Jacksons continued to be one of the most influential families in the United States and in recent years some family members have been honored for their work; in 1997 [[The Jackson 5]] was inducted to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nelson George|George, Nelson]] (2004). ''[[Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection]]'' booklet. [[Sony BMG]]. pp 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael would follow the group to the hall in 2001. The Jacksons, Michael and Janet all received stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1980, 1984 and 1990 respectively. Joseph was recognized as "the best musical businessman of all time" by the city of [[Cleveland]] in 2002. In 2009 a new series from [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] entitled ''[[The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty]]'' premiered documenting the Jackson brothers dealing with the sudden loss of Michael and preparing for a Jackson 5 Reunion tour.&lt;ref name="Jackson Series Prolongs A&amp;E's 'Family' Affair"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/25/AR2009082503189.html?hpid=artsliving|title=Jackson Series Prolongs A&amp;E's 'Family' Affair|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|date=August 26, 2009|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular members of the Jackson family are Michael Jackson, known as the ''King of Pop'' and Janet Jackson, often considered one of the most influential [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] artists of all time.

==First generation==
{{Main|Joe Jackson (manager)|Katherine Jackson}}
Joseph Walter Jackson was born on July 26, 1928 in [[Arkansas]] but he grew up in [[Oakland, California]] with his father Samuel Jackson, a school teacher. At age 18 he moved to [[East Chicago, Indiana]] to be with his mother Crystal Lee King and to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional boxer. At age 21, Joseph married Katherine Scruse, 19, immediately starting a family. Even though he wanted to be a success in boxing it wasn’t a job for a family man, so he obtained a job as an [[overhead crane]] operator with East Chicago's [[Inland Steel Company]].  His family continued to grow steadily and over the course of sixteen years he and Katherine had a house full of nine children.  Joe Jackson always wanted to make it big and although he couldn’t in boxing or in his own short musical stint in the 1950s with the band The Falcons&lt;!-- not the same as the Detroit group --&gt;, he saw the talent in his children, starting with Tito and Tito's ability to play the guitar.&lt;ref name=JosephJackson&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Jackson Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/joseph-jackson-467150|work=Joseph Jackson Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon enough Joe Jackson formed a band of his sons [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], and [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]] called [[The Jackson Brothers]] in 1964 and became their manager. After several years of doing local talent shows, Joseph enlarged the band to include [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]], two of his younger sons, and then changed the name of the band to [[The Jackson Five]] by 1966, remaining the group's manager. As their father he was a very strict disciplinarian and had an abusive nature{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and as their manager he enforced long practice sessions of singing and dancing in hopes of preparing them to make it big one day. In August 1967, the group made a debut at the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem, New York]] where they won the Amateur Night contest. [[Gordon Keith (producer)|Gordon Keith]], the owner and producer at [[Steeltown Records]] in Gary, Indiana, discovered the ''Jackson Five'' and signed them to their first contract in November 1967. “[[Big Boy (song)|Big Boy]]”, the boys' first record which was produced by Keith, was released on January 30, 1968. It became a local hit. In March 1969, they signed a [[Motown Records|Motown]] record contract and became known as the ''Jackson 5''. The group enjoyed the fame Joseph Jackson had been longing for in his life. He continued to manage The Jackson 5 into stardom and after the band they had many No. 1 hits on the ''Billboard'' hot singles charts; Joseph moved them to a mansion in [[Encino, California]] with his own hefty salary he had obtained as their full-time manager.   After many years as a band and with Michael as lead singer, the group continued to churn out even more hits and wealth, but tensions grew and in 1979, Michael severed ties with his father/manager and went on to pursue a solo musical entertainment career. Four years later, in 1983, Michael's siblings fired Joseph Jackson as their manager.  In 1993, Michael Jackson accused his father of physical and mental abuse; a few of the other siblings confirmed this claim, but others denied it.&lt;ref name="JosephJackson"/&gt;

Katherine Jackson (née Kattie B. Scruse) was born on May 4, 1930 in [[Barbour County, Alabama]], the child of Prince Albert Scruse (1907–1997) and Martha Mattie Upshaw (1907–1990). She was left with a permanent limp after acquiring [[polio]] syndrome in her childhood. She later recovered from her illness after moving with her family to [[East Chicago, Indiana]], where she would remain until meeting her husband Joseph Jackson. The couple moved and bought a small home in [[Gary, Indiana]], where they birthed and raised nine children and she was a stay-at-home mother.&lt;ref name=KatherineJackson /&gt; Throughout her life, Katherine remained a devoted [[Jehovah's Witness]] and raised her children strictly under the same spiritual teachings she received. Also, as a talented pianist and vocalist who shared her talents with her children, she was later credited for being the foundation of her children's success. After her sons' rise to fame as The Jackson 5, she strongly supported her children and became the costume designer for their shows and performances. Some of the memorable moments of her unconditional support were seen when her son Michael was tried for molestation charges in [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|1993]] and [[Trial of Michael Jackson|2005]]. Katherine now lives in Calabasas, California where she cares for the children of her [[Death of Michael Jackson|late son, Michael]].&lt;ref name=KatherineJackson&gt;{{cite web|title=Katherine Jackson Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/katherine-jackson-466952?page=1|work=Katherine Jackson Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After allegations that she may have been held against her will by Randy and Janet Jackson, Katherine lost custody of Michael's children, ultimately regaining it in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krishnamurthy|first1=Sowmya|title=Katherine Jackson Loses Custody Of Michael Jackson's Children|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2498670/katherine-jackson-separated-from-michael-jacksons-children/|website=mtv.com|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paquette|first1=Danielle|title=Katherine Jackson to split custody of kids with T.J.

==Second generation==
Together, Joseph and Katherine Jackson had ten children. Their son Brandon (Marlon's twin) died shortly after birth. The other nine grew up to become professional musicians.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite book|title=My Family, the Jacksons|last=Jackson|first=Katherine|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|year=1990|isbn=0-312-92350-3|author2=Rich Wiseman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third generation==
There are 26 children that make up the third generation of the Jackson family along with several great-grandchildren. Among them, some have followed in the family's footsteps into the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1614845/michael-jacksons-family-tree-janet-rebbie-marlon-and-more/|title=Michael Jackson's Family Tree: Janet, Rebbie, Marlon And More|website=Mtv.com|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The three children of Michael Jackson are probably the most well-known of the third generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2012/11/michael-jackson-family-tree|title=Photos: Michael Jackson’s Extended Family Tree: Who’s Who?|first=James|last=Wolcott|website=Vanityfair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

April 3, 1998), and  [[Prince Michael Jackson II]] also known as "Blanket" now called "Bigi" (b. February 21, 2002), have been discussed in the press numerous times throughout their lives, particularly since their [[Death of Michael Jackson|father's death]] in 2009.

Rebbie, Tito, Jackie, Jermaine and Janet Jackson have also had children, who have come under varying degrees of media focus. [[Austin Brown]] (b. 1985), the only son of Rebbie Jackson, is a singer and songwriter who has released several successful singles in the pop/R&amp;B genre.

Abrams was recruited, along with Jesse Krakow, into [[Time of Orchids]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cuneiformrecords.com/press/TimeOfOrchids_NamesakePressRelease.doc {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193452/http://www.cuneiformrecords.com/press/TimeOfOrchids_NamesakePressRelease.doc |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuneiformrecords.com/press/TimeOfOrchids_NamesakePressRelease.doc&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, PAK's bassist Krakow asked band leader Ron Anderson to audition Abrams for PAK - Abrams impressed Anderson with his ability to play a difficult passage, without warming up, much faster than its regular tempo, and so he was admitted to the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ronanderson-molecules.com/PAK.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715201433/http://www.ronanderson-molecules.com/PAK.htm |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently he has joined fellow PAK member Tim Byrnes in [[Kayo Dot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=15996&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurie Cabot''' (born March 6, 1933) is an [[United States|American]] [[Witchcraft]] high priestess, one of the most high-profile witches in the world, one of the first people to popularize Witchcraft in the [[United States]], and author of several books.

She founded the Cabot Tradition of the Science of Witchcraft and the Witches' League for Public Awareness to defend the civil rights of witches everywhere.

In the 1970s she was declared the "Official [[Witch]] of [[Salem, Massachusetts]]" by Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] to honor her work with [[special needs]] children.

She continues to reside in Salem, where she owned a shop called The Cat, the Crow, and the Crown, which closed in early 2012 after 40 years. Cabot claims to be related to the prominent [[Boston Brahmin]] [[Cabot family]].  She is a part of Salem lore, and a local [[celebrity]] in that city and throughout the Massachusetts [[North Shore (Massachusetts)|North Shore]].

==Life and career and possible inspirations==
Laurie Cabot was born '''Mercedes Elizabeth Kearsey'''. She grew up in [[California]] and came east to [[New England]] as a teenager. She maintains that her interest in the [[occult]] began in childhood. She developed this interest in Boston through time she spent as a young woman in the halls of the [[Boston Public Library]].

During the 1950s Cabot worked as a dancer in a Boston nightclub called "[[Latin Quarter (nightclub)|The Latin Quarter]]" owned by [[Lou Walters]], the father of TV journalist [[Barbara Walters]]. Cabot was asked by Mr. Walters to open his Las Vegas Latin Quarter, 
but she declined.

Cabot married and divorced twice, with each marriage producing a daughter, Jody Cabot (b. 1963) and Penny Cabot (b. 1965), respectively. Cabot chose to raise her daughters as Witches, and she began appearing in black robes and black eye-makeup in her everyday life.  She identifies herself as a Witch, but not as a follower of the modern Wiccan religion, because she practiced Witchcraft before Wicca became a popular movement.  The kind of Witchcraft she practices focuses on the Art and Science of Witchcraft.  Many of Laurie Cabot's lectures focus on energy, instead of a focus on religious particulars, thus making her brand of the Craft Traditional Witchcraft.

In 1970 TV's sitcom ''[[Bewitched]]'' visited Salem for a series of episodes with location filming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/salemsaga.htm Harpiesbizarre.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Cabot opened the town's first "Witch shop" in Salem in 1971, which became a tourist destination thanks to the national TV exposure.



After 10 straight losses in May 1976, things were looking so bad for the Red Sox that a Boston radio station hired Laurie Cabot, a genuine Salem witch, to remove a curse that had allegedly been cast upon the team by an Orioles-employed witch doctor from Kenya. Cabot is pictured here examining the aura of Dwight Evans before a May 13 game in Cleveland. 

Cabot was featured prominently in Season 5 of the science/documentary series ''[[In Search Of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]'', hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]], in Episode 13: "Salem Witches", originally aired 13 December 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|GfX_gLhjDx8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode spent much time on Cabot's activities as a leader in the local community of witches in Salem.

In 1986, after the release of the film version of "The Witches of Eastwick," John Updike's novel about single suburban women venturing into the occult, Cabot established the Witches' League for Public Awareness to counter negative images of her religion in popular culture and the media. "Here are three women who have nothing better to do, because they are so frustrated sexually, than to get involved with witchcraft," Cabot said of the movie. "They are not witches. If they are anything, they are weekend Satanists. They don't do one witchy thing in the whole film."




Cabot's shop sold [[herbs]], jewelry, [[Tarot]] decks, and other items used in witchcraft. She later relocated her shop to an old gambrel-roofed house on Essex Street. This new shop was named "Crow Haven Corner". The physical store is still open, though no longer owned or managed by any member of the Cabot family (formerly, her eldest daughter Jody owned and ran it). Cabot's final shop in Salem, The Cat, The Crow and the Crown on Pickering Wharf, later renamed The Official Witch Shoppe, closed its doors in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/yourtown/salem/articles/2012/02/09/laurie_cabot_salems_official_witch_closes_up_shop_after_40_years/?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; Cabot still maintains an online shop by the same name that is frequently patronized, and is an important resource to many witches. She is as well known for her businesses, lectures and books. Cabot was a guest on both "[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]" and on [[Phil Donahue]]'s talk shows in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="skeptic"&gt;THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW "WITCHES" June 24, 1987  Transcript #W203&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Cabot celebrated her 75th birthday at a surprise birthday party attended by hundreds of witches, including [[Sully Erna]] of the band [[Godsmack]], for whom Cabot had appeared in the band's "Voodoo" music video shot at [[Hammond Castle]].

==Incidents and controversies==
Cabot is also known for her sometimes controversial behavior. There was a legal situation in the mid 1990s in which Cabot allegedly threatened local real estate agent, Janet Andrews, with her gun.&lt;ref name="salemwitch"&gt;"[http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/07-97/07-07-97/a03sr015.htm Salem witch Laurie Cabot a center of controversy]," ''South Coast Today'' (accessed May 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Cabot denied she had ever acted in such a manner and upon further investigation all charges against Cabot were dismissed and she still retains a gun permit.

She garnered more notoriety in 2004 when Salem Police came to her home in order to remove her adolescent grandson over a custody issue between Jody Cabot and her former husband.&lt;ref name="wicca"&gt;"[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/3435992/detail.html Police: Witch Put Hex On Department, Cabot Says 'I Don't Do Curses'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219224807/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/3435992/detail.html |date=2005-12-19 }}," [http://www.thebostonchannel.com/index.html WCBTV Boston] (accessed May 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Both incidents were covered by local and national press and even featured on CNN. A policeman claimed that during the incident Cabot ordered him to look into her eyes, telling him he was cursed once he did.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Cabot denies she ever cursed the policeman, stating "I say it is a curse when you do bad things."

Jody Cabot was dismissed after being accused of stealing money from her mother and all ties between them were severed.&lt;ref&gt;http://hecatedemetersdatter.blogspot.com/2009/09/some-sad-news-about-laurie-cabot.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Penny Cabot is currently Laurie's partner in running their business interests.

The '''Leshy''' (also '''Leshi'''; {{lang-rus|ле́ший|p=ˈlʲeʂɨj}}; literally, "[he] from the forest", {{lang-pl|boruta, leszy}}) is a [[tutelary deity]] of the [[forest]]s in [[Slavic mythology]]. The plural form in Russian is лешие, ''leshiye'' (retaining the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] on the first syllable). As the spirit rules over the forest and hunting, he may be related to the Slavic god [[Porewit]].&lt;ref name="Bane2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Theresa Bane|title=Encyclopedia of Demons in World Religions and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njDRfG6YVb8C&amp;pg=PA85|date=9 January 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8894-0|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Porteous2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Porteous|title=The Lore of the Forest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZ7AEU18fFoC&amp;pg=PA108|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59605-105-8|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also a deity, named Svyatibor (Svyatobor, Svyatibog), who is mentioned in the beliefs of the Eastern and Western Slavs as the god of forests and the lord of the leshies. His functions were identical to [[Veles (god) |Veles]].&lt;ref name="Kaysarov"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaysarov Andei Sergeevich|title=Slavic and Russian mythology|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=f_JeZYwhjBsC&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|date=1810|publisher=DirectMEDIA|isbn=5998918851|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known by some to have a propensity to lead travelers astray and abduct children, (which he shares with [[Chort]], the "Black One") which would lead some to believe he is an evil entity. He is however also known to have a more neutral disposition towards humans, dependent on the attitudes and behaviours of an individual person, or local population, towards the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62151653|title=Wielka księga demonów polskich : leksykon i antologia demonologii ludowej|last=Barbara.|first=Podgórska,|date=2005|publisher=Wydawn.

Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]], which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood.&lt;ref name=AARP-07&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt : The music legend opens up to AARP Segunda Juventud Online |first=Anita Mabante |last=Leach |date=August 2007 |url=http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222084100/http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archivedate=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records{{snds}}rock and roll, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi{{snds}}is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and her father for introducing her to the [[traditional pop]] and [[Great American Songbook]] repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation.&lt;ref name="Asheralbumsales"&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt Interview 17 June 1998 at Linda's home in Tucson, Arizona |first=Debbie |last=Kruger |publisher=debbiekruger.com |date=June 17, 1998 |url=http://www.debbiekruger.com/writer/freelance/ronstadt_transcript.html |accessdate=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=starbulletin /&gt;

Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as [[Lola Beltrán]] and [[Édith Piaf]]; she has called their singing and rhythms "more like Greek music ... It's sort of like 6/8 [[time signature]] ... very hard driving and very intense."&lt;ref name=influences&gt;{{cite web |work=Hit Parader |title=Sanity on the Line Every Show |date=February 1971 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthitp1.htm |accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also drew influence from country singer [[Hank Williams]].

She has said that "all girl singers" eventually "have to curtsy to [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]]".&lt;ref name="tiptheirhat" /&gt; Of [[Maria Callas]], Ronstadt says, "There's no one in her league. That's it. Period. I learn more ... about singing rock n roll from listening to Maria Callas records than I ever would from listening to pop music for a month of Sundays.&amp;nbsp;...

A self-described product of American radio of the 1950s and 1960s, Ronstadt is a fan of its eclectic and diverse music programming.&lt;ref name=starbulletin&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |title=Silver threads golden moments: After 35 years, Linda Ronstadt returns to sing in Diamond Head Crater |first=Burl |last=Burlingame |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/03/28/features/story01.html |accessdate=April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginning of professional career ===
At age 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Gretchen. The group played coffeehouses, fraternity houses, and other small venues, billing themselves as "the Union City Ramblers" and "the Three Ronstadts", and they even recorded themselves at a Tucson studio under the name "the New Union Ramblers".&lt;ref name=MIXMag2000 /&gt; Their repertoire included the music they grew up on{{snds}}folk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican.&lt;ref name=ramblers&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt: The Queen of Rock &amp; Roll is also a Queen of Country Music |work=[[Country Music (magazine)|Country Music]] |date=October 1978 |first=Russ |last=Barnard |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artcm78.htm |accessdate=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; But increasingly, Ronstadt wanted to make a union of folk music and rock 'n' roll,&lt;ref name=hamill /&gt; and in 1964, after a semester at Arizona State University,&lt;ref name=ramblers /&gt; the 18-year-old decided to move to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite journal |first=Randy |last=Lewis |date=August 20, 2010 |title=Linda Ronstadt remembers Kenny Edwards: 'A beacon to me' |journal=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Company |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/08/linda-ronstadt-kenny-edwards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soulful" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Claire"&gt;{{cite book |title=Linda Ronstadt |last=Claire |first=Vivian |year=1978 |publisher=Flash Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8256-3918-2 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Stone Poneys ===
{{Main|Stone Poneys}}

Ronstadt visited a friend from Tucson, [[Bobby Kimmel]], in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday,&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; decided to move there permanently to form a band with him.&lt;ref name="Soulful" /&gt; Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter [[Kenny Edwards]], and eventually the three of them were signed by [[Nik Venet]] to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in the summer of 1966 as "[[the Stone Poneys]]". The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 1967{{ndash}}68: ''[[The Stone Poneys (album)|The Stone Poneys]]''; ''[[Evergreen, Volume 2]]''; and ''[[Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III]]''. The band is best known for their hit single "[[Different Drum]]" (written by [[Michael Nesmith]] prior to his joining [[the Monkees]]), which reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart as well as number 12 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine. Nearly 50 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt's most popular recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt |publisher=Rhapsody |url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/linda-ronstadt |accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Australia's [[Raven Records]] released a compilation CD titled ''The Stone Poneys''. The disc features all tracks from the first two Stone Poneys albums and four tracks from the third album.

=== Solo career ===
Still contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, ''Hand Sown ... Home Grown'', in 1969. It has been called the first [[alternative country]] record by a female recording artist.&lt;ref name="Linen106" /&gt; During this same period, she contributed to the ''[[Music from Free Creek]]'' "super session" project.

Ronstadt provided the vocals for some commercials during this period, including one for [[Remington Products|Remington]] electric razors, in which a multitracked Ronstadt and [[Frank Zappa]] claimed that the electric razor "cleans you, thrills you ... may even keep you from getting busted".&lt;ref name=Remington&gt;{{cite web|work=The Linda Ronstadt Download Center |title=Remington Electric Razor |url=http://home.comcast.net/~westhamptonpg/razor.html |publisher=westhamptonpg personal webpage |accessdate=June 16, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121219221429/http://home.comcast.net/~westhamptonpg/razor.html |archivedate=December 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt's second solo album, ''[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]'', was released in March 1970. Recorded entirely in Nashville, it was produced by [[Elliot Mazer]], whom Ronstadt chose on the advice of [[Janis Joplin]], who had worked with him on the ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]'' album.&lt;ref name=Capitol&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt's 1969–1974 Capitol Records Solo Output Presented in New 2-CD Collection, 'The Best Of Linda Ronstadt: The Capitol Years' |publisher=PR Newswire |date=November 8, 2005 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/11-08-2005/0004211041&amp;EDATE= |accessdate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Silk Purse'' album cover showed Ronstadt in a muddy pigpen, while the back and inside cover depicted her onstage wearing bright red. Ronstadt has stated that she was not pleased with the album, although it provided her with her first solo hit, the multi-format single "[[Long, Long Time]]", and earned her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).

Several years before Ronstadt became what author Gerri Hirshey called the first "arena-class rock diva" with "hugely anticipated tours"&lt;ref name="doubleplatinum" /&gt; she began her solo career touring the North American concert circuit. But being on the road took its toll both emotionally and professionally.

Soon after she went solo in the late 1960s, one of her first backing bands was the pioneering country-rock band [[Swampwater]], which combined [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and swamp-rock elements in their music. Its members included Cajun fiddler [[Gib Guilbeau]] and [[John Beland]], who later joined [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]],&lt;ref name=swamprock&gt;{{cite web |work=The Rising Storm |title=Swampwater "Swampwater" |author=jason |date=May 20, 2007 |url=http://therisingstorm.net/swampwater-swampwater/ |accessdate=June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Stan Pratt, Thad Maxwell, and Eric White, brother of [[Clarence White]] of [[the Byrds]].

Another backing band included [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Bernie Leadon]], and [[Randy Meisner]], who went on to form the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. They toured with her for a short period in 1971 and played on ''[[Linda Ronstadt (album)|Linda Ronstadt]]'', her self-titled third album, from which the failed single, Ronstadt's version of Browne's "[[Rock Me on the Water]]", was drawn. At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]]. She said, "As soon as I started working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims."&lt;ref name=MIXMag2000 /&gt; Also in 1971, Ronstadt began talking with [[David Geffen]] about moving from Capitol Records to Geffen's [[Asylum Records]] label.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 159, 173, Broadway Books (New York 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collaborations with Peter Asher ====

| source=—[[Peter Asher]], on collaborating with Ronstadt&lt;ref name="Goldmine589" /&gt;}}

Ronstadt began her fourth solo album, ''[[Don't Cry Now]]'', in 1973, with Boylan (who had negotiated her contract with [[Asylum Records]]) and [[J. D. Souther|John David "J.D." Souther]] producing most of the album's tracks. But needing someone willing to work with her as an equal, Ronstadt asked [[Peter Asher]], who came highly recommended to her by [[James Taylor|James Taylor's]] sister [[Kate Taylor]], to help produce two of them: "Sail Away" and "I Believe in You".&lt;ref name="producer3" /&gt;

The album featured Ronstadt's first country hit, "[[Silver Threads and Golden Needles]]", which she had first recorded on ''Hand Sown ... Home Grown''{{snds}}this time hitting the Country Top 20.

With the release of ''Don't Cry Now'', Ronstadt took on her biggest gig to date as the opening act on [[Neil Young|Neil Young's]] ''Time Fades Away'' tour, playing for larger crowds than ever before. Backstage at a concert in Texas, [[Chris Hillman]] introduced her to [[Emmylou Harris]], telling them, "You two could be good friends",&lt;ref name=goldmine&gt;{{cite web |title=And then there were two ...

Meanwhile, the album became Ronstadt's most successful up to that time, selling 300,000 copies by the end of 1974.&lt;ref name=producer3&gt;{{cite book |title=Not Fade Away: A Backstage Pass to 20 Years of Rock &amp; Roll |chapter=Linda Ronstadt, Heartbreak on Wheels (Rolling Stone, March 27, 1975) |first=Ben |last=Fong-Torres |year=1999 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] (via Google Books) |pages=209–220 |isbn=978-0-87930-590-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igEvYlgm4HIC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher turned out to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any producer she had worked with previously.&lt;ref name=MIXMag2000&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]] |title=Linda Ronstadt |date=December 1, 2000 |first=Dan |last=Daley |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_linda_ronstadt/index.html |accessdate=May 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113092247/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_linda_ronstadt/index.html|archive-date=November 13, 2005}}http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/linda-ronstadt/365380&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio.&lt;ref name="producer3" /&gt; Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a "woman of strong opinions (who) knew what she wanted to do (with her career)", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer,&lt;ref name="negativequalities"&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Asher Interview |first=Caroline |last=Ryder |work=[[Swindle (magazine)|Swindle]] |date=October 2007 |url=http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/peter-asher/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025181433/http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/peter-asher/ |archivedate=October 25, 2007 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. "It must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someone's career when it's someone you sleep with", he said.&lt;ref name="producer3" /&gt;

Asher executive produced a tribute CD called ''[[Listen to Me: Buddy Holly]]'', released September 6, 2011, on which Ronstadt's 1976 version of [[Buddy Holly|Buddy Holly's]] "[[That'll Be The Day]]" appears among newly recorded versions of Holly's songs by various artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/132169-listen-buddy-holly-tribute-cd-sept-6th.html |title=Listen To Me: Buddy Holly Tribute CD Out Sept. 6th |date=July 26, 2011 |publisher=AltSounds.com |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003125925/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/132169-listen-buddy-holly-tribute-cd-sept-6th.html |archivedate=October 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that's how I attack vocals.|source=—Linda Ronstadt, on reconciling her musical instincts with rock 'n' roll.&lt;ref name=MIXMag2000 /&gt;}}

Ronstadt captured the sounds of [[country music]] and the rhythms of [[ranchera]] music{{snds}}which she likened in 1968 to ''"Mexican bluegrass"''{{snds}}and redirected them into her rock 'n' roll and some of her pop music. Many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] roots.&lt;ref name=Soulful2&gt;{{cite web |work=Cleveland Scene |title=Gypsy Eyes, Interview 1968 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdis.htm |accessdate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a country sound and style, a fusion of country music and rock 'n' roll called [[Country rock]], started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s, and it became an emerging movement Ronstadt helped form and commercialize. However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music "purists" for her "brand of music" which crossed many genres. ''Country Western Stars'' magazine wrote in 1970 that "Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda." She never categorized herself and stuck to her genre-crossing brand of music.&lt;ref name=CWS&gt;{{cite web |work=Country Western Stars |title=Sexy new sweetheart for country western |date=March 1970 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/cws70-3.html |accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt's natural vocal range spans several octaves from [[contralto]] to [[soprano]], and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work. Ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive platinum albums (fourteen certified million selling, to date). As for the singles, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' pointed out that a whole generation, "but for her, might never have heard the work of artists such as [[Buddy Holly]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Chuck Berry]]."&lt;ref name="interpreter6"&gt;{{cite web |work=Rolling Stone |title=Artists: Linda Ronstadt Bio, Pictures, Video |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/linda-ronstadt/biography |accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that Ronstadt had the same generational effect with her [[Great American Songbook]] music, exposing a whole new generation to the music of the 1920s and 1930s{{snds}}music which was pushed aside because of the advent of rock 'n' roll. When interpreting, Ronstadt said she "sticks to what the music demands", in terms of lyrics.&lt;ref name=Demands1&gt;{{cite web |title=Songbird Sisters: South Louisiana's Ann Savoy teams up with pop icon Linda Ronstadt for their new CD, Adieu False Heart |first=Joshua Clegg |last=Caffery |date=July 26, 2006 |work=The Independent Weekly |url=http://www.theind.com/cover2.asp?CID=-1710469275 |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000105/http://www.theind.com/cover2.asp?CID=-1710469275 |archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that rock and roll music is part of her culture, she says that the songs she sang after her rock and roll hits were part of her soul. "The (Mariachi music) was my father's side of the soul," she was quoted as saying in a 1998 interview she gave at her Tucson home. "My mother's side of my soul was the Nelson Riddle stuff. And I had to do them both in order to reestablish who I was."&lt;ref name=hersoul&gt;{{cite web |title=Everlasting Linda (Interview 17 June 1998 in Tucson, AZ) |work=Linda Ronstadt |url=http://www.debbiekruger.com/writer/freelance/ronstadt_transcript.html |accessdate=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1974 book ''Rock 'N' Roll Woman'', author Katherine Orloff writes that Ronstadt's "own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues, the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to ... (and) her goal is to ... be soulful too. With this in mind, Ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special union."&lt;ref name="Soulful" /&gt;

By this stage of her career, Ronstadt had established her niche in the field of country-rock. Along with other musicians such as [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gram Parsons]], [[Swampwater]], [[Neil Young]], and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was okay. However, she stated that she was being pushed hard into singing more rock and roll.&lt;ref name=goldmine /&gt;

Although Ronstadt had been a cult favorite on the music scene for several years, 1975 was "remembered in the music biz as the year when 29-year-old Linda Ronstadt ''belatedly'' happened."&lt;ref name=people75&gt;{{cite web |title=When Will She Be Loved?

With the release of ''Heart Like a Wheel''{{nsmdns}}named after one of the album's songs, written by [[Anna McGarrigle]]{{nsmdns}}Ronstadt reached number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart;&lt;ref name=BillboardWheelno1on200&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caulfield |first1=Keith |title=Linda Ronstadt Rocks Highest-Charting Album In 24 Years |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6062513/linda-ronstadt-rocks-highest-charting-album-in-24-years |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also the first of four number 1 Country Albums, and the disc was certified double-platinum&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/ |title=RIAA – Gold &amp; Platinum |author=RIAA |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (over two million copies sold in the U.S.). In many instances, her own interpretations were more successful than the original recordings, and many times new songwriters were discovered by a larger audience as a result of her interpretation and recording. Ronstadt had major success interpreting songs from a diverse spectrum of artists.

''Heart Like a Wheel''{{'}}s first single release, "[[You're No Good]]"{{snds}}a rockified version of an R&amp;B song written by [[Clint Ballard, Jr.]] that Ronstadt had initially resisted because [[Andrew Gold|Andrew Gold's]] guitar tracks sounded too much like a "Beatles song" to her&lt;ref name="producer3" /&gt;{{snds}}climbed to number 1 on both the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''Cash Box'' Pop singles charts.&lt;ref name=bronson&gt;Bronson, Fred.

The album showed a physically attractive Ronstadt on the cover but, more importantly, its critical and commercial success was due to a fine presentation of country and rock, with ''Heart Like a Wheel'' her first of many major commercial successes that would set her on the path to being one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Ronstadt won her first Grammy Award&lt;ref name=1stgrammy&gt;{{cite web|title='The GRAMMYs: Past Winners Search' |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search |accessdate=February 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Country Vocal Performance/Female]] for "[[I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)]]" which was originally a 1940s hit by [[Hank Williams]]. Ronstadt's interpretation peaked at number 2 on the country chart. The album itself was nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' put Ronstadt on its cover in March 1975. It was the first of six ''Rolling Stone'' covers shot by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]]. It included her as the featured artist with a full photo layout and an article by [[Ben Fong-Torres]], discussing Ronstadt's many struggling years in rock n roll, as well as her home life and what it was like to be a woman on tour in a decidedly all-male environment.

In September 1975, Ronstadt's album ''[[Prisoner In Disguise]]'' was released. It quickly climbed into the Top Five on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart and sold over a million copies.&lt;ref name = RIAAsearch /&gt; It became her second in a row to go platinum, "a grand slam" in the same year (Ronstadt would eventually become the first female artist in popular music history to have three consecutive platinum albums and would ultimately go on to have eight consecutive platinum albums, and then another six between 1983 and 1990).&lt;ref name=people75 /&gt; The disc's first single release was "[[Love Is A Rose]]". It was climbing the pop and country charts but [[Heat Wave (Martha and the Vandellas song)|Heat Wave]], a rockified version of the 1963 hit by [[Martha and the Vandellas]], was receiving considerable airplay. Asylum pulled the "Love Is a Rose" single and issued "Heat Wave" with "Love Is a Rose" on the B-side. "Heat Wave" hit the Top Five on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 while "Love Is A Rose" hit the Top Five on Billboard's country chart.

In 1976, Ronstadt reached the Top 3 of ''Billboard''{{'}}s Album Chart and won her second career [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for her third consecutive platinum&lt;ref name = RIAAsearch /&gt; album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. The album featured a sexy, revealing cover shot and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed two of its songs, "Try Me Again" (co-authored with Andrew Gold) and "Lo Siento Mi Vida". It also included an interpretation of Willie Nelson's ballad "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]", which became a Top 10 Country hit for Ronstadt in early 1977.

At the end of 1977, Ronstadt surpassed the success of ''Heart Like a Wheel'' with her album ''[[Simple Dreams]]'', which held the number 1 position for five consecutive weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref name=Billboardsimpledreams5weeks&gt;{{cite journal |title=Billboard Jan 17, 2009 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 17, 2009 |volume=121 |issue=2 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKAOa7WLRrYC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=%22simple+dreams%22+Ronstadt+billboard+five+weeks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mIyqI89esS&amp;sig=3rXnDWhqySpI0Hf5D5WFwd7s538&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oTqGVITPDoKqogST7IGABA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22simple%20dreams%22%20Ronstadt%20billboard%20five%20weeks&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]] |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over 3½ million copies in less than a year in the U.S. alone – a record for a female artist. ''Simple Dreams'' spawned a string of hit singles on numerous charts. Among them were the [[RIAA]] platinum-certified single "[[Blue Bayou]]", a country rock interpretation of a [[Roy Orbison]] song; "[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]"{{snds}}previously sung by Buddy Holly{{spaced ndash}}; and "[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]", a song written by [[Warren Zevon]], an up-and-coming songwriter of the time. The album garnered several Grammy Award nominations{{snds}}including Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for "Blue Bayou"{{snds}}and won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, the first of three Grammy Awards he would win for designing Ronstadt album covers.

''Simple Dreams'' became one of the singer's best-selling international-selling albums as well, reaching number 1 on the Australian and Canadian Pop and Country Albums charts.&lt;ref name="international"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ronstadt Facts, Investigative International Sales |work=Linda Ronstadt Record Sales Information Page (German Site) |url=http://lindaronstadt.de/facts.htm |accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simple Dreams'' also made Ronstadt the most successful international female touring artist. The same year, she completed a concert tour around Europe. As [[Country Music (magazine)|''Country Music'']] magazine wrote in October 1978, ''Simple Dreams'' solidified Ronstadt's role as "easily the most successful female rock and roll ''and'' country star at this time."&lt;ref name=ramblers /&gt;

Also in 1977, she was asked by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] to sing the [[U.S. National Anthem]] at game three of the [[World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref name=nationalanthem&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt Singing the National Anthem at Game three of World Series |publisher=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxYYwE_ezE |accessdate=August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Time'' magazine and Ronstadt's "rock chick" image ====
Ronstadt has remarked that she felt as though she was "artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)," which she felt wasn't worn quite authentically.&lt;ref name=identitycrisis&gt;{{cite web |title=Not My Job: Linda Ronstadt |publisher=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9888452 |accessdate=May 10, 2007 |date=April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female rock artists like her and [[Janis Joplin]], whom she described as lovely, shy, and very literate in real life and the antithesis of the "red hot mamma" she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis.&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt;

[[File:RonstadtTime.jpg|thumb|right|On the cover of the February 28, 1977, issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine]]

By the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's image became just as famous as her music.&lt;ref name="Goldmine589" /&gt; In 1976 and 1977, she appeared on the covers of ''Rolling Stone'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', respectively. The ''Rolling Stone'' cover story was accompanied by a series of photographs of Ronstadt in a skimpy red slip, taken by [[Annie Leibovitz]]. Ronstadt felt deceived by the photographer, not realizing that the photos would be so revealing. She says her manager Peter Asher kicked Leibovitz out of the house when she visited to show them the photographs prior to publication. Leibovitz had refused to let them veto any of the photos, which included one of Ronstadt sprawled across a bed in her underpants.&lt;ref name="Goldmine589" /&gt; In a 1977 interview, Ronstadt explained, "Annie [Leibovitz] saw that picture as an exposé of my personality. She was right. But I wouldn't choose to show a picture like that to anybody who didn't know me personally, because only friends could get the other sides of me in balance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rockwell |first=John |title=Linda Ronstadt: Her Soft-Core Charms |journal=New Times |date=October 14, 1977 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artnt77.htm |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1977 appearance on the cover of ''Time'' magazine under the banner "Torchy Rock" was also upsetting to Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock.&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt;&lt;ref name=rockwell&gt;{{cite book |title=Stranded – Rock and Roll for a Desert Island | editor=Greil Marcus | contribution=Living in the USA | last=Rockwell | first=John | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/desertisle.htm |accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear,&lt;ref name=Asherscomment&gt;{{cite web |work=Mojo |title=Homecoming Queen, April 1995 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artmojo.htm |accessdate=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover,&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt; and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image she did not want to project.&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt; In 2004, she was interviewed for ''[[CBS This Morning]]''&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=December 5, 2004 |url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/CBSNSM/CBS_SundayAM.html |accessdate=July 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, "Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her [[Svengali]]. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism's about."&lt;ref name=Asherscomment /&gt; Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a "negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold".&lt;ref name="negativequalities" /&gt; Since her solo career had begun, Ronstadt had fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the ''Time'' cover did not appear to help the situation.&lt;ref name=backupband2 /&gt;

In 1978, ''Rolling Stone'' declared Ronstadt "by far America's best-known female rock singer."&lt;ref name=RocksVenusSuccess /&gt; She scored a third number 1 album on the Billboard Album Chart – at this point equaling the record set by Carole King in 1974 – with ''[[Living in the USA]]''. She achieved a major hit single with "[[Ooh Baby Baby]]", with her rendition hitting all four major singles charts (Pop, AC, Country, R&amp;B). ''Living in the USA'' was the first album by any recording act in music history to ship double-platinum (over 2 million advance copies).&lt;ref name="doubleplatinum" /&gt; The album eventually sold 3 million U.S. copies.

At the end of that year, ''Billboard'' magazine crowned Ronstadt with three number-one Awards for the Year: Pop Female Singles Artist of the Year, Pop Female Album Artist of the Year, and Female Artist of the Year (overall).&lt;ref name=TopFemale&gt;{{cite web |work=Billboard |title=Congratulations |date=December 23, 1978 |url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/pwoi/BB_23Dec1978_Congrats.html |accessdate=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Living in the USA'' showed the singer on roller skates with a newly short, permed hairdo on the album cover. Ronstadt continued this theme on concert tour promotional posters with photos of her on roller skates in a dramatic pose with a large American flag in the background. By this stage of her career, she was using posters to promote every album&lt;ref name="Goldmine589" /&gt; and concert – which at the time were recorded live on radio or television.

Ronstadt was also featured in the 1978 film ''[[FM (film)|FM]]'', where the plot involved disc jockeys attempting to broadcast a Ronstadt concert live, without a competing station's knowledge. The film also showed Ronstadt performing the songs "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me", "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", and "[[Tumbling Dice]]". Ronstadt was persuaded to record "Tumbling Dice" after [[Mick Jagger]] came backstage when she was at a concert and said, "You do too many ballads, you should do more rock and roll songs."&lt;ref name=MickJagger&gt;{{cite web |work=The Hit Parader Interview |title=Tour Reflections and Simple Dreams |date=March 1978 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp78.htm |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''Living in the USA'', Ronstadt conducted album promotional tours and concerts. She made a guest appearance onstage with [[the Rolling Stones]] at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, in her hometown of Tucson, where she and Jagger sang "Tumbling Dice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ronstadt and Rolling Stones, July 21, 1978 |work=Photos |url=http://www.iorr.org/talk/read.php?1,1222215,1222980 |publisher=iorr.org forum |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Linda Ronstadt Still Matters to Tucson |date=September 12, 2013 |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/why-linda-ronstadt-still-matters-to-tucson/Content?oid=3872523 |accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rolling Stones U.S. Tour 1978 |date=July 21, 1978 |url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Rolling_Stones_U.S._Tour_1978.html0 |publisher=MyEtyomology.com/SpeedyLook |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, "I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared. He's so silly onstage, he knocks you over. I mean you have to be on your toes or you wind up falling on your face."&lt;ref name=RocksVenusSuccess /&gt;

By the end of 1978, Ronstadt had solidified her role as one of rock and pop's most successful solo female acts, and owing to her consistent platinum album success, and her ability as the first woman to sell out concerts in arenas and stadiums hosting tens of thousands of fans,&lt;ref name="tiptheirhat" /&gt; Ronstadt became the "highest paid woman in rock".&lt;ref name="doubleplatinum" /&gt; She had six platinum-certified albums, three of which were number 1 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, and numerous charted pop singles.

As ''Rolling Stone'' dubbed her "Rock's Venus",&lt;ref name=RocksVenusSuccess /&gt; her record sales continued to multiply and set records themselves. By 1979, Ronstadt had collected eight gold, six platinum, and four multi-platinum certifications for her albums, an unprecedented feat at the time. Her 1976 ''[[Greatest Hits (Linda Ronstadt)|Greatest Hits]]'' album would sell consistently for the next 25 years and in 2001 was certified by the [[RIAA]] for seven-times platinum&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch /&gt; (over seven million U.S. copies sold). In 1980, ''[[Greatest Hits, Volume 2 (Linda Ronstadt album)|Greatest Hits, Volume 2]]'' was released and certified platinum.&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch /&gt;

In 1979, Ronstadt went on an international tour, playing in arenas across Australia to Japan, including the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]], and the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] in Tokyo. She also participated in a benefit concert for her friend [[Lowell George]], held at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], in Los Angeles.

By the end of the decade, Ronstadt had outsold her female competition; no other female artist to date had five straight platinum LPs{{snds}}''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]'' and ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'' among them.&lt;ref name=PeopleMagazine&gt;{{cite web |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |title=On the Charts and in Men's Hearts Linda Ronstadt is  No. 1 With a Bullet |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artpeo77.htm |date=October 24, 1977 |accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Us Weekly]]'' reported in 1978 that Ronstadt, [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Stevie Nicks]], and [[Carly Simon]] had become "The Queens of Rock"&lt;ref name=Ward1978 /&gt; and "Rock is no longer exclusively male. There is a new royalty ruling today's record charts."&lt;ref name=Ward1978 /&gt;

She would go on to parlay her mass commercial appeal with major success in interpreting [[The Great American Songbook]]{{snds}}made famous a generation before by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]{{snds}}and later the Mexican folk songs of her childhood.

In 1980, Ronstadt released ''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]'', her seventh consecutive platinum-selling album. It was a straightforward rock and roll album with post-punk, new wave influences, including tracks by songwriters such as Elvis Costello, [[the Cretones]], and musician [[Mark Goldenberg]] who played on the record himself.

She also made the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' for a record-setting sixth time. ''Mad Love'' entered the ''Billboard'' Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the number 3 position. The project continued her streak of Top 10 hits with "[[How Do I Make You]]", originally recorded by [[Billy Thermal]], and "[[Hurt So Bad]]", originally a Top 10 hit for [[Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials]]. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female]] (although she lost to [[Pat Benatar|Pat Benatar's]] ''[[Crimes of Passion (Pat Benatar album)|Crimes of Passion]]'' album). Benatar praised Ronstadt by stating, "There are a lot of good female singers around. How could I be the best? Ronstadt is still alive!"&lt;ref name="recordreview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pat Benatar: Rock's Reluctant Sex Symbol |work=Record Review, December 1980 |url=http://www.lemuseumdebenatar.com/vintage4.html |accessdate=July 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1980, Ronstadt began rehearsals for the first of several leads in Broadway musicals. [[Joseph Papp]] cast her as the lead in the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert and Sullivan's]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', alongside [[Kevin Kline]].&lt;ref name=Pirates&gt;{{cite web |work=Hit Parader |title=Rock Queen Conquers Broadway and Lives Happily Ever After |date=September 1981 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp81.htm |accessdate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She said singing Gilbert and Sullivan was a natural choice for her, since her grandfather Fred Ronstadt was credited with having created [[Tucson|Tucson's]] first orchestra, the ''Club Filarmonico Tucsonense'', and had once created an arrangement of ''The Pirates of Penzance''.&lt;ref name=AARP-07 /&gt;

''The Pirates of Penzance'' opened for a limited engagement in New York City's [[Central Park]], eventually moving its production to Broadway, where it became a hit, running from January 8, 1981, to November 28, 1982.&lt;ref name=imbd&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]] |title=Linda Ronstadt |url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=58306 |accessdate=May 8, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015170003/http://ibdb.com/person.asp?id=58306|archive-date=October 15, 2007}}http://www.ibdb.com/Person/View/58306&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' was effusive in its praise: "... she has not dodged the [[coloratura]] demands of her role (and Mabel is one of the most demanding parts in the G&amp;S canon): from her entrance trilling 'Poor Wand'ring One,' it is clear that she is prepared to scale whatever soprano peaks stand in her way."&lt;ref name=bronson /&gt; Ronstadt co-starred with Kline and [[Angela Lansbury]] in the 1983 operetta's film version. Ronstadt received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for the role in the film version. She garnered a nomination for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]] and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' won several Tony Awards, including a [[Tony Award for Best Revival]].

As a child, Ronstadt had discovered the opera ''[[La bohème]]'' through the silent film with [[Lillian Gish]] and was determined to someday play the part of Mimi. When she met the opera superstar [[Beverly Sills]], she was told, ''"My dear, ''every'' soprano in the world wants to play Mimi!"'' In 1984, Ronstadt was cast in the role at Joseph Papp's [[Public Theater]]. However, the production was a critical and commercial disaster, closing after only a few nights.&lt;ref name=Mimi&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Newsweek]] |title=A Pop Star Goes Puccini |first=Jack |last=Kroll |date=December 10, 1984 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artnw84.htm |accessdate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Ronstadt released the album ''[[Get Closer (Linda Ronstadt album)|Get Closer]]'', a primarily rock album with some country and pop music as well. It remains her only album between 1975 and 1990 not to be officially certified platinum. It peaked at number 31 on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart. The release continued her streak of Top 40 hits with "Get Closer" and "[[I Knew You When]]"{{snds}}a 1965 hit by [[Billy Joe Royal]]{{snds}}while the [[Jimmy Webb]] song "Easy For You To Say" was a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the spring of 1983. "Sometimes You Just Can't Win" was picked up by country radio, and made it to number 27 on that listing. Ronstadt also filmed several music videos for this album which became popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel. The album earned Ronstadt two Grammy Award nominations: one for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female for the title track and another for Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for the album. The artwork won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], his second Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Package]].

Along with the release of her ''Get Closer'' album, Ronstadt embarked on a North American tour, remaining one of the top rock-concert draws that summer and fall. On November 25, 1982, her "Happy Thanksgiving Day" concert was held at the [[Reunion Arena]] in Dallas and broadcast live via satellite to [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] radio stations in the United States.&lt;ref name=dallas&gt;{{cite web |work=Billboard |title=Linda Ronstadt Live.

=== Artistic aspirations ===
Ronstadt has remarked that in the beginning of her career she "was so focused on folk, rock and country" that she "got a bit bored and started to branch out, and ... [has] been doing that ever since."&lt;ref name=bored12&gt;{{cite news |title=Linda Ronstadt to Play at Fantasy Springs |newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise|Press-Enterprise]] |location=Riverside, California |first=Paul |last=Saitowitz |date=May 31, 2007 |url=http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Ent_Guide_D_ronstadt01.19591ed.html |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095508/http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Ent_Guide_D_ronstadt01.19591ed.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, her estimated worth was over $40 million&lt;ref name="Reported worth"&gt;{{cite web |title=What's New with Linda Ronstadt?

Ronstadt eventually tired of playing arenas.&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt; She had ceased to feel that arenas, where people milled around smoking marijuana cigarettes and drinking beer, were "appropriate places for music". She wanted "angels in the architecture"{{snds}}a reference to a lyric in the [[Paul Simon]] song "[[You Can Call Me Al]]" from the 1986 album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]''. (Ronstadt sang harmony with Simon on a different ''Graceland'' track, "[[Under African Skies]]". The second verse's lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: "Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona.&amp;nbsp;..."). Ronstadt has said she wants to sing in places similar to the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], where the attention is focused on the stage and the performer.&lt;ref name=angels&gt;{{cite web |work=Gazette'' (Montreal)'' |first=M. |last=Boone |date=July 18, 2007 |title=Great Musicians and Their Legions of Paying Fans Deserve a Great Venue |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=3d66e8e0-b5c8-4106-a56b-95d023c067c3 |accessdate=July 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015160703/http://canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=3d66e8e0-b5c8-4106-a56b-95d023c067c3 |archivedate=October 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt's recording output in the 1980s proved to be just as commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990, Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two are triple platinum (each with over three million U.S. copies sold); one has been certified double platinum (over two million copies sold); and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double-disc album.&lt;ref name="certifications" /&gt;

By recording [[traditional pop]], [[Old-time music|traditional country]] and [[Latin American music|traditional Latin roots]] Ronstadt resonated with a different fan base and diversified her appeal.

=== Jazz/pop trilogy ===
In 1981, Ronstadt produced and recorded an album pop standards (later marketed in [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] form) titled ''Keeping Out of Mischief'' with the assistance of producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. However, Ronstadt's displeasure with the final result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project. "Doing that killed me," she said in a ''Time'' magazine interview.&lt;ref name="Time interview"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Linda Leads the Band |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833-2,00.html |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |date=September 26, 1983 |first1=Jay |last1=Cocks |first2=Denise |last2=Worrell}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the appeal of the album's music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told ''[[Down Beat]]'' in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her.&lt;ref name="Jerry Wexler"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Down Beat]] |title=An Intimate Conversation with Linda Ronstadt |first=Steve |last=Bloom |date=July 1985 |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdb85.htm |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to convince her reluctant record company, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], to approve this type of album under her contract.&lt;ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle" /&gt;

By 1983, Ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62-year-old conductor [[Nelson Riddle]]. The two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]], recording a trilogy of [[traditional pop]] albums: ''[[What's New (Linda Ronstadt album)|What's New]]'' (1983{{nsmdns}}U.S. 3.7 million as of 2010); ''[[Lush Life (Linda Ronstadt album)|Lush Life]]'' (1984{{nsmdns}}U.S. 1.7 million as of 2010); and ''[[For Sentimental Reasons (Linda Ronstadt album)|For Sentimental Reasons]]'' (1986{{nsmdns}}U.S. 1.3 million as of 2010). The three albums have had a combined sales total of nearly seven million copies in the U.S. alone.

The album design for ''What's New'' by designer [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]] was unlike any of her previous disc covers. It showed Ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a [[Walkman]] headset. At the time, Ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered "elevator music" by cynics, but remained determined to record with Riddle, and ''What's New'' became a hit. The album was released in September 1983 and spent 81 weeks on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart and held the number three position for a month and a half (held out of the top spot only by [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' and [[Lionel Richie|Lionel Richie's]] ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'') and the [[RIAA]] [[certified]] it triple platinum&lt;ref name = RIAAsearch /&gt; (over three million copies sold in the U.S. alone). The album earned Ronstadt another [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and critical raves, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine calling it "one of the gutsiest, most unorthodox and unexpected albums of the year."&lt;ref name="TimeWhatsNewReview"&gt;{{cite news |title=Music: Linda Leads the Band |date=September 26, 1983 |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' {{subscription required}}|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833,00.html |archiveurl=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arttm83.htm |archivedate= August 8, 2008| deadurl=no |accessdate= September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt faced considerable pressure not to record ''What's New'' or record with Riddle. According to jazz historian [[Peter Levinson]], author of the book ''September in the Rain{{snds}}a Biography on Nelson Riddle'', Joe Smith, president of Elektra Records, was terrified that the Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt's rock audience.&lt;ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle"&gt;{{cite web |work=Jerry Jazz Musician |title=The Peter Levinson Interview |url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html |accessdate=June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured [[Danny Kortchmar]] as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.

''What's New'' brought Riddle to a younger audience. According to Levinson, "the younger audience hated what Riddle had done with [[Frank Sinatra]],&lt;ref name=nelsonriddle&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Levinson (Interview) |publisher=jerryjazzmusician.com |url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html |accessdate=June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1983 was considered 'Vintage Pop'". Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life.&lt;ref name=nelsonriddle /&gt; [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, ''What's New'' "isn't the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that [[Beatlemania]] and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teenagers undid in the mid-60s.&amp;nbsp;... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print."&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Linda Ronstadt Celebrate the Golden Age of Pop |author=[[Stephen Holden|Holden, Stephen]] |date=September 4, 1983 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/arts/linda-ronstadt-celebrates-the-golden-age-of-pop.html |accessdate=May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''What's New'' is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]].&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

In 1984, Ronstadt and Riddle performed these songs live, in [[concert halls]] throughout Australia, Japan, and the United States, including multi-night performances at historic venues [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Radio City Music Hall]], and [[Pine Knob]].

In 2004, Ronstadt released ''[[Hummin' to Myself (Linda Ronstadt album)|Hummin' to Myself]]'', her album for [[Verve Records]]. It was her first foray into [[traditional jazz]] since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|combo]]. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as promotion. It reached number 2 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at number 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that [[Warner Music Group]] gave her, ''Hummin' To Myself'' had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.&lt;ref name="JazzTimes2" /&gt;

==== "Trio" recordings ====

In 1978, Ronstadt, [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Emmylou Harris]], friends and admirers of one another's work (Ronstadt had included a cover of Parton's "[[I Will Always Love You]]" on ''Prisoner in Disguise'') attempted to collaborate on a ''Trio'' album. Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.

In January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'', which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the number 1 position on Billboard's Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the pop side also. Selling over three million copies in the U.S. and winning them a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], it produced four Top Ten Country singles including "[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]" which hit number 1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, [[U2]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Whitney Houston]].

In 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to ''Trio''. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album's release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time{{nsmdns}}and owed her record company a finished album{{nsmdns}}removed Parton's individual tracks at Parton's request, kept Harris's vocals, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to country rock, the album ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]''.

However, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton, and Harris agreed to release the ''[[Trio II]]'' album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of [[Neil Young|Neil Young's]] "[[After The Gold Rush (song)|After The Gold Rush]]" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with [[George Massenburg]] and the three ladies also received a nomination for the Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]].

==== ''Canciones'' – songs of the Ronstadt family ====
At the end of 1987, Ronstadt released ''[[Canciones de Mi Padre]]'', an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as "world class songs".  Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician [[Rubén Fuentes]].

These ''canciones'' were a big part of Ronstadt's family tradition and musical roots. For example, the history of this album goes back half a century. In January 1946, the [[University of Arizona]] published a booklet by Luisa Espinel entitled ''Canciones de mi Padre''.&lt;ref name=MyFathersSongs&gt;{{cite web |work=Tucson'sRonstadtFamily |title=The Singing Ronstadts and Canciones de mi Padre – A Musical Family |first=James S. |last=Griffith |url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html |accessdate=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt's aunt, was an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Espinel's father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda Ronstadt's grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed, and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from [[Sonora]]. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt's booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible U.S. accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American.&lt;ref name=MexAm&gt;{{cite web |title=American Way |work=Linda Ronstadt's New Old Flame- Mexican Music |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm |accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her formative years were spent with her father's side of the family.&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Herbst |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |title=The Rolling Stone Interview |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |accessdate=October 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022112308/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a traditional Mexican folk ballad, ''"Lo siento mi vida"''{{snds}}a song that she included in her Grammy Award-winning album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. Also, Ronstadt has credited Mexican singer [[Lola Beltrán]] as an influence in her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, [[Lalo Guerrero|Eduardo "Lalo" Guerrero]], father of [[Chicano]] music, would often serenade her as a child.&lt;ref name="AARP-07" /&gt;

This album won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican-American Performance]]. The real achievement, however, is the disc's [[RIAA]] double-platinum&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch /&gt; (over two million copies sold in the U.S.) certification, making it the biggest-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. Another achievement is that the album and later theatrical stage show served as a benchmark of Latin cultural renaissance in North America.

Ronstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show in concert halls across the U.S. and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences, including on Broadway. She called the stage show by the same name ''Canciones de mi Padre''. These performances were released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, four years after she performed in ''La bohème'', for a limited-run engagement. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Great Performances'' aired the stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].

Ronstadt later recorded two additional discs of Latin music in the early 1990s; their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, was a quieter affair, where she appeared to do the "bare minimum" to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as ''Canciones De Mi Padre'', but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991, she released ''[[Mas Canciones]]'', a follow-up to the first ''Canciones''. For this effort she won a [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album]]. The following year, she stepped outside of the mariachi genre and decided to record well known "afro-Cuban" songs. This disc was titled ''[[Frenesí (album)|Frenesí]]''. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, this third Latin album won Ronstadt another Grammy Award, this time the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album]].

In 1991, Ronstadt acted in the lead role of arch angel San Miguel in ''La Pastorela'', or ''A Shephard's Tale'', a musical filmed at ''[[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]''. It was written and directed by [[Luis Valdez]]. The production was part of the PBS ''Great Performances'' series.

==== Returning to the contemporary music scene ====
By the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987, she made a return to the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart with "[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]", which peaked at number 2 in March.&lt;ref name=bronson /&gt; Featured in the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'', the sentimental duet with [[James Ingram]] was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]]. The song also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S.{{snds}}one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, [[Steven Spielberg]] asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was titled "[[Dreams to Dream]]". Although "Dreams to Dream" failed to achieve the success of "Somewhere Out There", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.

In 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. ''[[Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind]]'' became one of the singer's most successful albums{{snds}}in production, arrangements, sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's tenth Top 10 album on the ''Billboard'' chart, reaching number 7 and being certified triple-platinum&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch /&gt; (over three million copies sold in the U.S.). The album also received Grammy Award nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/linda-ronstadt|title=Artist Linda Ronstadt|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt included New Orleans soul singer [[Aaron Neville]] on several of the album's songs.

Ronstadt incorporated the sounds of the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]], [[Tower of Power]] horns, the [[Skywalker Symphony]], and numerous musicians. It had the duets with Aaron Neville, "[[Don't Know Much]]" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 2 hit, Christmas 1989&lt;ref name=bronson /&gt;) and "[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 11 hit), both of which were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits. The duets earned several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed "Don't Know Much" together on the telecast.&lt;ref name=kqed /&gt; ("Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can't do by myself", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. "I can do things with Aaron that I can't do alone.")&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Ron (February 11, 2007). "Home Grown". ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1990, she participated in a concert held at the [[Tokyo Dome]] to commemorate [[John Lennon|John Lennon's]] 50th birthday, and to raise awareness of environmental issues. Other participants included [[Miles Davis]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Hall &amp; Oates]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Yoko Ono]], and [[Sean Lennon]]. An album resulted, titled ''Happy Birthday, John''.&lt;ref name=Lennon&gt;{{cite web |title=John Lennon Super Live -- Japan |work=Dream Power |first=Hisataka |last=Suzuki |first2=Shiona |last2=MacKenzie |date=November 9, 2001 |url=http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/dreampower2001.html |accessdate=May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A return to roots music ===
Ronstadt released the highly acclaimed ''[[Winter Light (Linda Ronstadt album)|Winter Light]]'' album at the end of 1993. It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single "[[Heartbeats Accelerating]]" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the glass harmonica. It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]'' was Ronstadt's much heralded return to country-rock and included her version of [[Tom Petty|Tom Petty's]] classic hit "[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]". The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, "Walk On", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled "The Blue Train" charted 10 weeks in ''Billboard''{{'}}s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog. Ronstadt was nominated for three [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Awards]] in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song "Perfidia" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year.&lt;ref name="billboardmag"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lannert |first=John |date=March 30, 1993 |title=Secada Lead Latin Noms Following Grammy Win |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |volume=105 |issue=10 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=no+se+tu+luis+miguel&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_PzlUJ3QOcKsjALfhYEQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=no%20se%20tu%20luis%20miguel&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Ronstadt produced ''[[Dedicated to the One I Love (album)|Dedicated to the One I Love]]'', an album of classic rock and roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The album reached number 78 in ''Billboard'' and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children]].

In 1998, Ronstadt released ''[[We Ran]]'', her first album in over two years. The album harkened back to Ronstadt's country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock 'n' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[John Hiatt]]. The recording was produced by [[Glyn Johns]]. A commercial failure, the album stood at 57,897 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008.  It is the poorest-selling studio album in Ronstadt's Elektra/Asylum catalog. ''We Ran'' did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.

Despite the lack of success of ''We Ran'', Ronstadt kept moving towards this adult rock exploration. In the summer of 1999, she released the album ''[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]'', a folk-rock-oriented project with EmmyLou Harris. It earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for the Best Contemporary Folk Album, and made the Top 10 of ''Billboard''{{'}}s Country Albums chart. Still in print as of December 2016, it has sold 223,255 copies per [[Nielsen SoundScan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Also in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots, when she performed with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Jackson Browne]] at [[Staples Center|Staples Center's]] 1999 New Year's Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and General Manager Bobby Goldwater said, "It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century", and "Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century. Their performances will constitute a singular and historic night of entertainment for New Year's Eve in Los Angeles."&lt;ref name=NewYearsEve&gt;{{cite web |title=The Eagles to Perform at Staples Center |date=May 6, 1999 |publisher=Staples Center |url=http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135754/http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Ronstadt completed her long contractual relationship with the [[Elektra Records|Elektra/Asylum label]]. The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of ''[[A Merry Little Christmas (Linda Ronstadt album)|A Merry Little Christmas]]'', her first holiday collection, which includes rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song "[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]", and a rare recorded duet with the late [[Rosemary Clooney]] on Clooney's signature song, "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]".

Since leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Vanguard Records]].

In 2006, recording as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt teamed with her new friend, musician and musical scholar [[Ann Savoy]], to record ''[[Adieu False Heart]]''. It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But ''Adieu False Heart'' was a commercial failure, peaking at number 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year. It was the last time Linda Ronstadt would record an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as the result of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in December 2012. ''Adieu False Heart'', recorded in [[Louisiana]], features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of [[the Red Stick Ramblers]], Sam Broussard of [[the Mamou Playboys]], [[Dirk Powell]], and [[Joel Savoy]], as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler [[Stuart Duncan]], mandolinist [[Sam Bush]], and guitarist [[Bryan Sutton]]. The recording earned two Grammy Award nominations: [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album|Best Traditional Folk Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].

In 2007, Ronstadt contributed to the compilation album ''[[We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song]]''{{snds}}a tribute album to jazz music's all-time most heralded artist{{snds}}on the track "[[Miss Otis Regrets]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm Linda Ronstadt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024115915/http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm |date=October 24, 2016 }} Rock on the Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Ronstadt headlined the [[Newport Folk Festival]], making her debut at this event, where she incorporated jazz, rock, and folk music into her repertoire. It was one of her final concerts.

In 2010, Ronstadt contributed the arrangement and lead vocal to "A La Orilla de un Palmar" on [[the Chieftains|the Chieftains']] studio album ''[[San Patricio (album)|San Patricio]]'' (with [[Ry Cooder]]).  This remains her most recent commercially available recording as lead vocalist.

=== Retirement ===
In 2011, Ronstadt was interviewed by the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' and announced her retirement.&lt;ref name="retirement"&gt;{{cite web |author=Burch, Cathalena E. |date=April 22, 2011 |title=Ronstadt: Legacy 'Belongs 100 Percent to Nelson' |url=http://azstarnet.com/entertainment/blogs/caliente-tuned-in/ronstadt-legacy-belongs-percent-to-nelson/article_17e2d7b2-6ca0-11e0-b37e-001cc4c002e0.html |work=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, she revealed to [[AARP]] that she has [[Parkinson's disease]] and "can no longer sing a note."&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Mansfield|Mansfield, Brian]] (August 23, 2013).

As of 2018, Ronstadt has earned three number 1 pop albums, 10 top-ten pop albums and 38 charting pop albums on the ''Billboard'' Pop Album Charts. She has 15 albums on the [[Top Country Albums|''Billboard'' Top Country Albums]] chart,  including four that hit number 1. Ronstadt's singles have earned her a number 1 hit and three number 2 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, with 10 top-ten pop singles and 21 reaching the Top 40. She has also scored two number 1 hits on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]] chart, and two number 1 hits and on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart. ''Rolling Stone'' wrote, a whole generation "but for her, might never have heard the work of [[Buddy Holly]], [[Chuck Berry]], or [[Elvis Costello]]."&lt;ref name="interpreter6" /&gt;

She has recorded and released over 30 studio albums and has made guest appearances on an estimated 120 albums by other artists. Her guest appearances included the classical minimalist [[Philip Glass|Philip Glass's]] album ''[[Songs from Liquid Days]]'', a hit classical record with other major pop stars either singing or writing lyrics. She also appeared on Glass's follow-up recording ''[[1000 Airplanes on the Roof]]''. She appeared on [[Paul Simon|Paul Simon's]] ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'', where she sang second voice on a song of Simon's called "[[Under African Skies]]." In that song, there is a verse dedicated to Ronstadt, to her amazing voice and harmonies and her birth in Tucson, Arizona. She voiced herself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Mr. Plow]]" and sang a duet, "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]," with [[Homer Simpson]] on ''[[The Yellow Album]]''. Ronstadt has also recorded albums with [[Billy Eckstine]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[the Chieftains]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Neil Young]], [[J. D.

After living in Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco because she said she never felt at home in Southern California.&lt;ref name=SFGateSale /&gt; "Los Angeles became too enclosing an environment", she says. "I couldn't breathe the air, and I didn't want to drive on the freeways to get to the studio. I also didn't want to embrace the values that have been so completely embraced by that city. Are you glamorous? Are you rich? Are you important? Do you have clout? It's just not me, and it never was me." &lt;ref name=NYTGarden /&gt; In 1997, Ronstadt sold her home in San Francisco and moved back to her hometown of Tucson, Arizona, to raise her two children.&lt;ref name=SFGateSale /&gt; In more recent years, Ronstadt moved back to San Francisco while continuing to maintain her home in Tucson.

In 2009, in honor of Ronstadt, the [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin Guitar Company]] made a 00{{ndash}}42 model "Linda Ronstadt Limited Edition" acoustic guitar.

In August 2013, Ronstadt revealed she has [[Parkinson's disease]], leaving her unable to sing due to loss of muscular control, which is common to Parkinson's patients. She was diagnosed eight months prior to the announcement and had initially attributed the symptoms she had been experiencing to the aftereffects of shoulder surgery and a tick bite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Linda Ronstadt has Parkinson's Disease |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/08/23/linda-ronstadt-parkinsons-disease/2694053/ |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |first=Brian |last=Mansfield |date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt Says She Has Parkinson's Disease |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/08/24/linda-ronstadt-says-she-has-parkinsons-disease/ |publisher=CBS San Francisco Bay Area |accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt describes herself as a "spiritual [[atheist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Asked about her religious beliefs on ''[[The Tavis Smiley Show]]'' (September 26, 2013), she replied, "I'm a spiritual atheist."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political activism ===
Ronstadt's politics received criticism and praise during and after her July 17, 2004, performance at the [[Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Toward the end of the show, as she had done across the country, Ronstadt spoke to the audience, praising ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', [[Michael Moore]]'s documentary film about the [[Iraq War]]; she dedicated the song "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]" to Moore.&lt;ref name=aladdin2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Progressive |work=Linda Ronstadt Gets the Hook at Aladdin |first=Matthew |last=Rothschild |date=July 21, 2004 |url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_mclindar |accessdate=May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts say the crowd's initial reaction was mixed, with "half the crowd heartily applauding her praise for Moore, (and) the other half booing."&lt;ref name=aladdin2 /&gt;

Following the concert, news accounts reported that Ronstadt was "evicted" from the hotel premises.&lt;ref name=aladdin&gt;{{cite web |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |title=Aladdin officials defend eviction of singer after political comments |first=Mike |last=Weatherford |date=July 20, 2004 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Jul-20-Tue-2004/news/24348468.html |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt's comments, as well as the reactions of some audience members and the hotel, became a topic of discussion nationwide. Aladdin casino president Bill Timmins and Michael Moore each made public statements on the controversy.&lt;ref name=aladdin1&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Michael Moore |title=Open Letter to Bill Timmins, President Aladdin Casino and Hotels |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-07-19 |accessdate=June 24, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319134057/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-07-19|archive-date=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident prompted international headlines and debate on an entertainer's right to express a political opinion from the stage and made the editorial section of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Desperadoes&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Desperadoes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/21/opinion/21wed4.html |date=July 21, 2004 |accessdate=May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, many friends of Ronstadt's, including the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], immediately cancelled their engagements at the Aladdin.&lt;ref name=kqed /&gt; Ronstadt also received telegrams of support from her rock 'n' roll friends around the world, such as [[the Rolling Stones]], the Eagles, and [[Elton John]]. Amid reports of mixed public response, Ronstadt continued in her praise of Moore and his film throughout her 2004 and 2006 summer concerts across North America.

At a 2006 concert in Canada, Ronstadt told the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' that she was "embarrassed [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] (was) from the United States.&amp;nbsp;... He's an idiot. ... He's enormously incompetent on both the domestic and international scenes.&amp;nbsp;... Now the fact that we were lied to about the reasons for entering into war against Iraq and thousands of people have died{{nsmdns}}it's just as immoral as racism." Her remarks drew international headlines. In an August 14, 2007, interview, she commented on all her well-publicized, outspoken views, in particular the Aladdin incident, by noting, "If I had it to do over I would be much more gracious to everyone ... you can be as outspoken as you want if you are very, very respectful. Show some grace".&lt;ref name=Blogcritics&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: Linda Ronstadt |first=Nancy |last=Dunham |date=August 14, 2007 |publisher=Blogcritics |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/08/14/085901.php |accessdate=November 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014155540/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/08/14/085901.php |archivedate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Ronstadt, in a well-publicized interview to [[Planet Out|PlanetOut Inc.]] titled "Linda Ronstadt's Gay Mission", championed gay rights and same-sex marriage, and stated that "homophobia is anti-family values. Period, end of story."&lt;ref name="PlanetOut09"&gt;{{cite web |title=Linda Ronstadt's Gay Mission |publisher=[[Planet Out]] |date=August 26, 2009 |first=Jenny |last=Stewart |url=http://www.gay.net/entertainment/2009/08/legend-linda-ronstadt-gay-lesbian-mission.html |accessdate=April 30, 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731025545/http://www.gay.net/entertainment/2009/08/legend-linda-ronstadt-gay-lesbian-mission.html|archive-date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2010, Ronstadt converged with thousands of other activists in a "National Day of Action". Ronstadt stated that her "dog in the fight"{{snds}}as a native Arizonan and coming from a law enforcement family{{snds}}was the treatment of illegal aliens and Arizona's enforcement of its illegal immigrant law, especially Maricopa County Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]]'s immigration efforts.&lt;ref name=NDAProtest&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Phoenix New Times]] |title=Linda Ronstadt Calls Joe Arpaio 'a Sadistic Man', Will Participate in Anti-Arpaio Human Rights March Saturday, January 16 |first=Stephen |last=Lemons |date=December 29, 2009 |url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2009/12/linda_ronstadt_call_joe_arpaio.php |accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt has also been outspoken on environmental and community issues. She is a major supporter and admirer of sustainable agriculture pioneer [[Wes Jackson]], saying in 2000, "the work he's doing right now is the most important work there is in the (United States)",&lt;ref name=Engaged /&gt; and dedicating the rock anthem "Desperado" to him at an August 2007 concert in [[Kansas City, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=SalinaJ&gt;{{cite web |title=Ex-Interior Department secretary says The Land Institute on right track |work=[[Salina Journal]] |date=October 1, 2007 |author=Strand, Michael |url=http://www.saljournal.com/rdnews/story/Prairie100107 |accessdate=November 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224214156/http://www.saljournal.com/rdnews/story/Prairie100107 |archivedate=December 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of Mbunda Chiefs in Zambia}}'''GAWA KALONGA UNDI ( Chewa people of Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania)'''

The Chewa are a large group of people estimated at over 12 million and usually come together during the annual traditional ceremony called the Kulamba ceremony.

'''Kulamba Traditional Ceremony'''

The Kulamba traditional ceremony is celebrated towards the end of August each year at Mkaika, the headquarters of the Chewa people in Katete District of Zambia.

This is the time for the Kulamba, or paying homage. All the subordinate chiefs in Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique come to Katete at Mkaika to pay their tributes and join in the celebrations with their people.

The ceremony, held after harvest in late August, is a way of bringing together different Chewa chiefs from the three countries to present their reports of grievances to paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi. The name Kalonga means the one who installs subordinate chiefs. Gawa is the one who gives out land and Undi means the one who protects the subordinates. The Kalonga Gawa Undi is head of all the Chewa chiefdoms and takes care of all the installations of chiefs not only in Zambia but in Malawi and Mozambique as well.

The ceremony was banned by the colonial masters in 1934 but paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi Chivunga revived the ceremony in 1984. Since then it has been an annual event. On the day of the ceremony, the center of attraction is the main area where all the dignitaries are seated. The entrance of paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi into the arena signifies the start of the ceremony. Visitors from Zambia and Chewa's from neighboring Malawi and Mozambique are entertained to a variety of dances that are from three countries.

A variety of dances like Gule Wamukulu (Nyau), Gologolo, Makanja, Muganda, Chinamwali, Chimtali (the female dance) and many others are performed during the ceremony. The Nyau or popularly known as the Gule Wamukulu among locals, is the most celebrated dance among the Chewa people.

The Nyau dance (Gule Wamukulu) was officially recognized by UNESCO in 2006. Nyau dancers are referred to as Vilombo (animals) in Chewa, believed to emanate from dead spirits. There are a lot of Nyau dances at any ceremony. The type of the dance depends to a larger extent on the nature of the occasion. More than 30 different Nyau dances are performed at a single festival with each dancer adorning a different mask in an array of colors.

Some of the Nyau masks are a reflection of human behavior in true life. The people can tell the type of Nyau entertaining them through its dress or mask. Some Nyau are frightening while others are fun.

Also part of the Kulamba ceremony is an annual initiation ceremony for the young girls who have come of age. The ?anamwali? or young girls have been in confinement where they have spent time being taught skills and responsibilities of womanhood.

Kulamba ceremony is proving to be a big annual event, bringing together chiefs from 137 chiefdoms in Malawi, 33 in Mozambique and 42 in Zambia. The significance of this is its ability to bring Chewa under different chiefdoms and countries to Mkaika, capital of the Chewa and palace of paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi, to celebrate these festivals together regardless of today?s political boundaries.

The Llauders were first recorded in the late 15th century, its representatives noted as blacksmiths based in the Catalan town of [[Argentona]].&lt;ref&gt;Enric Subińà i Coll, ''La Torre Llauder: La masia i els seus propietaris'', [in:] ''XV Sessió Estudis Mataronins. Comunicacions presentades'', Mataró 1998, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In course of the next two centuries the family grew into prominence and wealth, accumulating a number of estates in [[Mataró]] and [[Barcelona]]; since mid-17th century its senior was honorary citizen of the Catalan capital.&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 82; the city ceased to recognise the title in the early 19th century&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century the family built an iconic Mataró mansion known as [[:ca:Vil·la romana de Torre Llauder|Torre Llauder]]&lt;ref&gt;the mansion was sold by Llauder family in 1915 and changed hands a number of times, gradually falling into decrepit condition; though it was declared part of national heritage, half-abandoned it was demolished in 1970, Subińà 1998, pp. 79, 94. Since the early 1960s the plot was site of archeological works; declared remnants of ancient Roman village, in 1980 it was re-arranged as a museum&lt;/ref&gt; and kept living there interchanging with the residence at intersection of the Hèrcules and Arlet streets in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Luis' great-grandfather, José Antonio Llauder y Duran, commenced industrial activities upon receiving concession to exploit water springs;&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; despite damages suffered during the [[Peninsular War]], the business was developed further on by his son José Francisco Llauder y Camín, who died in 1824 already as the first taxpayer of Mataró.&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ULL.87.23.14.jpg|thumbnail|160px|young Llauder]]
José Francisco's son and the father of Luis, Ramón de Llauder y Freixes (1807–1870), inherited the family wealth and prestige. He fell in love with María Mercedes de Dalmases y de Bufalà (died 1885),&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 92; for her death date see ''La Hormiga de Oro'' 07.06.85, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012078479&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; also a Catalan native of [[Sant Martí Sesgueioles]],&lt;ref name="Canal 2003, p. 30"&gt;Canal 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; descendant to a wealthy [[bourgeoisie]] family.&lt;ref&gt;''El fons del llinatge Massot-Dalmases'', [in:] ''Lo Carranquer'' blog 31.03.15, available [http://locarranquer.blogspot.com/2015/03/el-fons-del-llinatge-massot-dalmases.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1837&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 92; the 1837 date of marriage seems somewhat odd, given their son Luis was born in May 1837&lt;/ref&gt; and initially settled in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;though most sources claim that Llauder was born in Madrid, according to one author it was in Mataró, Francisco de Paula, ''Album de Personajes Carlistas con sus Biografias'', volume II, Barcelona 1888, vol. 2, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; but they soon moved to the Llauder residence in Barcelona; Ramon remained the first taxpayer of Mataró.&lt;ref name="Subińà 1998, p. 92"&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from integration and further development of the family businesses, he made his name as a lawyer and became member of [[Supreme Court of Spain|Tribunal Supremo]].&lt;ref name="Subińà 1998, p. 92"/&gt; He is known as a fervent Catholic who donated large sums to the Church, including financing of a newly set up [[Poor Clares]] convent. Ramon demonstrated interest in charity, further developed also by Luis, e.g. founding and financing a school for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, pp. 92-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramon and María had 6 children, except Luis all of them daughters;&lt;ref&gt;María Candelària, María Assumpció, María del Àngels, María Ignàcia and Pilar&lt;/ref&gt; they were brought up in fervently Catholic ambience. One of them, Pilar, became nun of the [[Handmaids of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]] order.&lt;ref&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 93, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 22.03.82, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000062151&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear where the young Luis received his schooling; he obtained bachillerato in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; He then enrolled at the Civil and Canon law faculty of the [[Universitat de Barcelona]], graduating as licenciado in 1858;&lt;ref&gt;''La Corona'' 18.12.58, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026730994&amp;page=8 here]&lt;/ref&gt; one source claims he received technical education and graduated as engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Begoña Urigüen, ''Orígenes y evolución de la derecha española: el neo-catolicismo'', Madrid 1986, {{ISBN|9788400061579}}, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; As he inherited a real estate fortune and the industry enterprises, it is not clear whether he has ever practiced as a lawyer. He has never married and had no children.&lt;ref name="Subińà 1998, p. 93"&gt;Subińà 1998, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; A little known poet of the early 20th century, Lorenzo de Llauder y de Bonilla, was his distant relative.&lt;ref&gt;he was grandson of Luis’ grandfather's brother, see Enrique Toral y Fernández de Peñaranda, ''Vida y obra del poeta giennense de los floreos, don Lorenzo de Llauder y de Bonilla, quinto Marqués del Valle de Ribas'', [in:] ''Boletín del Instituto de Estudios Giennenses'' 180 (2002), pp. 545-572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early public activity==
[[File:CAZ,18.17.jpg|thumbnail|left|160px|''La Convicción'']]
There is little information on Llauder's public activity in the 1860s. He was certainly active in various Catholic groupings; having inherited from his father vivid interest in social issues and a penchant for charity, in 1863 he was acknowledged as engaged in Caridad Cristiana, a Barcelona philanthropic institution specializing in education; in the early 1864 he rose to deputy treasurer of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;''La Corona'' 05.02.64, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026775253&amp;page=8 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Llauder was also noted as active in regional realm in-between economy and public management: in 1865 he was secretary of comisión organizadora preparing an agricultural exposition in Mataró; within this body he represented the proprietors.&lt;ref&gt;''La Corona'' 24.07.65, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026783215&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a source which claims that in his youth he practiced as a lawyer, though the information is not confirmed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;"durante su juventud había sido un abogado distinguido", ''El Deber'' 14.06.02, available [http://pandora.bibgirona.cat/viewer.vm?id=0000142211&amp;page=16 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably engaged also in the family business; at unspecified time and under his guidance the number of family operated watermills rose from 2 to 5; he also upgraded some of them by mounting auxiliary steam engines.&lt;ref name="Subińà 1998, p. 93"/&gt;

It is not clear when Llauder commenced his lifelong career of a publisher and a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;a hagiographic piece claims that "en 1866 empezó a distinguirse ya como periodista", B. de Artagan [Reynaldo Brea], ''Políticos del carlismo'', Barcelona 1912, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; One author maintains that it was "shortly after" graduation when he tried his hand in letters, starting co-operation with local periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2003, p. 30; some authors claim he commenced writing in 1866, see Artagan 1912, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The first titles named are popular Catholic reviews ''La Sociedad Católica'',&lt;ref&gt;a Madrid based daily launched in 1865; he managed it at unspecified time before it ceased in 1867, José Navarro Cabanes, ''Apuntes bibliográficos de la prensa carlista'', Valencia 1917, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Amigo del Pueblo'' and ''El Criterio Católico'',&lt;ref&gt;a Barcelona based daily launched in 1866, Navarro 1917, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and the time is specified as "second half of the 1860s".&lt;ref&gt;''El Deber'' 14.06.02, available [http://pandora.bibgirona.cat/viewer.vm?id=0000142211&amp;page=16 here], Canal 2003, p. 30, Canal 1998, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that at that time he was formatted as a militant Catholic author rather than a partisan of any specific party. His opinion on politics of the era, especially on the crumbling rule of [[Isabel II of Spain|Isabel II]], is not known. It was only the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 and declaration of the [[First Spanish Republic]] that triggered Llauder's political career.

There were no known Carlist antecedents in Llauder's family. Political views of his father are unclear, while his paternal uncle, [[Carlos de Llauder y Freixes]], was well established in the Isabelline system as a [[Partido Moderado]] politician and a [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] deputy.&lt;ref&gt;see official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2861240%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; It was rather the brother of his paternal grandfather, [[:es:Manuel Llauder|Manuel de Llauder y Camín]], who gained nationwide recognition as a Carlist foe; when capitán general of Catalonia he made his name for engineering anti-Carlist repressions during and after the [[First Carlist War]].&lt;ref&gt;Artagan 1912, p. 105; for his own account see ''Memorias documentadas del teniente coronel don Manuel Llauder'', Madrid 1844, available [https://books.google.es/books?id=GOwCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;hl=pl#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is not clear how Llauder approached the Carlists in the late 1860s. Later party propaganda claimed that it was his bright intelligence that made him conclude, somewhat against the family background, that [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]] was the only way forward.&lt;ref&gt;"sobrino del famoso general Llauder, uno de los que más persiguieron a los legitimistas en la guerra civil, habiéndose educado al lado de parienres moderados, su inteligencia previsora, su gran conocimiento de las cosas y de los hombres a pesar de los pocos anos que cuenta, le hicieron comprender que la única salvación del pais estaba en la bandera legitimista", El Vizconde de la Esperanza [Julio Nombela ], ''La Bandera Carlista en 1871'', Madrid 1871, p. 305, quoted after Canal 2003, pp. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt; This became evident in his 1869 booklet, ''El desenlace de la revolución españoIa''. The work compared regimes of liberal monarchy, republic and traditionalist monarchy. Stemming mostly from Catholic principles, it declared Traditionalism the only viable option, advocating leadership of the Carlist claimant [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]]. ''Desenlace'' was focused on politics; the work by no means endorsed violence, the position that Llauder was to maintain through all later life.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own later accounts, the book was the first attempt "to fly the Carlist standard in Catalonia" during the [[Sexenio Democrático]].&lt;ref name="Canal 2003, p. 30"/&gt;

==Approach to, Third Carlist War and aftermath==
[[File:Carlist deputies and senators 1871.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|Llauder and Carlist MPs]]
''Desenlace'' earned Llauder his name in Catalan public discourse. He was welcomed in Asociación Católico-Monárquica,&lt;ref&gt;by the Carlist veteran Ramón Cabrera it was envisioned as a Carlist legal outpost and possibly a Spanish version of the English Tories, Urigüen 1986, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; an agglutinatory force attracting far-Right opposition. The formation was an alliance of [[:es:Neocatólico|neo-Catholics]], Conservatives and Carlists; though Llauder's non-belligerent stance was similar to that of the neos, a contemporary scholar clearly identifies him as a Carlist.&lt;ref&gt;Urigüen 1986, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; In the supplementary 1870 elections to Cortes Constituentes Llauder appeared on candidatura católico-monárquica in his native district of [[Vic]]h.&lt;ref&gt;Urigüen 1986, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; When elected&lt;ref&gt;see the 1870 mandate at official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2861250%29.NDIP. here].&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the 23-member Carlist minority.&lt;ref&gt;Urigüen 1986, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; In the successive 1871 campaign he ran&lt;ref&gt;according to his later account, the objective was not to govern or share power, but to protest Republican injustice towards religion and society, Urigüen 1986, pp. 429-30&lt;/ref&gt; on the same ticket from [[Berga]], elected with 97% of all votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;see the 1871 mandate at official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=2-2&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2861250%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1872 he again stood in Berga;&lt;ref&gt;''La Esperanza'' 22.03.72, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002540678&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though initially reported victorious,&lt;ref&gt;''El Imparcial'' 09.04.72, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000488778&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in unclear circumstances he was finally declared defeated.&lt;ref&gt;the victorious candidate gained only 34% of the votes cast, see the 1872 Berga mandate at official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDBuscHisDip?_piref73_1340033_73_1340032_1340032.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXDSP.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%40ELEN%26gt%3B%3D%2229%22+%26+%40ELEN%26lt%3B%3D%2230%22+%26+%28%22BERGA%22%29.DIST. here] also ''La Epoca'' 10.04.72, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000294164&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1870s Llauder's career of a publisher was already in full swing. Around 1870&lt;ref&gt;according to most scholars, but one source claims the correct date is 1868, Solange Hibbs-Lissorgues, ''La prensa católica catalana de 1868 a 1900 (II)'', [in:] ''Anales de Literatura Española'' 9 (1993), p. 97, also Navarro 1917, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; he founded with his own money a Barcelona-based daily ''La Convicción'',&lt;ref name="de Paula 1888, p. 184"&gt;de Paula 1888, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; acting also as a manager and [[editor-in-chief]] until the title was closed in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2003, p. 30 Urigüen 1986, p. 351, Solange Hibbs-Lissorgues, ''La prensa católica catalana de 1868 a 1900 (I)'', [in:] ''Anales de Literatura Española'' 7 (1991), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Though the paper demonstrated clear Traditionalist leaning, its political strategy appear confusing. On the one hand Llauder demonstrated much flexibility. In 1871 he advocated alliance of all opposition groupings; the call raised eyebrows of those - like [[:es:Francisco Navarro Villoslada|Navarro Villoslada]] - who were surprised at having been encouraged to join ranks with the radical republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Urigüen 1986, pp. 429-30&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Llauder demonstrated a doctrinaire position when lambasting the neo-Catholic [[:es:José María Quadrado|José María Quadrado]]&lt;ref&gt;who claimed that one can be a good Catholic not being a Carlist&lt;/ref&gt; by calling him a liberal disciple of [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]].&lt;ref&gt;he wrote that Carlist standard was "en la cual el católico puede esperar tranquilamente la muerte sin que tenga que hacer retractaciones y arrepentirse de otra cosa que no haver luchado bastante pos su triunfo", Urigüen 1986, pp. 351-2&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars present different views on Llauder's position versus amalgamation with the neo-Catholics; some claim he opposed it&lt;ref&gt;a present-day scholar claims that while [[:es:Joan Mañé i Flaquer|Juan Mañé y Flaquer]] represented the Carlist press sympathetic towards a merger with the Neos, Llauder stood for the branch opposing it, Urigüen 1986, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; and some claim he himself approached them.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; At that time he was already considered "prestigioso periodista".&lt;ref&gt;Urigüen 1986, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1872 nafarroa.jpg|thumbnail|160px|Carlist subjects, 1870s]]
Shortly before outbreak of the [[Third Carlist War]] Llauder was an eminent party figure in Catalonia, rising to presidency of the Barcelona Ateneo Católico-monárquica&lt;ref&gt;''La Esperanza'' 02.03.72, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002540174&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and Junta Provincial Católico-monárquica.&lt;ref&gt;his deputy was Rafael de Llanza, ''La Regeneración'' 02.03.72, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026701939&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1870 he was living intermittently in Spain and abroad, mostly in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Vevey]], where he accompanied the claimant and his brother [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Don Alfonso Carlos]].&lt;ref name="de Paula 1888, p. 184"/&gt; At the outbreak of hostilities as a renowned propagandist he felt endangered by republican militants and did not return to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''La Convicción'' 15.08.72, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004147345&amp;page=1 here], also Artagan 1912, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; His exact war record is not clear, though he probably did not take part in hostilities. At least temporarily he accompanied Carlos VII in [[Gipuzkoa]];&lt;ref name="de Paula 1888, p. 184"/&gt; in mid-1873 the press reported him as nominated secretary to Alfonso Carlos,&lt;ref&gt;''La Discussión'' 29.05.73, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002422024&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though later he was noted as resident in the French [[Prats-de-Mollo]], active within a group of recovering Carlist combatants.&lt;ref&gt;''La Esperanza'' 07.10.75, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002562009&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; No further information is available; one scholar summarizes his contribution to the Carlist war effort as "modestíssima".&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Carlist defeat Llauder did not return to Spain. In 1876 the claimant nominated him secretary to Junta de Generales,&lt;ref name="de Paula 1888, p. 184"/&gt; a rather ineffective makeshift Carlist executive set up by Carlos VII prior to his departure to America. Some sources claim that until 1878 he permanently resided in [[Rome]], acting as sort of a Carlist diplomatic envoy to [[Holy See|Vatican]],&lt;ref&gt;de Paula 1888, pp. 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; though contemporary press noticed his taking part in the 1877 pilgrimage to [[Zaragoza]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 19.07.77, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000023122&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nocedalista==
[[File:Candido Nocedal.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|[[:es:Cándido Nocedal|Candido Noceda]]l]]
Back in Spain Llauder resumed public activity in the Carlist realm. It was very much pursued along the lines set up by [[:es:Cándido Nocedal|Candido Nocedal]], who intended to format the party as focused on religious issues and vehemently opposed to the emerging [[Restoration (Spain)|Restauración]] regime. Already shortly after the military defeat Llauder joined Nocedal in a plot, aimed against Junta de Generales, and served as liaison with a number of distinguished Carlist figures.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 41, Javier Real Cuesta, ''El Carlismo Vasco 1876–1900'', Madrid 1985, {{ISBN|9788432305108}}, pp. 4-5, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Once Nocedal was appointed the official jefe delegado in 1879, Llauder emerged as top Catalan exponent of his political line, known as [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrism]]. Since key nocedalista means of mobilization were public events styled as Catholic feasts, especially pilgrimages, in 1879 Llauder became member of Junta Directiva organizing another massive excursion to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 14.11.79, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000047818&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; As initial plan did not work out, in 1882 he headed Barcelona branch of junta organizadora engineering the next attempt,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 14.01.83, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000060006&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and once political nature of the enterprise became evident, he was confronted by the Barcelona bishop [[:es:José María Urquinaona|José María Urquinaona]].&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Nocedal and his followers envisioned Carlism as a loose movement, its direction set by a wide range of publications; in 1875 in Madrid they founded a daily which was to become an icon of Traditionalist press, ''[[El Siglo Futuro]]''. Llauder followed suit in Barcelona, where in 1878 he took over ''Correo Catalán''. ''Correo'' started to serve as the principal Integrist tribune in Catalonia; it published articles of key Catholic intransigents like [[Félix Sardà y Salvany]],&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 44, Canal 2003, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; joined ''El Siglo Futuro'' in war against other Carlist publications like ''Le Fé'', representing competitive religious and political vision,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 43, 51&lt;/ref&gt; and co-engineered campaign against the [[:es:Alejandro Pidal y Mon|Pidalistas]], who decided to join political structures of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; His belligerency cost Llauder legal action&lt;ref&gt;for attacking Alfonso XII personally&lt;/ref&gt; and incarceration sentence;&lt;ref&gt;he avoided prison thanks to paying a 5,000 peseta penalty&lt;/ref&gt; ''Correo'', suspended for 45 days, was at that time replaced by ephemeral ''El Noticiero''.&lt;ref&gt;Navarro 1917, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Soon Llauder threw himself into publishing activity altogether: in 1883 he set up an intransigent Catholic weekly,&lt;ref&gt;the first issue appeared in January 1884, Raquel Arias Durá, ''Revista ''La Hormiga de Oro''. Análisis documental'', [in:] ''Revista General de Información y Documentación'' 24-1 (2014), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; in 1885 he opened a bookstore,&lt;ref name="Arias 2014, p. 186"&gt;Arias 2014, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1887 he complemented the business by founding a publishing house, all named ''La Hormiga de Oro''.&lt;ref name="Arias 2014, p. 188"&gt;Arias 2014, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CAZ18.18.jpg|thumbnail|''La Hormiga de Oro'' bookstore]]
In the mid-1880s Llauder seemed fully aligned with the Integrist vision and its key components: intransigent Catholicism, political abstention, and Carlism understood primarily as a platform of religious mobilization. He self-declared himself an Integrist, writing with pride that "only a small group of faithful disciples followed the Church [...]. This group was called integristas, intransigentes or tradicionalistas".&lt;ref&gt;Hibbs-Lissorgues 1993, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in number of formal Integrist-defined and Integrist-named public initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;''La Unión'' 18.06.83, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004865540&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; let alone co-operation between ''Correo Catalán'' and ''El Siglo Futuro'',&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 03.02.83, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000066019&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; his daily representing an exclusivist, hard-line, [[Hardline|machamartillo]] format of religiosity. By scholars he is clearly considered as "member of the Integrist sector of the party".&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal i Morell, ''Carlins i integristes a la Restauració: l’escissió de 1888'', [in:] ''Revista de Girona'' 147 (1991), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from continuing ''guerra periodistica'', Llauder is not recognized for confronting the competitive group, led by [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|marqués de Cerralbo]] and known as aperturistas, and is not considered protagonist of increasingly bitter strife between the warring factions.

==Breakup of 1888==
[[File:Ramon Nocedal.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|[[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón Nocedal]]]]
In early 1888 the claimant invited Llauder to his [[Venice]] residence and asked to prepare a publication which would clarify the official royal position. His personal choice might have seemed surprising given Llauder's role in Integrism, as Nocedal's son [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón]] clearly aimed at reducing the claimant to a decorative role. Some scholars claim that Carlos VII picked Llauder considering him an in-between person who would act as mediator between the two factions.&lt;ref&gt;José Andres Gallego, ''La politica religiosa en España'', Madrid 1975, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Other students suggest that the Carlist king intended to outplay the Nocedalistas by luring into his camp one of their politicians, and that choosing Llauder was a smart deceiving move.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication took shape of a March 1888 article in ''Correo Catalán'', titled ''El Pensamiento del Duque de Madrid'';&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845–1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; it was styled as an interview with the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;it was possibly based on the actual interview that Llauder held with Carlos VI during a Catalan pilgrimage to Rome, Andres Gallego 1975, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from doctrinal issues it urged moderation, respect for other Traditionalists and stated that no daily could speak for the king.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 64, Canal 2003, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of reconciliation, it led to escalation; Nocedal and his supporters left Carlism and set up their own party. Though the breakup did not have a major effect on the rank-and-file, it devastated Carlist network of periodicals; most editorial boards decided to side with the secessionists.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal i Morell, ''La masonería en el discurso integrista español a fines del siglo XIX: Ramón Nocedal y Romea'', [in:] J. A. Ferrer Benimeli (ed.), ''Masonería, revolución y reacción'' vol. 2, Alicante 1990, {{ISBN|844047606X}}, p. 778&lt;/ref&gt; Llauder's position came as a surprise: for 10 years one of the most prestigious Nocedals' supporters, he decided not to join them and to stand by his king.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carlos Duke of Madrid.jpg|thumbnail|160px|Carlos VII, probably around 1890]]
Llauder's motives are not entirely clear; it seems that out of two features constituting his previous position, the Integrist outlook and the loyalty to Carlist dynasty, the latter prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2003, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; His stand came as a nasty surprise for the Nocedalistas, who declared Llauder a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 74, Canal 2003, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; When striking back&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; he played down ideological differences and tended to define the conflict as result of overgrown personal ambitions of Nocedal. Also in case of Sarda Llauder confirmed validity of his works, noting that the author took unduly advantage of his prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 280-1&lt;/ref&gt; In general, he tended to approach the Integrists as a sick branch of a healthy tree and later tried to exercise some moderating influence; following clashes in the [[:ca:Teatre Olimp|Olimpo theatre]] in 1889&lt;ref&gt;details in Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; he criticized Carlists taking part and demanded they do not respond to provocations.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 74-5&lt;/ref&gt;

As the breakaway Nocedalistas controlled ''El Siglo Futuro'', previously the national party mouthpiece,&lt;ref&gt;in a bitter guerra periodistica which ensued he became one of prime targets for the Integrist propaganda; ''El Siglo Futuro'' did not spare him any charge and insult Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 123, 128, Jordi Canal i Morell, ''Banderas blancas, boinas rojas: una historia política del carlismo, 1876–1939'', Madrid 2006, {{ISBN|9788496467347}}, pp. 166-7&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos VII decided to set a new semi-official Carlist newspaper; this role was entrusted to Llauder, who in 1888–1889 moved to [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 257, Canal 2003, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Initially to be named ''El Estandarte Real'',&lt;ref&gt;and based on staff consisting of Leandro Herrero, Valbuena y Somoza Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 127, Canal 1998, pp. 134-5&lt;/ref&gt; the daily materialized in 1888 as ''[[El Correo Español (1888-1922)|El Correo Español]]'', largely modeled on ''Correo Catalán'' and by some considered its "brother newspaper".&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Following successful launch, in 1889 Llauder transferred ownership to the claimant,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 136, Canal 2003, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; ceded management to [[Leandro Herrero]]&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 144, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and moved back to Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 128, Canal 2000, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, it was Llauder who offered job in the editorial board to [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]].&lt;ref&gt;opinion of Jesús Pabón, referred after Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the early 1890s some suggested that Llauder takes back leadership of the newspaper, suffering from capricious de Mella's management,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; the daily proved a lasting enterprise and closed as late as 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El XVII marqués de Cerralbo (1845–1922).

The new party leader de Cerralbo pursued his own vision of Carlism, focused on organizational build-up. Its initial embodiment were structures officially created to co-ordinate Carlist celebrations of the so-called [[:es:Conversión de Recaredo|Conversión de Recaredo]]; in 1889 Llauder was nominated Catalan representative in Junta Central&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and head of Catalan Junta Regional.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''¿En busca del precedente perdido? Tríptico sobre las complejas relaciones entre carlismo y catalanismo a fines del siglo XIX'', [in:] ''Historia y Politica'' 14 (2005), p. 46, Canal 1998, p. 79, Canal 2003, p. 31, Canal 2006, p. 200, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Though the nomination was protested by those who remembered his anti-belligerent stand in the 1870s&lt;ref&gt;mostly supporters of Felip de Sabater, who had military record in the Third Carlist War and counted among key Catalan Carlists&lt;/ref&gt; and those who resented his alliance with the Integros in the 1880s,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 84, Canal 2003, pp. 31-2&lt;/ref&gt; in 1890 Llauder was confirmed as President of new official Junta Regional Carlista.&lt;ref&gt;Aratagan 1917, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In Catalonia Llauder presided over transformation of Carlism from a loose movement into a modern and efficient party. In line with Cerralbo's strategy he worked towards setting local structures, encouraging new juntas whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;“en los pueblos de mas corto vecindario”, Canal 1998, p. 94, also Jordi Canal, ''La revitalización política del carlismo a fines del siglo XIX: los viajes de propaganda del Marqués de Cerralbo'', [in:] ''Studia Zamorensia'' 3 (1996), p. 256; Llauder liste a number of reasons to set up he circulos, Canal 1998, p. 182. For detailed discussion of their role see Canal 1998, pp. 179-216&lt;/ref&gt; He proved very efficient: in 1892 Catalonia boasted 43 circulos out of 102 existing in Spain;&lt;ref&gt;no province in Spain was comparable to Barcelona (18 circulos) and Tarragona (16), Canal 1998, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; in 1896 the number grew to 100 out of 298, with [[Barcelona province]] leading the way with 46 circulos.&lt;ref&gt;Valencia came second with 45 and Tarragona third with 27 circulos, Canal 1998, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; According to Llauder himself, along [[Navarre]] the countryside of [[muntanya catalana (socio-cultural term)|muntanya catalana]] turned the very heartland of Spanish Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; First Juventud section, a new juvenile branch, was created in Barcelona in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;6 years after the first Juventud, set up in Madrid, Canal 1998, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in general he remained antiparliamentarian and considered elections a secondary issue,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2003, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; sort of front cover-up for Liberal backstage rule,&lt;ref&gt;he considered universal suffrage a farce, as he believed the government would never allow the rule of truly popular parties (he counted Carlism among these), Canal 1998, pp. 119-20&lt;/ref&gt; he engaged in Carlist electoral effort, resumed by de Cerralbo for the first time in the [[Spanish general election, 1891|1891 campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Llauder noted that 19 years of inactivity made people forget the value of their vote, Canal 1998, p. 118, Canal 2003, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; When acknowledging rather poor results at the pools in 1891 (2 MPs),&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 120, Canal 2003, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish general election, 1896|1896]] (2)&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spanish general election, 1898|1898]] (2),&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; let alone the disastrous [[Spanish general election, 1893|1893 campaign]] (no mandate),&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 126-7&lt;/ref&gt; he noted it would have been absurd to conclude that Carlism enjoyed so limited support, blaming fraud for the poor showing.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 121, Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 244, 251&lt;/ref&gt; Himself he stood in his old constituency of Berga and was successful in 1891,&lt;ref&gt;he succeeded partly thanks to divisions among the Liberals and low turnover, Canal 1998, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; but lost in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 126, Canal 2003, p. 32, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 he successfully ran for [[Senate (Spain)|Senate]] from [[Girona]],&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 255; he was one of 4 Carlists in the Senate, along Cerralbo, Solferino (ensured seat thanks to their grandeza de España) and Tirso Olazabal (also elected), Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; but on the claimant's order he refused to take oath&lt;ref&gt;see the official Senate service, available [http://www.senado.es/web/conocersenado/senadohistoria/senado18341923/senadores/fichasenador/index.html?id1=5145&amp;id2=N here]&lt;/ref&gt; and signed ''Manifiesto de las minorias carlistas'';&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; by some sources he is not listed as a senator.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Isidre Molas, ''Els senadors carlins de Catalunya (1901–1923)'', Barcelona 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 14-year leadership of Catalan Carlism Llauder emerged as one of key party heavyweights of the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Canal 2005, p. 46"&gt;Canal 2005, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered principal agent of ''carlismo nuevo'' in the region;&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Catalonia was the first stage of innovative Cerralbo's tours across the country&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1996, pp. 259-260; Llauder was not renown as public speaker himself, though at times he had to delivere public addresses due to his high position in the party, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; and Llauder worked hand-in-hand with jefe delegado to implement new peaceful strategy and defuse conspiracy which aimed at renewing violence.&lt;ref&gt;dormant Carlist military structures existed, but were incomaparable to official party network. Small Carlist groups in Catalonia kept accumulating weapons, gearing up for another uprising, Canal 1998, p. 129. Indeed in few cases official authorities banned planned Carlist activities due to fear of unrest, Canal 1998, pp. 129-130. Llauder tried to keep the hot-heads in check. Though he did not exclude violence as a last measure, he considered Carlist primary task to be effective politically, so that violence does not stand a chance of erupting, Canal 1998, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; He hugely contributed to smooth recovery of Catalan Carlism from the Nocedalista crisis; though Llauder had to cope with internal conflict;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the fronda of Salvador Soliva in 1895-7, Canal 1998, p. 109; there were also controversies over appointing jefes of local circulos instead of having them elected, Canal 1998, pp. 109-113&lt;/ref&gt; he played vital role in party consolidation of the 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; His 1897 contribution to [[Acta de Loredan]] became last Llauder's major public engagement;&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; starting 1898 due to rapidly deteriorating health&lt;ref&gt;he developed meningoencefalitis, Canal 2006, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; he was spending long periods in the spa of [[:ca:Serra de Cardó|Cardó]]&lt;ref name="Canal 1998, p. 257"&gt;Canal 1998, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; and his regional leadership became largely theoretical. In 1898 the claimant declared him marqués de Vallteix.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2003, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; No scholar mentions Llauder discussing [[:es:Sublevación carlista de octubre de 1900|Carlist 1900 revolts in Catalonia]], which suggests that shortly before death - still official jefe - he already played no major role in politics.

Though he owned, managed and edited a number of periodicals, including ''La Convicción'' in 1870–1873 and ''El Correo Español'' in 1888–1889, as a publisher Llauder is first and foremost recognized as the moving spirit behind two enterprises which turned into monumental periodical prints in Catalonia, the daily ''Correo Catalán'' and the weekly ''La Hormiga de Oro''; both issued for more than half a century, both outlived him by 34 years.&lt;ref&gt;they went into print until 1936, when their premises were overtaken by Republican militias&lt;/ref&gt;

''Correo Catalán'', started in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;by Manuel Milá de la Roca&lt;/ref&gt; was taken over by Llauder in 1878.&lt;ref name="Canal 1998, p. 143"&gt;Canal 1998, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''Correo Español'', launched with official party finances,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; ''Correo Catalán'' was Llauder's private property. He remained also chief editor of the daily, formatted as continuation of ''La Convicción''.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbs-Lissorgues 1993, p. 106; some sources claim that ''Correo Catalán'' was simply continuation of ''La Convicción'', see ''Lluís Maria de Llauder i de Dalmases'' entry [in:] ''Gran enciclopèdia catalana'' online, available [http://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0037578.xml here]&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decade it followed the Integrist line of Nocedal and Sarda;&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; though after 1888 the daily remained within mainstream Traditionalism,&lt;ref name="Canal 1998, p. 143"/&gt; it very much kept pursuing the same intransigent Catholic line.&lt;ref&gt;Llauder „había asumido la fusión tácita y táctica de los carlistas ortodoxos y los neocatólicos integristas”, José María Paz Gago, ''Una nota sobre la ideología de Pardo Bazán. Doña Emilia, entre el carlismo integrista y el carlismo moderado'', [in:] ''La Tribuna. Cadernos de estudios de Casa Museo Emilia Pardo Bazán'' 5 (2007), p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; ''Correo'' remained a semi-official party paper in Catalonia, publishing orders and dispositions, mobilizing organizational work and disseminating propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2006, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; It chiefly consisted of 3 sections: news, opinion and fixed columns, dominated by religious subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 145, Canal 2003, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The daily developed weekly mutations in [[Tarragona]], Girona and [[Lleida]].&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Its circulation is not clear; some sources claim 4,000 copies&lt;ref name="Arias 2014, p. 186"/&gt; and some claim as much as 8,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Bonet i Balta, ''L'integrisme a Catalunya. Les grans polemiques: 1881–1888'', Barcelona 1990, p. 19, referred after Hibbs-Lissorgues 1993, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Personal Llauder's trademark were his Sunday editorials.&lt;ref name="Canal 2005, p. 46"/&gt; In 1899 he ceded command of the paper to Salvador Morales.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 145; following Llauder’s death ''Correo Catalán'' became the property of Fomento de la Prensa Tradicionalista and was re-launched by [[Manuel de Llanza y Pignatelli|Solferino]] with Junyent appointed its manager&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CAZ.18.17.jpg|thumbnail|160px|''[[:es:La Hormiga de Oro|La Hormiga de Oro]]'', sample from 1899]]
The 1884-launched ''La Hormiga de Oro''&lt;ref name="Arias 2014, p. 187"&gt;Arias 2014, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; was among innovative periodicals on the Spanish market;&lt;ref&gt;among ''La Ilustración Española y Americana'', ''Blanco y Negro'', ''Nuevo Mundo'', ''Mundo Gráfico'', Arias 2014, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; published in A3, they combined text and high-quality graphics,&lt;ref&gt;full list of graphic artists Arias 2014, p. 191, list of photographers Arias 2014, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; first drawings and since early 1890s also photographs.&lt;ref&gt;the first photo was published in 1891, Arias 2014, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The weekly aspired to the role of popular enciclopedia educativa;&lt;ref&gt;Arias 2014, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; its contents comprised news, information, history, letters, arts, politics, though it was dominated by religion-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 148, Canal 2003, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Key difference between ''Hormiga'' and likewise reviews was its confessional nature;&lt;ref&gt;Arias 2014, p. 187. "Cuatro son las bestias negras de la selecta publicación de Luis María Llauder: en política, el liberalismo; en religión, la masonería; en historia, la revolución francesa, y en literatura, el naturalismo", Paz Gago 2007, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; it was intended to disseminate Christian thought by means of affordable modern media. Carlism, though present, did not form a leading thread.&lt;ref&gt;Arias 2014, p. 193; some authors claim that ''Hormiga'' played key role in Carlist propaganda machinery of the late 19th century, Canal 1996, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution included Spain, [[Portugal]], [[Philippines]] and [[Latin America]],&lt;ref name="Arias 2014, p. 187"/&gt; the number of subscribers estimated at 4,000;&lt;ref name="Arias 2014, p. 186"/&gt; in the early 20th century it was one of 6 reviews with the highest circulation in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Arias 2014, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Llauder did not run ''Hormiga'', ceding management to different directors.&lt;ref&gt;full list in Arias 2014, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The power plant behind Llauder's periodicals&lt;ref&gt;the house issued another daily, ''La Exposición Vaticana llustrada'' (1887-9)&lt;/ref&gt; was his publishing house ''La Hormiga de Oro'', founded in 1887;&lt;ref name="Arias 2014, p. 188"/&gt; of three similar Carlist enterprises in Catalonia it was the most stable and the most durable one.&lt;ref&gt;there were three Carlist publishing houses in Catalonia, apart from ''Hormiga'' also ''Biblioteca Tradicionalista'', owned by Francesc de Paula Oller (existing in 1889–1892), and ''Biblioteca Regional'' (1897–1901), owned by Josep Font i Fargas&lt;/ref&gt;  With a dedicated book shop serving as a front-end customer interface,&lt;ref name="book shop" /&gt; the conglomerate demonstrated that Llauder was fully conscious of the commencing mass culture era. Its business soundness is unclear. It remains striking that Llauder, himself a solitary leading a modest life,&lt;ref&gt;though he was a public figure and one of leading politicians in Catalonia, during his lifetime his own illustrated review, ''La Hormiga de Oro'', has never published his picture&lt;/ref&gt; between 1871 and 1902 sold real estate inherited from his ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;the family wealth was being accumulated by generations until 1870, when Luis’ father passed away.  In 1871 Llauder sold estate at carrer de Sant Francesc in Mataró (possessed since 1867), in 1876 a house at Muralla del Tigre (held since the early nineteenth century), in 1893 sold three plots in Mataró, in 1900 a garden in Salvi and in 1902 few other pieces, Subińà 1998, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems that a fortune, accumulated by nine generations of the Llauder family, has ultimately been spent as financial reserve sustaining Carlist propaganda machinery in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;PhD thesis dedicated to ''La Hormiga'' on almost 400 pages dwells in detail on organization, personal issues and editorial questions, but provides no insight into financial dimension of the business, see Raquel Arias Durá, ''La revista "La Hormiga de Oro".

Llauder kept contributing to different newspapers between mid-1860s and early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;in 1899 he almost ceased writing, Canal 1998, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; though his opus is mostly [[editorial]]s to ''Correo Catalan''; between 1888 and 1900 he published 537 of them.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2005, p. 46; in 1888–1898 Llauder used to write 45-50 editorials each year, in every Sunday issue; in 1899 he wrote only 3, in 1900 only 4 and none in 1901 and 1902, Canal 1998, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], they were usually clearly attributable,&lt;ref&gt;they were usually signed, sometimes with easily attributable abbreviations like "LL" or "de LL", Canal 1998, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; covered range of topics and served as semi-official Carlist lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 251-2&lt;/ref&gt; Llauder was no political theorist, but his contribution is named "corpus de doctrina carlista"&lt;ref name="Canal 2005, p. 46"/&gt; and compared to that of key Carlist ideologues like [[Antonio Aparisi Guijarro|Aparisi Guijarro]] or Vázquez de Mella.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Some maintain that Llauder underwent ideological evolution, testimonial to schizophrenia of Carlism in the late 19th century;&lt;ref&gt;opinion of Josep M. Fradera in preface to Canal 1998, pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; others argue that he demonstrated "coherencia personal i ideologica".&lt;ref name="Canal 2003, p. 30"/&gt; Upon death he was hailed as giant figure in journalism,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 252-3, Canal 2003, pp. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt; today in historiography of Spanish ''periodismo'' he is acknowledged rather briefly.&lt;ref&gt;compare rather casual note in Juan Francisco Fuentes, Javier Fernández Sebastián, ''Historia del periodismo español'', Madrid 1997, {{ISBN|8477384975}}, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary feature of Llauder's writings was Catholicism; some described his editorial activity as secular [[evangelization]] and dubbed him "sacerdote de la causa".&lt;ref name="Canal 1998, p. 257"/&gt; His religiosity was formatted along fundamentalist lines, based on [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] vision of the world as a battleground between God and satan.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 259, Canal 2005, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Principal Llauder's foe was liberal Catholicism;&lt;ref&gt;including its vision of religious tolerance and separation of state and Church, Canal 1998, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; campaigns against its embodiment, [[:es:Alejandro Pidal y Mon|Alejandro Pidal]], were by some dubbed as pidalofobia.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. opinion of Arturo Campión, Canal 1998, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Most events were interpreted within chiliastic perspective, either episodes like [[cholera]] threat in 1890 and attempt against [[Arsenio Martínez-Campos y Antón|Martínez Campos]] in 1893&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 277-8&lt;/ref&gt; or milestones of Spanish history like the [[Spanish–American War|1898 crisis]]. The [[Cuban War of Independence|Cuban war]] was seen as a warning (maybe the final one) to Spain, and the [[United States]] was presented as a divine tool, sort of a plague, administered by God to punish the Spaniards for their offences.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vayreda6.JPG|thumbnail|160px|''[[Marian Vayreda i Vila|Catalunya muntanyenca]]'']]
Llauder's vision of politics was an Integrist one. He viewed Carlism not as a political option, but rather as work of divine providence;&lt;ref&gt;see also references to a “Dios es carlista”, a famous 1873 phrase of Chambord, Canal 1998, p. 278, Canal 2000, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; within this perspective dynastic issues were secondary to questions of principles.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 287, Canal 2000, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Carlism was the trunk of the [[The Tree and its Fruits|good tree as opposed to the bad tree]]; the trunk of the latter was [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberalism]],&lt;ref&gt;referred to also as an apocalyptic beast, Canal 1998, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; its gardeners were [[Protestantism|Protestants]],&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; [[freemasonry]]&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 264; masonry was "un instrumento del infierno para destruir la obra de Jesucristo", Canal 2000, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 264-5, 275; also the war in Cuba was interpreted along these lines against dechristianisation, masonry and Judaism, Canal 1998, pp. 264-5, 275&lt;/ref&gt; while its satanic fruits were [[nihilism]], [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]],&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; all [[patricide]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; The Restoration regime was considered a farce,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; while the party system and universal suffrage were deemed corruptive manipulative mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 274-5. However, Llauder was convinced that republic, democracy, secularization and the like are all part of the divine plan: “en el orden de la Creación no hay nada casual, ni violento; todo es lógico, todo es regulado... La sublevación de Septiembre (1868) ayudando a la obra de Dios, que indudablemente ha marcado ya la hora de que caiga el árbol nocivo, ha fecundizado la tierra para que adelante la madurez del fruto... esto satisface la doble mira de la providencia: castigar a los pueblos y salvarlos. Si la democracia fuese sólo la república, no seria un castigo, podría ser hasta su salvación”, quoted after Máximo Martín Cabeza, ''Una mítica y simbólica de un milenarismo: el legitimismo'', [in:] Francisco P. Díez de Velasco Abellán (ed.), ''Miedo y religion'', Tenerife 2002, {{ISBN|8479232951}}, available also [http://www.ull.es/congresos/conmirel/martinca1.html#N_27_ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Llauder viewed social problems as part of religious issue,&lt;ref&gt;his sensitivity to poverty was well known; according to his contemporaries, “sus rasgos de caridad fueron innumerables, practicandola con tan grande modestia y reserva, que a duras penas tenian conocimiento de sus dadivas las personas de su mayor intimidad", quoted after Canal 1998, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; results of godless Liberalism allowing shameless profiteering,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; brought to Spain by foreign and Jewish speculators.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 288. Llauder remained in favour of state protectionism, be it in case of vineyards or railways Canal 1998, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish economy was described as [[feudalism]] of money, with Jews playing [[senior (status in feudalism)|seniors]] and [[:es:Caciquismo (España)|caciques]] their [[vassal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, pp. 270-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some scholars claim that opposing centralization was one of his political principles&lt;ref&gt;the other 3 were abandoning violence, confirming claimants authority and opposing Nocedal, Francesc Closa, ''El finançament de la premsa carlina lleidatana: recursos econòmics i publicitat'', [in:] ''Història Moderna i Contemporània'' 9 (2011), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; and underline that [[Fuero|foralism]] was key component of Catalan Carlism,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 04.09.99, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2014/01/02/pagina-18/34483965/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; others argue that regionalism did not form a key thread of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;only one of 537 editorials was dedicated to Catalanism (in 1895), Canal 2005, p. 47. Ongoing polemics, especially when ''La Renaixensa'' took on Vazquez de Mella, was mostly about repulsing attacks rather than about priority attached to the issue, Canal 2005, p. 56, Canal 2006, pp. 202-8. Similar opinion is advanced by Pere Anguera, who underlines "la escasa sensibilidad del principal teórico carlista de la restauración, Luis M. de Llauder, por la cuestión catalana", ''La Vanguardia'' 22.08.99, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1999/08/22/pagina-24/34501143/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He considered genuine Traditionalists "españoles de sangre y corazón".&lt;ref&gt;going on to explain that it consisted of an amalgama of patriotic, Christian and monarchist values, Canal 1998, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed nascent [[Catalanism]] with cautious sympathy&lt;ref&gt;Llauder viewed nascent Catalanism as a response of the youth against centralizing Liberalism, Canal 2005, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; as sort of unconscious Carlism; he encouraged the young Catalanists to look for their own way, confident that sooner or later they would join the ranks of Traditionalism and its vision of ''Catalunya muntanyenca''.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 291, Canal 2005, p. 48, Canal 2006, pp. 200-1&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after a few years when he concluded with some surprise that key Catalanist tribune ''[[:ca:La Renaixensa|La Renaixensa]]'' was "periódico sistemáticamente anticarlista".&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2005, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Gafni was born in 1960&lt;ref name = "Oppenheimer2015" /&gt; to [[Holocaust]] survivors in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = "POJ-RR"&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.haaretz.com/post-orthodoxy-journey-1.115864 |title= Post-Orthodoxy Journey |last= Livneh |first= Neri |date= March 4, 2004 |newspaper= [[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gafni was educated at Modern-Orthodox [[yeshiva]]s in the [[New York City]] area. In the 1980s, while attending [[Yeshiva University]],&lt;ref name = "POJ-RR" /&gt; Gafni worked with Jewish Public School Youth, an organization providing Jewish social clubs in public schools.&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Gafni also worked as a rabbi in [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Rosenblatt04" /&gt; After making [[aliyah]], Gafni served as rabbi of the [[West Bank]] settlement of [[Tzofim]].&lt;ref name = "Ynet-Raved"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; When Gafni moved to Israel he hebraicized his name. "Winiarz," Polish for "vintner," is related to the [[Hebrew]] word {{transl|he|ISO|''gefen''}} ({{rtl-lang|he|גפן}}), which means "grape"—thus the name "Gafni."

==Teachings and prominent works==
Gafni's teachings are often described as [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral]] or world [[spirituality]], incorporating traditional religious studies to contemporary themes, and are aimed at spirituality for people who do not identify with one specific religion.&lt;ref name = "POJ-RR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganihar|first=Tomer|title=Death of the spirit|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/death-of-the-spirit-1.366510|publisher=Haaretz|date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gafni describes himself and his students as "dual citizens" of both their native traditional religion and the broader themes of "world spirituality".&lt;ref name = "POJ-RR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dual&gt;{{cite web|title=A Passport for Dual Citizenship with Michael Murphy &amp; Marc Gafni|url=http://www.ievolve.org/tag/dual-citizenship/|publisher=Center for World Spirituality|date=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates a new set of teachings around [[Eros (concept)|eros]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Intimate relationship|relationships]] in his book ''Mystery of Love'' and CD set ''Erotic and the Holy''.&lt;ref name=jweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Wall|first=Alexandra|title=Let love, sex and holiness make your life full, says rabbi|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/19850/let-love-sex-and-holiness-make-your-life-full-says-rabbi/|publisher=J Weekly|date=May 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rosnblum2006"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Gafni believes that "the sexual is the ultimate Spiritual Master" and has written "I was convinced from an early age that religion had lost what I believed must have been its original erotic vitality…I knew that the sexual, if liberated and ethically expressed, must somehow hold the mystery of return to the much larger-than-sexual Eros."&lt;ref name = "TantricGuru" /&gt;

In 2010, Gafni, together with Mariana Caplan—the mother of his son Zion,&lt;ref name = "Caplan"/&gt; Sally Kempton, and Lori Galperin, founded the Center for World Spirituality.&lt;ref name = "CSWFounding"&gt;{{cite web

===Writing===
Gafni is the author of eight books on spirituality and religion, including the 2001 ''Soul Prints''.&lt;ref name="catalyst"/&gt; Marc Gafni's second English-language book, ''The Mystery of Love'', was later converted to an audio lecture series called ''The Erotic and the Holy'', published by [[Sounds True]].

===Television and speaking===
While in Israel, Gafni hosted {{transl|he|ISO|''Tahat Gafno''}} ({{lang-he|תחת גפנו|lit=under his vine}}), a television program broadcast on Israel's [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]].&lt;ref name = "POJ-RR"/&gt; Gafni also did a series of weekly television spots with Israeli comedian Gil Kopatch on biblical wisdom for every day life.&lt;ref name = "Kopatch2005"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Gafni appeared in a series of spiritual [[public service announcement]]s on Israeli television in the wake of several terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcgafni.com/video_audio/video/series-1-4-spots-dubbed-in-english/ "These four videos (in Hebrew with English subtitles) are part of a series of seven spots made for Israel’s leading television station in the middle of a wave of terrorist bombings."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411081027/http://www.marcgafni.com/video_audio/video/series-1-4-spots-dubbed-in-english/ |date=2013-04-11 }} MarcGafni.com Retrieved March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Gafni spoke with the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] about the perception of love.&lt;ref name = "Kopatch2005" /&gt; In 2010  Gafni did a series with Chopra entitled ''Love and Evolution''.&lt;ref name=dee&gt;{{cite web|last=Gafni|first=Marc|title=Join Deepak Chopra and Dr. Marc Gafni on the Future of Love|url=http://www.marcgafni.com/englishenglishhebrewhebrew-189/|publisher=Marc Gafni|date=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gafni and [[Eben Pagan]] founded an event called "Actualize: The Source Code of Success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= |last= |title=Actualize: The Source Code of Success|url=http://www.ievolve.org/actualize-the-source-code-of-success/|publisher=iEvolve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual assault allegations==
Gafni has been accused of sexual assault multiple times dating back to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Rosenblatt04"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Oppenheimer2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYP" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "JW 09132011" /&gt;

In early January 2016, Judy Mitzner alleged that she was one of two teenage girls whom Gafni molested in New York City in 1986.&lt;ref name = "Prince"&gt;{{cite news |last=Prince |first=Cathryn J. |date=January 6, 2016 |title=Controversial ex-rabbi Gafni and an alleged victim square off |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/controversial-ex-rabbi-gafni-and-an-alleged-victim-square-off/ |work=[[The Times of Israel]] |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reiterated those claims on an appearance on the [[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]] show of January 19, 2018, in which Gafni also appeared.&lt;ref name = "Pink"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pink|first=Aiden|date=January 21, 2018|title=Accused Child Molester Marc Gafni Defends Himself On 'Dr. Phil'|url=https://forward.com/fast-forward/392482/accused-child-molester-marc-gafni-defends-himself-on-dr-phil/|magazine=[[The Forward]]|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in January 2016, an unnamed woman wrote that she was married to Gafni from 1999 to 2004 in an [[opinion piece]] in ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' . The article was in response to a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article about Gafni the preceding week.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer2015" /&gt; She catalogued what she described as her story of abuse and wrote that she had gone public to "Protect some girl.

Because of the nearly three decades that have elapsed since Ms. Kabakow's letter would have been received, confidence in this conclusion is necessarily somewhat less than would otherwise be the case.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Kabakov responded to Gafni's comments and reiterated her claim that the relationship was not consensual.&lt;ref name="Kabakov2"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kabakov|first=Sara|date=November 14, 2016|title=Marc Gafni Told His Side of the Story.

&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, the [[National Coalition for Men]] published an article by Gafni in which he defended himself, calling the allegations "a long-standing smear campaign".&lt;ref name="NCFM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncfm.org/2017/02/news/uncategorized/ncfm-member-marc-gafni-fake-facts-unchecked-falsehoods-that-destroy-lives/|title=NCFM Member Marc Gafni, Fake Facts: Unchecked Falsehoods that Destroy Lives|last=Gafni|first=Marc|date=February 10, 2017|publisher=[[National Coalition for Men]]|access-date=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, he published another rebuttal on [[Medium.com]].&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@eytanyair/marc-gafni-responds-missing-facts-motives-malice-ex-wife-c43f191f0c3#.3wg795c1o|title=The Missing Facts, Motives, and Hidden Malice in My Ex-Wife's Articles about Me, Marc Gafni|last=Gafni|first=Marc|date=March 9, 2017|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|access-date=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accusation was also addressed on the Dr. Phil episode of January 19, 2018.&lt;ref name = "Pink" /&gt;

In 2006, after he moved to Israel, Gafni was accused by three women who attended the {{transl|he|ISO|''Bayit Hadash''}} ({{lang-he|בית חדש|lit=new home}}) spiritual center in [[Jaffa]], which Gafni opened in the late 1990s. Gafni acknowledged relationships with some of the women.&lt;ref name="NYP" /&gt; However, he characterized the relationships as consensual and supported his claim by posting [[polygraph]] results on his website.&lt;ref name="Barland1b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcgafni.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Gafni-report-1b-final-Barland.pdf|title=Report of Polygraph Examination: Marc Gafni|last=Barland|first=Gordon H.|date=October 30, 2007|website=MarcGafni.com|format=PDF|access-date=December 28, 2016|quote=In my opinion Mr. Gafni answered the relevant questions truthfully. This opinion is tempered by the fact that I had no access to the original complaints.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the allegations, and because Gafni fled the country to avoid prosecution,&lt;ref name="Ynet-Raved" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz" /&gt; he was dismissed from {{transl|he|ISO|''Bayit Hadash''}},&lt;ref name="Heruti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/new-age-rabbi-mordechi-gafni-accused-of-sex-crimes-1.188097|title=New-age Rabbi Mordechi Gafni accused of sex crimes|last=Singer-Heruti|first=Roni|date=May 19, 2006|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which closed within days.&lt;ref name="Shma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ner-David|first=Jacob|date=December 1, 2006|title=Genug: Time for a Change|url=http://www.shma.com/dec_06/genug.htm|journal=Sh'ma: A Journal of Jewish Responsibility|location=[[Boston]]|publisher=Sh'ma Institute|archiveurl=http://www.shma.com/2006/12/genug-time-for-a-change/|archivedate=October 8, 2008|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the United States, Gafni sent a remorseful letter to his congregation saying he regretted his actions.&lt;ref name="Heruti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/965/|title=Rabbi Fired Over Sex Claims, Defenders Offer Mea Culpa|last=Siegal|first=Jennifer|date=May 19, 2006|publisher=''[[The Forward]]''|accessdate=2008-01-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Gafni later claimed the letter was not an admission of guilt but an attempt to cool the controversy.&lt;ref name="gafniletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcgafni.com/englishenglishhebrewhebrew-430/|title=Why I Signed the Letter|last=Gafni|first=Marc|date=May 27, 2008|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gafni was the subject of new allegations of sexual misconduct in 2011.&lt;ref name="JW 09132011" /&gt; As a result, Integral Life, one of Gafni's promoters, deleted his contributions from its website and announced that it was distancing itself from him.&lt;ref name="JW 09132011" /&gt; Tami Simon, CEO of [[Sounds True]], canceled her planned publication of Gafni's book, ''Your Unique Self'', and issued a statement denouncing him.&lt;ref name="JW 09142011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/gary-rosenblatt/marc-gafni-again|title=Marc Gafni, Again|last1=Rosenblatt|first1=Gary|authorlink1=Gary Rosenblatt|date=September 14, 2011|publisher=''[[The Jewish Week]]''|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The board of directors of the Center for World Spirituality, an organization co-founded by Gafni and of which he is CEO, issued a statement of "unequivocal support" for Gafni.&lt;ref name="support"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ievolve.org/a-cws-board-statement-of-unequivocal-support-for-dr-marc-gafni/|title=A CWS Board Statement of Unequivocal Support for Dr. Marc Gafni|date=September 2011|website=ievolve.org|publisher=Center for Integral Wisdom|access-date=December 28, 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber first separated from Gafni,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://integrallife.com/member/ken-wilber/blog/ken-wilbers-response-marc-gafni-debacle?|title=Ken Wilber's Response to the Marc Gafni Debacle|last=Wilber|first=Ken|date=October 17, 2011|publisher=Ken Wilber}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the two eventually reconciled and Wilber rejoined Gafni at the Center for World Spirituality.&lt;ref name="wilber11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/701|title=Ken Wilber Statement on Marc Gafni and the Center for World Spirituality|last=Wilber|first=Ken|date=December 27, 2011|publisher=Ken Wilber}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Your Unique Self'' was ultimately published by Integral Publishers.&lt;ref name="integralbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://integralpublishers.com/ip_books/your-unique-self|title=Your Unique Self|publisher=Integral Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marshall Jevons''' is a [[fictitious name|fictitious]] [[crime writer]] invented and used by [[William L. Breit]] and [[Kenneth G. Elzinga]], professors of [[economics]] at [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and the [[University of Virginia]], respectively.

It was Breit's notion to write a mystery novel in which an amateur detective uses economic theory to solve crimes. Elzinga was enthusiastic about his colleague's idea and not only encouraged him to proceed but also decided to take an active role in writing the book. Over the next twenty years, on top of their academic schedules, Breit and Elzinga co-authored three mystery books featuring [[Harvard University|Harvard]] economist-sleuth [[Henry Spearman (fictional character)|Henry Spearman]]. The first Henry Spearman Mystery, ''[[Murder at the Margin]]'', came out in [[1978 in literature|1978]], and was followed by ''[[The Fatal Equilibrium]]'' ([[1985 in literature|1985]]), ''[[A Deadly Indifference]]'' ([[1995 in literature|1995]]) and ''[[The Mystery of the Invisible Hand]]'' ([[2014 in literature|2014]]).

When, in 1978, after a three-year collaboration, the two economists' first foray into [[crime fiction]] was eventually published by Thomas Horton and Daughters, there was no indication on the book cover as to the true identity of the authors. Rather, Elzinga had concocted a fanciful biography of ''Marshall Jevons'' which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Marshall Jevons''' is the President of UtilMax, Inc., an international [[management consulting|consulting firm]] headquartered in [[New York City]]. A former [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]], he holds advanced degrees in [[economics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[oceanography]]. Mr. Jevons is an [[Olympic medalists|Olympic medal holder]] in [[kayaking]] whose hobbies now include [[rocket]]ry and the [[futures exchange|futures market]] in [[cocoa bean]]s. He is a native of [[Virginia]] but prefers to call 'home' the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|Queen Elizabeth 2]]. This is Marshall Jevons' first novel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in subsequent editions of the book, Breit and Elzinga's authorship was recognized. ''Murder at the Margin'' has since been used as supplementary reading in many introductory courses in economics. In commercial terms the novel was a success, and [[MIT Press]] approached the authors to suggest they write another Henry Spearman Mystery which they would publish. Thus, in 1985, ''The Fatal Equilibrium'' became the first mystery novel to be published by a [[university press]]. One year later, a [[mass market paperback]] was issued, prompting Marshall Jevons to comment that “there are few pleasures more satisfying than seeing one's own paperback in a book rack at an airport newsstand”.

The name ''Marshall Jevons'' derives from the surnames of two 19th-century English economists, [[Alfred Marshall]] and [[William Stanley Jevons]].

A blog about economics called "The Bayesian Heresy" has also adopted the pseudonym.

'''Matthew Jukes''' has worked in the UK wine business for over 30 years.  With experience in all sectors of the industry he has been writing about wine for two decades and during this time he has penned fourteen wine books.  He now concentrates on four annual Reports which are published on his website.

The Burgundy En Primeur Report and the Piemonte Report are both published in January.  The Bordeaux En Primeur Report is published in April and the 100 Best Australian Wines Report is published in May, and this initiative is in its fourteenth year.  One of the world’s leading experts on Australian wine, each year he takes a selection of each year’s 100 Best Australian Wines on a Roadshow around the UK.  He also runs an annual competition in Australia to find ‘The Great Australian Red’,[1] created with Tyson Stelzer, this tasting sets out to find the best Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz wine in the country, which Matthew describes as ‘the blend that defines Australia’.  This initiative was started in 2006 and Matthew has hosted TGAR showcase events in London, New York and Sydney in order to spread the word about this iconic red wine style.

Matthew regularly lectures, judges, speaks at wine conferences and runs masterclass tastings for both corporate and private clients all over the world.

Matthew has written a highly acclaimed, weekly article for MoneyWeek since 2006 and also a weekly column for the Daily Mail’s Weekend Magazine since 2000.  With over 5 million Daily Mail readers a week, Matthew has the most keenly followed wine column in the UK.


==Career history==

Matthew started his career in the wine industry in 1987 working with the talented wine consultant James Rogers at the Barnes Wine Shop, London SW13. From there, Matthew moved into buying for Bibendum Restaurant &amp; Oyster Bar, London SW3 (from 1990 - 2016), winning awards for this wine list and then into radio when journalism started to become his focus. After 3 years on a weekly radio slot for the BBC, Channel 4 approached Matthew to host 'Wine Hunt'.[2] Matthew then went on to write 'The Wine Book' which was later serialised by the Daily Mail and due to the popularity of the book, Matthew was offered the chance to write the most widely read wine column in the UK in the Daily Mail’s Weekend Magazine, with over 5 million readers each week.[3]   While Matthew spends most of his time writing about wine, he has managed to keep his wine list writing skills going and he is currently the wine consultant for the award-winning Loch Lomond Arms Hotel, 
Scotland.


==Awards==
In March 2013 Matthew was given the Journalism Award at the Portuguese Wine Awards.
In July 2013 Matthew was awarded the Communicator of the Year award by the English Wine Producers Association.
In January 2012, Matthew Jukes was awarded the Honorary Australian of the Year Award by the Australia Day Foundation. It recognises a non-Australian resident of the UK who displays "Australian characteristics" or has contributed significantly to Australia.[4]
In May 2011, Off Licence News voted Matthew the most influential wine writer in the UK.[5]
His book, Taste Food &amp; Wine, co-written with Tyson Stelzer, won the Australian Food Media Award for Best Food and Writing.[6]
In 2002, Matthew won the prestigious International Wine and Spirit Competition’s Trophy for Wine Communicator of the Year.[7]

'''Mercy Seiradaki''' (''née'' '''Money-Coutts'''; 16 April 1910 – 1 September 1993) was a British archaeologist who worked in [[Crete]] in the 1930s, mostly on projects led by [[John Pendlebury]], including excavations at [[Knossos (modern history)|Knossos]]. She co-authored several reports on the work undertaken with him and published a later key text on the pottery from [[Karphi]] in 1960. During the war she worked at [[Bletchley Park]], and then joined the [[Red Cross]]. She worked with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) in Crete in the post-war years and lived in Greece for the rest of her life.

== Personal life ==
Mercy Burdett Money-Coutts was born on 16 April 1910 in [[Devon]] into an upper-class family, the only daughter of Hester Frances ''née'' Russell and Hugh Burdett Money-Coutts, later [[Baron Latymer]]. Unsurprisingly for a girl of her background, she was privately educated at home and [[Debutante|presented at court]]&lt;ref&gt;'Court Circular',''The Times'', 10 May 1928, p10&lt;/ref&gt; before going to [[Lady Margaret Hall]] at [[Oxford University]], and she entered enthusiastically into traditional English field sports. This background developed certain qualities helpful to her later work in archaeology. As well as being well-read and skilled in drawing, she built up physical stamina while [[deer stalking]].&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;

When, at the age of 37, she married Michael Seiradakis, a Cretan from an ordinary village background, her parents did not go the wedding,&lt;ref name=ES/&gt; though a conventional announcement appeared in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;'Marriages', ''The Times'' 26 May 1947, p1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and work ==

After graduating in Modern History&lt;ref&gt;'University News', ''The Times'' 30 July 1932, p12&lt;/ref&gt; in 1932 she asked [[Arthur Evans]] to accept her as a student helper at [[Knossos]].&lt;ref name=ES/&gt; Evans had led this major project for decades but by this time excavations were directed by [[John Pendlebury]], who became a mentor to Seiradaki.&lt;ref name=BG&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Mercy%20Money-Coutts&amp;last=Seiradaki Breaking Ground: Mercy Money-Coutts Seiradaki]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as excavating he undertook a major reorganisation of the on-site Stratigraphical Museum, a task in which Seiradaki would take a large part. She was accepted as a student of the [[British School at Athens]] at the same time as [[Edith Eccles]] who became a friend with whom she worked and travelled. Her endurance and stamina on difficult journeys over mountain tracks were noteworthy. There were several young women archaeologists from the UK and all were determined not to be put off by difficult terrain and challenging routes, and yet Seiradaki stood out for her reluctance even to ride a mule instead of walking.&lt;ref name=ES&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Seiradaki_Mercy%20Money-Coutts.pdf Elizabeth Schofield, Mercy Money-Coutts Seiradaki (1910-1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a winter in Athens studying prehistoric pottery she and Eccles went to Crete to help complete the catalogue of the museum at Knossos. Pendlebury and his wife worked to date one third of a huge collection of [[sherds]] assembled in 2000 boxes. Eccles and Seiradaki dated the rest and published the results in instalments. They also went on several expeditions in central Crete, often with Pendlebury, seeking out new sites and checking on some already discovered.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt; This led to Pendlebury's book the ''Archaeology of Crete'' in which half of the illustrations were drawn by Seiradaki, particularly the drawings of [[seal stone]]s and pottery patterns.

In 1934 she explored a variety of archaeological sites in the [[Peloponnese]] and other parts of mainland Greece, and returned to Crete in 1935. She continued to work in association with Pendlebury: in particular around [[Lasithi]] in central Crete. She excavated, helped publish, and also took opportunities to travel with Eccles. Some of her travel was to the Middle East and Egypt to explore links between [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and Oriental cultures. Although Arthur Evans' visits to Knossos had become less frequent in the 1930s, he knew enough about her work to give her the role of organising the Knossos section of a London exhibition celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the British School, and of helping with a further display at the [[Ashmolean]].&lt;ref name="Brown1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Cynthia Brown|title=Arthur Evans and the Palace of Minos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2Lko17Cr8wC&amp;pg=PA11|date=January 1983|publisher=Ashmolean Museum|isbn=978-0-900090-92-9|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used one of her drawings of a hoard of axes to illustrate his last work on the palace at Knossos.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;

When the cave at [[Trapeza, Crete|Trapeza]] was excavated she was responsible for the pottery and the challenge of dating it. She produced an extensive illustrated and descriptive catalogue of pottery and other smaller finds. About three quarters of the work published about the cave is by Seiradaki.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt; She did similar work for other excavations run by Pendlebury in Lesithi, publishing as M. Money-Coutts. The work at [[Karphi]] was fully completed in 1960 when she published ''Pottery from Karphi'' under the name mercy Seiradaki.

She was whole-hearted not only about her work but also about life on Crete. She learned modern Greek, got to know the island, its people and culture and was known for her ability to get on with local workers on site. In this way, she can be seen as a pioneer of contemporary approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/822773/Women_Archaeologists_and_Non-Palatial_Greece_a_Case-Study_from_Crete_of_the_Hundred_Cities Anna Lucia D'Agata, ''Women Archaeologists and Non-Palatial Greece: a Case-Study from Crete of the Hundred Cities'', p268]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Second World War she worked, probably as a secretary,&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;  at [[Bletchley Park]], the secret code breaking establishment. In 1944 she joined the [[Red Cross]] and was sent to Egypt. She is presumed to have wanted to return to Crete where some of the men she knew had worked with the [[Resistance movement|Resistance]], as did many academics associated with the British School at Athens.&lt;ref name="Clogg2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Clogg|title=Anglo-Greek Attitudes: Studies in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDaDDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|date=5 September 2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-0-230-59868-3|pages=32-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Eccles managed to travel from Libya to Crete in 1944 when the island was still considered dangerous. After her friend left for Athens she stayed on in Crete working for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA), was awarded the bronze medal of the Greek Red Cross for her courage, and became a local heroine.&lt;ref name=BG/&gt; Through UNRRA she met her husband who received many honours for acts of wartime bravery.

== Later life ==
After marrying and having a son and daughter she lived in Crete until 1962. She continued her Red Cross work, her involvement with archaeology on the island, and offered "open house" hospitality to English-speaking visitors. She worked on her drawings for the Karphi pottery book and was a member of the first British Council in [[Chania]]. When the family moved to Athens in 1962 Seiradaki was active in the British School library.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt; She died on 1 September 1993.

==Early life==
Michael Brant Shermer was born on September 8, 1954 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|date=September 2004|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2004/09/mustangs-monists-and-meaning|title= Mustangs, Monists &amp; Meaning|publisher=The Work of Michael Shermer|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Ronald Bruce|url=http://freethoughtalmanac.com/?p=7176|title=September 8: Michael Shermer (1954)|publisher=Freethought Almanac|date=2013-09-08|access-date=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An only child, he was raised in [[Southern California]], primarily in the [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]] area.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref name=BelievingBrainCh4&gt;Shermer, Michael. ''The Believing Brain''. 2011. Times Books. Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2002page127&gt;Shermer, 2002, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was four&lt;ref name=BelievingBrainCh4/&gt; and later remarried, his mother to a man with three children, who became Shermer's step-sister and two step-brothers, and his father to a woman with whom he had two daughters, Shermer's half-sisters. His father died of a heart attack in 1986, and his mother of brain cancer in 2000.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBrainChap6&gt;Shermer, ''The Believing Brain'', Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Shermer went to Sunday school, he says that neither his biological parents, stepparents nor siblings were religious nor non-religious, as they did not discuss that topic often, nor did they attend church or pray together. Shermer began his senior year of high school in 1971, when the evangelical movement in the United States was beginning to gain popularity. One night at the behest of his best friend George, whose parents were Christian, Shermer converted to [[Christianity]]. The next day the two friends attended the [[Glendale, CA|Glendale]], [[Presbyterian]] Church, where a sermon was given by what Shermer describes as "a very dynamic and histrionic preacher who inspired me to come forward at the end of the sermon to be saved." For the next seven years he evangelized door-to-door as part of his profoundly held beliefs.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBrainChap6/&gt;

Shermer attended an informal Christian study fellowship group at a place called "The Barn" in [[La Crescenta, California]], which Shermer describes as "a quintessential 1970s-era hang-out with a long-haired hippie-type, guitar-playing leader who read Bible passages that we discussed at length." Shermer enjoyed the social aspects of religion, and particularly relished its theological debates.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;

Shermer was raised with guns. His stepfather was a hunter who took Shermer and their hunting dogs with him on hunting excursions half a dozen times a year, shooting game such as doves, ducks, and quail with shotguns. They ate everything they killed, for which Shermer's stepfather also displayed culinary skills. Growing up, Shermer owned a BB gun, then a pellet gun, then a 20-gauge shotgun, and then a 12-gauge shotgun.&lt;ref name=Skeptic18.1&gt;Shermer, Michael (2013). "The Sandy Hook Effect". ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]''. Vol. 18 No. 1. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer graduated from [[Crescenta Valley High School]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=2002page127/&gt; Desiring serious theological training, he enrolled at [[Pepperdine University]] with the intent of becoming a theologian. He initially majored in Christian theology. In addition to taking courses on the Bible, Shermer studied the writings of [[C.S. Lewis]], and he attended chapel twice a week, which was required for all students. Despite the restrictions imposed on students, such as a ban on dancing and visiting the dorm rooms of opposite sex, Shermer found the university a good experience, and he accepted its teachings as a valid guide for behavior.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt; However, when he learned that the PhD needed to be a professor of theology required proficiency in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Aramaic, Shermer, who did not find foreign languages to be his forte, switched his major to psychology.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref name=2002page127/&gt;&lt;ref name="meettheskeptics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-michael-shermer|title=Michael Shermer|publisher=Meet The Skeptics|date=November 2011|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100517/http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-michael-shermer|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has stated that at this point he "mastered one of the languages of science: statistics", and that he learned about forming hypotheses, the [[null hypothesis]] and [[testing hypotheses]], which led to a change in his thinking.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt; He completed his [[bachelor's degree|BA]] in psychology at Pepperdine in 1976.&lt;ref name="ShermerAbout"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.skeptic.com/about_us/meet_michael_shermer.html | title=Skeptic Magazine: Meet Michael Shermer |publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]]|year=2006|accessdate = 2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate studies and change of beliefs==
Shermer's master's degree in [[experimental psychology]] at the [[California State University, Fullerton]], led to many after-class discussions with professors Bayard Brattstrom and Meg White at a local pub—The 301 Club—that went late into the night. These discussions,&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhyPeoplePg128&gt;Shermer, ''Why People Believe Weird Things'', 2002, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; along with his studies in [[cultural anthropology]], led him to question his religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=BBrainChap6/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhyPeoplePg128/&gt; He abandoned his devout religious views, fueled by what he perceived to be the intolerance generated by the absolute morality he was taught in his religious studies; the hypocrisy in what many believers preached and what they practiced; and his growing awareness of other religious beliefs, and how they were determined by the temporal, geographic, and cultural circumstances in which their adherents were born. From this, Shermer came to conclude it is "obvious that God was made in our likeness and not the reverse."&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt; By midway through his graduate training, he removed the Christian silver [[ichthys]] medallion that he had been wearing around his neck for years.&lt;ref name=BBrainChap6/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhyPeoplePg128/&gt; He completed his MA degree from the California State University in psychology in 1978.&lt;ref name="ShermerAbout"/&gt;

The final step in Shermer's abandoning religion came when his college sweetheart, Maureen, was in an automobile accident that broke her back and rendered her paralyzed from the waist down. Shermer relates:&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I saw her at the Long Beach Medical Center ER, the full implications of what this meant for her begin to dawn on me. There, in the ER, day after dreary day, night after sleepless night, I took a knee and bowed my head and asked God to heal Maureen's broken back. I prayed with deepest sincerity. I cried out to God to overlook my doubts in the name of Maureen. I willingly suspended all disbelief. At that time and in that place, I was once again a believer. I believed because I wanted to believe that if there was any justice in the universe — any at all — this sweet, loving, smart, responsible, devoted, caring spirit did not deserve to be in a shattered body. A just and loving God who had the power to heal, would surely heal Maureen. He didn't. He didn't, I now believe, not because "God works in mysterious ways" or "He has a special plan for Maureen" — the nauseatingly banal comforts believers sometimes offer in such trying and ultimately futile times — but because there is no God.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer (2011), ''The Believing Brain'', "Chapter 3: A Skeptic's Journey"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Competitive cycling==
After earning his MA in experimental psychology in 1978, Shermer was unable to secure a position in a PhD program, and landed a job writing for a bicycle magazine in [[Irvine, California]]. His first assignment, a [[Cycles Peugeot]] press conference featuring John Marino, who had just ridden from Los Angeles to New York in 13 days, one hour, and 20 minutes, made a deep impression on Shermer.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Ed (March 2, 2014). [https://ultracycling.com/sections/awards/hof/marino  "UltraCycling Hall of Fame Founding Member: John Marino"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053237/https://ultracycling.com/sections/awards/hof/marino/ |date=2016-03-04 }}, ultracycling.com; accessed July 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He bought a bike and entered the Yoplait Yogurt 50-kilometer race through [[Griffith Park]] in Los Angeles the following weekend. His interest grew rapidly, and within a short time he had completed his first [[century ride]] (100 miles). Before long he was riding hundreds of miles a week.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;

Shermer began competitive cycling in 1979, and he spent a decade as a professional rider. Shermer's best known bicycling is in the very long distance ultramarathon [[Road bicycle racing|road racing]] discipline. Shermer is a founding member of the Ultra Cycling Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="ultrahof"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lumia, Carrie|url=http://www.ultracycling.com/sections/awards/hof/shermer/|title=Michael Shermer – Ultra Cycling Hall of Fame|publisher=UltraMarathon Cycling Association|date=March 2, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062625/http://www.ultracycling.com/sections/awards/hof/shermer/|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of his cycling career, Shermer worked with cycling technologists in developing better products for the sport. During his association with [[Bell Sports|Bell Helmets]], a bicycle-race sponsor, Shermer advised them on design issues regarding their development of [[expanded-polystyrene]] for use in [[bicycle helmet|cycling helmets]], which would absorb impact far better than the old leather "[[hairnet]]" helmets used by bicyclists for decades. Shermer advised them that if their helmets looked too much like [[motorcycle helmets]], in which polystyrene was already being used, and not like the old hairnet helmets, no serious cyclists or amateur would use them. This suggestion led to their model, the ''V1 Pro'', which looked like a black leather hairnet, but functioned on the inside like a motorcycle helmet. In 1982, Shermer worked with Wayman Spence, whose small supply company, Spenco Medical, adapted the gel technology Spence developed for bedridden patients with pressure sores into [[cycling gloves]] and [[Bicycle saddle|saddles]] to alleviate the [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] and saddle sores suffered by cyclists.&lt;ref name=Market&gt;Shermer, Michael (2007). ''The Mind of The Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans, and Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics''. Holt Paperbacks. pp. 59 -61 {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7832-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the decade in which he raced long distances, he helped to found the 3,000-mile nonstop transcontinental bicycle [[Race Across America]] (known as "RAAM", along with Lon Haldeman and John Marino), in which he competed five times (1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1989), was an assistant race director for six years, and the executive race director for seven years.&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt;&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www.michaelshermer.com/about-michael/curriculum-vitae/ "Michael Shermer: Curriculum Vitae"]. michaelshermer.com. Retrieved June 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An acute medical condition is named for him: "Shermer Neck" is pain in and extreme weakness of the [[neck muscles]] found among long-distance bicyclists. Shermer suffered the condition about 2,000 miles into the 1983 Race Across America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Libby|title=A Pain in the Neck: Shermer's Neck|url=http://www.ultracycling.com/old/training/neck_pain.html|publisher=UltraMarathon Cycling Association|accessdate=28 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412024227/http://www.ultracycling.com/old/training/neck_pain.html|archivedate=12 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shermer's embrace of [[scientific skepticism]] crystallized during his time as a cyclist, explaining, "I became a skeptic on Saturday, August 6, 1983, on the long climbing road to [[Loveland Pass, Colorado]]", after months of training under the guidance of a "nutritionist" with an [[school accreditation|unaccredited]] PhD. After years of practicing [[acupuncture]], [[chiropractic]], [[massage therapy]], [[negative ion]]s, [[rolfing]], [[pyramid power]], [[fundamentalist Christianity]], and "a host of weird things" (with the exception of drugs) to improve his life and training, Shermer stopped rationalizing the failure of these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer (2002), pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Shermer later produced several documentary films on cycling.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

Shermer still cycles actively, and participated in the Furnace Creek 508 in October 2011, a qualifying race for RAAM, finishing second in the four man team category.&lt;ref name="meettheskeptics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=furnacecreek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbase.adventurecorps.com/individualTd.php?e=3631|title=2011 Furnace Creek 508 – Great American Toad – team data|publisher=AdventureCORPS, Inc.|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer has written on the subject of pervasive [[doping in sport|doping]] in competitive cycling and a [[game theory|game theoretic]] view of the dynamics driving the problem in several sports. He wrote specifically about [[Erythropoietin#Blood doping|r-EPO doping]], which he saw as both widespread and well known within the sport, which was later shown to be instrumental in the [[Lance Armstrong doping case|doping scandal surrounding Lance Armstrong]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="skepticality200"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trueslant.com/michaelshermer/2010/07/07/nash-equilibrium-the-omerta-rule-and-doping-in-cycling/|title=Nash Equilibrium, the Omerta Rule, and Doping in Cycling|publisher=[[True/Slant]]|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=7 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222052118/http://trueslant.com/michaelshermer/2010/07/07/nash-equilibrium-the-omerta-rule-and-doping-in-cycling/|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shermer, Michael|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-doping-dilemma/|title=The Doping Dilemma|newspaper=[[Scientific American]]|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earning his PhD and teaching==
While cycling, Shermer taught Psychology 101 during the evenings at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]], a two-year college. Wanting to teach at a four-year university, he decided to earn his PhD. Because Shermer's interests lay in [[behaviorism]] and he did not believe he could make a difference in the world by working in a lab with [[Skinner boxes]], he lost interest in psychology and switched to studying the [[history of science]],&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt; earning his PhD at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1991. His dissertation was titled ''Heretic-Scientist: [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and the Evolution of Man: A Study on the Nature of Historical Change''.&lt;ref name="Shermer 1991"&gt;{{Cite thesis

Earlier that year, in his book ''The Borderlands of Science'', Shermer rated several noted scientists for gullibility toward "pseudo" or "borderland" ideas, using a rating version, developed by psychologist [[Frank Sulloway]], of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model of personality]]. Shermer rated Wallace extremely high (99th percentile) on [[Agreeableness|agreeableness/accommodation]] and argued that this was the key trait in distinguishing Wallace from scientists who give less credence to fringe ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Stephen (December 30, 2008).

Shermer then became an adjunct professor of the history of science at [[Occidental College]], California. In 2007, Shermer took a position as a senior research fellow at Claremont Graduate University. In 2011, he took a position as an adjunct professor at [[Chapman University]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellington, Kim; Bennett, Bo (May 7, 2014).

==Scientific skepticism==
In 1992, Shermer founded the [[Skeptics Society]], which began as a hobby in his garage, but eventually grew into a full-time occupation. The Skeptics Society publishes the magazine [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|''Skeptic'']], and organizes the [[Caltech Lecture Series]]. As of 2008, it has over 55,000 members.&lt;ref name=VueWeekly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/upcoming-lectures/|title=Skeptic » Upcoming Lectures » Upcoming Science Salons|website=www.skeptic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer is also a scientific advisor to the [[American Council on Science and Health]] (ACSH).&lt;ref name="ACSH Scientific Advisors"/&gt;

===Published works===
{{wikiquote}}
[[File:Michael Shermer wiki portrait2.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Shermer in 2008]]
Shermer is the author of books which attempt to explain the ubiquity of irrational or poorly substantiated beliefs, including [[UFO]]s, [[Bigfoot]], and paranormal claims. In 1997, he wrote ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]'', which explores a variety of "weird" ideas and groups (including cults), in the tradition of the skeptical writings of [[Martin Gardner]]. A revised and expanded edition was published in 2002. He writes in the Introduction:&lt;blockquote&gt;So we are left with the legacy of two types of thinking errors: ''Type 1 Error: believing a falsehood'' and ''Type 2 Error: rejecting a truth''. ... Believers in UFOs, [[alien abductions]], [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], and [[psychic phenomena]] have committed a Type 1 Error in thinking: they are believing a falsehood. ... It's not that these folks are ignorant or uninformed; they are intelligent but misinformed. Their thinking has gone wrong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In ''How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science'', Shermer explored the psychology behind the belief in God. In its introduction, Shermer wrote "Never in history have so many, and such a high percentage of the population, believed in God. Not only is God not dead as [[Nietzsche]] [[God is dead|proclaimed]], but he has never been more alive."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Since April 2001, he has written the monthly ''Skeptic'' column for ''[[Scientific American]]''. He has also contributed to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael (November 25, 2014). [http://time.com/3590767/thanksgiving-lookback-time/ "The Reason Every One of Us Should Be Thankful"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2002, he characterized the position that "God had no part in the process [of the evolution of mankind]" as the "standard scientific theory".&lt;ref name=SA2002-02&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=The Gradual Illumination of the Mind|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2002/02/the-gradual-illumination-of-the-mind/|work=Scientific American|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was criticized in January 2006 by the scientist [[Eugenie Scott]], who commented that science makes no claim about God one way or the other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott, Eugenie]]. (2006). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8RUPdH8eLk "Intelligent Design and the Creationism/Evolution Controversy"] (00:42:42~00:43:53). [[University of Michigan]]. YouTube. July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, Shermer and [[Alex Grobman]] published their book ''[[Denying History|Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?]]'', which examined and refuted the [[Holocaust denial]] movement. This book recounts meeting various denialists and concludes that free speech is the best way to deal with [[pseudohistory]].

''[[Science Friction: Where the Known Meets the Unknown]]'' was released in 2005. His 2006 book ''[[Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design]]'' marshals point-by-point arguments supporting [[evolution]], sharply criticizing [[intelligent design]]. This book also argues that science cannot invalidate religion, and that [[Christian]]s and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] can and should accept evolution.

In June 2006, Shermer, who formerly expressed skepticism regarding the mainstream scientific views on [[global warming]], wrote in "Scientific American" magazine that, in the light of the accumulation of evidence, the position of denying global warming is no longer tenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=13&amp;articleID=000B557A-71ED-146C-ADB783414B7F0000 | title=The Flipping Point | newspaper=Scientific American | date=June 2006 | first=Michael | last=Shermer | accessdate = 2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Mind of The Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans, and Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics'' was released in 2007. In it Shermer reports on the findings of multiple behavioral and biochemical studies that address evolutionary explanations for modern behavior. It garnered several critical reviews from academics, with skeptic [[Robert T.

Prior to work on science and skepticism, Shermer published books on cycling and others on child education in the math and science disciplines.  These include collaborations with [[Arthur T. Benjamin|Arthur Benjamin]].&lt;ref name="meettheskeptics"/&gt;

In January 2015, Shermer published ''[[The Moral Arc: How Science and Reason Lead Humanity Toward Truth, Justice, and Freedom]]''.

[[Harriet A. Hall|Harriet Hall]] says of Shermer's 2018 publication, ''Heavens on Earth: The Scientific Search for the Afterlife, Immortality, and Utopia'', that "the topics of ''Heavens on Earth'' are usually relegated to the spheres of philosophy and religion, but Shermer approaches them through science, looking for evidence -- or lack thereof." She goes on to say that "[s]ome will argue that Shermer goes beyond the science" but that "it will definitely ... make the reader think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Harriet |authorlink1=Harriet A.

===Media appearances and lectures===
[[File:Michael Shermer by Gage Skidmore.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Shermer giving a talk at FreedomFest in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 2016]]
Shermer appeared as a guest on ''[[Phil Donahue|Donahue]]'' in 1994 to respond to [[Bradley Smith (Holocaust denier)|Bradley Smith]]'s and David Cole's [[Holocaust denial]] claims, and in 1995 on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to challenge [[Rosemary Altea]]'s psychic claims. Shermer made a guest appearance in a 2004 episode of [[Penn &amp; Teller]]'s ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'', in which he argued that events in the [[Bible]] constitute "mythic storytelling", rather than events described literally. His stance was supported by the show's hosts, who have expressed their own atheism. The episode in question, ''The Bible: Fact or Fiction?'', sought to debunk the notion that the Bible is an [[empiricism|empirically]] reliable historical record. Opposing Shermer was [[Paul Maier]], professor of ancient history at [[Western Michigan University]].&lt;ref name="ShermerBible"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070318221056/http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/prevepisodes.do?episodeid=s2/bible "The Bible: Fact or Fiction?"], ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' Season 2; accessed July 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer made several appearances on [[NBC]]'s daytime paranormal-themed show ''The Other Side'' in 1994 and 1995. After getting to know the show's producers, he made a formal pitch to their production company for his own skepticism-oriented reality show whose aim would be to present points of view of both believers and skeptics. His proposals were not fruitful, but several years later, one of the executives of that company went to work for the then-newly formed [[Fox Family Channel]], and impressed with Shermer's show treatment, requested he pitch it to the network. The network picked up the series, ''Exploring the Unknown'', of which Shermer became a producer and cohost. The series, which was budgeted at approximately $200,000 per episode, was viewed by Shermer as a direct extension of the work done at the Skeptics Society and ''Skeptic'' magazine, and would enable Shermer to reach more people. The equivocal title was chosen so as to not tip off guests or viewers as to the skeptical nature of the show.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael (2001). ''The Borderlands of Science''. [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Various segments from ''Exploring the Unknown'' can be found on Shermer's YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelShermer "Skeptic (Michael Shermer)"]. YouTube. Retrieved December 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Shermer produced and co-hosted the [[Television networks preceding ABC Family#Fox Family|Fox Family]] TV series ''Exploring the Unknown''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Shermer has been a speaker at all three [[Beyond Belief (symposium)|Beyond Belief]] events from 2006 to 2008. He also spoke at the 2006 [[TED Conference]] on "Why people believe strange things".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/speakers/michael_shermer Michael Shermer: Professional Skeptic], [[TED Conference]] website, November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he delivered the commencement speech at [[Whittier College]], which awarded him with an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters.&lt;ref name=WhittierCollege&gt;[http://www.whittier.edu/news/105th-whittier-college-commencement-ceremony-0 "105th Whittier College Commencement Ceremony"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710233946/http://www.whittier.edu/news/105th-whittier-college-commencement-ceremony-0 |date=2015-07-10 }}. May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an occasional guest on ''[[Skepticality]]'', the official [[podcast]] of ''Skeptic''.&lt;ref name="skepticality200"/&gt;

Shermer has debated [[Deepak Chopra]] on multiple occasions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-09-28/ "The Great Debate:Deepak Chopra v. Michael Shermer"]. ''Skeptic''. September 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael (April 5, 2011). [http://www.skepticblog.org/2011/04/05/my-evening-with-deepak-chopra/ "The Woo of Creation:My evening with Deepak Chopra"].

==Personal life==
As of 2007, Shermer lives in [[Altadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael (2007). "The Skeptic's Chaplain: Richard Dawkins as a Fountainhead of Skepticism". ''Skeptic''. Vol. 13. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Jennifer Graf, a native of [[Cologne]], Germany, on June 25, 2014.&lt;ref name="SA marriage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/anomalous-events-that-can-shake-one-s-skepticism-to-the-core/|title=Anomalous Events That Can Shake One's Skepticism to the Core|author=Shermer, Michael|date=September 16, 2014|work=Scientific American|access-date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was performed by Shermer's sister, Tina, who was ordained online for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Shermer | first=Michael | date=June 25, 2014 | url=https://twitter.com/michaelshermer/status/481962630337150976/photo/1 | title=Married by Minister Tina, AKA my sister. Ordained online on the spot with Open Ministry (free instant!) what a world | work=Twitter | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lifelong dog lover, he previously had a dog named Darwin, and as of April 2018, they have a [[Chocolate Labrador Retriever]] named Hitch, in honor of [[Christopher Hitchens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shermer, Michael|title=Dr. Gregory Berns — What It’s Like to Be a Dog: Animal Neuroscience (Science Salon # 22)|magazine=Skeptic|publisher=Skeptics Society/[[YouTube]]|date=April 16, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9p9stYaI7c&amp;t=0s&amp;list=WL&amp;index=3|accessdate=April 23, 2018|time=0:50; 2:18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Shermer has described himself as a lifelong [[Libertarianism|libertarian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-shermer/the-case-for-libertariani_b_258500.html|title=The Case for Libertarianism|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=September 13, 2009|access-date=October 6, 2015|author=Shermer, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 interview, Shermer stated that he prefers to talk about individual issues, lamenting that, in the past, people would refuse to even listen to him because of his self-description as a libertarian. In this same interview, he also mentioned that his research into gun control led him to believe that some measures to reduce gun-related violence would be beneficial.&lt;ref name="skepticality2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|title=Arcing Toward Morality - Interview with Dr. Michael Shermer|url=https://www.skepticality.com/arcing-toward-morality/|website=Skepticality|access-date=May 27, 2016|date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first president he voted for was [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972, which, in light of the [[Watergate scandal]], he calls his "most embarrassing vote".

In 2000, he voted for [[Harry Browne]] to "vote his conscience", on the assumption that the winner of the [[Al Gore]] – [[George W. Bush]] contest would be irrelevant. He later regretted this decision, believing that [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush's foreign policy]] made the world more dangerous, and he voted for [[John Kerry]] in 2004. Shermer has named [[Thomas Jefferson]] as his favorite president, for his championing of liberty and his application of scientific thinking to the political, economic, and social spheres. He says of Jefferson, "When he dined alone at the White House there was more intelligence in that room than when [[John F. Kennedy]] hosted a dinner there for a roomful of Nobel laureates."&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Getting Your Vote?|author=Shermer, Michael|newspaper=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|date=November 2004|url=https://reason.com/archives/2004/11/01/whos-getting-your-vote/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer once opposed most [[gun control]] measures, primarily because of his beliefs in the principle of increasing individual freedom and decreased government intervention, and also because he has owned guns for most of his life. As an adult, he owned a [[.357 Magnum]] [[pistol]] for a quarter of a century for protection, although he eventually took it out of the house, and then got rid of it entirely. Though he no longer owns guns, he continues to support the right to own guns to protect one's family.&lt;ref name=Skeptic18.1/&gt; However, by 2013, the data on gun homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings convinced him that some modest gun control measures might be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael (October 2013). [https://michaelshermer.com/2013/10/when-science-doesnt-support-beliefs/ "When Science Doesn’t Support Beliefs"], ''Scientific American'', October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer also previously favored [[capital punishment]], primarily in sympathy for victims' families, but later he came to oppose the death penalty, partially out of a resistance to giving the government too much power – in light of the hundreds of executed individuals who were later revealed to be innocent – and partially from his view that retributive justice is driven by humanity's baser instincts, and it does not effect [[restorative justice]].&lt;ref name=BestSchools/&gt; He later changed his mind about the issue during research for ''[[The Moral Arc]]'', reasoning that "[Capital punishment] is one of these barbaric practices that we need to get rid of. [The United States of] America is really the last of the 19 industrialized democracies to have the death penalty. (...) The Italian enlightenment philosopher [[Cesare Beccaria]], on his book [[On Crimes and Punishments]], put forward the idea that the punishment should fit the crime and that the criteria should be whether it keeps people from committing crimes, and the Death Penalty does not do that."&lt;ref name="skepticality2015"/&gt;

'''Nāgārjuna''' (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) is widely considered one of the most important [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosophers]].&lt;ref name=Garfield&gt;Garfield, Jay L. (1995), ''The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his disciple [[Aryadeva|Āryadeva]], he is considered to be the founder of the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=Garfield /&gt; Nāgārjuna is also credited with developing the philosophy of the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] sūtras and, in some sources, with having revealed these scriptures in the world, having recovered them from the [[nāga]]s (water spirits often depicted in the form of serpent-like humans). Furthermore, he is traditionally supposed to have written several treatises on [[rasayana]] as well as serving a term as the head of [[Nalanda|Nālandā]].&lt;ref&gt;Hsing Yun, Xingyun, Tom Manzo, Shujan Cheng Infinite Compassion, Endless Wisdom: The Practice of the Bodhisattva Path Buddha's Light Publishing Hacienda Heights California&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Very little is reliably known of the life of Nāgārjuna, since the surviving accounts were written in Chinese&lt;ref&gt;Rongxi, Li; Dalia, Albert A. (2002). [https://web.archive.org/web/20150920131638/http://www.bdk.or.jp/pdf/bdk/digitaldl/dBET_LivesGreatMonksNuns_2002.pdf The Lives of Great Monks and Nuns], Berkeley CA: Numata Center for Translation and Research, pp. 21–30&lt;/ref&gt; and Tibetan centuries after his death. According to some accounts, Nāgārjuna was originally from South India.&lt;ref name="kalupahana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Art &amp; Antiquities of Himachal Pradesh By Omacanda Hāṇḍā (Page 97)&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that Nāgārjuna was an advisor to a king of the [[Satavahana dynasty]].&lt;ref name="kalupahana"/&gt; Archaeological evidence at Amarāvatī indicates that if this is true, the king may have been [[Yajna Sri Satakarni|Yajña Śrī Śātakarṇi]], who ruled between 167 and 196 CE. On the basis of this association, Nāgārjuna is conventionally placed at around 150–250 CE.&lt;ref name="kalupahana"/&gt;

According to a 4th/5th-century biography translated by [[Kumārajīva]], Nāgārjuna was born into a [[Brahmin]] family&lt;ref&gt;Notes on the Nagarjunikonda Inscriptions, Dutt, Nalinaksha. The Indian Historical Quarterly 7:3 1931.09 pp.633–653 "..Tibetan tradition which says that Nāgārjuna was born of a brahmin family of Vidarbha."&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vidarbha]]&lt;ref&gt;Geri Hockfield Malandra, ''Unfolding A Mandala: The Buddhist Cave Temples at Ellora'', SUNY Press, 1993, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shōhei Ichimura, ''Buddhist Critical Spirituality: Prajñā and Śūnyatā'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (2001), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bkra-śis-rnam-rgyal (Dwags-po Paṇ-chen), Takpo Tashi Namgyal, ''Mahamudra: The Quintessence of Mind and Meditation'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (1993), p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; (a region of [[Maharashtra]]) and later became a Buddhist.

Some sources claim that in his later years, Nāgārjuna lived on the mountain of Śrīparvata near the city that would later be called [[Nagarjunakonda|Nāgārjunakoṇḍa]] ("Hill of Nāgārjuna").&lt;ref name="hirakawa"&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins of Nāgārjunakoṇḍa are located in [[Guntur district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The [[Caitika]] and [[Bahuśrutīya]] nikāyas are known to have had [[vihara|monasteries]] in Nāgārjunakoṇḍa.&lt;ref name="hirakawa"/&gt; The archaeological finds at Nagarjunakonda have not resulted in any evidence that the site was associated with Nagarjuna. The name "Nagarjunakonda" dates from the medieval period, and the 3rd-4th century inscriptions found at the site make it clear that it was known as "Vijayapuri" in the ancient period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=K. Krishna Murthy |title=Nāgārjunakoṇḍā: A Cultural Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gBSWyLTSzkC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=1977 |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |oclc=4541213 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
There exist a number of influential texts attributed to Nāgārjuna though, as there are many [[pseudepigrapha]] attributed to him, lively controversy exists over which are his authentic works. 

===Mūlamadhyamakakārikā===
{{Main article|Mūlamadhyamakakārikā}}
The ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'' is Nāgārjuna's best-known work. It is "not only a grand commentary on the Buddha's discourse to Kaccayana,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.015.than.html SN 12.15 Kaccayanagotta Sutta: To Kaccayana Gotta (on Right View) ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329025311/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.015.than.html |date=29 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only discourse cited by name, but also a detailed and careful analysis of most of the important discourses included in the Nikayas and the agamas, especially those of the ''Atthakavagga'' of the ''Sutta-nipata''.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=161}}
{{quote|Utilizing the Buddha's theory of [[Pratītyasamutpāda|"dependent arising" (''pratitya-samutpada'')]], Nagarjuna demonstrated the futility of [...] metaphysical speculations. His method of dealing with such metaphysics is referred to as "middle way" (''madhyama pratipad''). It is the middle way that avoided the substantialism of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] as well as the nominalism of the [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantikas]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}}}
In the ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'', "[A]ll experienced phenomena are [[Śūnyatā|empty (''sunya'')]]. This did not mean that they are not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of [[Svabhava|a permanent and eternal substance (''svabhava'')]] because, like a dream, they are mere projections of human consciousness. Since these imaginary fictions are experienced, they are not [[Prajñaptivāda|mere names (''prajnapti'')]]."{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}

===Other attributed works===
According to one view, that of Christian Lindtner,&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, C. (1982). Nagarjuniana: studies in the writings and philosophy of Nāgārjuna, Copenhagen: Akademisk forlag, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; the works definitely written by Nāgārjuna are:
* ''Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā'' (Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way)
* ''Śūnyatāsaptati'' (Seventy Verses on Emptiness)
* ''Vigrahavyāvartanī'' (The End of Disputes)
* {{IAST|''Vaidalyaprakaraṇa''}} (Pulverizing the Categories)
* ''Vyavahārasiddhi'' (Proof of Convention)
* {{IAST|''Yuktiṣāṣṭika''}} (Sixty Verses on Reasoning)
* {{IAST|''Catuḥstava''}} (Hymn to the Absolute Reality)
* ''Ratnāvalī'' (Precious Garland)
* {{IAST|''Pratītyasamutpādahṝdayakārika''}} (Constituents of Dependent Arising)
* [[Sutrasamuccaya|''Sūtrasamuccaya'']]
* {{IAST|''Bodhicittavivaraṇa''}} (Exposition of the Enlightened Mind)
* {{IAST|''Suhṛllekha''}} (Letter to a Good Friend)
* {{IAST|''Bodhisaṃbhāra''}} (Requisites of Enlightenment)

Buston considers the first six to be the main treatises of Nāgārjuna, while according to Taaranaatha only the first five are the works of Nāgārjuna. TRV Murti considers Ratnaavali, Pratitya Samutpaada Hridaya and Sutra Samuccaya to be works of Nāgārjuna as the first two are quoted profusely by Chandrakirti and the third by Shantideva.&lt;ref&gt;TRV Murti, Central philosophy of Buddhism, pages 89-91&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to works mentioned above, several others are attributed to
Nāgārjuna. There is an ongoing, lively controversy over which of those
works are authentic. Contemporary research suggest that these works belong
to a significantly later period, either to late 8th or early 9th century CE,
and hence can not be authentic works of Nāgārjuna.

However, several works considered important in esoteric Buddhism are
attributed to Nāgārjuna and his disciples by traditional historians
like Tāranātha from 17th century Tibet. These historians try to account
for chronological difficulties with various theories. For example, a
propagation of later writings via mystical revelation. For a useful
summary of this tradition, see Wedemeyer 2007.

Lindtner considers that the ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' "Commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom" is not a genuine work of Nāgārjuna. This work is only attested in a Chinese translation by [[Kumārajīva]].There is much discussion as to whether this is a work of Nāgārjuna, or someone else. [[Étienne Lamotte]], who translated one third of the work into French, felt that it was the work of a North Indian [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school who later became a convert to the [[Mahayana]]. The Chinese scholar-monk [[Yin Shun]] felt that it was the work of a South Indian and that Nāgārjuna was quite possibly the author. These two views are not necessarily in opposition and a South Indian Nāgārjuna could well have studied the northern Sarvāstivāda. Neither of the two felt that it was composed by Kumārajīva, which others have suggested.

[[File:Nagarjuna.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Nāgārjuna in Tibetan monastery near [[Kullu]], India|200px]]
From studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with many of the [[Śrāvaka]] philosophies and with the Mahāyāna tradition. However, determining Nāgārjuna's affiliation with a specific [[nikāya]] is difficult, considering much of this material has been lost. If the most commonly accepted attribution of texts (that of Christian Lindtner) holds, then he was clearly a Māhayānist, but his philosophy holds assiduously to the Śrāvaka ''[[Tripiṭaka]]'', and while he does make explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, he is always careful to stay within the parameters set out by the Śrāvaka canon.

Nāgārjuna may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the [[āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]]. In the eyes of Nāgārjuna, the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Madhyamaka system.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lindtner, ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing 1997, page 324.&lt;/ref&gt; David Kalupahana sees Nāgārjuna as a successor to [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] in being a champion of the middle-way and a reviver of the original philosophical ideals of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nāgārjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2005, pages 2,5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nāgārjuna assumes a knowledge of the definitions of the sixteen categories as given in the [[Nyaya Sutras]], the chief text of the Hindu Nyaya school, and wrote a treatise on the pramanas where he reduced the syllogism of five members into one of three. In the Vigrahavyavartani Karika, Nāgārjuna criticizes the Nyaya theory of pramanas (means of knowledge) &lt;ref&gt;S.Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy Volume 1, page 644&lt;/ref&gt;

Nāgārjuna was fully acquainted with the classical Hindu philosophies of [[Samkhya]] and even the [[Vaiseshika]].&lt;ref&gt;TRV Murti, The central philosophy of Buddhism, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the high degree of similarity between Nāgārjuna's philosophy and [[Pyrrhonism]], particularly the surviving works of [[Sextus Empiricus]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Kuzminski, ''Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas McEvilley]] suspects that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonists texts imported into India.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McEvilley, ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' 2002 pp499-505&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrrho]] of Elis (c. 360-c. 270 BCE), who is usually credited with founding this school of [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical philosophy]], was himself influenced by Indian philosophy, when he traveled to India with [[Alexander the Great]]'s army and studied with the [[gymnosophist]]s.

===Sunyata===
Nāgārjuna's major thematic focus is the concept of [[śūnyatā]] (translated into English as "emptiness") which brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly [[anatta|anātman]] "not-self" and [[pratītyasamutpāda]] "dependent origination", to refute the metaphysics of some of his contemporaries. For Nāgārjuna, as for the Buddha in the early texts, it is not merely [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] that are "selfless" or non-substantial; all phenomena (dhammas) are without any [[svabhava|svabhāva]], literally "own-being", "self-nature", or "inherent existence" and thus without any underlying essence. They are ''empty'' of being independently existent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhāva circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. This is so because all things arise always dependently: not by their own power, but by depending on conditions leading to their coming into [[existence]], as opposed to [[being]].

Nāgārjuna means by real any entity which has a nature of its own (svabhāva), which is not produced by causes (akrtaka), which is not dependent on anything else (paratra nirapeksha).&lt;ref&gt;S.Radhakrishnan, Indian philosophy Volume 1, page 607&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 24 verse 14 of the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] provides one of Nāgārjuna's most famous quotations on emptiness and co-arising:&lt;ref name="siderits"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Siderits | first1 = Mark | last2 = Katsura | first2 = Shoryu | title = Nagarjuna's Middle Way: Mulamadhyamakakarika (Classics of Indian Buddhism) | publisher = Wisdom Publications | year = 2013 | isbn = 1614290504 | pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''sarva&amp;#7747; ca yujyate tasya &amp;#347;&amp;#363;nyat&amp;#257; yasya yujyate&lt;br /&gt;sarva&amp;#7747; na yujyate tasya &amp;#347;&amp;#363;nya&amp;#7747; yasya na yujyate''

All is possible when emptiness is possible.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is possible when emptiness is impossible.}}

As part of his analysis of the emptiness of phenomena in the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], Nāgārjuna critiques svabhāva in several different concepts. He discusses the problems of positing any sort of inherent essence to causation, movement, change and personal identity. Nāgārjuna makes use of the Indian logical tool of the [[tetralemma]] to attack any essentialist conceptions. Nāgārjuna’s logical analysis is based on four basic propositions:

:All things (dharma) exist: affirmation of being, negation of non-being
:All things (dharma) do not exist: affirmation of non-being, negation of being
:All things (dharma) both exist and do not exist: both affirmation and negation
:All things (dharma) neither exist nor do not exist: neither affirmation nor negation &lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich (1998) Zen Buddhism: a history, India and China, Macmillan Publishing, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

To say that all things are 'empty' is to deny any kind of ontological foundation, therefore Nāgārjuna's view is often seen as a kind of ontological [[anti-foundationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan. Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; or a metaphysical [[anti-realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark. Nagarjuna as anti-realist, Journal of Indian Philosophy December 1988, Volume 16, Issue 4, pp 311-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the nature of the emptiness of phenomena is simply a means to an end, which is [[nirvana]]. Thus Nāgārjuna's philosophical project is ultimately a soteriological one meant to correct our everyday cognitive processes which mistakenly posits [[svabhava|svabhāva]] on the flow of experience.

Some scholars such as [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] and T.R.V. Murti held that Nāgārjuna was the inventor of the Shunyata doctrine, however, more recent work by scholars such as Choong Mun-keat, Yin Shun and Dhammajothi Thero has argued that Nāgārjuna was not an innovator by putting forth this theory,&lt;ref&gt;Yìn Shùn, An Investigation into Emptiness (Kōng zhī Tànjìu 空之探究) (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choong, The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medawachchiye Dhammajothi Thero, The Concept of Emptiness in Pali Literature&lt;/ref&gt; but that, in the words of Shi Huifeng, "the connection between emptiness and dependent origination is not an innovation or creation of Nāgārjuna."&lt;ref&gt;Shi huifeng: “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two truths===
Nāgārjuna was also instrumental in the development of the [[two truths doctrine]], which claims that there are two levels of truth in Buddhist teaching, the ultimate truth (''paramārtha satya'') and the conventional or superficial truth (''saṃvṛtisatya''). The ultimate truth to Nāgārjuna is the truth that everything is empty of essence,&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay. Empty Words: Buddhist Philosophy and Cross-cultural Interpretation, pp. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; this includes emptiness itself ('the emptiness of emptiness'). While some (Murti, 1955) have interpreted this by positing Nāgārjuna as a [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] and thus making ultimate truth a metaphysical [[noumenon]] or an "ineffable ultimate that transcends the capacities of discursive reason",&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark 2003"&gt;Siderits, Mark, On the Soteriological Significance of Emptiness, Contemporary Buddhism, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; others such as Mark Siderits and [[Jay L. Garfield]] have argued that Nāgārjuna's view is that "the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth" (Siderits) and that Nāgārjuna is a "semantic anti-dualist" who posits that there are only conventional truths.&lt;ref name="Siderits, Mark 2003"/&gt; Hence according to Garfield:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that we take a conventional entity, such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts […]. So we conclude that it is empty. But now let us analyze that emptiness […]. What do we find? Nothing at all but the table’s lack of inherent existence. […]. To see the table as empty […] is to see the table as conventional, as dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, J. L. (2002). Empty words, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In articulating this notion in the ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'', Nāgārjuna drew on an early source in the ''[[Kaccānagotta Sutta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalupahana|first=David J.|title=Nāgārjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way|year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; which distinguishes definitive meaning (''nītārtha'') from interpretable meaning (''neyārtha''):
{{quote|By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one reads the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "non-existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one reads the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one.

By and large, Kaccayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings (sustenances), and biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on "my self". He has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress, when arising, is arising; stress, when passing away, is passing away. In this, his knowledge is independent of others. It's to this extent, Kaccayana, that there is right view.

"Everything exists": That is one extreme. "Everything doesn't exist": That is a second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle...&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20130329025311/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.015.than.html SN 12.15 Kaccayanagotta Sutta: To Kaccayana Gotta (on Right View)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The version linked to is the one found in the nikayas, and is slightly different from the one found in the ''Samyuktagama''. Both contain the concept of teaching via the middle between the extremes of existence and non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Warder, ''A Course in Indian Philosophy.'' Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1998, pages 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the full text of both versions with analysis see pages 192–195 of Choong Mun-keat, ''The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism: A comparative study basted on the Sutranga portion of the Pali Samyutta-Nikaya and the Chinese Samyuktagama''; Harrassowitz Verlag, Weisbaden, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Nagarjuna does not make reference to "everything" when he quotes the agamic text in his ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā''.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way''. SUNY Press, 1986, page 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causality  ===
{{See also|Causality}}	

Jay L. Garfield describes that Nāgārjuna approached causality from the [[four noble truths]] and [[dependent origination]]. Nāgārjuna distinguished two dependent origination views in a causal process, that which causes effects and that which causes conditions. This is predicated in the [[Nagarjuna#Two truths|two truth doctrine]], as conventional truth and ultimate truth held together, in which both are empty in existence.  The distinction between effects and conditions is controversial. In Nāgārjuna's approach, cause means an event or state that has power to bring an effect. Conditions, refer to proliferating causes that bring a further event, state or process; without a metaphysical commitment to an occult connection between explaining and explanans. He argues nonexistent causes and various existing conditions. The argument draws from unreal causal power.  Things conventional exist and are ultimately nonexistent to rest in the [[middle way]] in both causal existence and nonexistence as casual emptiness within the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] doctrine. Although seeming strange to Westerners, this is seen as an attack on a reified view of causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garfield|first1=Jay L|title=Dependent Arising and the Emptiness of Emptiness: Why Did Nāgārjuna Start with Causation?|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=April 1994|volume=44|issue=2|page=|pages=219–250|doi=10.2307/1399593|jstor=1399593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relativity===
Nāgārjuna also taught the idea of relativity; in the Ratnāvalī, he gives the example that shortness exists only in relation to the idea of length. The determination of a thing or object is only possible in relation to other things or objects, especially by way of contrast. He held that the relationship between the ideas of "short" and "long" is not due to intrinsic nature (svabhāva). This idea is also found in the Pali Nikāyas and Chinese Āgamas, in which the idea of relativity is expressed similarly: "That which is the element of light ... is seen to exist on account of [in relation to] darkness; that which is the element of good is seen to exist on account of bad; that which is the element of space is seen to exist on account of form."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, pages 96–97. In the Nikayas the quote is found at SN 2.150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Nāgārjuna is often depicted in composite form comprising human and nāga characteristics. Often the nāga-aspect forms a canopy crowning and shielding his human head. The notion of the naga is found throughout Indian religious culture, and typically signifies an intelligent serpent or dragon, who is responsible for the rains, lakes and other bodies of water. In Buddhism, it is a synonym for a realised [[arhat]], or wise person in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nagarjun/|title=Nagarjuna (c. 150—c. 250)|last=Berger|first=Douglas|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Hugh Emmett''' (September 22, 1900 – April 22, 1985) was an American [[chemical engineer]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Portland, Oregon]]. After completing his baccalaureate at Oregon Agricultural College (now [[Oregon State University]]), Emmett went on to the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he earned his Ph.D.  He was also a classmate and close friend of [[Linus Pauling]] at both institutions. In 1976, Emmett married Pauling's sister, Pauline (his third wife).

Emmett became chair of the Chemical Engineering Department at The [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1937. In 1943 he left the university to join the staff of the [[Manhattan Project]], where he was instrumental in developing a technique for the separation of Uranium-235 from U-238. Following a residency at the [[Mellon Institute]] of Industrial Research, Emmett returned to Johns Hopkins in 1955, as the W. R. Grace Professor in the Chemistry Department. He was active both nationally and internationally with various chemistry committees and conferences. Emmett’s contributions include the [[BET theory]] for calculating the surface area of a material from the amount of gas it absorbs; work with ammonia and iron nitride; and many other detailed experiments. He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in 1955.

Emmett retired from Johns Hopkins in 1971. He then became research professor in the Chemistry Department at [[Portland State University]], undertaking new research areas such as surface area of soils and the porosity of coals, presenting seminar talks and offering advanced courses in [[catalysis]].

==Honors and awards==
*1955 Elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences.

'''Peter Christian Albrecht Jensen''' (16 August 1861 - 16 August 1936), best known as '''Peter C. Jensen''' was a German [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]].

Jensen held the view that [[List of major biblical figures|Biblical figures]] such as [[Jesus]], [[Moses]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] were based on Babylonian myths.&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells, John R. (2007). ''A Handbook of Ancient Religions''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 207. {{ISBN|978-0521847124}} "Peter Jensen, a distinguished Assyriologist, argued that Abraham, Jesus and John the Baptist, for example, were borrowed from Babylonian mythology and that the Gilgamesh epic, to him a kind of astral saga, was the basis for the New Testament and the Koran."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heschel, Susannah. (2008). ''The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany''. [[Princeton University Press]]. pp. 57-58. {{ISBN|978-0691148052}} "Peter Jensen, professor at the University of Marburg, published a pamphlet in 1909 asserting that Moses, Jesus and Paul were three variants of Babylonian divinities. A year later he published another pamphlet, questioning the reliability of sources for Jesus's life as related in the gospels, and suggesting it was contrived along the lines of hero myths such as the Gilgamesh epic."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Jensen was born as the son of the pastor of the German-Danish Protestant congregation in [[Bordeaux]], Conrad Jensen. He grew up in [[Holstein]], later in Nustrup Sogn (Nordschleswig), where the family moved to 1871, and visited the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] town gymnasium until 1879. In 1880 he began his theological studies at [[Leipzig University]]. There he soon moved to Oriental Studies with a focus on [[Assyriology]] under [[Friedrich Delitzsch]].  In 1883 Jensen went to [[Eberhard Schrader]] in Berlin. After completing his doctorate under Schrader and [[Eduard Sachau]] in 1884, Jensen first went to [[Kiel]] and to [[Strasbourg]], where he qualified as a librarian in 1888. In 1892 Jensen was called to the [[University of Marburg]] as successor to [[Julius Wellhausen]], where he taught Semitic languages as a professor from 1895 to 1928.

He studied the [[Babylonia]]n-[[Assyria]]n religious literature in his doctoral dissertation and in 1890 published ''Die Kosmologie der Babylonier'' (The Cosmology of the Babylonians). His hypotheses on the comparison of myths pointed to parallels between the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and Greek (especially [[Homer]]) and Israelite "legends," including the story of Jesus in the [[New Testament]]. He then worked on this theory as a monumental work ''Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur'' (Gilgamesh in world literature) in 1906 in such a way that he subjected the Old Testament figures from [[Abraham]] to the Judaic kings, as well as Jesus and Paul, to an arbitrary interpretation as an Israelite Gilgamesh legend.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Aaron Barton|Barton, George A]]. (1907). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3154520 ''Review: The Metamorphoses of Gilgamesh'']. ''[[The American Journal of Theology]]'' 11 (3): 519–524.&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen has been described as an advocate of [[Panbabylonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Daniel. (2003). ''Aesthetics and Analysis in Writing on Religion: Modern Fascinations''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0520236141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his pamphlet ''Hat der Jesus der Evangelien wirklich gelebt?'' (1910), he contended that the [[historicity of Jesus]] was a myth based upon the Epic of Gilgamesh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Warren Allen Smith|Smith, Warren Allen]]. (2000). ''Who's Who in Hell: A Handbook and International Directory for Humanists, Freethinkers, Naturalists, Rationalists, and Non-theists''. [[Barricade Books]]. p. 590. {{ISBN|978-1569801581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jensen's theories were largely criticized by Biblical scholars and theologians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Clemen|Clemen, Carl]]. (1908). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3155088 ''Does the Fourth Gospel Depend Upon Pagan Traditions?''] ''[[The American Journal of Theology]]'' 12 (4): 529–546.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shirley Jackson Case|Case, Shirley Jackson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1258">'''Reuben Davies''' (Reuben Brydydd y Coed) (1808-1833) was a Welsh poet. His family were from the [[Cribyn]] area of [[Ceredigion]], where his father worked as a weaver. After completing his education in local schools, he planned to enter the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] ministry. Shortly after entering [[Carmarthen College]] in 1825, he was taken ill and was unable to continue his studies. He became the schoolmaster at [[Cribyn]] (and later at Cilmaenllwyd, [[Carmarthenshire]]). 

He was also a prolific poet and writer. His works include over fifty hymns, several [[englynion]]-style poems, and a memorial [[awdl]] to D. L. Jones, a Carmarthenshire tutor. He translated the works of many Greek and Latin authors (e.g. those of Ovid) into Welsh.

He died, aged 25, in January 1833, and is buried in [[Dihewyd]] churchyard.

[[File:United States of America Fallout shelter sign.jpg|thumb|right|x250px|A fallout shelter sign at the [[Smithsonian Institution Building|Smithsonian]] in Washington, D.C.]]

[[Major general (United States)|Major General]] Keith R. Barney tasked Blakeley with creating the fallout shelter sign in 1961. Blakeley decided that to be most durable the signs must be made from metal. As they needed to be easy to find in the dark, he chose to use orange-yellow and black, with an image created by graphic design firm Blair Inc. and possibly based a image from on [[Clarence P. Hornung]]'s ''Handbook of Designs'', consisting of three upside-down [[equilateral triangle]]s on a black background and the words "Fallout Shelter" in large letters.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/nuclear-fallout-shelters-were-never-going-to-work|title=Nuclear Fallout Shelters Were Never Going to Work|first=Robert|last=Klara|date=October 16, 2017|work=[[History (U.S. TV network)|History]]|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blakeley also wanted the reflective paint to easily illuminate from a [[lighter|cigarette lighter]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5814592/where-did-the-iconic-fallout-shelter-symbol-come-from|title=Where Did The Iconic Fallout Shelter Symbol Come From?|first=Kwame|last=Opam|date=June 22, 2011|work=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His design was approved by Special Assistant to the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Powell Pierpoint]]. Blakeley suggested a $700,000 production run of one million interior signs by Alfray Products from [[Coshocton, Ohio]] and 400,000 exterior signs by [[Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing]] (3M).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

Blakeley debuted the completed products at the [[Westchester County]] Office Building in [[White Plains, New York]], on October 4, 1961. The signs became an icon for the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protests]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and were featured in popular culture, including [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1965 album cover for ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Blakeley recounted a story from when his children were young and saw the ubiquitous signs:{{Quote|We'd go down the street, and one of the kids would say, "Hey, Dad, there's one of your signs." But, you know, other than that it's just like many of the other things that happen in life. It's just like one of those routine things.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;}}

Crippen received the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]].

==Background==
Crippen was born September 11, 1937, in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/13/us/robert-l-crippen.html|title=Robert L.

==Flight experience==
Crippen was commissioned through the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)|Aviation Officer Candidate School]] (AOCS) Program at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He continued his flight training at [[Naval Air Station Whiting Field]], Florida, and went from there to [[Naval Air Station Chase Field]] in [[Beeville, Texas]], where he received his wings. As a [[United States naval aviator|Naval Aviator]] from June 1962 to November 1964, he made two deployments aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS ''Independence'']], flying the [[A-4 Skyhawk]] in Attack Squadron 72 ([[VA-72 (U.S. Navy)|VA-72]]). He later attended the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Aerospace Research Pilot School]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. Upon graduation he remained at Edwards as an instructor until he was picked for the USAF [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) spaceflight program in October 1966.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

He has logged more than 6,500 hours flying time, which includes more than 5,500 hours in jet aircraft.&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

After the MOL program was cancelled, Crippen became a NASA astronaut in September 1969.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He served on the astronaut support crew for the [[Skylab 2]], [[Skylab 3]], and [[Skylab 4]] missions, and for the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] mission.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He was the Pilot of the first orbital test flight of the [[Space Shuttle program]] ([[STS-1]], April 12&amp;ndash;14, 1981) and was the Commander of three additional Shuttle flights: [[STS-7]], June 18&amp;ndash;24, 1983; [[STS-41-C]], April 6&amp;ndash;13, 1984; and [[STS-41-G]], October 6&amp;ndash;13, 1984.  In addition to participating in the first Shuttle flight, he also presided over the first five-person crew ([[STS-7]], which included [[Sally Ride]], the first American woman in space), the first satellite repair operation (STS-41-C, which repaired the [[Solar Maximum Mission]] satellite), and the first seven-person crew (STS-41-G). He was named Commander of the [[STS-62-A]] mission which would have launched from the new [[SLC-6]] facility at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], California.  That mission was cancelled after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] and SLC-6 was closed when the Air Force went back to launching [[satellites]] on the [[Titan III]] and [[Titan IV]] rockets.

Crippen was stationed at [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]], from July 1987 to December 1989, as Deputy Director, Shuttle Operations for [[NASA Headquarters]]. He was responsible for final Shuttle preparation, mission execution and return of the [[orbiter]] to KSC after landings at Edwards Air Force Base. From January 1990 to January 1992, he served as Director, Space Shuttle, at NASA Headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] As such, he was responsible for the overall Shuttle program requirements, performance, and total program control, including budget, schedule and program content. He subsequently served as the Director of the Kennedy Space Center from January 1992 to January 1995.

===Spaceflight experience===
[[File:R. Crippen and J. Young KSC-81P-0140.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and Crippen suiting up for the STS-1 mission]]
[[STS-1]]: [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] (April 12–14, 1981) was the first orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle ''Columbia''. It was also the first manned vehicle to be flown into orbit without previous unmanned orbital testing and the first winged manned vehicle to launch with solid rocket boosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flying Machine|page=9|date=April 15, 1982|newspaper=Star-Gazette|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17465918/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first winged reentry vehicle to return to a conventional runway landing. The mission lasted 54 hours, 20 minutes, 53 seconds.&lt;ref name=scienceksc&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-1/mission-sts-1.html |title=STS-1 Overview |publisher=NASA |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[STS-7]]: [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] (June 18–24, 1983) was the second flight for the Orbiter ''Challenger''. This was also the first mission with a five-person crew. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) and [[Indonesia]] (PALAPA B-1); operated the Canadian-built [[Remote Manipulator System]] (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise with the [[Shuttle Pallet Satellite]] (SPAS-01); conducted the first formation flying of the orbiter with a free-flying satellite (SPAS-02); carried and operated the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2); and operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven Getaway Specials. Mission duration was 146 hours, 23 minutes, 59 seconds.

[[STS-41-C]]: ''Challenger'' (April 6–13, 1984) was a seven-day mission during which the crew deployed the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF); retrieved the ailing Solar Maximum Satellite, repaired it aboard the orbiting ''Challenger'', and replaced it in orbit using the robot arm called the Remote Manipulator System (RMS); flight tested the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]]s (MMU's) in two extravehicular activities ([[Extravehicular activity|EVA]]); as well as operating the Cinema 360 and [[IMAX]] Camera Systems, and running a Bee Hive Honeycomb Structures student experiment. Mission duration was 167 hours, 40 minutes, 07 seconds.

[[STS-41-G]]: ''Challenger'' (October 5–13, 1984) was the first mission with a seven-person crew. During the eight-day flight, the crew deployed the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]], conducted scientific observations of the [[Earth]] with the OSTA-3 pallet and Large Format Camera, and demonstrated potential satellite refueling with an EVA and associated hydrazine transfer. Mission duration was 8 days, 5 hours, 23 minutes, 33 seconds and concluded with a landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.&lt;ref name=mis41g&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/41-g/mission-41-g.html|title=41-G (13)|publisher=NASA|access-date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rustin Spencer "Rust" Cohle''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[True Detective (season 1)|first season]] of the [[anthology series|anthology]] [[crime drama]] television series ''[[True Detective]]'' on [[HBO]]. He was created by series creator [[Nic Pizzolatto]] and is portrayed by [[Matthew McConaughey]]. Cohle works as a detective for the Louisiana State Homicide Unit, alongside his partner Martin "Marty" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]). The season follows Cohle and Hart's hunt for a [[serial killer]] in Louisiana, across 17 years.

Both the character of Rust Cohle and Matthew McConaughey's performance have received critical acclaim. McConaughey won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series]], and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alice|last=Vincent|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10677470/True-Detective-Matthew-McConaughey-wrote-a-450-page-deconstruction-of-Rust-Cohles-life.html|title=''True Detective'': Matthew McConaughey wrote a 450-page deconstruction of Rust Cohle's life|work= ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|location=London, England|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Cohle is introduced as a gifted, but deeply troubled, detective from [[Texas]] who is transferred from working on regional drug task force to the [[Louisiana]] State Police near the end of 1994. After three months with the LSP, in January 1995, he and his partner are tasked with investigating a series of brutal, bizarre murders. A haunted, solitary [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], Cohle believes that life is meaningless, human beings are merely "sentient meat", and hope is self-delusion.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Long Bright Dark|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep1|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 12, 2014|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohle spends his free time obsessing over every detail of the crime, hoarding evidence in a storage locker and keeping extensive notes in a ledger, which earns him the derisive nickname "The Taxman" among his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Seeing Things|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep2|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 19, 2014|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gradually reveals Cohle's backstory. He was born in [[South Texas]] but raised in [[Alaska]] by his father after his parents divorced. He became a police detective in his 20s. Years before the main story arc, his two-year-old daughter, Sophia, was killed in a car accident, a tragedy that destroyed his marriage. Devastated by the loss, Cohle grew ever more unstable and unpredictable in his work, eventually killing a [[crystal meth]] addict who had injected his own child with the drug. His superiors offered him a chance to avoid prison by working as an undercover narcotics detective, which he did for four years; Cohle notes that this was twice as long as most undercover detectives are kept in rotation. During this assignment, Cohle became addicted to drugs, and eventually killed three cartel members in a shootout, while being shot multiple times himself.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"/&gt;

During his recovery, he was committed to a mental hospital in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. Upon his release, he was offered retirement with full pension, but he declined that offer in favor of transferring to a homicide division. His superiors then transferred him to Louisiana. In Louisiana, he lives alone and has no friends, living only for his work. He tries to remain sober, but he occasionally falls off the wagon because of the stress of his job and his grief for his daughter. Cohle also has [[synesthesia]] and suffers from [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] from his drug-using years as an undercover cop.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

The series takes place in two time periods: 1995–2002, in which Cohle and Hart work together to find the killer; and 2012, when Cohle, who has by now quit the police force and become an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], submits to an interview with Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough ([[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]]) and Thomas Papania ([[Tory Kittles]]) regarding the murders. Cohle sees through the detectives, and realizes that they think he is the killer.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Locked Room|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep3|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=January 26, 2014|season=1|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character arc==
Cohle and Hart are assigned to investigate a murder in which the killer [[rape]]d and [[torture]]d the victim, Dora Lange, and attached a pair of antlers to her head after killing her.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark" /&gt; They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to "[[Carcosa]]" and a "Yellow King". In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

Cohle and Hart work the case for three months, during which they trace the murder to Reggie Ledoux ([[Charles Halford]]), a former cellmate of Lange's ex-husband.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room" /&gt; To find more information, Cohle infiltrates a biker gang with ties to Ledoux, posing as a drug dealer representing a cartel in Mexico. He assists the gang in a home invasion so he can arrest the ringleader, Ginger ([[Joseph Sikora]]), and force him to lead them to Ledoux, who cooks meth for the biker gang. During the home invasion, a shootout ensues in which several people are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Who Goes There|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep4|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=February 9, 2014|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginger takes Cohle to meet Ledoux's cousin and "cook partner", Dewall ([[Ólafur Darri Ólafsson]]). The meeting does not go well, but Hart follows Dewall to Ledoux's [[meth lab]] and calls Cohle to tell him where it is. There, Hart and Cohle discover that Ledoux has kidnapped and tortured two children, and Hart kills Ledoux in a fit of rage as Cohle looks on. Dewall, meanwhile, is killed after he runs off and blows up on one of his own homemade mines. Cohle stages evidence to support Hart's story that Ledoux opened fire on them, forcing Hart to kill him in self-defense. The two are hailed as heroes, and receive commendations and promotions.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Secret Fate of All Life|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep5|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 16, 2014|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cohle interrogates a suspect who reveals that Ledoux and Dewall did not act alone.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life" /&gt; He tells Cohle that he will give them information about the "Yellow King" in return for a plea deal. Cohle wants to investigate this lead further, but the suspect kills himself in his cell that night, after receiving a phone call. Cohle becomes obsessed with reopening the case, and pursues several leads, including a private Christian school run by Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle ([[Jay O. Sanders]]) that had been closed amid rumors of [[child molestation]]. Tuttle complains to Cohle's superiors, who suspend Cohle without pay and order him to leave the case closed. That night, Hart's wife Maggie ([[Michelle Monaghan]]) shows up at Cohle's apartment and seduces him in order to get back at Hart for repeatedly cheating on her. Hart finds out and gets into a fistfight with Cohle in front of the entire department. Cohle quits the force the same day, and becomes a drifter and an alcoholic, supporting himself as a part-time bartender.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Haunted Houses|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep6|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 23, 2014|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rust Cohle 2012.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cohle in 2012]]
In 2012, murders similar to those from 1995 begin again, Cohle is seen in the vicinity of the body, arousing the suspicion of Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania. They believe that Cohle was the killer in 1995, because he led Hart to every lead they had and seemed to know everything about the killer's frame of mind. Gilbough and Papania now believe that Cohle is committing the new murders as well. They interview Cohle and Hart, who both refuse to cooperate once the purpose of the interview becomes clear.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses" /&gt;

Cohle meets with Hart and tells him that he has found evidence leading to the killer. Hart is skeptical, and still resentful of Cohle for having sex with Maggie, but Cohle convinces him to help with the investigation by showing him a videotape he stole from Rev. Tuttle's home. The video is over 20 years old, and shows numerous masked men raping and torturing Marie Fontenot, a missing child whose name had come up in their investigation 17 years earlier. Cohle and Hart track down the original case's chief investigating officer, Steve Geraci ([[Michael Harney]]), and interrogate him at gunpoint. Geraci tells them that his superior, the late Sheriff Ted Childress, ordered him to halt the investigation; Childress was one of Tuttle's relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=After You've Gone|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep7|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=March 2, 2014|season=1|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon discover that the Tuttle and Childress families — to whom both Reggie and Dewall Ledoux belong — are related, and have long histories of child abuse and murder. They ultimately discover that the killer is a Childress, and go to the late sheriff's home to investigate.&lt;ref name="Form and Void"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Form and Void|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep8|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= March 9, 2014|season=1|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohle and Hart go to the Childress house, where they find that the sheriff's son, Errol ([[Glenn Fleshler]]), is the killer, and discover the remains of his father tied up in a shed. They also encounter Betty Childress ([[Ann Dowd]]), his mentally disabled half-sister, with whom he is having an [[incest]]uous relationship. Cohle pursues Childress into the catacombs behind the house, which Childress identifies as Carcosa. Cohle discovers an idol draped in yellow and covered in skulls — the "Yellow King" — and has a hallucination of a spiraling vortex, the same vortex that had been drawn on many of the victims over the past 17 years. Childress stabs Cohle in the gut and also attacks Hart, but Cohle saves his partner by shooting Childress in the head, killing him. Gilborough and Papania, whom Hart had called, arrive at the scene. With the evidence Hart and Cohle collected, they connect Childress to dozens of murders, including Dora Lange's.&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

Cohle falls into a coma, during which he feels the loving presence of his father and daughter. He later wakes up in hospital and leaves with Hart, and tells him that, "Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning."&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

He and [[Hōne Heke]] successfully fought the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Flagstaff War]] in 1845–46.&lt;ref name="Belich"&gt;[[James Belich (historian)|Belich, James]]. ''The New Zealand Wars''. (Penguin Books, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

He traced descent from [[Rahiri|Rāhiri]] and Nukutawhiti of the ''[[Ngātokimatawhaorua]]'' canoe, the ancestors of the [[Ngāpuhi]].
He was born in the north of [[New Zealand]] into the [[Ngāti Hine]] [[hapu]], one of the subtribes of the Ngāpuhi. From his youth he was trained in leadership and warfare by [[Hongi Hika]].&lt;ref name="TW39-43"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kawiti| first =Tawai |title=Hekes War in the North | publisher=No. 16 Ao Hou, Te / The New World, National Library of New Zealand|pages =38–43|date = October 1956|url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c22-7.html| accessdate=10 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was present at the [[Battle of Moremonui]] in 1807 or 1808 when many Ngāpuhi were slaughtered by [[Ngāti Whātua]]. Almost twenty years later, in 1825, he was at the [[Te Whareumu#Te Ika-a-ranga-nui|Battle of Te Ika-a-ranga-nui]] when it was Ngāpuhi's turn to slaughter Ngāti Whātua in an act of [[Utu (Māori concept)|utu]] or revenge. He took a number of Ngāti Whātua captive and refused to hand them over to Hongi Hika, preferring instead to return them to their own people to whom he was related.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|last=Martin|first=Kene Hine Te Uira|id=1k4|title=Kawiti, Te Ruki ? - 1854|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty of Waitangi==
{{Main|Treaty of Waitangi}}
Kawiti initially refused to sign the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] on 6 February 1840, believing that it would inevitably lead to further European encroachment and the loss of Māori land. However he eventually yielded to pressure from his own people and signed the Treaty in May 1840, right at the top, above those chiefs who had signed earlier.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book

However he soon grew disenchanted with British law and supported Hōne Heke in his protests against British rule.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; Hōne Heke sought support from Kawiti and other leaders of the [[Ngāpuhi]] [[iwi]] by the conveying of ‘te ngākau’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Māori Dictionary Online|publisher=John C Moorfield|year=2005|url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=ngakau+mahaki&amp;n=1&amp;sp=1|accessdate=19 Oct 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112165137/http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=ngakau+mahaki&amp;n=1&amp;sp=1|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;

==Battle of Kororāreka==
{{Main|Battle of Kororāreka}}
Hōne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti worked out the plan to draw the Colonial forces into battle, with the opening provocations focusing on the flagstaff on [[Flagstaff Hill, New Zealand|Maiki Hill]] at the north end [[Kororāreka]].&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt; When in March 1845 Heke cut down the flag pole at [[Kororāreka]] for the fourth time, thereby initiating the Flagstaff War, Kawiti, now in his seventies, created a diversion by attacking the town.

The Māori warriors followed their chief and would fight in separate groups;&lt;ref name="TW43"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kawiti| first =Tawai |title=Hekes War in the North | publisher=No. 16 Ao Hou, Te / The New World, National Library of New Zealand|pages =43|date = October 1956|url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c22-7.html| accessdate=10 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Kawiti and Heke co-ordinated their tactics at each battle. The conduct of the Flagstaff War appears to follow a strategy of drawing the Colonial forces into attacking a fortified pā, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire. Kawiti was the senior rangatira and appears to have had a key role in the strategic decisions as to the design of the strengthened defences of Pene Taui's [[Pa (Māori)|pā]] at [[Battle of Ohaeawai|Ohaeawai]] and the design and construction of the new pā that was built at [[Ruapekapeka]] to engage the British forces.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;

==The attack on Heke's Pā at Puketutu==
{{Main|Flagstaff War}}

The first major engagement of the Flagstaff War was the [[Hōne Heke#Attack on Heke's Pā at Puketutu|attack on Heke's Pā at Puketutu]] in May 1845 by the colonial forces led by Lt Col [[William Hulme (soldier)|William Hulme]].&lt;ref name="nzhon2"&gt;{{cite web| title = Puketutu and Te Ahuahu - Northern War| date =3 April 2009 |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/northern-war/puketutu |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage - NZ History online | accessdate=17 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Heke occupied the [[Pa (Māori)|pā]] itself, Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged with the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the pā. They successfully prevented the Colonial forces from launching a coordinated attack on the pā but at quite a heavy cost in casualties. The Colonial forces were unable to overcome the defences of the pā and retreated back to the [[Bay of Islands]].

==Battle of Te Ahuahu==
The next major engagement was the [[Hōne Heke#Battle of Te Ahuahu|Battle of Te Ahuahu]].&lt;ref name="nzhon2"/&gt; The contemporary European accounts of the battle describe it as being fought on 12 June 1845 nearby [[Te Ahuahu]] and that it involve only the warriors of [[Hōne Heke]] fighting the warriors of [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]]. However, there are no detailed accounts of the action; [[Hugh Carleton]] (1874) mentions

{{cquote|Heke committed the error (against the advice of Pene Taui) of attacking Walker [Tāmati Wāka Nene], who had advanced to Pukenui. With four hundred men, he attacked about one hundred and fifty of Walker's party, taking them also by surprise; but was beaten back with loss. Kahakaha was killed, Haratua was shot through the lungs.&lt;ref name="CARv2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB),  University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=110–111 |chapter= Vol. II |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1046&amp;action=null|quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Walker was a name adopted by Tāmati Wāka Nene. In this battle Nene's warriors carried the day. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of [[Ruapekapeka]].  On this account of the early engagements of the Flagstaff War, Kawiti appears to have made the better strategic decisions as to which battles to fight and which not to fight.

==Battle of Ohaeawai==
{{Main|Battle of Ohaeawai}}

A debate occurred between Kawiti and the Ngatirangi chief Pene Taui as to the site of the next battle; Kawiti eventually agreed to the request to fortify Pene Taui’s Pā at [[Ohaeawai]].&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;

The Colonial forces arrived before the Ohaeawai Pā on 23 June and established a camp about {{convert|500|m|ft}} away. On the summit of a nearby hill (Puketapu) they built a four gun battery. They opened fire next day and continued until dark but did very little damage to the palisade. The next day the guns were brought to within {{convert|200|m|ft}} of the pā. The bombardment continued for another two days but still did very little damage. Partly this was due to the elasticity of the flax covering the palisade but the main fault was a failure to concentrate the cannon fire on one area of the defences.

After two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Lieutenant Colonel Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|naval gun]] which came the next day, 1 July.  However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]] had his camp and the capture of Nene's colours - the [[Union Flag]]. The Union Flag was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a Kākahu (Māori cloak).&lt;ref name="JC5"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Cowan |first1= James|authorlink1= |title= The New Zealand Wars: a history of the Maori campaigns and the pioneering period, Volume I: 1845–1864 |url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c8.html|accessdate=  |year= 1922 |publisher= R.E.

The attack was directed to the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour.&lt;ref name="CARv2a"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title=Vol II, The Life of Henry William|url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1050&amp;page=1&amp;action=null|format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB),  University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=112|pages= |chapter= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured.&lt;ref name="MK"&gt;{{cite web| last=King | first =Marie |title= A Most Noble Anchorage - The Story of Russell &amp; The Bay of Islands | publisher=The Northland Publications Society, Inc., The Northlander No 14 (1974)|chapter=|year =1992|url= http://www.reocities.com/wlorac/russbois.txt| accessdate=9 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Ruapekapeka==
{{Main|Ruapekapeka}}

Towards the end of 1845 the British launched a major expedition against Kawiti's new pā at [[Ruapekapeka]]. It took two weeks to bring the heavy guns into range of the pā, they started the cannon bombardment on 27 December 1845.The siege continued for some two weeks with enough patrols and probes from the pā to keep everyone alert. Then, early in the morning of Sunday, 11 January 1846, [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]]'s men discovered that the pā appeared to have been abandoned; although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his warriors remained behind, and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault.&lt;ref name="TRBP"&gt;{{cite book | author= Tim Ryan and Bill Parham| title=The Colonial New Zealand Wars|year=1986|publisher=Grantham House, Wellington NZ|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting took place behind the pā and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle.

The reason why the defenders appeared to have abandoned but then re-entered the pā is the subject of continuing debate.

It was Māori custom that the place of a battle where blood was spilt became [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] so that the Ngāpuhi left Ruapekapeka Pā.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CARv2"/&gt; After the battle Kawiti and his warriors, carrying their dead, travelled some four miles north-west to [[Waiomio]], the ancestral home of the [[Ngāti Hine]].&lt;ref name="TW43"/&gt; After the battle of Ruapekapeka Kawiti expressed the will to continue to fight,&lt;ref name="TW45-46"/&gt; however Kawiti and Heke made it known that they would end the rebellion if the Colonial forces would leave the Ngāpuhi land.[[Tāmati Wāka Nene]] acted as the intermediary in the negotiations, with Nene persuading the Governor to accept the terms of Kawiti and Heke - that they were to be unconditionally pardoned for their rebellion.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

==The aftermath of the Flagstaff War==
After the conclusion of the [[Flagstaff War]] Kawiti went to live near by [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] at [[Pakaraka]]. Kawiti was baptised by Henry Williams in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;O.C. Davis (1885) ''The Renowned Chief Kawiti, and other New Zealand Warriors''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LMR1874"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rogers |first1= Lawrence M. |authorlink1= |title= Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year=1973 |publisher=Pegasus Press |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=97, footnote 13 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at Waiomio, near [[Kawakawa, New Zealand|Kawakawa]] on 5 May 1854, The meeting house and marae complex at Waiomio Caves are his memorial.

==The legacy of Kawiti and the fifth flagpole at Kororāreka==
At the conclusion of the [[Flagstaff War]], the [[Hokianga]] and the [[Bay of Islands]] region was nominally under British influence; the fact that the government's flag was not re-erected was symbolically very significant. Such significance was not lost on [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who, writing to [[Edward Garrard Marsh|E. G. Marsh]] on 28 May 1846, stated that "the flag-staff in the Bay is still prostrate, and the natives here rule. These are humiliating facts to the proud Englishman, many of whom thought they could govern by a mere name."&lt;ref name="CARv2b"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB), University of Auckland Library|location= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 137–8|chapter= Vol. II |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1046&amp;action=null |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Belich p.70"&gt;James Belich, The New Zealand Wars, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the Flagstaff War can be considered an inconclusive stalemate, as both sides wished the war to end, both gained somewhat from the fighting, and the situation more or less remained the same as it was before the outbreak of hostilities.&lt;ref name="Ian McGibbon p.373"&gt;Ian McGibbon, (2001) The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Military History, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of Henry Williams, who had counseled Kawiti to abandon the rebellion, was that the [[Ngāpuhi]] and the colonial government both agreed that each should let the other alone, so that Kawiti achieved peace on his terms. Henry Williams wrote to his son-in-law [[Hugh Carleton]] on 13 March 1854 in response to an earlier comment by Carleton as to the consequences of Kawiti having made peace with [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] [[George Edward Grey|Grey]]:

{{cquote|But you say, "Grey will go upon Kawiti's submission as a proof of victory." I ask you in what form was Kawiti's submission? and to what and when did it take place? This is new to me, as also to Kawiti. Compare Kawiti's letter to Governor FitzRoy with the proclamation of Grey, immediately on Grey's return to Auckland, after Te Ruapekapeka was upset, or before peace was made, that all parties were to return to their own places, keeping in mind that the bone of contention was the flag-staff. Nothing was demanded from the chiefs in arms; nothing was given; but Kawiti demanded in his letter that if peace were made, it should be made with respect to the land. This was acceded to by Grey, and the flag-staff has remained prostrate to this day, though several attempts have been made to re-erect it. Captain Stanley was applied to replace it; he consented to do so immediately, but asked,--who would take care of it. Major Bridge declared it would take a thousand men to keep it in its place. Why? the natives had gained their point, and to this day laugh at the idea of submission. Peace was made with the natives on the understanding that each should let the other alone, and the demands of Kawiti having been complied with by Grey, where is the evidence of Kawiti's submission? Rather, does not the evidence shew Grey's submission to Kawiti? The war was a perfect farce, both in the North and in the South.&lt;ref name="CARv2ab"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB),  University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 328–331|chapter= Vol. II |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1046&amp;action=null|quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="LMR1973"/&gt;}}

Upon the death of Kawiti, his son [[Maihi Paraone Kawiti]], who had been a missionary teacher at [[Titoki, New Zealand|Mangakahia]], succeeded Kawiti as leader of the Ngāti Hine [[hapu]].&lt;ref name ="LMR1973"&gt;Rogers, Lawrence M., (1973) ''Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams'', Pegasus Press, pp. 296-97&lt;/ref&gt; Maihi Paraone Kawiti was a supporter of te ture (the law) and te whakapono (the gospel).&lt;ref name ="LMR1973"/&gt; Deputations came to Maihi Paraone Kawiti from the [[Taranaki (iwi)|Taranaki]] and [[Waikato]] iwi asking the Ngāpuhi to join the [[Māori King Movement]]; the reply from Maihi Paraone Kawiti was that the Ngāpuhi had no desire for a ‘Māori Kingi’ as [[Queen Victoria|‘Kuini Wikitoria’]] was their ‘Kingi'.&lt;ref name="CARv2ab"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="LMR1973"/&gt;

Maihi Paraone Kawiti, as a signal to Governor [[Thomas Gore Browne]] that he did not follow his father’s path, arranged for the fifth flagpole to be erected at Kororāreka; this occurred in January 1858 with the flag being named Whakakotahitanga, “being at one with the Queen.”&lt;ref name="CARv2ab"/&gt; As a further symbolic act, the 400 Ngāpuhi warriors involved in preparing and erecting the flagpole were selected from the ‘rebel’ forces of Kawiti and Heke – that is, Ngāpuhi from the [[hapu]] of [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]] (who had fought as allies of the British forces during the Flagstaff War), observed, but did not participate in the erection of the fifth flagpole.  The restoration of the flagpole was presented by Maihi Paraone Kawiti as a voluntary act on the part of the Ngāpuhi that had cut it down in 1845, and they would not allow any other to render any assistance in this work.&lt;ref name="CARv2ab"/&gt;

The legacy of Kawiti’s rebellion during the Flagstaff War was that during the time of [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] [[George Edward Grey|Grey]] and Governor [[Thomas Gore Browne]], the colonial administrators were obliged to take account of opinions of the Ngāpuhi before taking actions in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands. The continuing symbolism of the fifth flagpole at [[Kororāreka]] is that it exists because of the goodwill of the Ngāpuhi.

'''Teofil (Bogusław) Rutka''' SJ (27 December 1622 in the [[Kiev Voivodeship]] &amp;ndash; 18 May 1700 in [[Lwów]]) - Polish [[Jesuits|Jesuit]]. Rhetorician, philosopher, theologian and missionary. 

Teofil Rutka became a Jesuit in 1643 in Kraków and a priest in 1652 in Poznań. He was a professor of rhetorics, philosophy, polemical theology and moral theology in many Jesuit schools in Poland (in 1656–57 also in Bohemian [[Głogów]]). He served as a professor in the years 1653–76, with short breaks for being a court missionary (1657–58, probably for the Inowrocław voievode [[Krzysztof Żegocki]]), a missionary to the [[Crimean Khanate]] (1661), a ''poenitentiarius'' in Loreto (1663–64), and a missionary to [[Constantinople]] (1672–73). In the years 1676–1700 he served as a court missionary for the Ruthenian voievode [[Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski]].

Rutka wrote in Latin, but he has also published translations of his works into Polish. He is renowned mainly for his works on rhetorics, primarily for his tractatus ''Rhetor polonus''. He was a very prolific writer, beside of the rhetorics, an author of many polemical and ascetical works. Rutka was deeply interested in the problem of the relations between Eastern and Western Christianity, which was very vivid in the 17th century Poland, especially among the Jesuits. He wrote many books on the problem, especially on the [[filioque]] question. He has also acted for conversion of the Muslims, writing some books on the subject and trying to promote the idea of a league against the [[Ottoman Empire]] to be organized by the Christian monarchs.

'''Tomás Dolz de Espejo Andreu Muñoz Serrano y Duforq-Salinis, 5th Count of La Florida''' (1879-1974) was a Spanish politician and businessman. For some 30 years he campaigned within [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]] and [[Carlism]]. Periodically he was holding regional party leadership jobs, though nationwide he remained rather in the back row. He is best known as member of the first Junta Política and [[National Council of the Movement|Consejo Nacional]], executive bodies of the newly created [[Francoism|Francoist]] state party, [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|Falange Española Tradicionalista]].

==Family and youth==
[[File:Albarracín - Casa de los Dolz de Espejo - Portada.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Dolz de Espejo house, [[Albarracín]]]]
The Dolz lineage is related to Southern [[Aragón]]; its first representatives were noted in the late 12th century, once the successful [[Reconquista]] claimed [[Teruel]].&lt;ref&gt;Rocio Castellote Simón, ''El retablo de la Virgen del Pilar de la iglesia de San Bernardo abad de Gea de Albarracín'', Valencia 2016, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The family was initially linked to [[Albarracín]],&lt;ref&gt;Tomás Alamán Artigot, ''Gea en el tiempo'', [in:] ''GeaDeAlbarracín'' service, available [http://www.geadealbarracin.com/historia.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; over time spreading to neighboring counties.&lt;ref&gt;more details are scattered across different volumes of ''Linajes de Aragón. Revista quincenal ilustrada'', see for instance Gregorio García Ciprés, ''Los Sánchez-Muñoz de Teruel'', [in:] ''Linajes de Aragón'' 01.05.12, pp. 137-141&lt;/ref&gt; The Espejo lineage originated from Northern parts of [[Kingdom of Valencia]], resident in [[:es:Castelfabib|Castelfabib]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Fuertes de Gilbert Rojo, ''Albarracin: linajes y testimonios heraldicos'', [in:] José Antonio Salas Ausens (ed.), ''Tiempo de Derecho foral en el sur aragonés: los fueros de Teruel y Albarracín'', Zaragoza 2007, {{ISBN|9788489510814}}, pp. 55-106&lt;/ref&gt; The two families intermarried in the early 17th century, giving rise to the Dolz de Espejo branch.&lt;ref&gt;Castellote Simón 2016, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its members made their names in history of Spain; Tomás’ great-grandfather, Pedro Federico Dolz de Espejo, was awarded the title of Conde de la Florida in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in Fuertes de Gilbert Rojo 2007, pp. 55-106&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, the 2nd Count and the grandfather of Tomás, [[Pedro Pablo Dolz de Espejo]],&lt;ref&gt;some services confuse different members of the family, compare ''Pedro Pablo Dolz de Espejo, 2. conde de la Florida'' entry, [in:] ''Geneallnet'' service, available [http://geneall.net/es/name/1824586/pedro-pablo-dolz-de-espejo-2-conde-de-la-florida/ here], or ''Compactgen'' service, available [http://compactgen.com/es/f/flo.htm here].

==Early political career (until 1919)==
[[File:Ramon Nocedal.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón Nocedal]]]]
With two generations of ancestors serving the legitimist cause Dolz seemed poised to follow suit, especially that also his mother came from a Traditionalist family.&lt;ref&gt;daughter of marqués de Ballestar, Moreno y Mórrison 1928, p. 885. The Ballestars supported the Carlists since the First Carlist War, Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza Gómez de Valugera, ''La nobleza carlista'', [in:] ''Nobleza y sociedad en la España moderna'' 2 (1997), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; However, during his youth Traditionalism was divided into mainstream Carlists and the breakaway [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrists]]. His brother, only 2 years senior, sided with the rebels; as a 16-year-old in 1893 he publicly voiced support for the [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Nocedalistas]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 14.03.93, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000170527&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In course of the 1890s Pedro Dolz de Espejo grew in the Integrist structures,&lt;ref&gt;''El Ancora'' 25.09.97, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2252841&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1900 rising to president of the [[Valencia (province)|Valencian]] Junta Provincial&lt;ref&gt;''El estandarte católico'' 14.09.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1025350&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''La correspondencia de Valencia'' 16.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000238926&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1907 entering the executive of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian]] Junta Regional.&lt;ref&gt;rising to its vice-president, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 12.06.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000260348&amp;page=1 here], ''El Ebro'' 15.06.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=1026881&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the sources consulted confirms (or denies) that Tomás followed his older brother; until the early 1910s he is not recorded as engaged in politics.

Dolz was first noted in political milieu&lt;ref&gt;apart from non-political incidents, some of them awkward; in 1911 he engaged in a brawl, related to his borrowing and breaking of a camera, compare ''La Mañana'' 19.08.11, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026277183&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1911; he demonstrated support to Traditionalist deputies from both the Integrist and [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaimist]] minorities, who in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in vain tried to block [[:es:Ley del Candado|Ley del Candado]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 06.01.11, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000294447&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 he was admitted to [[:es:Real Maestranza de Caballería de Zaragoza|Real Maestranza de Caballeria de Zaragoza]], a theoretically non-political but in fact highly conservative aristocratic organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuario de la nobleza de España'' 1911, p. 587, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=607&amp;path=1000179115&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following death of his older brother he became a somewhat prestigious figure in the Teruel realm and as such decided to join the electoral race: in [[Spanish general election, 1914|1914]] he ran to the Cortes from [[Mora de Rubielos]], a district in the [[Teruel (province)|Teruel province]]; it was also the first time he declared himself a Jaimista, member of Carlist branch supporting the claim of [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]].&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Valencia'' 04.03.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000187325&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt proved premature and he lost pathetically, gaining 10 times fewer votes than a victorious candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Diario Turolense'' 13.10.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2300504&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''El mercantil'' 09.03.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2303225&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the defeat Florida is never confirmed to have renewed his bid for the parliament.

In the mid-1910s Florida, already referred to in the press as "rico propietario", was already fully engaged in the Jaimista structures. In 1915 he was rumored to be running in the [[Spanish general election, 1916|Cortes elections of the following year]] from the [[Latina (Madrid)|Madrid Latina district]];&lt;ref&gt;''Diario Turolense'' 07.10.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2301264&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the news eventually proved false, though in 1916 he was busy mounting an electoral alliance which would include even the Traditionalist arch-enemies, the [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Cronista de Teruel'' 21.03.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2304527&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 he worked to seal an electoral union of the Jaimists, the Integrists, the [[Antonio Maura|Maurists]] and independent candidates, to be fielded in the [[Spanish general election, 1918|forthcoming electoral campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 21.11.17, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3049708&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to first secretary of the Madrid municipal Jaimist organization,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 06.05.17, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1917/05/06/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1918 growing to its jefe&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 23.09.17, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029778907&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and soon also jefe of the provincial Madrid structures,&lt;ref&gt;''El Porvenir'' 17.05.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2150876&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; though in general remained a back-row party figure.&lt;ref&gt;Florida is not a single time mentioned in an extensive study dealing with Carlist political history of the late 19th and early 20th history, see Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vázquez de Mella 3.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Vázquez de Mella|de Mella]] speaking, 1916]]
Though he seemed perfectly loyal to Don Jaime,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1918 he entertained Infanta Beatriz, sister of the claimant Don Jaime, ''El Debate'' 23.06.18, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2279721&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the new internal conflict within Carlism Florida tended rather to side with its key theorist, [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]]. This was demonstrated not only by [[Mellismo|Mellista]]-typical penchant for right-wing alliances,&lt;ref&gt;one scholar defined Mellismo as a political strategy, aiming at building ultra-Right alliances centred around Traditionalism though with dynastic issues sidetracked or even ignored, Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also by advocating neutralist stand in the [[First World War|Great War]], a strategy intended to counter pro-[[Entente Cordiale|Entente]] feelings and effectively supporting the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;1916 co-organized "conferencia neutralista", ''Heraldo Militar'' 28.10.16, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003417319&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Florida was not among chief protagonists of the strife and remained in the background; however, when in 1919 Vázquez de Mella broke away and set up his own party, Dolz de Espejo decided to join him.

[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumb|Carlist standard]]
Upon declaration of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] Florida tried to transfer his capital abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''El Telegrama del Rif'' 04.06.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000176172&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apprehended by the customs service he was detained and possibly suffered forfeiture of some of the assets smuggled.&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 30.05.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=10&amp;path=1000319232&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; At unspecified time he returned to Carlist loyalty by entering [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]], which in 1932 re-joined the former Jaimistas, Integristas and Mellistas. In 1933 he was appointed its Jefe Regional of Castilla La Nueva.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensamiento Alaves'' 12.08.33, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;path=1000032204&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite holding a theoretically prestigious position, Florida did not seem particularly active; he was seldom recorded as speaking at party meetings&lt;ref&gt;though at times he did, compare ''Tradición'' 15.01.33, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=27&amp;path=1000208691&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and historians almost do not mention his name when discussing Carlist activities during the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;1935 he co-founded a company Editorial Católica Gráfica, called up to issue a Madrid Catholic review ''Esto''; it is not clear whether this was part of the Carlist propaganda efforts, ''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 13.02.35, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5049194&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what his position was on controversial question of alliances with other monarchist and Right-wing groupings or on internal leadership rivalry between [[Tomas Dominguez Arevalo|Conde de Rodezno]] and [[Manuel Fal Conde|Manuel Fal]]. In 1935 the latter triggered his nomination to Junta de Hacienda,&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'' vol. 30/2, Sevilla 1979, p. 57, Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''El carlisme català durant la Segona República Espanyola 1931-1936'', Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; a body entrusted with organizing funds for the Comunión.

==Towards political climax (1936-1937)==
[[File:Tropas del bando nacional (14 de 16) - Fondo Marín-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|left|thumb|[[requetés]] (1936)]]
It is not clear whether Florida was engaged in Carlist preparations to the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|July 1936 coup]]; in particular there is no information whether he opted for unconditional alliance with the military or rather for negotiating terms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Peñalba Sotorrío, ''Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul'', Estella 2013, {{ISBN|9788423533657}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It is neither known where he was during the first days of the fighting. Later Francoist propaganda claimed that from the onset Florida acted as member of Junta Carlista de Guerra del Reino de León;&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 29.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3103206&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''Heraldo de Zamora'' 27.03.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2265890&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the first confirmed information is that in September he emerged in [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], busy organizing [[Requeté]];&lt;ref&gt;''Miróbriga'' 20.09.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000166257&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in October his [[León (historical region)|León]] efforts gained him a letter of thanks from the new Carlist regent, [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Zamora'' 14.10.36, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2257433&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though he is not listed as member of the national Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra,&lt;ref&gt;Florida is not listed among members of the Junta and heads of its agencies, compare Ricardo Ollaquindia Aguirre, ''La Oficina de Prensa y Propaganda Carlista de Pamplona al comienzo de la guerra de 1936'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 56 (1995), pp. 485-6&lt;/ref&gt; residing in [[Salamanca]] he started to take part in meetings of the Comunión leaders. For reasons which are not entirely clear his position grew; perhaps as a host Florida presided over a Carlist emergency meeting of December 1936, called to deal with Franco’s demand that Fal Conde leaves Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime del Burgo Torres, ''Un episodio poco conocido de la guerra civil española. La Real Academia Militar de Requetés y el destierro de Fal Conde'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 196 (1992), p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what position he took; some historians discussing the day refer to him as "Rodezno’s ally", which suggests that Florida proposed that the ultimatum be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Francisco Franco 1930.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]]]
Starting early 1937 the Carlists were facing a prospect of forced amalgamation into a state party; the claimant and the Falcondistas opted for intransigence, Rodezno and the [[Navarre]]se opted for negotiations. Florida was present at a February meeting in [[Insua]] and sided with the Rodeznistas,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Barcelona 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; position maintained also in March.&lt;ref&gt;in March 1937 Consejo de la Tradicióñ decided to send a delegation to Franco informing him that Junta Nacional resigned and could be re-appointed according to his will; the envoys were Martinez Berasain, Marcelino Ulibarri and José María García Verde, Florida was not mentioned, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, pp. 42, 126&lt;/ref&gt; In early April he took part in a meeting of a somewhat rebellious Navarrese Junta Central; it adopted a Franco-addressed proposal suggesting a directorio, composed of Carlists, [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falangists]] and caudillo’s appointees.&lt;ref&gt;the meeting took place on April 4, 1937. The 12-member directorio was to composed of 3 Carlists, 3 Falangists and 6 appointees of Franco, Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|9788487863523}}, p. 262. It does not seem that at the time Florida took the unification threat very seriously, as on April 8, 1937 he was appointed president of jury to examin proposals for AET logotypes, ''Pensamiento Alaves'' 08.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000032217&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-April he was one of 4 Carlists summoned to [[Burgos]]; generalísimo informed them about forthcoming political unification.&lt;ref&gt;apart from Florida, they were Rodezno, Ulíbarri and Martínez Berasain, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why he was picked up by Franco; some suggest that Florida was among most "conspicuous" Carlists because of his Requeté recruitment activities.&lt;ref&gt;"con cargo preeminente en la dirección del Requeté", Maximiliano García Venero, ''Historia de la unificación'', Madrid 1970, p. 96. This argument does not seem convincing, since the man formally responsible for Requeté, [[Jose Luis Zamanillo Gonzalez-Camino|Jose Luis Zamanillo]], was actually ignored by the Franco headquarters. As to Rodezno, it seems that he and his entourage considered unification sort of a loose general alliance; he ensured his fellow partymen that unification means monarchy, regionalism and Catholicism. Some scholars are not sure whether Florida took part in the meeting, Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 288, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time Franco and his aides were already considering personal composition of executive of the state party just to be announced. Florida was not among the Carlists initially marked; presented by Franco with shortlisted candidates,&lt;ref&gt;there were 3 Carlists on the original list of candidates: Conde de Rodezno, Marcelino Ulibarri and Luis Arellano, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Rodezno suggested that [[Marcelino Ulibarri]] is dropped and one more seat is reserved for the Carlists, coming with the names of Florida and [[José María Mazón]].&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was accepted and on April 22 Dolz found himself among 4 Carlists nominated to a 10-member&lt;ref&gt;some scholars say there were 9 members, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; "Secretariado o Junta Política"&lt;ref&gt;''Boletin Oficial de la Provincia de Soría'' 28.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=3027541&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; of Falange Española Tradicionalista.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Of all its members he was perhaps the least-known one; among press-published short notes about the appointees, his was the shortest one.&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 29.04.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3103206&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|Terms of unification]] greatly disappointed many Carlists, including some of the Junta appointees;&lt;ref&gt;following publication of the Unification Decree some Carlists - Rodezno, Arellano, Ortigosa, Berasain - disgusted with its terms, visited Franco to voice their opinion; Florida was not among them, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; the regent was furious. In June the Carlist junteros asked him to authorize their presence in the Junta, but to no avail;&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009 , p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; later on all were expulsed from Comunión for breach of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;some scholars claim they were expulsed on July 18, 1937 - Ana Marín Fidaldo, Manuel M. Burgueño, ''In memoriam. Manuel J. Fal Conde (1894-1975)'', Sevilla 1980, p. 45; some claim the correct date is December 3, 1937, Garcia Venero 1970, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive or figurehead (1937-1939)==
[[File:Bandera FE JONS.png|thumbnail|left|Falangist standard]]
Frustrated by lack of the Falangist give and take in the Junta, some Carlists complained to Franco; the result were October 1937 nominations to another party body, a 50-member Consejo Nacional.&lt;ref&gt;''Boletin Oficial de la Provincia de Soría'' 26.10.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3028380&amp;presentacion=pagina here], César Alcalá, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biografía política (1901-1980)'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|8493109797}}, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Florida found himself among 12 Carlist nominees&lt;ref&gt;the nominees were not listed alphabetically, but in a specific order; Florida was among the last Carlists ranked. The sequence was as follows: 2. Rodezno, 6. [[Esteban de Bilbao Eguía|Bilbao]], 8. Muñoz Aguilar, 12. [[Joaquin Baleztena Ascarate|Baleztena]], 14. [[María Rosa Urraca Pastor|Urraca]], 17. [[Jose Maria Valiente Soriano|Valiente]], 23. Fal, 27. [[Jose Luis de Oriol y Uriguen|Oriol]], 29. Mazón, 32. Florida, 47. Arellano, 49. Toledo&lt;/ref&gt; and was already firmly mounted among highest-positioned civilians of the Francoist Spain, sitting in two bodies directing the only political organization allowed in the state.&lt;ref&gt;none of the sources consulted provided any insight into a meteoric rise of Florida; from a local Carlist jefe, inactive and with no particular skills demonstrated so far, he turned into one of the highest-positioned civilians in the Francoist state&lt;/ref&gt; However, many historians agree that both executive structures were rather decorative and that the entire party was at that stage a nascent structure, called into being to ensure that power stays with Franco and yet to acquire its later dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;compare Stanley G. Payne, ''Fascism in Spain'', Madison 1999, {{ISBN|9780299165642}}, especially chapters ''Francisco Franco and the formation of the Falange Española Tradicionalista'', pp. 239-272, and ''The FET during the Civil War'', pp. 273-39&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Carlists were enraged to find that what they supposed to be an organization they could control or at least influence was increasingly turning into a new version of Falange, with syndicalist blue-shirts systematically gaining the upper hand. Following unification Carlist rank-and-file started to bombard their leaders in Junta and in Consejo with complaints about getting sidetracked, asking for support. As recipient of these notes and phone calls Florida is recorded as pledging support; it is not clear whether he indeed intervened, though it is clear that nothing changed.&lt;ref&gt;José Antonio Parejo Fernández, ''Falangistas y requetés: historia de una absorción violenta'', [in:] María Encarna Nicolás Marín, Carmen González Martínez (eds.), ''Ayeres en discusión: temas clave de Historia Contemporánea'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788483717721}}, pp. 12-14, 16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Entrevista entre Franco y el conde Ciano en San Sebastián en julio de 1939.jpg|thumb|160px|Francoism, 1939]]
Throughout most of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] in public Florida maintained a loyal Francoist stand.&lt;ref&gt;apparently he remained also on very good terms with the military of the Burgos headquarters, as he was in position to issue recommendations regarding handling of foreign vounteers; it was thanks to his support that in August 1937 colonel [[Antonio Barroso y Sánchez-Guerra]] directed a certain Andre Radzivill, referred to as "Principe de Estado de Ucraina (Polonia Rusa)", to enlist to the 6. Navarrese Brigade, Jan Stanisław Ciechanowski, ''Polscy ochotnicy po stronie narodowej'', [in:] Jan Kieniewicz (ed.), ''Studia polsko-hiszpańskie. Wiek XX'', Warszawa 2004, {{ISBN|8392018028}}, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In newspapers he was quoted arguing in favor of the unification; according to him both Carlism and Falange were anti-democratic, anti-Liberal, anti-parliamentarian and Catholic, he claimed also that both supported monarchist solution, to be implemented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;''El Diario Palentino'' 28.02.38, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=2192141&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently he also tried to cultivate the Traditionalist format as much as he could, with some other FET executives attending sermons honoring Carlist kings [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]]&lt;ref&gt;''Azul'' 19.11.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=10&amp;path=2003792&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Alfonso Carlos]]&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Zamora'' 28.09.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=1000116311&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; or taking part in annual Carlist feast dedicated to Mártires de la Tradición, initially observed by the state party. On the other hand, he did not refrain from attending new-style events, like banquets in the [[Nazi]] headquarters in Salamanca.&lt;ref&gt;''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 30.11.37, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5048112&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he acted as FET Jefe Provincial in [[Salamanca (province)|Salamanca]],&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Zamora'' 28.03.38, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=2261949&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; typically one of the 3 most important civilian positions in every province;&lt;ref&gt;the other two were gobernador civil and alcalde of the province capital, Andreu Ginés i Sànchez, ''La instauració del franquisme al País Valencià'' [PhD thesis Universitat Pompeu Fabra], Barcelona 2008, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; it is not clear what exact dates of his term were.

Florida’s career at the top of the Francoist political strata came to the end in late summer of 1939. As late as in August he was still reported taking part in public events as consejero nacional,&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 13.07.39, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=3103656&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; but this changed in September; he did not find himself among appointees to the II Consejo Nacional and starting 1940 he was reported in the press simply as "Conde de la Florida".&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.03.40, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1940/03/12/012.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; None of the sources consulted offers any insight into his departure from the party executive, and specifically whether it was a fall from grace or a conscious decision to withdraw. It could have been resignation following disappointment with the syndicalist format of the new party; it could have been marginalization suffered as a result of an internal conflict, as it happened with [[Joaquín Bau]], another Carlist sidetracked by [[Ramón Serrano Suñer]],&lt;ref&gt;Joaquín Monserrat Cavaller, ''Joaquín Bau Nolla y la restauración de la Monarquía'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8487863949}}, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; especially that Florida publicly kept declaring inevitable restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;''El Diario Palentino'' 28.02.38, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=2192141&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political retirement and long senility (after 1939)==
[[File:RUMHE_logotype.jpg|thumb|left|RUMHE logotype]]
No longer in the top political flight, in the early 1940s Florida was still present in public life, e.g. taking part in Traditionalism-flavored feasts attended by some FET heavyweights.&lt;ref&gt;''El Progreso'' 12.03.40, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=3104332&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he was not appointed to the III Consejo Nacional&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 24.11.42, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1942/11/24/007.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and his political career seemed definitely over. This might not have been exactly the case, as in 1944 he was reported among governmental officials, namely noted as subsecretario de industria.&lt;ref&gt;''Imperio'' 27.02.44, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000119252&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; This was, however, definitely the last of his Francoist episodes; afterwards he was no longer mentioned related either to the party or to the government. He did not accept an olive branch from Carlism; in 1942 Fal declared that all those stained by Falangism might be re-admitted given they abandon their state party links; the offer explicitly excluded from the scheme some of the leaders, but Florida was not among them.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s he ventured to publicly demonstrate support for [[Ricardo Oreja]], his old-time fellow Mellista, when the latter succeeded in Madrid municipal elections.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 22.02.49, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1949/02/22/016.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though already at the retirement age, Florida remained active in a number of enterprises, mostly related to mineral resources and dependent businesses, like construction or pharmaceuticals; some of them, like RUMHE,&lt;ref&gt;RUMHE standing for Riqueza Urbana Madrileña Juan de Herrera, ''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 14.06.43, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=7148991&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; landed hefty contracts in prestigious locations, like the [[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Madrid Gran Vía]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 15.05.44, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;path=7149381&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he regularly featured in societé columns, attending aristocratic feasts related and unrelated to his own family. His political engagements were almost inexistent, except that he kept attending the Mártires de la Tradición sermons.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 11.03.56, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1956/03/11/072.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; This changed abruptly in the mid-1950s. In 1956 Florida was awarded [[Order of Civil Merit|Gran Cruz del Mérito Civil]], a very prestigious Francoist honor.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 18.07.56, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1956/07/18/036.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he was among 70-odd Carlists who concluded their longtime rapprochement with the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsist]] claimant, [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Don Juan]]. Satisfied that formal acceptance of Traditionalist principles rendered him fit for succession also from the Carlist perspective, they declared him the legitimate heir to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, p. 139, Vallverdu 2014, p. 157, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Florida, one of the most distinguished of the so-called "Estorilos", entered the claimant’s Consejo Privado, the post retained until the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 02.04.93, available [http://hemeroteca.sevilla.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1993/04/02/100.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as an octogenarian Florida kept attending social events, at times assuming unlikely roles; in 1962 he formed part of a jury at a female beauty contest.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 25.05.62, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1962/05/25/003.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained engaged in religious activities, in particular in ranks of Hermandad de Caballeros de San Juan Bautista y Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes;&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 16.12.63, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=18&amp;path=7150283&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally he presided over charity initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial de Lunes'' 10.02.64, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=19&amp;path=7150187&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Cautiously he kept admitting Traditionalist heritage; apart from cultural events like those dedicated to memory of Vázquez de Mella&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 27.02.58, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1958/02/27/041.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1960s he engaged in Hermandad de Cristo Rey de Requetés ex Combatientes, formally an organisation of Carlist Civil War combatants though in practice a Traditionalist bulwark in internal Carlist strife, aimed against a newly emergent [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|progressist faction]];&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 11.06.67, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1967/06/11/089.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; nothing indicates he was aware of the background and historians extensively discussing internal fragmentation of Carlism in the 1960s and 1970s do not mention his name.&lt;ref&gt;there are 3 PhD studies dealing with history of Carlism in the Francoist era, but except mentioning the 1957 Estoril episode, none of them mentions Florida, compare Martorell Pérez 2009, Ramón María Rodón Guinjoan, ''Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962–1977'', Pamplona 1997; {{ISBN|9788431315641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the late 1960s he kept cultivating the Juanista link;&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 07.05.67, available [http://hemeroteca-paginas.lavanguardia.com/LVE07/HEM/1967/05/07/LVG19670507-021.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s he was noted only as attending weddings of his grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 07.06.72, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1972/06/07/057.html here], ''ABC'' 09.10.73, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1973/10/09/058.html here], ''ABC'' 25.10.73, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1973/10/25/055.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vishwa Bandhu Gupta''', popularly known as '''Vishwa Bandhu''',  is an Indian [[social activist]] and a prominent leader in the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement.
He is a former [[Indian Revenue Service]] officer,&lt;ref name="Gupta suspend"&gt;Sarin, Ritu (21 June 2000) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140711160103/http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20000622/ifr22013.html Vishwa Bandhu Gupta suspended, threatens to `expose' I-T dept]. indianexpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; who previously served in the [[Income Tax Department]] and was suspended as [[List of Income Tax ranks in India|an additional Commissioner]]&lt;ref name="Gupta suspend"/&gt;

==Opposition of VDIS Scheme==
Gupta then working as an additional commissioner of Income Tax, made an allegation on an unnamed former Indian Cricket Captain to have declared ₹ 160000 Million in the Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme in 1997. However he was later suspended from his post on disciplinary grounds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/03onkar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youtube Interviews==
In a playlist of interviews widely viewed on YouTube, Mr. Gupta talks about various subjects related to corruption, political and scams in India. He is against the use of [[Cloud Computing]] and storage of user data in the Cloud.

It is evident that his videos consist not of fact but of misapprehensions of a baby boomer. Furthermore, the lack of understanding of technology is apparent in his interviews of cloud computing, where Mr. Gupta seems to believe, among other things, that data is stored in actual clouds in the sky and that data you store on your phone will be 'transmitted' into your phone's batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Cloud-computing-is-unreliable-in-a-storm-Former-I-T-commissioner/articleshow/9834345.cms], ''Times Of India''. 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; And he also said that for the case when the storm comes the data could be lost.The whole topic of Cloud Computing is explained wrongly by him.

The other interviews on his channel touch upon subjects like

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7864">The '''wrongful conviction of Steve Titus''' was a [[miscarriage of justice]] in which Steve Titus (1950–1986), an American businessman, was wrongly convicted of [[rape]]. Titus was fired from his job after the conviction and, though the charges were soon dismissed, he became long term unemployed.&lt;ref name=look&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/news/local/tituscase/lookingback.html |title=Looking back at Titus case|publisher= The Seattle Times|date= July 2, 1981|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime was later determined to have been committed by [[serial rapist]] Edward Lee King.  Journalist [[Paul Henderson (journalist)|Paul Henderson]] was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]] for his work on the case. [[Jack Olsen]]'s book ''Predator'' examined the investigation of the crime and the life of the real criminal.

On October 12, 1980, a female hitchhiker was raped in [[SeaTac, Washington]]. The assault took place south of [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]] on land owned by the [[Port of Seattle]]. [[Port of Seattle Police]] described the rapist as 25 to 30 years old, driving a royal blue car with temporary license plates and cloth seats, and having a beard.  The rape was reported to have taken place at 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.  The victim walked to a nearby house, and after approximately 10 minutes of conversation, called the police at 7:22&amp;nbsp;p.m.  There were tire prints found near the scene which matched that of a [[Michelin]] XYZ tire, which was standard on 1981 [[Honda Accord]] LX cars, a model that was first sold in September, 1980.  The victim reported that there was a large brown folder in the car and that the rapist wore a three piece suit.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times - tick of clock"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/news/local/tituscase/clock.html|title=Guilt in rape case may hang on the tick, tick, tick of clock|last=Henderson|first=Paul|date=May 29, 1981|publisher=Seattle Time Company|pages=Local News|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Titus was arrested and was later identified by the victim in a line-up.  Like the rapist, he had a beard.  He had a new car, a royal blue [[Chevrolet Chevette]].  However, the car had neither Michelin tires nor cloth seats.  The car had a large brown folder which Titus later claimed was planted in the car by the police.  He did not have any suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Heinz-Dietrich|title=The Pulitzer prize archive, Part 4|editor=Heinz-Dietrich Fischer|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1997|series=4|pages=256 of 304|chapter=Innocent Man Wrongly Convicted of Rape|isbn=9783598301704|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2SH89Ap_pOMC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=port+of+seattle+rape+titus#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:1977-1982 Honda Accord 01.jpg|thumb|A Honda Accord for illustrative purposes]]

Psychologist [[Elizabeth Loftus]] argued at trial that the victim had elicited a [[false memory]] of the attacker due to a biased line up. When shown a line up of suspects the victim had initially claimed that Steve Titus was the man who looked the most similar to the attacker. Later in court the victim said that she definitely knew it was him. Her perceptions had been changed throughout the process of going to court through cues which created a false memory.

At trial prosecution testimony was changed and evidence of innocence was explained away by prosecution experts and law enforcement officers. As a direct result, Titus was wrongly convicted of Rape in the First Degree, a crime that carried with it a [[mandatory prison sentence]].  Working with investigative reporter Paul Henderson of the Seattle Times, Titus' new attorney, Jeff Jones, whom Titus had hired to pursue an appeal of his conviction, was able to convince the trial judge to grant a new trial based upon evidence developed by Henderson, arguing  that Titus' trial attorney had been ambushed by surprise testimony which directly contradicted evidence contained in the Port of Seattle Police investigative reports. Subsequently, as a result of good police work by a local municipal police officer who had been following the new articles about the case, a lead was developed as to a new suspect.  That lead was followed up by the King County Sheriff's Office whose investigation led to the arrest of Edward Lee King, called by the pseudonym "Mac Smith" in [[Jack Olsen]]'s book ''Predator: Rape, Madness, and Injustice in Seattle'', who eventually confessed to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/946785-129/spencer-henderson-prison-titus-case-says |title=Washington State’s Wrongfully Convicted |last=Anderson |first=Rick |date=12 May 2013 |work=[[Seattle Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405015909/http://www.seattleweekly.com:80/home/946785-129/spencer-henderson-prison-titus-case-says |archive-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exculpatory evidence==
The timeline was an important factor in the case.  Titus left his parents home at 6:10 p.m on October 12, 1980 after attending his father's birthday party where there were other guests.  He was seen by a coffee shop waitress at 6:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the day of the rape.  The waitress at different times thought she had seen him at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.  Titus made a long distance telephone call from his apartment at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the day of the rape.  The distance between the rape scene and Titus' apartment would have required a journey-time of 19½ minutes according to a Seattle Times reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/news/local/tituscase/clock.html|title=Guilt in rape case may hang on the tick, tick, tick of clock|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=May 29, 1981|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These times would not have allowed Titus to be at the location where the victim was raped at the time she indicated the crime had occurred. He was convicted on March 4, and the conviction was overturned June 8. He only spent one night in jail after conviction.&lt;ref name=look/&gt;

After charges against him were dismissed, Titus sued the Port of Seattle and its Police Department, based upon evidence that their officers had changed and planted evidence, as well as convinced the victim to alter her testimony.&lt;ref name=look/&gt; Just before the trial, Titus died of a heart attack.  His parents settled and got $2 million to be paid over 20 years.  The policeman accused of fabricating evidence died six years later of a heart attack.  Paul Henderson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for his reporting on this  case and later became a private investigator specializing in freeing innocent people who have been wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.centurionministries.org/aboutus.html|title=Centurion Ministries Staff|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Olsen]] wrote a book entitled ''Predator: Rape, Madness, and Injustice in Seattle'' detailing both the railroading of Titus and the life of Edward Lee King, a convicted rapist who later confessed to this rape, and who is thought to have committed more than 50 rapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/26/books/rapist-at-large.html |title=Rapist at Large|author=Charles Salzberg|publisher=New York Times|date=May 26, 1991|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
