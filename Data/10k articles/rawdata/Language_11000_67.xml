The '''Bo language''', '''''Aka-Bo''''' (also known as ''Ba''), is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese]] language. It was spoken on the west central coast of [[North Andaman]]&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Radcliffe-Brown, Alfred R. (1922). ''The Andaman Islanders''. Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and on North Reef Island of the [[Andaman Islands]] in [[India]].

==Name==
The ''Aka-'' at the beginning of the language name is a common Great Andamanese prefix for words related to the [[tongue]], which includes language.&lt;ref name=Templ&gt;Temple, Richard C. (1902). ''A Grammar of the Andamanese Languages, being Chapter IV of Part I of the Census Report on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands''. Superintendent's Printing Press: Port Blair.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original size of the Bo tribe, by 1858, has been estimated at 200 individuals.&lt;ref name="weber7"&gt;George Weber (~2009), ''[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter7/text7.htm Numbers]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531230544/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter7/text7.htm |date=May 31, 2012 }}''. Chapter 7 in ''[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/text-group-BodyChapters.htm The Andamanese] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805204050/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/app-a/a-portman.htm |date=2012-08-05 }}''. Accessed on 2012-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they were discovered by the British only later, in the work leading to the 1901 census.&lt;ref name="weber7"/&gt; Like other [[Andamanese people]]s, the Bo were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, [[alcohol]], colonial warfare and loss of territory. The census of 1901 recorded only 48 individuals.&lt;ref name="gob"/&gt; Census takers were told that an epidemic had come from the neighboring [[Kari people|Kari]] and [[Kora people|Kora]] tribes, and the Bo had resorted to killing all of their own who showed symptoms.&lt;ref name="weber7"/&gt;  Their number was up to 62 in 1911, but then decreased to 16 in 1921 and only 6 in 1931.&lt;ref name="weber7"/&gt;

In 1949, any remaining Bo were relocated, with all other surviving Great Andamanese,  to a reservation on [[Bluff Island (Andaman)|Bluff island]].  In 1969 they were moved again to a reservation on Strait Island.&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;Rann Singh Mann (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FPX6wiuZ3ikC&amp;pg=PA149 Andaman and Nicobar Tribes Restudied: Encounters and Concerns], page 149.  Mittal Publications. {{ISBN|81-8324-010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1980 only three out of the 23 surviving Great Andamanese claimed to belong to the Bo tribe. By 1994 their numbers had grown to 15 (out of 40).&lt;ref name="gob"&gt;A. N. Sharma (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WEztW7c0CqQC&amp;pg=PA62 Tribal Development in the Andaman Islands]'', page 62. Sarup &amp; Sons, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, tribal identities became largely symbolic in the wake of the relocations.  By 2006 the cultural and linguistic identity of the tribe had all but disappeared, due to intermarriage and other factors. The last speaker of the Bo language, a woman named [[Boa Sr.|Boa Senior]], died at age 85 in late January, 2010.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;(2010) ''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7161422/Language-lost-as-last-member-of-Andaman-tribe-dies.html Language lost as last member of Andaman tribe dies]''.

===Extinction===

[[Boa Sr.]], the last person who remembered any Bo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamanese.net/generalia.html|title=GA Community|publisher=Vanishing Voices of the Great Andamanese (VOGA)|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; died on 26 January 2010, at the age of approximately 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamanese.net/BoaSr_Obituary.html|title=Obituary for Boa Sr.|publisher=Vanishing Voices of the Great Andamanese (VOGA)|accessdate=2010-02-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210000858/http://www.andamanese.net/BoaSr_Obituary.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boa Sr.'s mother, who died approximately forty years before her death, was the only living speaker of Bo for a long time.  Other members of the Great Andamanese speech community had difficulty understanding the songs and narratives which she knew in Bo.&lt;ref name="andamanese1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamanese.net/generalia.htm |title=People of Great Andamanese |publisher=Andamanese.net |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2010-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208214255/http://www.andamanese.net/generalia.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also spoke the Andamanese [[dialect]] of [[Hindi]], as well as [[Great Andamanese]], a mix of the ten indigenous languages of Andamans.

Boa Sr. worked with [[Anvita Abbi]], a professor of [[linguistics]] at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in [[Delhi]], since 2005. Abbi studied and recorded Boa's language and songs.&lt;ref name="andamanese1"/&gt;

Boa Sr. died at a hospital in [[Port Blair]] on 26 January 2010.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Boa Sr., who was approximately 85 years old, was the oldest living member of the Great Andamanese tribes at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Language lost as last member of Andaman tribe dies  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7161422/Language-lost-as-last-member-of-Andaman-tribe-dies.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=|date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boa Sr.'s death left just 52&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; surviving Great Andamanese people in the world, none of whom remembers any Bo. Their population is greatly reduced from the estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living in the Andaman Islands at the time of the arrival of the British in 1858.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

[[Stephen Corry]], director of the [[United Kingdom|British]]-based [[NGO]] [[Survival International]], issued a statement saying, "With the death of Boa Sr. and the extinction of the Bo language, a unique part of human society is now just a memory. Boa's loss is a bleak reminder that we must not allow this to happen to the other tribes of the Andaman Islands."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Watt|title=Ancient tribal language becomes extinct as last speaker dies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/04/ancient-language-extinct-speaker-dies|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=|date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Narayan Choudhary also explained what the loss of Boa Sr. meant in both academic and personal terms, "Her loss is not just the loss of the Great Andamanese community, it is a loss of several disciplines of studies put together, including [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[history]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]]. To me, Boa Sr. epitomised a totality of humanity in all its hues and with a richness that is not to be found anywhere else."

==Grammar==
The Great Andamanese languages are [[agglutinative]] languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system.&lt;ref name=Templ&gt;Temple, Richard C. (1902). ''A Grammar of the Andamanese Languages, being Chapter IV of Part I of the Census Report on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands''. Superintendent's Printing Press: Port Blair.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a distinctive [[noun class]] system based largely on body parts, in which every [[noun]] and [[adjective]] may take a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the [[tongue]].&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;  An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of ''yop'', "pliable, soft", in Aka-Bea:&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt; 
*A [[cushion]] or [[sponge]] is ''ot-yop'' "round-soft", from the prefix attached to words relating to the head or heart.
*A [[Walking stick|cane]] is ''ôto-yop'', "pliable", from a prefix for long things.
*A [[wikt:stick|stick]] or [[pencil]] is ''aka-yop'', "pointed", from the tongue prefix.
*A fallen [[tree]] is ''ar-yop'', "rotten", from the prefix for [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s or upright things.
Similarly, ''beri-nga'' "good" yields:
*''un-bēri-ŋa'' "clever" (hand-good).
*''ig-bēri-ŋa'' "sharp-sighted" (eye-good).
*''aka-bēri-ŋa'' "good at languages" (tongue-good.)
*''ot-bēri-ŋa'' "virtuous" (head/heart-good)

The prefixes are,

{| class=wikitable
! !!Bea !!Balawa? !!Bajigyâs? !!Juwoi !!Kol
|-
!head/heart
| ot- ||ôt- ||ote- ||ôto- ||ôto-
|-
!hand/foot 
|ong- ||ong- ||ong- ||ôn- ||ôn-
|-
!mouth/tongue 
|âkà- ||aka- ||o- ||ókô- ||o-
|-
!torso (shoulder to shins) 
|ab- ||ab- ||ab- ||a- ||o-
|-
!eye/face/arm/breast 
|i-, ig- ||id- ||ir- ||re- ||er-
|-
!back/leg/butt 
|ar- ||ar- ||ar- ||ra- ||a-
|-
!waist 
|ôto-
|}

Body parts are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], requiring a [[possessive adjective]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] to complete them, so one cannot say "head" alone, but only "my, or his, or your, etc. head".

The basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):
{| class=wikitable
| I, my
| ''d-''
| we, our
| ''m-''
|-
| thou, thy
| ''ŋ-''
| you, your
| ''ŋ-''
|-
| he, his, she, her, it, its
| ''a''
| they, their
| ''l-''
|}

'This' and 'that' are distinguished as ''k-'' and ''t-''. 

Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s &amp;mdash; [[1 (number)|one]] and [[2 (number)|two]] &amp;mdash; and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;

'''Akkademja tal-Malti''' was the prime  regulatory body responsible for the [[Maltese language]] from the early 20th century up to the end of the millennium, when a Government sponsored law was passed to protect issues related to the national language. On joining the [[European Union]], Maltese became one of the recognised languages of the EU - no mean achievement for a language spoken by less than half a million people.

Initially it was known as ''L-Għaqda tal-Kittieba tal-Malti'' (Association of Writers of Maltese), [[Malta]]'s oldest literary society whose earliest activities go as far back as the early nineteen twenties, led by literary giants like [[Dun Karm]], [[Ġużè Muscat Azzopardi]] and Ninu Cremona, it spearheaded the cause of the Maltese language. The Akkademja was mainly responsible for all the major linguistic and literary development of the Maltese language during the past century, developing linguistic academic initiatives which culminated in the national recognition of a standard written Maltese.

In 2005 the [[National Council for the Maltese Language]] was set up through a Law by the Maltese Parliament.  This Council is nowadays the main regulatory body of the Maltese language instead of the L-Akkademja tal-Malti.

An '''altered chord''' is a [[chord (music)|chord]] in which one or more notes from the [[diatonic scale]] is replaced with a neighboring pitch from the [[chromatic scale]]. According to the broadest definition any chord with a nondiatonic chord tone is an altered chord, while the simplest use of altered chords is the use of [[borrowed chord|borrowed chords]], chords borrowed from the [[parallel key]], and the most common is the use of [[secondary dominant]]s. As Alfred Blatter explains,"An altered chord occurs when one of the standard, functional chords is given another quality by the modification of one or more components of the chord."&lt;ref&gt;Blatter, Alfred (2007). ''Revisiting Music Theory: A Guide to the Practice'', p.186. {{ISBN|0-415-97440-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, altered notes may be used as [[leading tone]]s to emphasize their diatonic neighbors. Contrast this with [[Extended chord|chord extensions]]: 

{{quote|Whereas chord extension generally involves adding notes that are logically implied, chord alteration involves changing some of the typical notes. This is usually done on [[dominant chord]]s, and the four alterations that are commonly used are the {{music|b}}5, {{music|#}}5, {{music|b}}9 and {{music|#}}9. Using one (or more) of these notes in a resolving dominant chord greatly increases the bite in the chord and therefore the power of the [[resolution (music)|resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Noah Baerman|Baerman, Noah]] (1998). ''Complete Jazz Keyboard Method: Intermediate Jazz Keyboard'', p.70. {{ISBN|0-88284-911-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In [[jazz harmony]], chromatic alteration is either the addition of notes not in the scale or expansion of a [chord] progression by adding extra non-diatonic chords.&lt;ref name="Arkin"&gt;Arkin, Eddie (2004). ''Creative Chord Substitution for Jazz Guitar'', p.42. {{ISBN|0-7579-2301-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "A C major scale with an added D{{music|sharp}} note, for instance, is a chromatically altered scale" while, "one bar of Cmaj&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; moving to Fmaj&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; in the next bar can be chromatically altered by adding the ii and V of Fmaj&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; on the second two beats of bar" one. Techniques include the [[ii-V-I turnaround]], as well as movement by half-step or minor third.&lt;ref name="Arkin 43"&gt;Arkin (2004), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Altered_chord_progression_jazz.png|frameless|400x400px]]

The five most common types of altered dominants are: V{{music|+}}, V{{sup|7}}&lt;sup&gt;{{music|sharp}}5&lt;/sup&gt; (both raised fifths), V{{sup|{{music|b}}5}}, V{{sup|7}}&lt;sup&gt;{{music|flat}}5&lt;/sup&gt; (both lowered fifths), and V{{music|halfdim}}{{sup|7}} (lowered fifth and third).&lt;ref&gt;Benward and Saker (2009), p.193.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=345|caption=A chord progression with chords borrowed from the [[parallel minor]]}}"Borrowing" of this type is seen in music from the [[Renaissance music]] era and the [[Baroque music]] era (1600–1750), such as with the use of the [[Picardy third]], in which a piece in a minor key has a final or intermediate cadence in the tonic major chord. "Borrowing" is also common in 20th century [[popular music]] and [[rock music]].

For example, in music in a major key, such as C major, composers and songwriters may use a B{{music|b}} major chord, which is "borrowed" from the key of C minor (where it is the VII chord). Similarly, in music in a minor key, composers and songwriters often "borrow" chords from the tonic major. For example, pieces in C minor often use F major and G major (IV and V chords), which are "borrowed" from the key of C major.

More advanced types of altered chords were used by [[Romantic music]] era composers in the 19th century, such as [[Chopin]] and by [[jazz]] composers and improvisers in the 20th and 21st century. For example, the [[chord progression]] on the left uses four unaltered chords, while the progression on the right uses an altered IV chord and is an alteration of the previous progression:&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;[[Robert Erickson|Erickson, Robert]] (1957).

According to one definition, "when a chord is chromatically altered, and the thirds remain large [major] or small [minor], and is not used in [[modulation (music)|modulation]], it is an altered chord."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Kenneth McPherson (1908).

C. F. Summy. {{pre-ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another, "all chords... having a major third, i.e., either triads, sevenths, or ninths, with the fifth chromatically raised or chromatically lowered, are altered chords," while triads with a single altered note are considered, "changes of form &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[chord quality|quality]]]," rather than alteration.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Homer Albert (1895). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FMYPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA52&amp;dq=%22altered+chord%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji6_jO2KXVAhXKhFQKHepgB88Q6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22altered%20chord%22&amp;f=false Practical Harmony on a French Basis, Volume 2]'', p.48. H.B. Stevens. {{pre-ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to composer [[Percy Goetschius]], "Altered... chords contain one or more tones written with [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] ({{music|#}}, {{music|b}}, or {{music|natural}}) and therefore foreign to the scale in which they appear, but nevertheless, from their connections and their effect, obviously belonging to the principal key of their [[phrase (music theory)|phrase]]."&lt;ref name="Goetschius"&gt;[[Percy Goetschius|Goetschius, Percy]] (1889).

G. Schirmer. {{pre-ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Franko Goldman]] argues that, once one accepts, "the variability of the scale," the concept of altered chords becomes unnecessary: "In reality, there is nothing 'altered' about them; they are entirely natural elements of a single key system,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Franko Goldman|Goldman, Richard Franko]] (1965). ''Harmony in Western Music'', p.83-4. Barrie &amp; Jenkins. {{ISBN|0-214-66680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is, "not necessary," to use the term as each 'altered chord' is, "simply one of the possibilities regularly existing and employed."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman (1965), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Haerle]] argues that only fifths and ninths may be altered, as all other alterations may be interpreted as an unaltered chord tone or, enharmonically, as an altered fifth or ninth (for example, {{music|#}}1 = {{music|b}}9 and {{music|b}}4 = 3).&lt;ref name="Haerle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alfred"&gt;Alfred Music (2013).

''The New Real Book Volume Two'', {{page needed|date=July 2017}}.

In practice, many [[fake book]]s do not specify all the alterations; the chord is typically just labelled as G&lt;sup&gt;7alt&lt;/sup&gt;, and the alteration of 9ths, 11ths and 13ths is left to the artistic discretion of the comping musician. The use of chords labeled "G&lt;sup&gt;7alt&lt;/sup&gt;" can create challenges in jazz ensembles where more than one chordal instrument are playing chords (e.g., a large band with an electric guitar player and a [[Hammond organ]] player), because the guitarist might interpret a G&lt;sup&gt;7alt&lt;/sup&gt; chord as containing a {{music|b}}9 and {{music|b}}13, whereas the organ player may interpret the same chord as containing a {{music|#}}9 and a {{music|natural}}13; this can lead to clashing harmonies. To deal with this issue, bands with more than one chordal instrument may work out the alt chord [[Voicing (music)|voicings]] beforehand or alternate playing of choruses.

The choice of [[Inverted chord|inversion]], or the omission of certain tones within the chord (e.g. omitting the root, common in jazz harmony and chord voicings), can lead to many different possible colorings, substitutions, and [[enharmonic|enharmonic equivalents]]. Altered chords are ambiguous harmonically, and may play a variety of roles, depending on such factors as voicing, [[modulation (music)|modulation]], and [[voice leading]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">'''Anna Myrberg''' ([[Norberg]], May 9, 1878 - [[Stockholm]], April 1, 1931) was a [[Swedish language|Swedish]] author and song lyricist.&lt;ref name="Persson 1984"&gt;Lena Persson’s foreword in ''Svarta Maskens Dårdikter: samt humoresker och slagdängor i urval'' (Stockholm: Prisma, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Anna Myrberg 002.jpg|thumb|275px|Anna Myrberg]]
Much of Myrberg's writing appeared under the pseudonym of '''Svarta Masken''' (The Black Mask).  After training to be a photoengraver, she found work at a photography studio and a [[Stockholm]] newspaper.  Her debut as a poet was the 1919 collection ''Svarta Maskens Dårdikter'' (The Black Mask’s Idiot Poems).  She published several volumes of poetry and humor,&lt;ref name="Persson 1984"/&gt; including two books about Willy Anderson, a boy from the south side of [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;''Svärjes historia: upptekknad i kårta drag av södergrabben Ville Andeson'' by Anna Myrberg, (Stockholm: Åhlén &amp; Åkeslund, 1923).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ville Andeson blir pracktisk'' by Anna Myrberg, (Stockholm: Bonnier, 1929).&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these was filmed as the 1929 movie “Ville Andesons Äventyr” (Willy Anderson’s Adventure). She also contributed articles and poems to the humor magazine ''Kasper''.&lt;ref name="Persson 1984"/&gt;

Myrberg wrote the lyrics for the well-known songs ''Lördagsvalsen'' (The Saturday Waltz) and ''Livet I Finnskogarna'' (Life in the Finnish Woods). 
Her works were recorded in America by [[Gustav Fonandern]], [[Arvid Franzen]], Olle i Gråthult and the [[Hjalmar Peterson Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic music on records: a discography of ethnic recordings produced in the United States, 1893-1942'' by Richard K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3529">'''Ariel Sands''' is the pseudonymous author of ''Never the Face'',&lt;ref name=ntf&gt;{{cite book|last=Sands|first=Ariel|title=Never the Face|year=2011|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-56386-8|pages=208|url=http://us.macmillan.com/nevertheface/ArielSands}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a [[sadomasochistic]] novel, who is also said to be an internationally known writer of non-fiction under another name. Her true identity is not publicly known.

==Never the Face==
''Never the Face'' describes a sadomasochistic relationship between a man, David, and the book's narrator, a woman identified only as "Kitten" or "Bitch". In the novel, David trains Kitten to be the [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] partner in a sexual relationship that includes [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], [[orgasm denial|orgasm control]] and beating her with a variety of implements. What begins as a consensual relationship spirals into increasing physical and emotional abuse. The book contains explicit sexual imagery that has been described as "brutal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendzlik|first=Jennifer|title=Never the Face: A Story of Desire by Ariel Sands|url=http://jenniferhendzlik.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/never-the-face-a-story-of-desire-by-ariel-sands/|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in April 2011 by [[St Martin's Press]].

==Identity==
To date the chief clues to Sands' identity are in an interview she gave to [[Claire Messud]] for [[Guernica Magazine|''Guernica'']] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Messud|first=Claire|title=Never the Face|url=http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/2768/ariel_sands_6_15_11/|accessdate=30 December 2011|newspaper=Guernica|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Messud, who met Sands in person in Berlin in May 2011, "under another name, Ariel Sands is an internationally known and highly respected writer of nonfiction." (She does not specify whether this other name is a real name or also a pseudonym.) Sands is "slight and elegant" but with "a commanding presence: in her professional capacity, she is accustomed to speaking before crowds." Both her fiction and non-fiction writing, as well as her speech, are characterized by "acerbic wit", "erudition" and "concision". Her "demeanor is formal, sometimes clipped; but she has a ready, throaty laugh". She is "feminist by her own admission" and a "female success story" despite the "obsessive submissiveness" of her novel's protagonist. She is "on the cusp of forty". The interview does not mention her nationality.

Her publisher's website describes her only as a "bestelling author".&lt;ref name=ntf /&gt;

==Reasons for pseudonymity==
In her interview with Messud, Sands says that she chose a pseudonym to avoid "genre confusion" with her non-fiction writing, and so that the text "would be taken on its own terms", rather than influenced by what readers already knew about the author.

==Influences==
Books that Sands mentions as influencing hers include [[The Story of O]], [[Venus in Furs]], [[Moby-Dick]], [[The Man of Feeling]], and [[The Emigrants (Sebald novel)|The Emigrants]].

'''Barada Charan Gupta''' was part of the short-lived but influential ''[[Sabujpatra]]'' group of writers in colonial Bengal that published its journal from 1922 to 1927.
His parents were residents of [[Gayeshpur]] (which now in [[East Bengal]], [[Bangladesh]]). Barada was a geologist, and was the second son and third child of Durga Charan Gupta. He had one brother and two sisters.

==Work==
After completing his education from the [[Jadavpur University#National Council of Education.2C Bengal|National Council of Education West Bengal]] (the first nationalistic technical institute), he joined the Geological Survey of India working with Mr. Heron, the geologist in the capacity of field supervisor. At GSI he was involved in field surveys for mineral resource of India and traveled extensively across the country, staying in different states like Bihar, Rajputana, Orissa in places like  Mewar, Jaisagar and Telinagar etc. His surveys included the examination of the [[Tungsten|wolfram]] deposit in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and the granite sheet jointing and quartzite ridge survey in the [[Aravalli Range]], which are still used. 
The evidence of his detailed study on the field of rocks and minerals can be found in the different memoirs published at that time by the GSI and other field notes now in possession of his family.&lt;ref&gt;Memoir of Geological Survey of India Volume LXV,Part II (Published by Government of India 1934), personal notes and memorandum dated 1948 onward.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalist Politics==
As a [[Gandhism|Gandhian]], Barada Gupta learned to use the [[Spinning wheel#Charkha|charkha]] spinning wheel to make bundles of thread, which his wife Nanibala Gupta also practiced. According to his sons and daughters, when the family went shopping for Puja clothes, he insisted on [[khādī]] and he would sweep aside the imported colourful, soft, shimmering, fabrics.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

He was awarded the [[Rai Saheb]] Title from the British Government for visionary leadership and exemplary service to the nation. But Gupta declined the title and discouraged people from even mentioning it.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Gupta was part of a movement that aimed to disprove the label of [[effeminacy]] that the British had imposed upon the Bengalis. Centres of physical training, wrestling and yoga had come up all over Bengal, with the militant [[Swadeshi]] movement often operating out of these. Gupta was part of a group that claimed that the regeneration of masculinity was critical to the spirit of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Indira|title=Frail Hero and Virile History|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195655311|id= {{ASIN|0195655311|country=in}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also promoted youth sports. Along with his hectic work schedule which involved an average of  6 months of touring per year, he initiated and organized an annual football event, the Tarini Charan Memorial Shield, where players from adjoining states would travel to [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]]. Tarini Charan, whose name the shield bore, had sponsored his school education when Gupta lost his father at a young age.

==Literary interests==
Gupta was a member of the ''[[Sabujpatra]]'' group.&lt;ref&gt;http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/handle/10689/1753&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in the ''Cholitobhasha'', or [[Bengali language#Spoken and literary varieties|Standard Colloquial Bengali]] dialect that was showcased and promoted by ''Sabujpatra'' and which is today the standard Bengali writing style. Gupta authored the essay 'Samajik Sahitya'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Baroda Charan|title=Samajik Sahitya|url=http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120190/226408/002|work=Sabuj Patra|publisher=South Asian Archive.com|accessdate=10 February 2015|pages=687–693|language=Bengali}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in Volume V, Issue 12 of ''Sabujpatra'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120190/226408&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to the different volumes of ''Sabujpatra'' and some new prose was collected and published as Shashwata Tarun, to which [[Pramatha Chowdhury]] wrote the Introduction and [[Rabindranath Tagore]] the foreword. Gupta authored a second book which is preserved in its manuscript form.

Barada Charan Gupta died on December 20, 1955 at the early age of 62 due to a sudden cardiac failure while taking his regular early morning walk.

The '''Bartangi language''' is a [[Pamir languages|Pamir language]] spoken along the [[Bartang River]] from [[Yemtz]] to [[Nikbist]], in [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]]. It is typically classified as a dialect of [[Shughni language|Shughni]], but is quite distinct. Within Bartangi, there are two (sub)dialects, Basid and Sipandzh, which are named after the villages in which they are spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolga|first1=Margus|title=The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire|date=2001|publisher=Tallinn|url=http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/bartangs.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not written. 

As of 1990, there are between 2,500{{cn|date=May 2015}} and 3,000 speakers of Bartangi. While the population continues to grow, civil war and Russian efforts to assimilate the Bartangi or move them to cities have caused the language to dwindle. In addition, the popularity of [[Tajik language|Tajik]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as the languages of education and modernization have contributed to the decline of Bartangi.

Bartangi is most similar to [[Rushani dialect|Rushani]] and [[Orosori dialect|Orosori]], two neighboring Sughni dialects.  Features that distinguish them include the form of the second person{{fix|text=inflection? pronoun?}}, a ''tu'' tense in Bartangi,{{what|date=May 2015}} and the Bartangi plural suffix ''-en''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bartangi|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bartangi-a-member-of-the-sugni-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and decline==
The language was unknown to Europe until the early twentieth century, when French linguist Robert Gauthiot published his findings on the area in his 1916 essay ''Notes sur le yazgoulami, dialecte iranien des confins du Pamir.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolga|first1=Margus|title=The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire|url=http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/bartangs.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the discovery of the Bartangi people, there was an increase in interest in the Shughni provinces, but due to the difficult landscape, very few explorers visited the area, and publications on the language dropped off, though in 1924 a Bartangi lullaby was printed. 

The next major European involvement in the area was by the Russians, who over the course of the nineteenth century had conquered parts of [[Tajikistan]] until its formal declaration as the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1929. Despite Tajikistan declaring independence in 1991, permanent Russian influence in language, culture, and politics have led to the loss of several Pamir languages. Tajik, an Iranian language which is the national language of Tajikistan, serves as a common language through all Tajik provinces. In addition, with a 96% literacy rate throughout the province, even the isolated region of Bartang is well-versed in the national languages of Tajik, Uzbek, and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jernudd|first1=Bjorn|title=The Language Situation in Tadzhik SSR|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|date=1965|volume=7|issue=3|pages=76–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian is currently the language of education and the intelligentsia in Tajikistan, and the influence of these larger languages are required for communication between speakers of the various Pamir languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jernudd|first1=Bjorn|title=The Language Situation in Tadzhik SSR|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|date=1965|volume=7|issue=3|pages=76–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

War has also contributed to substantial decline of the Shughni languages, and Bartangi is no exception. World War II, conflicts between Shughni villages, and the civil war which ravished the province from 1992 to 1997, all contributed to the diminishing status of the language. In addition to wiping out portions of the population, the war forced many of the Pamir inhabitants out of their native lands and into cities, where their languages are of little use. The 1950s also saw massive resettlement of Bartang people, though the population has been increasing since 1959.

'''Befunge''' is a [[stack-oriented programming language|stack-based]], [[Reflection (computer science)|reflective]], [[esoteric programming language]]. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid. "Arrow" instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle. It has been described as "a cross between [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] and [[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cantor.res.cmu.edu/bozeman/befunge/beffaq.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417044912/http://cantor.res.cmu.edu/bozeman/befunge/beffaq.html |title=The Befunge FAQ v.4|archivedate=2001-04-17|date=1997-11-04|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The language was originally created by [[Chris Pressey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esolangs.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Pressey&amp;oldid=13199 |title=Chris Pressey |date=2008-12-18 |website=Esolang |author=Ais523 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993 for the Amiga, as an attempt to devise a language which is as hard to compile as  possible. Note that the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; command allows for [[self-modifying code]]. Nevertheless, a number of [[compiler]]s have subsequently been written. A number of extensions to the original "Befunge-93" specification also exist, most notably Funge-98, which extends the concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions and can be multithreaded, with multiple instruction pointers operating simultaneously on the same space. Befunge-extensions and variants are called ''Fungeoids'' or just ''[[Funge]]s''.

The Befunge-93 specification restricts each valid program to a grid of 80 instructions horizontally by 25 instructions vertically. Program execution which exceeds these limits [[integer overflow|"wraps around"]] to a corresponding point on the other side of the grid; a Befunge program is in this manner [[Topology|topologically]] equivalent to a [[torus]]. Since a Befunge-93 program can only have a single stack and its storage array is bounded, the Befunge-93 language is not [[Turing-complete]] (however, it has been shown that Befunge-93 is Turing Complete with unbounded stack word size).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esolangs.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Befunge&amp;oldid=38327 |title=Talk:Befunge |website=Esolang |date=2014-01-18 |author=Oerjan |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later Funge-98 specification provides [[Turing completeness]] by removing the size restrictions on the program; rather than wrapping around at a fixed limit, the movement of a Funge-98 instruction pointer follows a model dubbed "Lahey-space" after its originator, Chris Lahey. In this model, the grid behaves like a torus of finite size with respect to wrapping, while still allowing itself to be extended indefinitely.

== Compilation ==
As stated, the design goal for Befunge was to create a language which was difficult to compile. This was attempted with the implementation of self-modifying code (the 'p' instruction can write new instructions into the playfield) and a multi-dimensional playfield (the same instruction can be executed in four different directions).

Nevertheless, these obstacles have been overcome, to some degree, and Befunge compilers have been written using appropriate techniques.

The bef2c compiler included with the standard Befunge-93 distribution uses [[threaded code]]: each instruction is compiled to a snippet of C code, and control flows through the snippets just as it does in a Befunge interpreter (that is, conditionally on the value of some 'direction' register). This does not result in a significant advantage over a good interpreter. Note that the bef2c compiler is not correct since it does not handle either 'p' or string mode, but it would not be impossible to make it do so (although the C language might not be well-suited for this).

The [[Betty (compiler)|Betty compiler]], for example, treats every possible straight line of instructions as a subprogram, and if a 'p' instruction alters that subprogram, that subprogram is recompiled. This is an interesting variation on [[just-in-time compilation]], and it results in a much better advantage over an interpreter, since many instructions can be executed in native code without making intervening decisions on the 'direction' register.

== Sample Befunge-93 code ==
The technique of using arrows to change control flow is demonstrated in the random number generator program below.  The Befunge instruction pointer begins in the upper left corner and will travel to the right if not redirected.  Following the arrows around, the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; instructions send the instruction pointer in random cardinal directions until the pointer hits a digit, pushing it to the stack. Then the arrows navigate to the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; to output the digit from the stack and return the pointer to the first directional randomiser. There is no &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; to terminate this program, so it produces an endless stream of random numbers from 1 to 9.
&lt;source lang="befunge"&gt;
 v&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;v
  12345
  ^?^
 &gt; ? ?^
  v?v
  6789
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; v
 ^    .&lt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The following code is an example of the classic [[Hello world program|"Hello World!" program]]. First the letters "olleH" are pushed onto the stack as [[ASCII]] numbers. These are then popped from the stack in [[LIFO (computing)|LIFO]] order and output as text characters to give "Hello". A space is character number 32 in ASCII, which here is constructed by multiplying 4 and 8, before being output as text. The remaining code then outputs "World!" in a similar way, followed by ASCII character 10 (a [[line feed]] character, moving the output cursor to a new line).
&lt;source lang="befunge"&gt;
&gt;              v
v  ,,,,,"Hello"&lt;
&gt;48*,          v
v,,,,,,"World!"&lt;
&gt;25*,@
&lt;/source&gt;
The following code is a slightly more complicated version. It adds the ASCII character 10 (a [[line feed]] character) to the stack, and then pushes "!dlrow ,olleH" to the stack. Again, [[LIFO (computing)|LIFO]] ordering means that "H" is now the top of the stack and will be the first printed, "e" is second, and so on. To print the characters, the program enters a [[Control flow#Loops|loop]] that first duplicates the top value on the stack (so now the stack would look like "[[line feed|\n]]!dlrow ,olleHH"). Then the "_" operation will pop the duplicated value, and go right if it's a zero, left otherwise. (This assumes a compliant interpreter that "returns" 0 when popping an empty stack.) When it goes left, it pops and prints the top value as an [[ASCII]] character. It then duplicates the next character and loops back to the "_" test, continuing to print the rest of the stack until it is empty and so the next value popped is 0, at which point "@" ends the program.
&lt;source lang="befunge"&gt;
 &gt;25*"!dlrow ,olleH":v
                  v:,_@
                  &gt;  ^
&lt;/source&gt;

Most one-dimensional programming languages require some syntactic distinction between [[comment (computer programming)|comment text]] and [[source code]] &amp;mdash; although that distinction may be as trivial as [[Brainfuck]]'s rule that any character not in the set &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;+-[]&lt;&gt;,.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a comment. Languages like [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] treat strings as comments in contexts where the values are not used. Similarly, in Befunge, there is no comment syntax: to embed documentation in the code, the programmer simply routes the control flow ''around'' the "comment" area, so that the text in that area is never executed.

'''Crimean Tatar''' ({{lang|crh-Cyrl|Къырымтатар тили}}, {{lang|crh-Latn|Qırımtatar tili}}), also called '''Crimean Turkish'''&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; or simply '''Crimean''' ({{lang|crh-Cyrl|Къырым тили}}, {{lang|crh-Latn|Qırım tili}}),&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; is a [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language spoken in [[Crimea]] and the [[Crimean Tatar diaspora]]s of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as small communities in the United States and Canada. It should not be confused with [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and adjacent regions in [[Russia]]; the languages are related, but belong to two different subgroups of the [[Kipchak languages]] and thus are not [[mutually intelligible]]. Crimean Tatar arrived in the 13th century with the Mongol [[Golden Horde]], succeeding the [[Crimean Greeks|Crimean Greek]] and [[Crimean Gothic]] [[Principality of Theodoro]], and continued through the 15th–18th century [[Crimean Khanate]] period. Though only distantly related, it has been extensively influenced by nearby [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz Turkic languages]] such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]].

==Number of speakers==
Today, more than 260,000 Crimean Tatars live in [[Crimea]]. Approximately 150,000 reside in Central Asia (mainly in [[Uzbekistan]]), where their ancestors had been exiled in 1944 during World War II by the Soviet Union. However, of all these people, mostly the older generations are the only ones still speaking Crimean Tatar.&lt;ref name=e16&gt;{{e16|crh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the language was estimated to be on the brink of extinction, being taught in only around 15 schools in Crimea. Turkey has provided support to Ukraine, to aid in bringing the schools teaching in Crimean Tatar to a modern state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avrupatimes.com/culture/3676-crimean-tatar-language-in-danger.html Crimean Tatar language in danger], ''Avrupa Times,'' 02/19/2013&lt;/ref&gt;
An estimated 5 million people of Crimean origin live in Turkey, descendants of those who emigrated in the 19th and early 20th centuries.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Of these an estimated 2,000 still speak the language.&lt;ref name=e16/&gt; Smaller Crimean Tatar communities are also found in Romania (22,000), Bulgaria (6,000), and the United States.&lt;ref name=e16/&gt; Crimean Tatar is one of the seriously endangered languages in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_report.html#Crimean|title=Tapani Salminen, UNESCO Red Book on Endangered Languages: Europe, September 1999|work=University of Helsinki, Finland|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all Crimean Tatars are bilingual or multilingual, using as their first language the dominant languages of their respective home countries, such as Russian, Turkish, Romanian, Uzbek, Bulgarian or Ukrainian.

==Classification and dialects==

Crimean Tatar is conventionally divided into three main dialects: northern, middle and southern.

The middle dialect is spoken in the [[Crimean Mountains]] by the sedentary ''Tat'' Tatars (should not be confused with the [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]] which speak an [[Iranic language]]). The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on Tat Tatar because the Tat Tatars comprise a relative majority.

Standard Crimean Tatar and its middle dialect classified as a language of the Cuman ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-половецкая}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]] and the closest relatives are [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Karaim language|Karaim]], [[Krymchak language|Krymchak]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Urum language|Urum]] and extinct [[Cuman language|Cuman]].

However, two other unwritten dialects of Crimean Tatar belong to two different groups or subgroups of the Turkic languages.

The northern dialect (also known as steppe or Nogay) is spoken by the ''Noğay'' ethnic subgroup, the former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean (Nogay) steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Lower Volga]]). This dialect belongs to the Nogay ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-ногайская}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]]. This subgroups also includes [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Nogai language|Nogai]] proper. It is thought that the Nogays of the Crimea and the Nogais of the Caucasus and Volga are of common origin from the [[Nogai Horde]], which is reflected in their common name and very closely related languages. In the past some speakers of this dialects also called themselves ''Qıpçaq'' (that is Cumans).

The southern or coastal dialects is spoken by ''Yalıboylu'' ("coastal dwellers") who have traditionally lived on the southern coast of the Crimea. Their dialects belongs to the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] group of the Turkic languages which includes [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. This dialect is most heavily influenced by Turkish.

Thus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three "dialects" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman origin, is in fact combine elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.

=== Volga Tatar ===
Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language. However, Tatar spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and the Volga-Ural region of Russian belongs to the different Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroup of the Kipchak languages, and its closet relative is [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]. Both Volga Tatar and Bashkir differ notably from Crimean Tatar, particularly because of the [[Tatar language#Historical shifts|specific Volga-Ural Turkic vocalism and historical shifts]].

==History==
The formation period of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions of Crimea by [[Cuman]]s and [[Pecheneg]]s and ended during the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].

In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.

In 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] based on the [[Latin script]]. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was replaced in 1938 by a [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]]. During the 1990s and 2000s, the government of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea under Ukraine encouraged replacing the script with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic has still been widely used (mainly in published literature, newspapers and education). The current Latin-based Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]], with two additional characters: [[Ñ]] ñ and [[Q]] q. Currently, in the Russian Republic of Crimea all official communications and education in Crimean Tatar are conducted exclusively in the Cyrillic alphabet.&lt;ref name="LangLaw2017"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://crimea.gov.ru/textdoc/ru/7/act/1562prz.pdf Закон Республики Крым «О государственных языках Республики Крым и иных языках в Республике Крым»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimean Tatar was the native language of the poet [[Bekir Çoban-zade]].

In addition to these phonemes, Crimean also displays marginal phonemes that occur in borrowed words, especially [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized consonants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kavitskaya|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern (coastal) dialect substitutes {{IPAslink|x}} for {{IPAslink|q}}, e.g. standard ''qara'' 'black', southern ''xara''.{{sfn|Изидинова|1997}}
At the same time the southern and some central dialects preserve glottal {{IPAslink|h}} which is pronounced {{IPAslink|x}} in the standard language.{{sfn|Изидинова|1997}} The northern dialect on the contrary lacks {{IPAslink|x}} and {{IPAslink|f}}, substituting {{IPAslink|q}} for {{IPAslink|x}} and {{IPAslink|p}} for {{IPAslink|f}}.{{sfn|Изидинова|1997}} The northern {{IPAslink|v}} is usually {{IPAblink|w}}, often in the place of {{IPAslink|ɣ}}, compare standard ''dağ'' and northern ''taw'' 'mountain' (also in other Oghuz and Kipchak languages, such as {{lang-az|dağ}} and {{lang-kk|taw}}).

{{IPAslink|k}} and {{IPAslink|ɡ}} are usually fronted, close to {{IPAblink|c}} and {{IPAblink|ɟ}}.

==Writing systems==
{{main article|Crimean Tatar alphabet}}
Crimean Tatar can be written in either the [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] or [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets, both modified to the specific needs of Crimean Tatar, and either used respective to where the language is used. Under Ukrainian rule, the Latin alphabet was preferred, but upon Russia's annexation of the Crimea, Cyrillic became the sole official script.&lt;ref name="LangLaw2017" /&gt;

===Arabic alphabet===
Crimean Tatars used Arabic script from 16th{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} century to 1928.

===Latin alphabet===
'''Â â''' symbol is not considered to be a separate letter.

==Legal status==

According to the [[Constitution of the Republic of Crimea|constitution]] of the [[Republic of Crimea]] and the Crimean language law,&lt;ref name="LangLaw2017" /&gt; the Crimean Tatar language is an official language in Crimea as well as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].

According to the [[constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea|constitution]] of the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]], as published in Russian by its [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Verkhovna Rada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rada.crimea.ua/constitution/glava03.html#_10 Конституция Автономной Республики Крым]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and Crimean Tatar languages enjoy a "protected" ({{lang-ru|обеспечивается ... защита}}) status; every citizen is entitled, at his request ({{lang|ru|ходатайство}}), to receive government documents, such as "Passport, Birth certificate and others" in Crimean Tatar. According to the constitution of Ukraine, however, Ukrainian is the only official language in all of Ukraine. Recognition of Russian and Crimean Tatar was a matter of political and legal debate.

Before the [[Sürgün]], the 18 May 1944 deportation by the Soviet Union of Crimean Tatars to internal exile in [[Uzbek SSR]], Crimean Tatar had an official language status in the [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3009">The '''Cupertino effect''' occurs when a [[spell checker]] erroneously replaces correctly spelled words which are not in its dictionary.

This term refers to the unhyphenated English word "cooperation" often being changed to "Cupertino" by older spell checkers with dictionaries containing only the hyphenated variant, "co-operation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oup.com/2007/11/spellchecker/ "When Spellcheckers Attack: Perils of the Cupertino Effect"], ''OUPblog'', [[Oxford University Press]], November 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]] is a town in California, often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for [[AppleInc.|Apple Inc]].

"Cupertino" has been in the dictionaries used by [[Microsoft Word]] since at least 1989.&lt;ref name=LangLog&gt;[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002911.html "The Cupertino effect"], ''[[Language Log]]'', March 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lack of vigilance in post-spell check editing can result in even official documents containing phrases such as "South Asian Association for Regional Cupertino" and "presentation on African-German Cupertino".&lt;ref name="New Scientist reference"&gt;{{cite news |title=The word: Cupertino effect |work=[[New Scientist]] |page=62 |date=2007-12-01 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626322-000-the-word-cupertino-effect/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Zimmer]] of [[Thinkmap, Inc.]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] has collected many examples of similar errors, including the common replacement of "{{Not a typo|defin|ately}}" (misspelling of "definitely") with "defiantly", "[[DeMeco Ryans]]" with "[[Demerol]]" (in ''[[The New York Times]]''), "[[Voldemort]]" with "[[Voltmeter]]" ''([[Denver Post]])'', and the "[[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]]" being replaced with "Muttonhead Quail Movement" ([[Reuters]]).&lt;ref name="New Scientist reference"/&gt;

The user need not always select an incorrect word for it to appear in the document. In [[WordPerfect]] 9 with factory default settings, any unrecognized word that was close enough to exactly one known word was automatically replaced with that word. Current versions of [[Microsoft Word]] come configured to "auto-correct" misspelled words silently as the user types. [[Smartphone]]s with dictionary-supported [[virtual keyboard]]s automatically replace possible mistakes with dictionary words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2573 "Cell phone cupertinos"], ''[[Language Log]]'', August 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eochaid mac Colla''' ({{circa}} 530 – 598), better known as '''Saint Dallán''' or '''Dallán Forgaill''' ({{lang-sga|Dallán Forchella}}; {{lang-la|Dallanus Forcellius}}; [[Primitive Irish]] ''Dallagnas Worgēllas''), was an early Christian [[Irish poet]] known as the writer of the "[[Amra Coluim Chille]]" ("Elegy of Saint Columba") and, traditionally, "Rop Tú Mo Baile"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/b/e/t/bethoumv.htm "Be Thou My Vision", Hymntime]&lt;/ref&gt;("[[Be Thou My Vision]]").

==Personal history==
Saint Dallan's given name was [[Eochaidh]] ({{lang-sga|Eochaid}}); his father was Colla, a descendant of the legendary High King [[Colla Uais]], and his mother was Forgall (Old Irish: ''Forchella'').&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Life of St Dallán'' in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae]]''&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname, ''Dallán'' ("little blind one"), was earned after he lost his sight,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]]'', compact edition, Royal Irish Academy p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; reputedly as a result of studying intensively.

He was born in Maigen (now [[Ballyconnell]]), at the eastern edge of the territory of the [[Masraige]] of [[Magh Slécht]] in modern [[County Cavan]]. He was not a member of the [[Masraige]] but belonged to a branch of the [[Airgíalla]] called the Fir Lurg, who were in the process of spreading southwards into Fermanagh and Cavan. (The barony of [[Lurg]] in [[County Fermanagh]] was named after them)&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;T. M. Charles-Edwards, ‘Dallán Forgaill ([[floruit|fl.]] 597)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7031 accessed 27 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; His was a first cousin of [[Saint Mogue]]. (The ''Life of Máedóc of Ferns'' says in ch. 72 that Dallán and Máedóc were sons of two brothers and he lived in [[Kildallan townland]].)&lt;ref name=Leverhulme/&gt; He was also a fourth cousin of [[Tigernach of Clones]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicsaints.info/book-of-saints-dallan-forgaill/ Monks of Ramsgate. “Dallan Forgaill”. ''Book of Saints'', 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Amhra Coluim Cille", a [[panegyric]] on [[Columba]], written shortly after Columba's death in 597, is his best known work&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanhamel.nl/codecs/Amra_Choluim_Chille "Amra Choluim Chille", Codecs]&lt;/ref&gt; and considered "one of the most important poems we have from the early medieval Gaelic world".&lt;ref name=Leverhulme&gt;[http://saintsplaces.gla.ac.uk/saint.php?id=84 "Dallan Forgaill M. Eirc", Saints in Scottish Place-Names, Leverhulme Trust Project]&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that after completing the work, Dallan regained his sight. It was claimed that those who recited the praises of Columba from memory would receive the gift of a happy death,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eXIrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=dall%C3%A1n+forgaill Crowe, John O'Beirne. ''The Amra Choluim Chilli of Dallan Forgaill'', McGlashan and Gill, 1871]&lt;/ref&gt; a custom that was widely abused by those who attempted to rely on their memory rather than a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; The "Amhra Coluim Cille" became a popular text for students in Irish monasteries.

The "Amra Senáin",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanhamel.nl/codecs/Amra_Senáin "Amra Senáin", Codecs]&lt;/ref&gt; a funeral oration in praise of [[Senán mac Geirrcinn]] (Senán of Iniscattery), was said to preserve from blindness those who recited it with devotion.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;O'Donnell, Patrick. ''Irish Ecclesiastical Record'', Vol. 8 (1887), pp.781-794&lt;/ref&gt;

In 598 Dallan was visiting his friend Saint Conall Cael at his monastery on [[Inishkeel]] when pirates raided the island monastery. Dallan was reportedly beheaded, and it is said that God reattached his head to his body after he was martyred.&lt;ref&gt;“Dallàn's death and burial" on page 37 of 'The Bodleian Amra Choluimb Chille' in Revue Celtique. Vol. 21 (Paris 1900), pp. 133-136.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried on Iniskeel; his friend Canall Cael was later laid to rest in the same grave.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt;

He was acclaimed a saint in the early 11th century, during the reign of the High King of Ireland [[Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] but was already listed as a saint in the earlier 9th century martyrologies compiled by [[Óengus of Tallaght]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; A medieval poem entitled "On  the  breaking up of a School" composed by Tadhg Og O Huiginn, c.1400, refers to the death of Dallán which caused his school to break up and the students to disperse as they would accept no other master.&lt;ref&gt;Studies Journal, Volume XXV (1924). Edited by Osborn Bergin.&lt;/ref&gt; In a list of ancient Irish authors contained in the Book of Ballymote, Dallán is called “grandson of testimony”.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Ballymote, p.&amp;nbsp;308, 26, "Dallán hua Forgaill in fil ut .i. Dallan mac Alla meic Eirc, meic Feradaigh gan tinii ardollam Erenn gan on, is e ro mol Cohan cille." ('Dallán son of Alla son of Erc son of Feradach without fear, Chief Ollam of Ireland without disgrace, it is he that praised Columba.')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Saint Dallan was a poet, [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]], as well as a scholar of Latin scriptural learning.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. O'Beirne Crowe, ''The ''Amra Coluim Cilli'' of Dallan Forgaill'', Dublin, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; He helped to reform the Bardic Order at the Convention of Drumceat.&lt;ref&gt;according to Geoffrey Keating's History of Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Amra]] Choluim Chille and Amra Senáin, the following works are attributed to Dallán, although some may be later works by other poets who credited Dallan with authorship in order to make their poems more famous.

1. Amra Conall Coel - in praise of St. Conall Coel, abbot of Iniskeel

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">A '''drawing room play''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|play]], developed during the [[Victorian period]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]], in which the actions take place in a [[drawing room]] or which is designed to be reenacted in the drawing room of a home. The common practice of entertaining a guest in the home led to the creation of this category of plays and while the drawing room itself has fallen out of favour, the play format has continued to provide a source of entertainment. 

While there is no date or authority directly ascribed to the term drawing room play, there is evidence that the term was derived from the [[England|English]] habit of putting on these short works for guests while entertaining in the drawing room of the home.  In [[France|French]] usage the room and the social gathering it contained are equally the salon.

==Types==
Beginning with the early forms of [[drama]], the drawing room play has evolved to encompass [[Comedy (theater)|comedy]] as well as to include the forms of the dramatic monologue.  The play format itself has also grown out of the traditional drawing room performance and back into main street theatre and film. Drawing room comedy is also sometimes called the "comedy of manners."  Many of the Drawing Room Plays adapted some form of social criticism in the transition from the Victorian period into the Modern era.

==Examples==
* ''[[The Elder Statesman]]'' (1959) was the last of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s drawing room works.
* [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' is one of the most widely known examples of the drawing room play.
* Several of the collected works of [[Noël Coward]] are also considered typical of the form.
* [[Paul Rudnick]]'s ''Regrets Only'' is a contemporary drawing room comedy released in 2006.
* Additional authors include Clement Scott, Walter Besant, Grace Luce Irwin and [[Arnold Bennett]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">A '''duodrama''' is a theatrical [[melodrama]] for two [[actor]]s or singers, in which the spoken voice is used with a musical accompaniment for heightened dramatic effect. It was popular at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

Closely related to [[opera]], the most famous example were the 1775 works ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]'' by [[Georg Benda]]. [[Mozart]] admired Benda's work and used similar techniques in ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780) and ''[[Thamos, König in Ägypten]]'' (c. 1773-1780). He considered writing a duodrama himself, to be called ''Semiramis''. [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805-1814) and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) also contain duodramas. The style is also used in [[lieder]] and song. &lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arizona Proposition 203''', also known as '''English for the Children''', is a ballot initiative that was passed by 63% of Arizona voters on November 7, 2000. It limited the type of instruction available to English language learner (ELL) students. Before Proposition 203, schools were free in terms of ELL instruction to use bilingual or immersion methods. According to a cover letter from the Arizona Department of Education Superintendent of Public Instruction [[Lisa Graham Keegan]] to the Arizona Legislature, it was impossible to make a correct analysis regarding how many students were learning through English as a second language programs, as opposed to bilingual education. The school districts had submitted "conflicting information," and 40% had not submitted any data, in spite of three deadline extensions. &lt;ref&gt;Lisa Graham Keegan, "English Acquisition Services: A Summary of Bilingual Programs and English as a Second Language Programs for School Year 1997-8," ''Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the Arizona Legislature,'' January 1999, cover letter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposition 203, like the similar California Proposition 227, was named after its financial supporter Ron Unz, a [[Silicon Valley]] software entrepreneur.  61% of the voters had passed Proposition 227. Arizona, Massachusetts, and Colorado followed with similar campaigns directed by Unz. On November 5, 2002, Question 2 in Massachusetts was passed by 68% of the voters, but Amendment 31 in Colorado was rejected by 56% of the voters. Unz's goal was to replace bilingual education with structured or sheltered English immersion programs.  The book ''English for the Children: Mandated by the People, Skewed by Politicians and Special Interests'' by Johanna J. Haver (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2013) reconstructs the politics surrounding Unz's movement and its effects on the education of ELLs.

==Content==
The actual text of the legislation begins with declarations regarding the importance of English and learning English. It goes on to state that immigrant parents want their children to acquire "a good knowledge of English," allowing them to "fully participate in the American dream." It explains that the government and Arizona public schools have a moral responsibility to "provide all of Arizona's children... with the skills necessary to become productive members of our society." It elaborates that public schools "currently do an inadequate job of educating immigrant children" by "experimental language programs whose failure over the past two decades is demonstrated by the current high drop-out rates and low English literacy levels of many immigrant children." It makes the point that "young immigrant children can easily acquire full fluency in a new language, such as English, if they are heavily exposed to that language in the classroom at an early age." &lt;ref&gt;Maria Mendoza and Hector Ayala, "English Language Education for Children in Public Schools, AZ Prop 203," January 6, 1999, English for the Children, www.onenation.org/aztext.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution states that "all children in Arizona public schools shall be taught English as rapidly and effectively as possible." ELLs should be educated in immersion programs during a temporary transition period "not normally intended to exceed one year." A parent may request for his or her child to be exempt if it can be determined that the child already knows English, the child is ten years old or older, or the child is identified as having special needs. However, for a child to claim to have special needs, it must be confirmed that education in English is not the best option for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Mendoza and Hector Ayala, "English Language Education for Children in Public Schools, AZ Prop 203," January 6, 1999, English for the Children, www.onenation.org/aztext.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
[[The New York Times|The ''New York Times'']] ran a front-page story in August prior to the November 2000 election, showing that California's version of the initiative, Proposition 227, had been highly successful, with a rise in standardized test scores among English language learners after two years.&lt;ref&gt; Jacques Steinberg, "Increase in Test Scores Counters Dire Forecasts for Bilingual Ban," August 20, 2000, www.onenation.org/008/082000.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of noted bilingual education theorists' arguments, disputing the particulars of the article, the ''Times'' story is believed to have strongly affected public opinion and the passage of Arizona Proposition 203.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna J. Haver, ''English for the Children'' (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2013), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Implementation of the policy was scheduled to occur at the beginning of the 2001-2002 school year. There was widespread confusion throughout the state because of differences of opinion regarding the language used in the text of the proposition. Following the implementation, some schools changed their approach to educating ELLs, but several districts obtained waivers for their ELL students and continued their bilingual education programs. For the most part, neither the bilingual nor the immersion programs were in compliance with the law. Fewer than 11% of the state's ELL students achieved proficiency in a year's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, K., Thompson, M., &amp; MacSwan, J. (2004).

'''Exclusive or''' or '''exclusive disjunction''' is a [[Logical connective|logical operation]] that outputs true only when inputs differ (one is true, the other is false).&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Germundsson|first1=Roger|last2=Weisstein|first2=Eric|title=XOR|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/XOR.html|website=[[MathWorld]]|publisher=[[Wolfram Research]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Table of logic symbols|symbolized]] by the prefix operator '''J'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=10|editor-first=Edward|editor-last=Craig|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=9780415073103|page=496|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP9O6OM4iOgC&amp;pg=PA496}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[infix]] operators '''XOR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|ɔr}}), '''EOR''', '''EXOR''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⊻&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⩒&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⩛&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;⊕&lt;/span&gt;''', &lt;span style="font-size:150%;"&gt;↮&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-size:150%;"&gt;'''&amp;#8802;'''&lt;/span&gt;. The [[negation]] of XOR is [[logical biconditional]], which outputs true only when both inputs are the same.

It gains the name "exclusive or" because the meaning of "or" is ambiguous when both [[operand]]s are true; the exclusive or operator ''excludes'' that case. This is sometimes thought of as "one or the other but not both". This could be written as "A or B, but not, A and B".

More generally, XOR is true only when an odd number of inputs are true. A chain of XORs—''a'' XOR ''b'' XOR ''c'' XOR ''d'' (and so on)—is true whenever an odd number of the inputs are true and is false whenever an even number of inputs are true.

==Truth table==
[[File:Multigrade operator XOR.svg|thumb|220px|Arguments on the left combined by XOR. This is a binary [[Walsh matrix]] (cf. [[Hadamard code]]).]]
The [[truth table]] of A XOR B shows that it outputs true whenever the inputs differ:

|-
| 1 || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0
|}

* 0, false
* 1, true

==Equivalences, elimination, and introduction==
Exclusive disjunction essentially means 'either one, but not both nor none'. In other words, the statement is true [[if and only if]] one is true and the other is false. For example, if two horses are racing, then one of the two will win the race, but not both of them. The exclusive disjunction &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt;, also denoted by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;'''⩛'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{J}pq&lt;/math&gt;, can be expressed in terms of the [[logical conjunction]] ("logical and", &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;), the [[disjunction]] ("logical or", &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;), and the [[negation]] (&lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;) as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) \land  \lnot (p \land q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The exclusive disjunction &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed in the following way:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) \lor (\lnot p \land q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This representation of XOR may be found useful when constructing a circuit or network, because it has only one &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; operation and small number of &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; operations. A proof of this identity is given below:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) &amp; \lor &amp; (\lnot p \land q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; ((p \land \lnot q) \lor \lnot p) &amp; \land &amp; ((p \land \lnot q) \lor q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; ((p \lor \lnot p) \land (\lnot q \lor \lnot p)) &amp; \land &amp; ((p \lor q) \land (\lnot q \lor q)) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (\lnot p \lor \lnot q) &amp; \land &amp; (p \lor q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; \lnot (p \land q) &amp; \land &amp; (p \lor q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

It is sometimes useful to write &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; \lnot ((p \land q) \lor (\lnot p \land \lnot q))
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
or:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) \land (\lnot p \lor \lnot q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This equivalence can be established by applying [[De Morgan's laws]] twice to the fourth line of the above proof.

The exclusive or is also equivalent to the negation of a [[logical biconditional]], by the rules of material implication (a [[material conditional]] is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of its [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and its consequence) and [[If and only if|material equivalence]].

In summary, we have, in mathematical and in engineering notation:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) &amp; \lor &amp; (\lnot p \land q) &amp; = &amp; p\overline{q} + \overline{p}q \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) &amp; \land &amp; (\lnot p \lor \lnot q) &amp; = &amp; (p + q)(\overline{p} + \overline{q}) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) &amp; \land &amp; \lnot (p \land q) &amp; = &amp; (p + q)(\overline{pq})
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to modern algebra==

Although the [[Operation (mathematics)|operators]] &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]) and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical disjunction|disjunction]]) are very useful in logic systems, they fail a more generalizable structure in the following way:

The systems &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \wedge)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \lor)&lt;/math&gt; are [[monoid]]s, but neither is a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. This unfortunately prevents the combination of these two systems into larger structures, such as a [[Ring (mathematics)|mathematical ring]].

However, the system using exclusive or &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \oplus)&lt;/math&gt; '''is''' an [[abelian group]].  The combination of operators &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; over elements &lt;math&gt;\{T, F\}&lt;/math&gt; produce the well-known [[field (mathematics)|field]] [[GF(2)|&lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;]].  This field can represent any logic obtainable with the system &lt;math&gt;(\land, \lor)&lt;/math&gt; and has the added benefit of the arsenal of algebraic analysis tools for fields.

More specifically, if one associates &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with 0 and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with 1, one can interpret the logical "AND" operation as multiplication on &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; and the "XOR" operation as addition on &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
   r = p \land q &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; r = p \cdot q \pmod 2 \\[3pt]
  r = p \oplus q &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; r = p + q \pmod 2 \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this basis to describe a boolean system is referred to as [[algebraic normal form]].

==Exclusive "or" in English==
{{essay|section|date=May 2013}}

The Oxford English Dictionary explains "either ... or" as follows:
{{quote|The primary function of ''either'', etc., is to emphasize the [[Mutually independent|perfect indifference]] of the two (or more) things or courses ... ; but a secondary function is to emphasize the mutual exclusiveness, {{=}} either of the two, but not both.&lt;ref&gt;or, conj.2 (adv.3) 2a ''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edition (1989). OED Online.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The exclusive-or explicitly states "one or the other, but not neither nor both." However, the mapping correspondence between formal [[Boolean algebra|Boolean]] operators and natural language conjunctions is far from simple or one-to-one, and has been studied for decades in [[linguistics]] and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Following this kind of common-sense intuition about "or", it is sometimes argued that in many natural languages, [[English language|English]] included, the word "or" has an "exclusive" sense.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings quotes numerous authors saying that the word "or" has an exclusive sense. See Chapter 3, "The First Myth of 'Or'":&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |last=Jennings |first=R. E. |date=1994 |title=The Genealogy of Disjunction |url= |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''exclusive disjunction''' of a pair of propositions, (''p'', ''q''), is supposed to mean  that ''p'' is true or ''q'' is true, but not both.  For example, it might be argued that the normal intention of a statement like "You may have coffee, or you may have tea" is to stipulate that exactly one of the conditions can be true. Certainly under some circumstances a sentence like this example should be taken as forbidding the possibility of one's accepting both options. Even so, there is good reason to suppose that this sort of sentence is not disjunctive at all. If all we know about some disjunction is that it is true overall, we cannot be sure which of its disjuncts is true. For example, if a woman has been told that her friend is either at the snack bar or on the tennis court, she cannot validly infer that he is on the tennis court. But if her waiter tells her that she may have coffee or she may have tea, she can validly infer that she may have tea. Nothing classically thought of as a disjunction has this property. This is so even given that she might reasonably take her waiter as having denied her the possibility of having both coffee and tea.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In English, the construct "either ... or" is usually used to indicate exclusive or and "or" generally used for inclusive.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}  But in Spanish, the word "''o''" (or) can be used in the form "''p o q''" (exclusive) or the form "''o p o q''" (inclusive). Some may contend that any binary or other [[arity|n-ary]] exclusive "or" is true if and only if it has an odd number of true inputs (this is not, however, the only reasonable definition; for example, digital xor gates with multiple inputs typically do not use that definition), and that there is no conjunction in English that has this general property.  For example, Barrett and Stenner contend in the 1971 article "The Myth of the Exclusive 'Or{{' "}} (Mind, 80 (317), 116–121) that no author has produced an example of an English or-sentence that appears to be false because both of its inputs are true, and brush off or-sentences such as "The light bulb is either on or off" as reflecting particular facts about the world rather than the nature of the word "or".  However, the "[[barber paradox]]"—Everybody in town shaves himself or is shaved by the barber, who shaves the barber? -- would not be paradoxical if "or" could not be exclusive (although a purist could say that "either" is required in the statement of the paradox).

Whether these examples can be considered "natural language" is another question.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}  Certainly when one sees a menu stating "Lunch special: sandwich and soup or salad" (parsed as "sandwich and (soup or salad)" according to common usage in the restaurant trade), one would not expect to be permitted to order both soup and salad.  Nor would one expect to order neither soup nor salad, because that belies the nature of the "special", that ordering the two items together is cheaper than ordering them a la carte.  Similarly, a lunch special consisting of one meat, French fries or mashed potatoes and vegetable would consist of three items, only one of which would be a form of potato.  If one wanted to have meat and both kinds of potatoes, one would ask if it were possible to substitute a second order of potatoes for the vegetable.  And, one would not expect to be permitted to have both types of potato and vegetable, because the result would be a vegetable plate rather than a meat plate.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Alternative symbols==
The symbol used for exclusive disjunction varies from one field of application to the next, and even depends on the properties being emphasized in a given context of discussion.  In addition to the abbreviation "XOR", any of the following symbols may also be seen:
* '''&lt;samp&gt;+&lt;/samp&gt;''', a plus sign, which has the advantage that all of the ordinary algebraic properties of mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] can be used without further ado; but the plus sign is also used for inclusive disjunction in some notation systems; note that exclusive disjunction corresponds to [[addition]] [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2, which has the following addition table, clearly [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the one above:

If using [[binary numeral system|binary]] values for true (1) and false (0), then ''exclusive or'' works exactly like [[addition]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2.

==Computer science==
[[File:XOR ANSI Labelled.svg|thumb|right|114px|Traditional symbolic representation of an XOR [[logic gate]]]]

===Bitwise operation===
{{Main article|Bitwise operation}}
[[File:Z2^4; Cayley table; binary.svg|thumb|[[Nimber]] addition is the ''exclusive or'' of [[natural number|nonnegative integers]] in [[w:binary numeral system|binary]] representation. This is also the vector addition in &lt;math&gt;(\Z/2\Z)^4&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Exclusive disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:
* 1 XOR 1 = 0
* 1 XOR 0 = 1
* 0 XOR 1 = 1
* 0 XOR 0 = 0
* {{n-ary|1110|2}} XOR {{n-ary|1001|2}} = {{n-ary|0111|2}} (this is equivalent to addition without [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]])

As noted above, since exclusive disjunction is identical to addition modulo 2, the bitwise exclusive disjunction of two ''n''-bit strings is identical to the standard vector of addition in the [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Z/2\Z)^n&lt;/math&gt;.

In computer science, exclusive disjunction has several uses:
* It tells whether two bits are unequal.
* It is an optional bit-flipper (the deciding input chooses whether to invert the data input).
* It tells whether there is an [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] number of 1&amp;nbsp;bits (&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B \oplus C \oplus D \oplus E&lt;/math&gt; is true [[If and only if|iff]] an odd number of the variables are true).

In logical circuits, a simple [[adder (electronics)|adder]] can be made with an [[XOR gate]] to add the numbers, and a series of AND, OR and NOT gates to create the carry output.

On some computer architectures, it is more efficient to store a zero in a register by XOR-ing the register with itself (bits XOR-ed with themselves are always zero) instead of loading and storing the value zero.

In simple threshold activated [[neural network]]s, modeling the XOR function requires a second layer because XOR is not a linearly separable function.

Exclusive-or is sometimes used as a simple mixing function in [[cryptography]], for example, with [[one-time pad]] or [[Feistel cipher|Feistel network]] systems.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Exclusive-or is also heavily used in block ciphers such as AES (Rijndael) or Serpent and in block cipher implementation (CBC, CFB, OFB or CTR).

Similarly, XOR can be used in generating [[entropy pool]]s for [[hardware random number generator]]s.  The XOR operation preserves randomness, meaning that a random bit XORed with a non-random bit will result in a random bit.  Multiple sources of potentially random data can be combined using XOR, and the unpredictability of the output is guaranteed to be at least as good as the best individual source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Robert B|title=Exclusive OR (XOR) and hardware random number generators|url=http://www.robertnz.net/pdf/xor2.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2013|date=28 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XOR is used in [[RAID]] 3–6 for creating parity information.  For example, RAID can "back up" bytes {{n-ary|10011100|2}} and {{n-ary|01101100|2}} from two (or more) hard drives by XORing the just mentioned bytes, resulting in ({{n-ary|11110000|2}}) and writing it to another drive.  Under this method, if any one of the three hard drives are lost, the lost byte can be re-created by XORing bytes from the remaining drives. For instance,  if the drive containing {{n-ary|01101100|2}} is lost, {{n-ary|10011100|2}} and {{n-ary|11110000|2}} can be XORed to recover the lost byte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nobel|first=Rickard|title=How RAID 5 actually works|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=26 July 2011|url=http://rickardnobel.se/how-raid5-works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XOR is also used to detect an overflow in the result of a signed binary arithmetic operation. If the leftmost retained bit of the result is not the same as the infinite number of digits to the left, then that means overflow occurred. XORing those two bits will give a "1" if there is an overflow.

XOR can be used to swap two numeric variables in computers, using the [[XOR swap algorithm]]; however this is regarded as more of a curiosity and not encouraged in practice.

[[XOR linked list]]s leverage XOR properties in order to save space to represent [[doubly linked list]] data structures.

In [[computer graphics]], XOR-based drawing methods are often used to manage such items as [[bounding volume|bounding boxes]] and [[cursor (computers)|cursors]] on systems without [[alpha compositing|alpha channels]] or overlay planes.

==Encodings==
Apart from the ASCII codes, the operator is encoded at {{unichar|22BB|XOR|html=}} and {{unichar|2295|CIRCLED PLUS|html=}}, both in block [[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode#Mathematical Operators|Mathematical Operators]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">In [[computer slang]], '''J. Random Hacker''' is  an arbitrary [[programmer]] ([[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]).

{{quote|A mythical figure like the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier]]; the archetypal hacker [[nerd]]. This term is one of the oldest in the [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker's]] [[jargon]], apparently going back to [[MIT]] in the 1960s. may originally have been inspired by ‘[[J. Fred Muggs]]’, a show-biz [[chimpanzee]] whose name was a household word back in the early days of [[TMRC]], and was probably influenced by ‘[[J. Presper Eckert]]’ (one of the co-inventors of the [[electronic computer]])".|"A Portrait of J. Random Hacker"|the [[Jargon File]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html Appendix B. A Portrait of J. Random Hacker], from the [[Jargon File]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"J. Random Hacker" is a popular [[placeholder name]] in a number of books and articles in programming.&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Unix Programming'' by [[Eric S. Raymond]],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=CZae0PbOXJMC&amp;pg=PA456&amp;dq=%22J.+Random+Hacker%22#PPA457,M1 p. 457]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Beginning Python'',  by [[Peter Norton]]  ''et al.'', p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; J. Random Hacker even authored a book about ease of malicious hacking, ''Adventures of a Wi-Fi Pirate''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Random Hacker, ''Adventures of a Wi-Fi Pirate'' (2005) {{ISBN|1-930919-62-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ''J. Random Hacker'' was a main developer of [[I2P]] software.

Over time, '''J. Random X'''  has become a popular [[cliché]], a [[snowclone]], in computer lore, with more types of "[[random]]" (meaning "arbitrary") categories of people, such as "J. Random [[Newbie]]",&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Unix Programming'' by Eric S. Raymond, Section "[http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch16s01.html The tale of J. Random Newbie]"&lt;/ref&gt; J.

'''Jose Miguel Barandiaran Aierbe''', known as '''on Joxemiel Barandiaran''' (31 December 1889 &amp;ndash; 21 December 1991), was a [[Basque people|Basque]] [[anthropologist]], [[ethnographer]], and [[priest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaur8.info/edukiak/20111224/311373/Joxe-Migel-Barandiaran-Desagertzeko-zorian-zegoen-kultura-baten-aztarnak-bilduz-hartu-zituen-ehun-urteak|title=Joxe Migel Barandiaran: Desagertzeko zorian zegoen kultura baten aztarnak bilduz hartu zituen ehun urteak|last=Agirre|first=Joxean|date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=February 14, 2015|language=Basque|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214045905/http://www.gaur8.info/edukiak/20111224/311373/Joxe-Migel-Barandiaran-Desagertzeko-zorian-zegoen-kultura-baten-aztarnak-bilduz-hartu-zituen-ehun-urteak|archivedate=February 14, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in 1889 as the youngest of nine children to Francisco Antonio Barandiaran and María Antonia Ayerbe in the family [[baserri]] Perune-Zarre in [[Ataun]].

Encouraged by his mother, he entered the priesthood aged 14 in [[Baliarrain]] and was ordained as a priest in 1914 in [[Burgos]].

==Career as an ethnographer==
Soon after being ordained as a priest, he took up ethnographical studies of Basque culture and archeology around 1916 in the [[Aralar Range|Aralar Mountains]]. He carried out invaluable research into folk traditions and collecting accounts and tales related to [[Basque mythology]].

[[File:Wellesley Islands locator map.jpg|thumb|right|Kayardild Traditional area]]
'''Kayardild''' is a moribund [[Tangkic languages|Tangkic]] language spoken by the [[Kaiadilt]] on the [[South Wellesley Islands]], north west [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], with fewer than ten fluent speakers remaining. Other members of the family include [[Lardil_language|Lardil]], [[Yukulta_language|Yukulta]] (Ganggalida) and [[Yangkaal]].
It is famous for its many unusual case phenomena, including [[Suffixaufnahme|case stacking]] of up to four levels, the use of clause-level case to signal interclausal relations and pragmatic factors, and another set of 'verbal case' endings which convert their hosts from nouns into verbs morphologically.

'''Kazak''' or '''Kazakh''' ([[Kazakh alphabets|Cyrillic]]: {{lang|kk|қазақша|italic=no}} or {{lang|kk|қазақ тілі|italic=no}}; [[Kazakh alphabets|Arabic]]: {{rtl-lang|kk-Arab|قازاقشا}} or {{rtl-lang|kk-Arab|قازاق تئلئ}}; {{IPA-kk|qɑzɑqˈʃɑ|pron}}, {{IPA-kk|qɑˈzɑq tɘˈlɘ|}}) belongs to the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak branch]] of the [[Turkic languages]]. It is closely related to [[Nogai language|Nogai]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]]. Kazak is the official language of the [[Kazakhstan|Republic of Kazakstan]] and a significant minority language in the [[Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[Xinjiang]], [[China]] and in the [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]] of [[Mongolia]]. Kazak is also spoken by many ethnic Kazaks through the former [[Soviet Union]] (approximately 472,000 in [[Russia]] according to the 2010 [[Russian Census]]), [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], and [[Germany]].

Like other Turkic languages, Kazak is an [[agglutinative language]], and it employs [[vowel harmony]].

In October 2017, Kazak President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] decreed that the [[politics of Kazakhstan|government]] would transition from using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to the [[Latin alphabet]] by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.dw.com/en/kazakhstan-to-change-from-cyrillic-to-latin-alphabet/a-41147396 |title= Kazakhstan to change from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet {{!}} DW |date= 2017-10-27 |work= Deutsche Welle (www.dw.com) |access-date= 2018-03-28 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Nazarbayev signed on February 19, 2018 an amendment to the decree of October 26, 2017 No. 569 "On translating the Kazak alphabet from Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin script."&lt;ref name="decree"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/kazakhstan-changing-russian-alphabet-812178 |title=This Country Is Changing Its Stalin-imposed Alphabet After 80 Years |agency=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amended alphabet uses  Sh and Ch for the Kazak sounds "Ш" and "Ч" and eliminates the use of apostrophes.&lt;ref name="2018 decree"/&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
The Kazak language has its speakers (mainly [[Kazakhs|Kazaks]]) spread over a vast territory from the [[Tian Shan]] to the western shore of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Kazak is the official state language of [[Kazakhstan|Kazakstan]], with nearly 10 million speakers (based on information from the [[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html|title = Central Asia: Kazakhstan|date = October 26, 2017|accessdate = October 31, 2017|work = [[The World Factbook|The 2017 World Factbook]]|publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|dead-url = no|archive-date = October 30, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171030062537/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; on population and the proportion of Kazakh speakers). In China, more than one million ethnic Kazaks and Kazak speakers reside in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture]] of [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kaz|chapter = Kazakh|title = [[Ethnologue|Ethnologue: Languages of the World]]|edition = 20th|location = Dallas, Texas|publisher = [[SIL International]]|editor1-last = Simons|editor1-first = Gary F.|editor2-first = Charles D.|editor2-last = Fennig|year = 2017|accessdate = October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Kazakh alphabets}}
The oldest known written records of languages closely related to Kazak were written in the [[Old Turkic alphabet]], though it is not believed that any of these varieties were direct predecessors of Kazak.&lt;ref name=mukh/&gt;  Modern Kazak, going back approximately one thousand years, was written in the [[Arabic script]] until 1929, when Soviet authorities introduced a [[Latin script|Latin-based alphabet]], and then a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] in 1940.&lt;ref name = Nazarbayev&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = [[Egemen Qazaqstan]]|title = Болашаққа бағдар: рухани жаңғыру|date = April 26, 2017|accessdate = October 30, 2017|trans-title = Orientation for the future: spiritual revival|first = Нұрсұлтан|last = Назарбаев|authorlink = Nursultan Nazarbayev|url = https://egemen.kz/article/nursultan-nazarbaev-bolashaqqa-baghdar-rukhani-zhanhghyru|dead-url = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170628091133/https://egemen.kz/article/nursultan-nazarbaev-bolashaqqa-baghdar-rukhani-zhanhghyru|archive-date = June 28, 2017|language = Kazakh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many citizens state that the officially introduced alphabet needs lots of improvements and changes. Moreover, Kazak becomes the only Turkic language which will be using Sh, Ch, after the intentions of the Uzbek government to abandon the Sh, Ch digraphs due to its impracticality.

== Phonology ==
Kazak exhibits [[retracted tongue root|tongue-root]] [[vowel harmony]], with some words of recent foreign origin (usually of [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin) as exceptions.  There is also a system of rounding harmony which resembles that of Kyrgyz, but which does not apply as strongly and is not reflected in the orthography.

===Consonants===
The following chart depicts the consonant inventory of standard Kazak;&lt;ref&gt;Some variations occur in the different regions where Kazakh is spoken, including outside Kazakhstan; e.g. ж / ج (where a Perso-Arabic script similar to the current [[Uyghur language#Writing system|Uyghur alphabet]] is used) is read {{IPA|[ʒ]}} in standard Kazakh, but {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} in some places.&lt;/ref&gt; many of the sounds, however, are allophones of other sounds or appear only in recent loan-words. For example, /q/ is allophone to /k/, and /{{IPA|ʁ}}/ is allophone to /g/, /{{IPA|ʃ}}/ to /ɕ/, and /{{IPA|ʒ}}/ to /ʑ/. The 18 consonant phonemes listed by Vajda are without parentheses—since these are phonemes, their listed place and manner of articulation are very general, and will vary from what is shown. The borrowed phonemes {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, {{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}} and {{IPA|/x/}}, only occur in recent borrowings, mostly from Russian. Non-Kazak sounds are in square brackets. 

In the table, the elements left of a divide are [[voiced|voiceless]], while those to the right are voiced.

--&gt;

===Vowels===
Kazak has a system of 12 phonemic vowels, 3 of which are diphthongs. The rounding contrast and {{IPA|/æ/}} generally only occur as phonemes in the first syllable of a word, but do occur later allophonically; see the section on harmony below for more information. Moreover, the {{IPA|/æ/}} sound has been included artificially due to the influence of Arabic, Persian and, later, Tatar languages during the Islamic period. 

According to Vajda, the front/back quality of vowels is actually one of neutral versus [[retracted tongue root]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009|reason=No reference given for 'Vajda'; why complicate things with ±RTR, which seems to be applied here mostly just because it is a fashionable feature in phonology}}

Phonetic values are paired with the corresponding character in Kazak's Cyrillic and current Latin alphabets.

The problem of the diphthongs:

* The diphthongs such as '''{{IPA|əj}} {{angle bracket|и/í}}, {{IPA|ʊw}} {{angle bracket|у/ý}}''' and '''{{IPA|i̯ɘ}} {{angle bracket|е/e}}''' as well as ё, ю, я appeared due to the strong Russian influence during the Soviet period. The Soviets decided to write the Russian names and words the same way in other languages and introduced alien letters and sounds to the Kazak language. However, most of Kazaks who do not speak Russian simply can not pronounce them and replace those sounds with Kazak equivalents. Moreover, these Russian sounds replaced some Kazak letters and artificially created the diphthongs, violating the law of syngarmony. For example, the word for 'to study' - 'оқыў' became 'оқу'; the word 'тию' replaced two words such as 'to touch' - 'тійіў' and 'to forbid' - 'тыйыў'. Even nowadays different dictionaries give different versions of words. In reality, most of the specialists who work at the language institution and who created the new latin alphabet, were born and raised in the Soviet Union. Thus, they firmly state to preserve the Russian letters in Kazak language while young generation with no authority recall scientists to give the syngarmony back to the Kazak language.
* Thus, Kazak (Russian) diphthongs historically has been: ''И - ıy/iy; У - uw/üw/ıw/iw; Е - e'' (not 'ye' in the beginning of a word); ''Ё - y''o (this combination of sounds doesn't exist in Kazak), ''Я - ya/ye/yä, Ю - yuw/yüw/yıw/yiw.''

== Morphology and syntax ==
Kazak is generally verb-final, though various permutations on [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] (subject–object–verb) word order can be used, depending on the logically stressed part of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beltranslations.com/Languages/Kaz-EN.html Beltranslations.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inflection]]al and [[Morphological derivation|derivational]] [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], both verbal and nominal, in Kazak, exists almost exclusively in the form of [[agglutinative]] suffixes. Kazak is a nominative-accusative, head-final, left-branching, dependent-marking language.&lt;ref name=mukh&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mukhamedova|first=Raikhangul |title=Kazakh: A Comprehensive Grammar|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317573081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pronouns ===

Kazak has eight personal pronouns:

===Tense, aspect and mood===
Kazak may express different combinations of [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]] through the use of various verbal morphology or through a system of [[auxiliary verbs]], many of which might better be considered light verbs. The present tense is a prime example of this; progressive tense in Kazak is formed with one of four possible auxiliaries. These auxiliaries "отыр" (sit), "тұр" (stand),  "жүр" (go) and  "жат" (lie), encode various shades of meaning of how the action is carried out and also interact with the lexical semantics of the root verb: telic and non-telic actions, semelfactives, durative and non-durative, punctual, etc. There are selectional restrictions on auxiliaries: motion verbs, such as бару (go) and келу (come) may not combine with "отыр". Any verb, however, can combine with "жат" (lie) to get a progressive tense meaning.&lt;ref name=mukh/&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|+Progressive aspect in the present tense&lt;ref name=mukh/&gt;
|-
!Kazak||Aspect||English translation
|-
|''Men jeymin''||non-progressive||"I (will) eat [every day]."
|-
|''Men jep jatırmın''||progressive||"I am eating [right now]."
|-
|''Men jep otırmın''||progressive/durative||"I am [sitting and] eating." / "I have been eating."
|-
|''Men jep turmın''||progressive/punctual||"I am [in the middle of] eating [this very minute]."
|-
|''Men jep jürmin''||habitual||"I eat [lunch, everyday]"
|}
While it is possible to think that different categories of aspect govern the choice of auxiliary, it is not so straightforward in Kazak. Auxiliaries are internally sensitive to the lexical semantics of predicates, for example, verbs describing motion:&lt;ref name=mukh/&gt;

|'''отыр''' – "sit", '''ungrammatical''' in

for verbs that are ''stative'' in nature
|*The fish has been swimming
''Not a possible sentence of Kazak''
|}

In addition to the complexities of the progressive tense, there are many auxiliary-converb pairs that encode a range of aspectual, modal, volitional, evidential and action- modificational meanings''.'' For example, the pattern -ып көру, with the auxiliary verb көру (see), indicates that the subject of the verb attempted or tried to do something (compare the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] てみる ''temiru'' construction).&lt;ref name=mukh/&gt;

'''Khan Roshan Khan''' ({{lang-ps|{{Nastaliq|خان روشن خان}}}}; November 1914 – 19 November 1988) was a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] historian, [[educationalist]], and writer from [[Pakistan]] known primarily for being president of the [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in Swabi and for writing books on the history of the [[Pashtun people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visitorsheaven.com/Swabi.php|title=Swabi|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pashto Academy]], [[University of Peshawar]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Allah Bakhsh Yusufi|first=Tariq bin|last=Yusufi|publisher=Allah Bakhsh Yusufi Research Council (Karachi)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Khan Roshan Khan was born in the village of [[Nawa Killi]], [[Swabi District|Swabi]] in 1914 and died on 19 November 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Residence of Roshan Khan and family, Karnal Sher Killi, Swabi.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Muhammad Zaman Khan. He wrote many books on the history of Pushtuns. He was a major figure in contemporary [[Pushto literature]]. Roshan Khan was an active member of the movement [[Khudai Khidmatgar]]. He was very energetic in the [[Pakistan Movement]] and was the president of the [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in Swabi. An area in [[Swabi]], called ''Roshan Pura'' is named after him, where his tomb is also located.&lt;ref&gt;"Government Primary School", Roshan Pura, [[Swabi]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Khan received his primary education from the Islami School Uthmanzai in [[Charsadda]]. Later on, he could not complete his further education due to the worse conditions of the times of [[British Raj|British Government of India]]. The changing circumstances diverted his attention towards history. He wrote books on the history of [[Pathan]]s. These books are ''Tazkira, Pathano&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt; ki Tareekh aur in ki asliat'' which describes the races of [[Pashtun tribes]] and their origins. In addition, he wrote ''Yousafzai qaum ki sarguzisht'', which gives details on the various tribes of Pukhtoons. Khan also authored ''Afghano ki nasli tarikh'', which describes the origin of Afghans(Pashtuns) from [[Israelites|Bani Israel]], (that is, the [[Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites|theory that the Pashtuns are descended from the biblical Israelites]]). Other booklets include ''Malika-Sawat'',''Baba-e-qaum Sheikhmali (RA)'' among others. His most important work is ''Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmat Khani'', which includes the details about the biographies of prominent Pukhtoon leaders and elders like [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan|Hafiz Rehmat Khan]], [[Hafiz Alpuri]](Abdulsamad) of [[Shangla]], [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]], Sardar Mohammad Khan, [[Dost Mohammad Khan|Dost Muhammad Khan]] and many others. It also sheds light on the important events and wars of Pukhtoons with other empires and tribes. Moreover, all the family trees of Pashtun tribes are also discussed in this book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swatvalley.com/swat/articles/litrature_in_swat.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kakazai.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Da Qalam Khawandan", pp. 184, 524 by Hamesh Khalil, Pushto Academy, Peshawar.&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the brief history of a famous Pashtun tribe, [[Shalmani]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shalman.iwarp.com/whats_new.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lars Kepler''' is the pseudonym of husband and wife team [[Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril]] (b. 1966) and [[Alexander Ahndoril]] (b. 1967), authors of the Joona Linna series. With six installments to date, the series has sold twelve million copies in 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://larskepler.com/lars-kepler/|title=Lars Kepler - Lars Kepler|work=Lars Kepler|access-date=2017-11-06|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahndorils were both established writers before they adopted the pen name Lars Kepler, and have each published several acclaimed novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enthusiast.bg/en/authors/74/|title=Lars Kepler|last=(www.thinkweb.bg)|first=PixelHouse.bg (office@pixelhouse.bg), powered by th!nkcms|website=enthusiast.bg|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joona Linna series follows Joona Linna, Detective Superintendent at the police’s National Operations Department,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://larskepler.com/joona-linna/|title=Joona Linna - Lars Kepler|work=Lars Kepler|access-date=2017-11-06|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saga Bauer, an Operational Superintendent at the Swedish Security Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://larskepler.com/saga-bauer/|title=Saga Bauer - Lars Kepler|work=Lars Kepler|access-date=2017-11-06|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Erik Maria Bark (in ''The Hypnotist'' and ''Stalker''), a trained psychiatrist and psychotherapist specialised in psycho-traumatology and disaster psychiatry.

In the fall of 2015, Lars Kepler’s sixth novel was published in Sweden, a stand-alone novel entitled ''Playground''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albertbonniersforlag.se/Bocker/deckare/p/playground/|title=Playground - Albert Bonniers Förlag|last=Kepler|first=Lars|website=www.albertbonniersforlag.se|language=sv|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The name Lars Kepler ==

Lars is a homage to the Swedish crime fiction author [[Stieg Larsson]] as he inspired the duo to start writing crime fiction. The name Kepler comes from the German scientist [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571-1630), who solved one of his time’s greatest mysteries: it was his calculations of the planets’ orbits that paved the way for Newton’s theses about gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://larskepler.com/faqs/|title=FAQs - Lars Kepler|work=Lars Kepler|access-date=2017-11-06|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The mystery of the pseudonym ==

British media first pointed out [[Henning Mankell]] as the person behind the pseudonym Lars Kepler, but this was quickly denied by both Mankell himself and Bonniers, the Swedish publisher of Lars Kepler’s books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/books/review/inside-the-list.html|title=Inside the List|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|date=2011-07-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several others were also suspected of being the author in question. In August 2009, Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet revealed that the spouses Ahndoril were in fact the ones behind the pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/wendela/ledig/article11953495.ab|title=Paret Ahndoril: Vi är Lars Kepler|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shortly thereafter confirmed by the couple’s publishing house through a press release. That the two created a third, fictional author to represent them can be considered a natural extension of their early individual careers, wherein they both experimented with the blurring of the line between fiction and reality, and incorporating the author as a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/alexander-ahndoril|title=Alexander Ahndoril - Uppslagsverk - NE.se|website=www.ne.se|language=sv|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most well-known is the example of how Alexander Ahndoril in his novel ''The Director'' (2006) crafted a fictive but plausible story about the director [[Ingmar Bergman]]’s life. Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril too has addressed this subject. In an article about the Portuguese writer [[Fernando Pessoa]], in the magazine Hjärnstorm, she writes about his way of working with so-called heteronyms, a kind of pseudonyms that act as independent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coelho Ahndoril|first=Alexandra|date=|title=Fernando Pessoa och den ställföreträdande författaren|url=|journal=Hjärnstorm|volume=98|pages=29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gives her view of why an author might choose such a trope: “He has created the opportunity to write something that may not be true, but is at least not false. If both writer and feeling are products of the text, then the link between prose and experience remains unbroken". For the spouses Ahndoril, the pseudonym was a method for writing together without limitations, while the secrecy around it stemmed from a desire to let Lars Kepler stand on his own two legs, and have his books assessed without prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mbokblogg.blogspot.se/2015/06/forfattarportratt-lars-kepler.html|title=Författarporträtt: "Lars Kepler"|website=mbokblogg.blogspot.se|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal lives ==

Alexander grew up in Upplands Väsby, twenty kilometers north of Stockholm. He has always been an avid reader, but wanted to be a painter in his youth. For many years he produced big oil paintings inspired by Caravaggio. He practiced Muay Thai and was accepted into a ranger unit, moved to central Stockholm and studied philosophy, religion, and film at university. His first novel was picked up when he was only nineteen. Before he began writing as Lars Kepler he had already penned nine novels, twenty theatre plays, and one opera libretto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://larskepler.com/faqs/|title=FAQs - Lars Kepler|work=Lars Kepler|access-date=2017-11-06|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra grew up in southern Sweden. She discovered early on that she wanted to become an actress and attended the National Academy of Mime and Acting in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albertbonniersforlag.se/forfattare/c/alexandra-coelho-ahndoril|title=Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril - Albert Bonniers Förlag|last=Förlag|first=Albert Bonniers|website=www.albertbonniersforlag.se|language=sv|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She thereafter got a Master’s Degree in literary science, was hired as a PhD student at university, and began writing a dissertation on the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coelho Ahndoril|first=Alexandra|date=|title=Fernando Pessoa och den ställföreträdande författaren|url=|journal=Hjärnstorm|volume=98|pages=29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She produced three historical novels before she began writing together with Alexander.

Alexander and Alexandra married in 1994 and have three daughters together. They live in central Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://larskepler.com/faqs/|title=FAQs - Lars Kepler|work=Lars Kepler|access-date=2017-11-06|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lemerig''' (sometimes also called ''Pak'', ''Päk'', or ''Sasar'') is an [[Oceanic language]] spoken on [[Vanua Lava]], in [[Vanuatu]]. 

Lemerig is no longer actively spoken. The 2 remaining speakers live on the northern coast of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.francois.free.fr/AF-field.htm#Vanuatu List of Banks islands languages].&lt;/ref&gt; The language has receded [[language shift|in favour of]] its neighbours [[Mwotlap language|Mwotlap]] and [[Vera'a language|Vera'a]].&lt;ref name="IJSL"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2012|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nar Phu''', or '''’Narpa''', is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] variety spoken in the two villages of Nar and Phu, in the Valley of the Nar Khola in the [[Manang district]] of [[Nepal]]. It forms a [[dialect continuum]] with [[Manang language|Manang]] and may be intelligible with it; however, the Nar and Phu share a secret language to confound Gyasumdo and Manang who would otherwise understand them.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

'''New immigrants in Hong Kong''' ({{zh|c=香港新移民}}) generally refers to migrants from mainland China ([[Mainland Chinese|Mainlanders]]). Despite its literal meaning, the term is rarely ever used to describe newly arrived immigrants other than the aforementioned one. Since the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] to [[PRC|The People's Republic of China]], {{citation needed span|text=increasing numbers|date=December 2014}} of migrants from mainland China have been coming to the territory.

== Family reunification and Right of abode ==
{{Main|Right of abode issue, Hong Kong}}
{{See also|Family reunification}}
Immediately after the handover of Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, Hong Kong's [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] passed an amendment to the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] that would restrict immigration to children born outside of Hong Kong that were born to Hong Kong residents. The constitutionality of this amendment came to be challenged in court, and in January 1999, the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] ruled against the amendment. This ruling immediately granted up to 300,000 people in mainland China the right of abode in Hong Kong, and it was estimated that within the next ten years, about 1.6&amp;nbsp;million people in mainland China would become eligible for right of abode in Hong Kong.{{clarify|reason=overturned by SCNPC's interpretation|date=December 2014}}

===Immigration and Cross-border Families===
Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2003){{who|date=December 2014}} gave the following account: after the first influx of refugee capitalists and workers from Mainland China in the late 1940s, Hong Kong experienced another influx in the late 1970s.  The migrants of this second wave were mainly young male mainlanders who made their living by working in the manufacturing industry.  Being less attractive in the eyes of Hong Kong local born women, many of these young mainlanders generally had to find spouses in Mainland China.  Soon after the Mainland government opened its door for economic development and after the signing of Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, there was a massive relocation of industrial activities from Hong Kong to the Pearl River Delta.  Such industrial relocation has accentuated the trend of marriage between Hong Kong working-class men and Mainland women (So, 2002).  According to the General Household Survey 1991, some 95,200 Hong Kong residents who were married in Mainland China had spouses still in Mainland.  It was estimated that 149,500 had children living in China and the total number of children was around 310,000 (fung,1996).

===Family Reunification Process and Family Strategies===
For working-class newly arrived families, the family reunification process is typically long and difficult with a number of obstacles to overcome.  There are complicated procedures and a long waiting time for getting a one-way permit. Therefore, cross-border family members need to formulate their own strategies for immigration and reunification.  The families have to plan the ‘best’ time for reunification, decide who will take care of the children, and discuss where and in what school the children should receive their education (Ku, 2001).  Rational and strategic use of family resources, including maximisation of family social capital is essential. Middle-class families tend to have an advantage in this process because of the financial capital and cultural capital they accumulated, but it is not the case for working-class newly arrived families.

The various scenarios in the family reunification process affect the social relations in the family, and therefore impact on the utilisation of family resources as well as its capital accumulation.  The scenarios could be:
1. The mother migrates first, and the children receive education and are taken care of by their grandparents, relatives or school in the Mainland;
2. The child migrates first, and leaves behind his/her mother and possibly also siblings to join the father in Hong Kong.

In the latter case, the father needs to take up the role of nurturing which was previously played by the mother.  Such a social phenomenon may create tension in family functioning (So, 2002:20).  Rao and Yuen (2001) suggest that psychiatric problems in newly arrived students may rise owing to the disruptions in family relations and changes in family ecologies.  It is also claimed that home-school co-operation can hardly be established if the mother, who has arrived in Hong Kong, does not know Cantonese.

=== Influx of mainland women coming to Hong Kong to give birth===
{{main|Birth tourism in Hong Kong}}
In the 2001 case ''[[Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen]]'', the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] held that a boy born in Hong Kong to two mainland parents neither of whom was a Hong Kong resident nevertheless was entitled to the right of abode.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://hm.people.com.cn/GB/42490/11262784.html|periodical=People's Daily|title=香江客语：赴港生子，无法预知的十年|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://geog.hku.hk/postgrad/geog7102/resource/HKRightofAbode.doc|title=Boy wins landmark abode battle|first=Magdalen|last=Chow|first2=Shirley|last2=Lau|periodical=South China Morning Post|date=21 July 2001|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The number of children born to non-Hong Kong permanent residents in Hong Kong hospitals has increased almost 100 times from 2001 to the first 10 months of 2006. The number of babies born to mainland mothers soared to 20,000 in the first 10 months of 2006 from less than 9,000 in 2002. Thousands of women from the mainland come to Hong Kong to give birth because it entitles their babies to permanent residency there. The benefits include a free education and subsidised health care as part of Hong Kong's British-inspired welfare policies. Hong Kong residents pay as little as $12.80 to give birth at a hospital because of extensive government subsidies.

To limit mainland mothers coming to give birth, starting 1 February 2007, pregnant women from the mainland have to pay $5,000 for their hospital care before they are even allowed to enter Hong Kong. Under the new release rules, immigration officers will be instructed to turn back any mainlander who appears to be at least seven months pregnant and has not paid.

[[File:AfroNicoya.jpg|thumb|Nicaraguan creole]]

[[Nicaragua]] [[Creole language|Creole]] [[English language|English]] is language spoken on the southern caribbean coast of Nicaragua and in a number of small villages which are all throughout the north and south.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is alongside Nicaragua's southern Caribbean coast,which is part of a region known as the [[Mosquito Coast]]. "[http://www.everyculture.com/knowledge/Mosquito.html Mosquito]" is the nickname that is given to the region and earlier residents by early Europeans who visited and settled at this location.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Middle-America-Caribbean/Creoles-of-Nicaragua-Orientation.html|title=Orientation - Creoles of Nicaragua|website=www.everyculture.com|language=eng|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Miskito is currently being used to designate this group of people and the language that they speak.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Location ==
The major population of speakers are centered in the port town of Bluefields and in a number of small villages along the north and south of the Nicaraguan southern Caribbean coast.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4025|title=Did you know Nicaragua Creole English is vulnerable?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment is that of a [[tropical rainforest]] with an average rainfall of 448 centimeters and temperatures that range 26.4&amp;nbsp;°C ( 79&amp;nbsp;°F ) and up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Most of the creole speakers are located along the banks of the large rivers and lagoons that surround the area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A smaller portion of the population stays in large towns along the northern Caribbean coast of [[Nicaragua]] and some also reside in [[Managua]] as well as other Central American countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==

=== 17 century - 19th century ===

The modern day Creole's ancestors came as slaves to the Nicaraguan caribbean cost from [[Africa]] between the 17th century and the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/creoles-nicaragua|title=Creoles of Nicaragua - Dictionary definition of Creoles of Nicaragua {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were originally brought there by the [[United Kingdom|British]] to serve them in agriculture and the various labors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over the period of time while they were here, the African population renewed and transformed their culture and traits by taking elements of their African culture and mixing it with their European masters along with the local Indians tribes which created a new culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the year of 1787, the British were forced to leave the [[Mosquito Coast|mosquito coast]] due to a treaty that was put forth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Slaves who ran away or who were abandoned had made their own African communities at Bluefield.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many escaped slaves from other islands had also come over to this area to settle down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Great Britain]] signed the Treaty of Managua which gave a portion of an area to the natives there and allowed it to be self-governed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This allowed for the African communities to grow and flourish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their culture became solid after gaining economic, political and social control over the Mosquito Coast.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The people in the communities then began to start calling themselves [[Creole peoples|Creoles.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 20th century - Present day ===

By the end of the 20th century, the coast was becoming more integrated economically and socially.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/creole-languages|title=Creole Languages {{!}} About World Languages|website=aboutworldlanguages.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Creole people have now become a minority in the areas which they had previously been predominant in.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nicaragua.com|title=Nicaragua Travel: Your Nicaraguan Guide for Things to Do, Hotels, Dining, Shopping, Events &amp; more {{!}} By Nicaragua Channel|website=www.nicaragua.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Creoles now mostly speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as well as [[Creole language|creole]] and consider themselves to be only Nicaraguan. There are many Creoles who have now intermarried with [[Mestizo]]s even though many of them still protest on how they lost their political and economic power to them.

== Culture and Identification ==
The Creoles of Nicaragua are said to be an Afro-Caribbean population that are mixed with Europeans, Africans and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their culture is influenced by West African and British roots along with [[mestizo]]s and [[Miskito people|miskito.]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some food that is used in their cooking consists of [[coconut oil]], [[taro root]], manioc and other elements such as wheat flour and other processed foods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They have their own musical style which can be compared to West Indian [[Calypso music|calypso.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Language details ==
The Nicaraguan Creole English language is spoken as a primary first language by only 35,000 to 50,000 Creoles, Nicaraguan Garifuna, and some Miskitos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The language is being quickly replaced with Spanish with fewer and fewer people speaking it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Creole English is used to an increasing degree in the churches (Decker &amp; Keener 1998) and in bilingual education programs...virtually all reading is done in Spanish" (Bartens 2013:116).

'''Njerep''' (Njerup) is a [[Mambiloid language]] spoken in the [[Adamawa Region]] of [[Cameroon]]. Njerep is essentially extinct, with a handful who cannot speak it fully. Though word lists and grammatical information have been collected from these people, the information remains fragmented.

==General information==
Njerep is considered a critically endangered language under the [[Endangered languages|UNESCO language endangerment index]]. Research conducted in 2000 indicates that only four speakers of this language remain, all of whom reside in the Somié village located along the Nigeria-Cameroon border (6°28' N, 11° 27' E).&lt;ref name="postcard" /&gt; Of these six speakers, only one remains conversant in the language. The others have been reported to be [[semi-speaker|semi-speakers]].&lt;ref name="postcard" /&gt; The youngest of the speakers was born in the 1940s, and it appears unlikely that Njerep will survive past the current generation.&lt;ref name="moribund"&gt;Connell, B. (1997). Moribund languages of the Nigeria-Cameroon borderland. In M. Brezinger (ed.), Endangered Languages in Africa. Cologne, Germany: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag. Pp 197-213. Retrieved from http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Bung%20%20Connell%201997.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Njerep is no longer a language of casual conversation. Instead, it is most often used for maintaining secrecy in conversation. According to a study in 2007, only 4 people spoke this language. All of them were elderly.
&lt;ref name="moribund" /&gt; The [[Mambila language]], also known as Mvop, has instead supplanted Njerep in casual use.&lt;ref name="postcard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moribund" /&gt;

==History of the Njerep people==
Though the Njerep people currently reside in Somié village, it is widely understood that the Njerep immigrated to that location. Geographically, Somié village is located on the Tikar Plain of Cameroon. The approximately 2,500 inhabitants&lt;ref name="market"&gt;Connell, B. (2009). Language diversity and language choice: A view from a Cameroon market. Anthropological Linguistics, 51(2), 130-150. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/2803659.&lt;/ref&gt; of Somié are not only Njerep, but also a wide variety of immigrant groups including the Liap, Ndeba, and Mvop people.&lt;ref name="fractal"&gt;Zeitlyn, D. &amp; Connell, B. (2003). Ethnogenesis and fractal history on an African frontier: Mambila—Njerep—Madulu. The Journal of African History, 44(1), 117-138. doi: 10.1017/S002185370200823X&lt;/ref&gt; Though oral accounts of how these groups immigrated to the Tikar plain are often contradictory, it appears that three or four waves of immigration led to the population of this area. It is likely that the Njerep people immigrated to the Tikar Plain from some region of the [[Adamawa Plateau]],&lt;ref name="moribund" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fractal" /&gt; possibly from the Djeni Mountain (also shown as Aigue Mboundo on some maps).

==Language affiliations==
Njerep appears to be related to the extinct [[Kasabe language|Kasabe]], the extinct [[Yeni language|Yeni]], and the endangered [[Twendi language|Twendi]].&lt;ref name="postcard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moribund" /&gt; Njerep appears to have been mutually intelligible with Kasabe, though not with Twendi.&lt;ref name="moribund" /&gt;

Njerep falls under the broad classification of one of the [[Mambiloid languages]]. [[Mambila language|Mambila]], the largest language in the Mambiloid grouping, has approximately twenty different dialects, loosely divided into East Mambila and West Mambila dialect clusters.&lt;ref name="market" /&gt; Linguistic analysis suggests that Njerep may fall under the East Mambila cluster.&lt;ref name="postcard" /&gt; However, it remains contested whether or not Njerep and its related languages should comprise its own unique grouping. 
 
==History of scholarship==
Intense efforts to record and characterize Njerep began in 2000. However, by the year 2000, Njerep had already been in terminal decline for some time. Thus, knowledge of Njerep vocabularies and grammars remains quite fragmentary.&lt;ref name="postcard" /&gt; Unfortunately, the lack of fluent speakers makes it unlikely that the incomplete record will ever be significantly amended.

==Word lists and grammar==
A comprehensive guide to Njerep vocabulary and grammar has been published and is freely available.&lt;ref name="postcard" /&gt;

'''Nyangatom''' (also Inyangatom, Donyiro, Dongiro, Idongiro) is a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]] ([[Eastern Sudanic]], [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]]) spoken in [[Ethiopia]] by the [[Nyangatom people]]. It is an oral language only, having no working orthography at present. Related languages include [[Toposa language|Toposa]] and [[Turkana language|Turkana]], both of which have a level of mutual intelligibility; Blench (2012) counts it as a dialect of Turkana.

== Life ==
=== Youth ===
Abelard, originally called "Pierre le Pallet", was born {{circa|1079}} in [[Le Pallet]],&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abelard, Peter|edition=15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Nantes]], in [[Brittany]], the eldest son of a minor noble [[France|French]] family. As a boy, he learned quickly. His father, a knight called Berenger, encouraged Pierre to study the [[liberal arts]], wherein he excelled at the art of [[dialectic]] (a branch of [[philosophy]]), which, at that time, consisted chiefly of the logic of [[Aristotle]] transmitted through [[Latin]] channels. Instead of entering a military career, as his father had done, Abelard became an academic. During his early academic pursuits, Abelard wandered throughout France, debating and learning, so as (in his own words) "he became such a one as the [[Peripatetics]]."&lt;ref name="Calamitatum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia Calamitatum|last=Abelard|first=Peter|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html|accessdate=7 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204063034/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html|archivedate=4 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first studied in the Loire area, where the [[Nominalism|nominalist]] [[Roscellinus]] of [[Compiègne]], who had been accused of heresy by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], was his teacher during this period.&lt;ref name="CBD" /&gt;

=== Rise to fame ===
Around 1100, Abelard's travels finally brought him to [[Paris]]. In the great [[cathedral school]] of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (before the current cathedral was actually built), he was taught for a while by [[William of Champeaux]], the disciple of [[Anselm of Laon]] (not to be confused with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]]), a leading proponent of [[Philosophical realism|Realism]].&lt;ref name="CBD" /&gt; During this time he changed his surname to "Abelard", sometimes written "Abailard" or "Abaelardus". Retrospectively, Abelard portrays William as having turned from approval to hostility when Abelard proved soon able to defeat the master in argument;{{efn|Older accounts of the meeting suggest that this resulted in a long duel that ended in the downfall of the philosophic theory of Realism, till then dominant in the early Middle Ages (to be replaced by Abelard's Conceptualism, or by Nominalism, the principal rival of Realism prior to Abelard).}} Abelard was, however, closer to William's thought than this account suggests.&lt;ref name=Marenbon-15&gt;{{harvnb|Marenbon|2004|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And William thought Abelard was too [[pride|arrogant]].&lt;ref name="Sellner2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Cletus Sellner|title=Finding the Monk Within: Great Monastic Values for Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xR7cxJ6mnboC&amp;pg=PA238|year=2008|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-1-58768-048-9|pages=238–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Abelard would provoke quarrels with both William and Roscellinus.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; Against opposition from the metropolitan teacher, Abelard set up his own school, first at [[Melun]], a favoured royal residence, then, around 1102-4, for more direct competition, he moved to [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]], nearer Paris.&lt;ref name="Calamitatum" /&gt;

His teaching was notably successful, though for a time he had to give it up and spend time in Brittany, the strain proving too great for his constitution. On his return, after 1108, he found William lecturing at the hermitage of Saint-Victor, just outside the [[Île de la Cité]], and there they once again became rivals, with Abelard challenging William over his theory of universals. Abelard was once more victorious, and Abelard was almost able to hold the position of master at Notre Dame. For a short time, however, William was able to prevent Abelard from lecturing in Paris. Abelard accordingly was forced to resume his school at Melun, which he was then able to move, from  {{circa|1110-12}}, to Paris itself, on the heights of [[Montagne Sainte-Geneviève]], overlooking Notre-Dame.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

From his success in dialectic, he next turned to [[theology]] and in 1113 moved to [[Laon]] to attend the lectures of [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] on Biblical [[exegesis]] and Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; Unimpressed by Anselm's teaching, Abelard began to offer his own lectures on the book of Ezekiel. Anselm forbade him to continue this teaching, and Abelard returned to Paris where, in around 1115, he became master of [[Notre-Dame de la Garde|Notre Dame]] and a canon of [[Sens]] (the cathedral of the archdiocese to which Paris belonged).&lt;ref name="Calamitatum" /&gt;

=== Héloïse ===
[[File:Abelard and Heloise.jpeg|thumb|Abelard and [[Heloïse]] in a manuscript of the [[Roman de la Rose]] (14th century)]]
Distinguished in figure and manners, Abelard was seen surrounded by crowds – it is said thousands of students – drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as he says, to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, at the height of his fame, he encountered romance.&lt;ref name="Calamitatum" /&gt;&lt;!---a guess--&gt;[[File:Heloïse et d'Abélard.jpg|thumb|right|"Abaelardus and Heloïse surprised by Master Fulbert", by [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] painter [[Jean Vignaud]] (1819)]]

[[Héloïse d'Argenteuil]] lived within the precincts of Notre-Dame, under the care of her uncle, the secular [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Fulbert. She was remarkable for her knowledge of [[classics|classical letters]], which extended beyond [[Latin]] to [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Abelard sought a place in Fulbert's house and, in 1115 or 1116, began an affair with Héloïse. The affair interfered with his career, and Abelard himself boasted of his conquest. Once Fulbert found out, he separated them, but they continued to meet in secret. Héloïse became pregnant and was sent by Abelard to be looked after by his family in Brittany, where she gave birth to a son whom she named Astrolabe after the [[astrolabe|scientific instrument]].&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;&lt;ref name="Calamitatum" /&gt;{{efn|Astrolabe, the son of Abelard and Héloïse, is mentioned by Peter the Venerable of Cluny, where Abelard spent his last years, when Peter the Venerable wrote to Héloise: "I will gladly do my best to obtain a prebend in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake". A 'Petrus Astralabius' is recorded at the Cathedral of Nantes in 1150, and the same name appears at the Cistercian abbey at Hauterive in what is now Switzerland, but it is uncertain whether this is the same man. However, Astrolabe is recorded as dying at Paraclete on 29 or 30 October, year unknown, appearing in the necrology as "Petrus Astralabius magistri nostri Petri filius". (See {{harvnb|Radice|1947|loc= (trans.)}}, The Letters of Abelard and Héloïse (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 287; for the necrology, see Enid McLeod, Héloise (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 2nd edn., 1971, pp. 253, 283-84)).}}

To appease Fulbert, Abelard proposed a secret marriage so as not to mar his career prospects. Héloïse initially opposed it, but the couple were married. When Fulbert publicly disclosed the marriage, and Héloïse denied it, Abelard sent Héloïse to the convent at [[Argenteuil]], where she had been brought up, in order to protect her from her uncle. Héloïse dressed as a nun and shared the nun's life, though she was not veiled.

Fulbert, most probably believing that Abelard wanted to be rid of Héloïse by forcing her to become a nun, arranged for a band of men to break into Abelard's room one night and [[Castration|castrate]] him. [[Roscellinus]] would later belittle Abelard for getting castrated.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''The History of Western Philosophy''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1945, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Abelard decided to become a monk at the monastery of St Denis, near Paris.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; Before doing so he insisted that Héloïse take vows as a nun. Héloïse sent letters to Abelard, questioning why she must submit to a religious life for which she had no calling.&lt;ref name="Calamitatum" /&gt;

=== Later life ===
In the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], the 40-year-old Abelard sought to bury himself as a monk with his woes out of sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kevin Guilfoy|first=Jeffrey E. Brower|title=The Cambridge Companion To Abelard|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Abelard and monastic reform|isbn=978-0-521-77596-0|pages=25|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jaj-JMThB4MC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=abelard+became+a+monk#v=onepage&amp;q=abelard%20became%20a%20monk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding no respite in the [[cloister]], and having gradually turned again to study, he gave in to urgent entreaties, and reopened his school at an unknown priory owned by the monastery. His lectures, now framed in a devotional spirit, and with lectures on theology as well as his previous lectures on logic, were once again heard by crowds of students, and his old influence seemed to have returned. Using his studies of the Bible and — in his view — inconsistent writings of the leaders of the church as his basis, he wrote ''[[Sic et Non]]'' (''Yes and No'').&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;

No sooner had he published his theological lectures (the ''Theologia Summi Boni'') than his adversaries picked up on his rationalistic interpretation of the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] dogma. Two pupils of [[Anselm of Laon]], Alberic of Rheims and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with the heresy of [[Sabellianism|Sabellius]] in a provincial [[synod]] held at [[Soissons]] in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn the ''Theologia'' himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, but it seems to have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked almost immediately, because after a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.&lt;ref name=Marenbon-15 /&gt;

Life in his own monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard himself was partly responsible. He took a sort of malicious pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for the sake of a joke, he cited [[Bede]] to prove that the believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] had been [[Bishop of Corinth]], while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot [[Hilduin]] that he had been [[Bishop of Athens]]. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard wrote a letter to the Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' and St. [[Jerome]], according to whom [[Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth]], was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Abelard initially lodged at St Ayoul of Provins, where the prior was a friend. Then, after the death of Abbot Adam in March 1122, Abelard was able to gain permission from the new abbot, [[Abbot Suger|Suger]], to live "in whatever solitary place he wished". In a deserted place near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] in [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]], he built a cabin of stubble and reeds, and a simple oratory dedicated to the Trinity and became a [[hermit]]. When his retreat became known, students flocked from Paris, and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts. He began to teach again there. The oratory was rebuilt in wood and stone and rededicated as the [[Oratory of the Paraclete]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[File:Abelard cour Napoleon Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Abelard at [[Louvre Palace]] in Paris by [[Jules Cavelier]]]]

Abelard remained at the Paraclete for about five years. His combination of the teaching of secular arts with his profession as a monk was heavily criticized by other men of religion, and Abelard contemplated flight outside Christendom altogether.&lt;ref name="Luscombe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1041/Peter-Abelard |author=David Edward Luscombe |title=Peter Abelard |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174804/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1041/Peter-Abelard |archivedate=2015-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abelard therefore decided to leave and find another refuge, accepting sometime between 1126 and 1128 an invitation to preside over the Abbey of [[Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys]] on the far-off shore of Lower Brittany. The region was inhospitable, the domain a prey to outlaws, the house itself savage and disorderly.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} There, too, his relations with the community deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Luscombe" /&gt;

During this time, however, Abelard came back into contact with Héloïse. In April 1129, [[Abbot Suger]] of St Denis succeeded in his plans to have the nuns, including Héloïse, expelled from the convent at Argenteuil, in order to take over the property for St Denis. Héloïse had meanwhile become the head of a new foundation of nuns called the [[Paraclete]]. Abelard became the abbot of the new community and provided it with a rule and with a justification of the nun’s way of life; in this he emphasized the virtue of literary study. He also provided books of hymns he had composed, and in the early 1130s he and Héloïse composed a collection of their own love letters and religious correspondence.&lt;ref name="Luscombe" /&gt;
[[File:France illustrée I p473.png|thumb|Abelard receives the monastery of the [[Paraclete]] Héloïse (1129)]]

Lack of success at St Gildas made Abelard decide to take up public teaching again (although he remained for a few more years, officially, Abbot of St Gildas). It is not entirely certain what he then did, but given that [[John of Salisbury]] heard Abelard lecture on dialectic in 1136, it is presumed that he returned to Paris and resumed teaching on the [[Montagne Sainte-Geneviève]]. It is presumed his lectures included logic, at least until 1136,{{efn|Given John of Salisbury's testimony.}} but were mainly concerned with the Bible, Christian doctrine, and ethics. Then he produced further drafts of his ''Theologia'' in which he analyzed the sources of belief in the Trinity and praised the pagan philosophers of classical antiquity for their virtues and for their discovery by the use of [[reason]] of many fundamental aspects of Christian revelation.&lt;ref name="Luscombe" /&gt;

At some point in this time Abelard wrote, among other things, his famous ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]''. This moved Héloïse to write her first Letter;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler|first=Bonnie|title=Listening to Héloïse: the voice of a twelfth-century woman|year=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-21354-1|pages=150–151|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f4ETQPKFVwoC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Héloïse+first+letter+passion#v=onepage&amp;q=Héloïse%20first%20letter%20passion&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being followed by the two other Letters, in which she finally accepted the part of resignation, which, now as a brother to a sister, Abelard commended to her. Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, ''Ethica'' or ''[[Scito te ipsum]]'' (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; During this period, he also wrote ''[[Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum]]'' (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also ''[[Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos]]'', a commentary on [[St. Paul]]'s epistle to the Romans, where he expands on the meaning of [[Christ]]'s life.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;

==== Conflicts with St. Bernard ====
Abelard was to face, however, another challenge which would put a final end to his teaching career. After 1136, it is not clear whether Abelard had stopped teaching, or whether he perhaps continued with all except his lectures on logic until as late as 1141. Whatever the exact timing, a process was instigated by [[William of St-Thierry|William of St Thierry]], who discovered what he considered to be heresies in some of Abelard's teaching. In spring 1140 he wrote to the Bishop of Chartres and to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] denouncing them. Another, less distinguished, theologian, [[Thomas of Morigny]], also produced at the same time a list of Abelard's supposed heresies, perhaps at Bernard's instigation. Bernard's complaint mainly is that Abelard has applied logic where it is not applicable, and that is illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj_CNqojMV8C |page=134 |title=Bernard of Clairvaux on the Life of the Mind |author=John R. Sommerfeldt |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8091-4203-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid pressure from Bernard, Abelard challenged Bernard either to withdraw his accusations, or to make them publicly at the important [[Councils of Sens|church council at Sens]] planned for 2 June 1141. In so doing, Abelard put himself into the position of the wronged party and forced Bernard to defend himself from the accusation of slander. Bernard avoided this trap, however: on the eve of the council, he called a private meeting of the assembled bishops and persuaded them to condemn, one by one, each of the heretical propositions he attributed to Abelard. When Abelard appeared at the council the next day, he was presented with a list of condemned propositions imputed to him.&lt;ref name="John Marenbon 2004 p17"&gt;{{harvnb|Marenbon|2004|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Refusing to answer to these propositions, Abelard left the assembly, appealed to the Pope, and set off for Rome, hoping that the Pope would be more supportive. However, this hope was unfounded. On 16 July 1141, [[Pope Innocent II]] issued a bull [[excommunication|excommunicating]] Abelard and his followers and imposing perpetual silence on him, and in a second document he ordered Abelard to be confined in a monastery and his books to be burned. Abelard was saved from this sentence, however, by [[Peter the Venerable]], abbot of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]]. Abelard had stopped there, on his way to Rome, before the papal condemnation had reached France. Peter persuaded Abelard, already old, to give up his journey and stay at the monastery. Peter managed to arrange a reconciliation with Bernard, to have the sentence of excommunication lifted, and to persuade Innocent that it was enough if Abelard remained under the aegis of Cluny. Abelard was treated not as a condemned heretic, but as a revered and wise scholar.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He spent his final months at the priory of St. Marcel, near [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], before he died on 21 April 1142.&lt;ref name="John Marenbon 2004 p17" /&gt; He is said to have uttered the last words "I don't know", before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A history|page=687|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC|accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died from a combination of fever and a skin disorder, most likely [[scurvy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman and Betty|last=Donaldson|title=How Did They Die?|year=1980|publisher=Greenwich House|isbn=978-0-517-40302-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disputed resting place/lovers' pilgrimage ====
[[File:Abelardtomb closeup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dedicatory panel in the Père Lachaise Cemetery]]
Abelard was first buried at St. Marcel, but his remains were soon carried off secretly to the Paraclete, and given over to the loving care of Héloïse, who in time came herself to rest beside them in 1163.

The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in eastern Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burge|2006|p=276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.

This remains, however, disputed. The [[Oratory of the Paraclete]] claims Abelard and Héloïse are buried there and that what exists in Père-Lachaise is merely a monument, or [[cenotaph]]. According to Père-Lachaise, the remains of both lovers were transferred from the Oratory in the early 19th century and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burge|2006|pp=276–277}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père-Lachaise, Heloïse's remains are elsewhere.

== Philosophy and theology ==
{{Catholic philosophy}}

=== Philosophical thought ===
The general importance of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with the object of giving a formal, rational expression to received ecclesiastical doctrine. Though his particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from the heads of the Church.

He helped to establish the ascendancy of the philosophical authority of [[Aristotle]] which became firmly established in the half-century after his death. It was at this time that the completed ''[[Organon]]'', and gradually all the other works of the Greek thinker, first came to be available in the schools. Before his time, [[Plato]]'s authority was the basis for the prevailing Realism. As regards his so-called Conceptualism and his attitude to the question of universals, see [[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Scholasticism|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'': Scholasticism]].

Outside of his dialectic, it was in ethics that Abelard showed greatest activity of philosophical thought. He stressed the subjective intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value, of human action. His thought in this direction, anticipating something of modern speculation, is remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least in the field of morals, hardly venturing to bring the principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after they were made fully aware of Aristotle's great ethical inquiries.

Regarding un[[baptized]] who die in [[infancy]], Abelard—in ''Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos''—emphasized the goodness of God and interpreted St. [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s "mildest punishment" as the pain of loss at being denied the [[beatific vision]] (''carentia visionis Dei''), without hope of obtaining it, but with no additional punishments. His thought contributed to the forming of [[Limbo of Infants]] theory in the 12th–13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|title=The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised|author=International Theological Commission, the Vatican|accessdate=7 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222011157/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|archivedate=22 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later influence ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Abelard was an enormous influence on his contemporaries and the course of medieval philosophical thought, but he has been known in modern times mainly for his connection with Héloïse. Only one of his strictly philosophical works, the ethical treatise ''Scito te ipsum'', had been published before the 19th century, in 1721. It was only with the publication by Cousin in 1836 of the collection entitled ''Ouvrages inedits d'Abelard'' that Abelard's philosophical work began to be studied more closely. Cousin's collection gave extracts from the theological work ''[[Sic et Non]]'' ("Yes and No") which is an assemblage of what Abelard saw as opposite opinions on doctrinal points culled from the Fathers as a basis for discussion. The collection also includes the ''Dialectica, ''and commentaries on logical works of Aristotle, Porphyry and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]. Two works published by Cousin and believed at the time to be by Abelard, the fragment ''De Generibus et Speciebus ''(published in the 1836 collection), and also the psychological treatise ''De Intellectibus'' (published separately by Cousin in  ''Fragmens Philosophiques'', vol. ii.), are'' ''now believed on upon internal evidence not to be by Abelard himself, but only to have sprung out of his school''.'' A genuine work, the ''Glossulae super Porphyrium'', from which [[Charles de Rémusat]] gave extracts in his monograph ''Abelard'' (1845), was published in 1930. The fascinating hypothesis of Abaelard‘s influence on [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] and [[Spinoza]] has been developed by [[Robert Menasse]] and first published in his essay „Enlightement as Harmonious Strategy“ edited by ''Versopolis'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401004614/http://www.versopolis.com/long-read/587/enlightenment-as-a-harmonious-strategy |archivedate=2018-04-01 |df= }} (retrieved on March 31, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notes from Pope Benedict XVI ===
During his general audience on 4 November 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] talked about [[Saint]] [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and Peter Abelard to illustrate differences in the [[monastic]] and [[scholasticism|scholastic]] approaches to [[theology]] in the 12th century. The Pope recalled that theology is the search for a rational understanding (if possible) of the mysteries of Christian [[revelation]], which is believed through [[faith]] — faith that seeks intelligibility (''fides quaerens intellectum''). But St. Bernard, a representative of monastic theology, emphasized "faith" whereas Abelard, who is a scholastic, stressed "understanding through reason".&lt;ref name="NCR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |title=St. Bernard and Peter Abelard |publisher=National Catholic Register – [[EWTN News, Inc.]] |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=June 21, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619153341/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/st._bernard_and_peter_abelard |archivedate=June 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Bernard, faith is based on the testimony of [[Scripture]] and on the teaching of the [[Fathers of the Church]]. Thus, Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and, in a more general way, with those who would subject the truths of faith to the critical examination of reason — an examination which, in his opinion, posed a grave danger: [[intellectualism]], the relativizing of truth, and the questioning of the truths of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in [[contemplative prayer]], by the affective union of the heart and mind with God, with only one purpose: to promote the living, intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt;

According to Pope Benedict XVI, an excessive use of [[philosophy]] rendered Abelard’s [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]] dangerously fragile and, thus, his idea of God. In the field of morals, his teaching was vague, as he insisted on considering the intention of the subject as the only basis for describing the goodness or evil of moral acts, thereby ignoring the objective meaning and moral value of the acts, resulting in a dangerous [[subjectivism]]. But the Pope recognized the great achievements of Abelard, who made a decisive contribution to the development of scholastic theology, which eventually expressed itself in a more mature and fruitful way during the following century. And some of Abelard's insights should not be underestimated, for example, his affirmation that non-Christian religious traditions already contain some form of preparation for welcoming Christ.&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt;

Pope Benedict XVI concluded that Bernard’s "theology of the heart" and Abelard’s "theology of reason" represent the importance of healthy theological discussion, especially when the questions being debated have not been defined by the [[magisterium]], and [[Humility|humble]] obedience to the authority of the Church. St. Bernard, and even Abelard himself, always recognized without any hesitation the authority of the magisterium. Abelard showed [[humility]] in acknowledging his errors, and Bernard exercised great [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]. The Pope emphasized, in the field of theology, there should be a balance between [[architecture|architectonic]] principles, which are given through Revelation and which always maintain their primary importance, and the interpretative principles proposed by philosophy (that is, by reason), which have an important function, but only as a tool. When the balance breaks down, theological reflection runs the risk of becoming marred by error; it is then up to the magisterium to exercise the needed service to truth, for which it is responsible.&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt;

== The letters of Abelard and Héloïse ==
The story of Abelard and Héloïse has proved immensely popular in modern European culture. This story is known almost entirely from a few sources: first, the ''Historia Calamitatum; ''secondly, the seven letters between Abelard and Héloïse which survive (three written by Abelard, and four by Héloïse), and always follow the ''Historia Calamitatum'' in the manuscript tradition; thirdly, four letters between Peter the Venerable and Héloïse (three by Peter, one by Héloïse).&lt;ref&gt;In the Latin categorising of Abelard's work, these are numbered ''Epistolae'' 2-8, because the ''Historia calamitatum'' (which takes the form of a letter) is termed ''Epistolae ''1.&lt;/ref&gt; They are, in modern times, the best known and most widely translated parts of Abelard's work.

It is unclear quite how the letters of Abelard and Héloïse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual references to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and [[Walter Map]]. It seems unlikely, however, that the letters were widely known in this period. Rather, the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore seems likely that the letters sent between Abelard and Héloïse were kept by Héloïse at the Paraclete along with the 'Letters of Direction', and that more than a century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the story of their love affair was summarised by [[Jean de Meun]] in his continuation to ''Le Roman de la Rose''.

Their story does not appear to have been widely known in the later Middle Ages, either. There is no mention of the couple in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]; [[Chaucer]] makes a very brief reference in the Wife of Bath's Prologue (lines 677–8), but no more. One of the first people to show a deeper interest in the couple appears to have been [[Petrarch]], who owned an early 14th-century manuscript of the couple's letters. This silence on what is today seen as a particularly touching story is perhaps surprising, given the Renaissance ideal of courtly love – but it is possible that the story of Abelard and Héloïse could not be appropriately fitted into the ideals of the lover's devotion to the chaste and unattainable lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first publication of the letters, in Latin, was in Paris in 1616, simultaneously in two editions. These editions gave rise to numerous translations of the letters into European languages – and consequent 18th- and 19th-century interest in the story of the medieval lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, the couple were revered as tragic lovers, who endured adversity in life but were united in death. With this reputation, they were the only individuals from the [[French Revolution|pre-Revolutionary]] period whose remains were given a place of honour at the newly founded cemetery of [[Père Lachaise]] in Paris. At this time, they were effectively revered as romantic saints; for some, they were forerunners of modernity, at odds with the ecclesiastical and monastic structures of their day and to be celebrated more for rejecting the traditions of the past than for any particular intellectual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Constant J Mews, ''Abelard and Héloïse'', (Oxford: OUP, 2005), p4&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia'' was first published in 1841 by John Caspar Orelli of Turici. Then, in 1849, [[Victor Cousin]] published ''Petri Abaelardi opera'', in part based on the two Paris editions of 1616 but also based on the reading of four manuscripts; this became the standard edition of the letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radice|1947|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in 1855, Migne printed an expanded version of the 1616 edition under the title ''Opera Petri Abaelardi'', without the name of Héloïse on the title page.

Critical editions of the ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' and the letters were subsequently published in the 1950s and 1960s.

At various times in the past two hundred years, it has been suggested that not all the letters are genuine. Questions were first raised in 1806 by Ignaz Fessler, and were renewed by J. C. Orelli in 1844 and [[Ludovic Lalanne]] in 1855, who all suggested that the letters might simply be a literary fiction. Doubts were raised at intervals in the succeeding decades. More recently, John Benton hypothesised (in 1972) that the entire letter collection might have been forged in the late 13th century, or by Abelard himself (a position Benton had reverted to by 1979). In the aftermath of reaction to Benton's thought, though, scholars have become more confident in asserting the genuine nature of the letters.&lt;ref&gt;Constant J. Mews, ''Abelard and Héloïse'', (Oxford: OUP, 2005), p16&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Constant Mews]], ''The Lost Love Letters of Héloïse and Abelard'', 113 anonymous love letters found in a 15th-century manuscript represent the correspondence exchanged by Héloïse and Abelard during the earlier phase of their affair.&lt;ref name="Mews2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mews|first=Constant|title=The Lost Love Letters of Héloïse and Abelard: Perceptions of Dialogue in Twelfth-Century France| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2001|isbn=978-0-312-23941-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not to be confused with the accepted ''Letters of Abelard and Héloïse'' which were written nearly fifteen years after their romance ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-866262-4|author=Marenbon, John|editor=Robert E. Bjork|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
Abelard was also long known as an important poet and [[composer]]. He composed some celebrated love songs for Héloïse that are now lost, and which have not been identified in the anonymous repertoire. Héloïse praised these songs in a letter: "The great charm and sweetness in language and music, and a soft attractiveness of the melody obliged even the unlettered".&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Peter Abelard|author=Lorenz Weinrich|access-date=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abelard composed a hymnbook for the religious community that Héloïse joined. This hymnbook, written after 1130, differed from contemporary hymnals, such as that of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in that Abelard used completely new and homogeneous material. The songs were grouped by metre, which meant that comparatively few melodies could be used. Only one melody from this hymnal survives, ''O quanta qualia''.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

Abelard also wrote six biblical ''[[planctus]]'' ([[lament]]s):
* Planctus Dinae filiae Iacob; inc.: Abrahae proles Israel nata (Planctus I)
* Planctus Iacob super filios suos; inc.: Infelices filii, patri nati misero (Planctus II)
* Planctus virginum Israel super filia Jepte Galadite; inc.: Ad festas choreas celibes (Planctus III)
* Planctus Israel super Samson; inc.: Abissus vere multa (Planctus IV)
* Planctus David super Abner, filio Neronis, quem Ioab occidit; inc.: Abner fidelissime (Planctus V)
* Planctus David super Saul et Jonatha; inc.: Dolorum solatium (Planctus VI).

In surviving manuscripts these pieces have been notated in diastematic [[neume]]s which resist reliable transcription. Only Planctus VI was fixed in square notation. Planctus as genre influenced the subsequent development of the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]], a song form that flourished in northern Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Melodies that have survived have been praised as "flexible, expressive melodies [that] show an elegance and technical adroitness that are very similar to the qualities that have been long admired in Abelard's poetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/gramofilereview.asp?reviewID=9503094&amp;mediaID=38977&amp;issue=Reviewed%3A+Gramophone+3%2F1995 |last=Oliver |first=Michael |title=Review: a CD of Abelard's music |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |year=1995 |accessdate=7 December 2008 |registration=yes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209235712/http://www.gramophone.co.uk/gramofilereview.asp?reviewID=9503094&amp;mediaID=38977&amp;issue=Reviewed%3A+Gramophone+3%2F1995 |archivedate=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pijao''' (''Piajao'', Pinao) is an [[unclassified languages|unclassified]] [[indigenous American language]] that was spoken in the villages of Orrega, Coyaima (Koyai, Tupe) and Natagaima in the [[Magdalena River]] Valley of Colombia until the 1950s.

A small vocabulary list was collected in 1943; only 30 Pijao words and expressions are known. The few words which resemble [[Carib languages|Carib]] are thought to be loans; toponyms in Pijao country are also Carib. Marshall &amp; Seijas (1973) did not detect significative connections between Pijao and other unclassified languages of the area: [[unclassified language of South America#Colima|Colima]], [[Muzo language|Muzo]], [[Pantagora language|Pantágora]], and [[Panche language|Panche]], but these are even more poorly attested than Pijao.

| bgcolor=#FFE0BB
| quote = Raghuveer's poetry is particularly remarkable for its profundity of thoughts and the meaningful use of images and symbols. Thought "poetry" remains his first love, the form he has consistently explored, is "novel". His faith in the functional aspect of human life has progressively strengthened. It is voiced through his novels ''Amrita'', ''Venu Vatsala'' and ''Uparvas triology''. ''Rudra Mahalaya'' is a landmark in Gujarati historical novel writing. His essays contains a combination of microscopic observation concerning the art of creative writing and a vivid presentation of thought. His style of writing tinged with his unique sense of humour adds to the readability of his essays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="439">In [[typography]], a '''runaround''' is where the ends of lines of text are adjusted to conform to a box or irregular shape, rather than a simple vertical column margin. This is done where an image or other content (known as an '''intrusion''') occupies part of a column, with the text conforming to the shape of the object.

'''Siamou''', also known as '''Sɛmɛ''' (Seme), is a [[Kru language]] of the [[Niger–Congo language family]]. In 1999, it was spoken by 20,000 people in western [[Burkina Faso]] and another 20,000 in the [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Mali]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; In Burkina Faso, it is mainly spoken in the province of [[Kénédougou Province|Kénédougou]], around the provincial capital [[Orodara]]. Siamou has one major dialect, Bandougou. In addition, there are minor dialectal differences among the Siamou spoken in Orodara and in surrounding villages.

Siamou is traditionally classed as Kru, however according to [[Roger Blench]] (2013) the language bears little resemblance to Kru.&lt;ref&gt;Blench (2013:50)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''style''' is a set of linguistic variants with specific [[social]] meanings. In this context, social meanings can include group membership, personal attributes, or beliefs. [[Variation (linguistics)|Linguistic variation]] is at the heart of the concept of linguistic style—without variation there is no basis for distinguishing social meanings. Variation can occur [[Syntax|syntactically]], [[Lexicon|lexically]], and [[Phonology|phonologically]].

Many approaches to interpreting and defining style incorporate the concepts of [[indexicality]], indexical order, stance-taking, and [[language ideology|linguistic ideology]]. Note that a style is not a fixed attribute of a speaker. Rather, a speaker may use different styles depending on context. Additionally, speakers often incorporate elements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or subconsciously, thereby creating a new style.

==Origins==
[[William Labov]] first introduced the concept of style in the context of sociolinguistics in the 1960s, though he did not explicitly define the term.&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;Labov, W. (1966). The social stratification of English in New York City.[Washington]: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov primarily studied individual linguistic variables, and how they were associated with various social groups (e.g. social classes). He summed up his ideas about style in five principles:&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1984. "Field Methods of the Project in Linguistic Change and Variation." In John Baugh and Joel Sherzer, eds., Language in Use, Prentice-Hall: 28-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
;"There are no single style speakers." : [[#Style-shifting|Style-shifting]] occurs in all speakers to a different degree; interlocutors regularly and consistently change their linguistic forms according to context.
;"Styles can be ranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech." : Style-shifting correlates strongly with the amount of attention paid to speech. According to studies conducted by Labov, this was one of the single most important factors that determined whether or not an interlocutor would make a style-shift.
;"The vernacular, in which the minimum attention is paid to speech, provides the most systematic data for linguistic analysis." : Labov characterized the vernacular as the original base mode of speech, learned at a very young age, on which more complex styles build later in life. This "basic" style has the least variation, and provides the most general account of the style of a given group.
;"Any systematic observation of a speaker defines a formal context where more than the minimum attention is paid to speech." : In other words, even formal face-to-face interviews severely limit a speaker’s use of their vernacular style. An interlocutor’s vernacular style is most likely displayed if they do not perceive outside observers, and are not paying immediate attention to their own speech.
;"Face-to-face interviews are the only means of obtaining the volume and quality of recorded speech that is needed for quantitative analysis." : Quantitative analysis requires the kind of data that must be obtained in a very obvious, formal way.

Labov’s work primarily attempted to linked linguistic variants as a function of formality (a proxy for attention to speech) to specific social groups. In his study of /r/-variation in New York Department stores, he observed that those with a lower social class are less likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in words like ''fourth'' and ''floor'', while those with a higher social class are more likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in their less careful speech. However, once forced to pay attention to language, they style-shift in a way indicative of their social aspirations. That is, those with a middle social class often alter their pronunciation of /r/ in a way that is generally indicative of a higher social standing, while those with a lower or higher social class more or less maintain their original pronunciation (presumably because they were either happy with their current position in the social hierarchy or resigned to it).&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William.. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern approaches==

===Indexical order===
[[Penelope Eckert|Penny Eckert's]]&lt;ref name="Eckert"&gt;Eckert, Penelope. Variation and the indexical field. Journal of Sociolinguistics, 2008, 12: 453–476.&lt;/ref&gt; characterization of style as related to indexicality marked the beginning of a new approach to linguistic style. She builds on [[Michael Silverstein|Michael Silverstein's]] notion of [[Indexicality|indexical]] order: the notion that linguistic variables index a social group, which by association leads to the indexing of certain traits stereotypically associated with members of that group.  For example, in New York in the 1960s, a study by Labov&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; showed that the clear articulation of postvocalic [r] in words like "fourth" and "floor" indexed a higher class (in New York), whereas the absence of postvocalic [r] indexed a lower class.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; However, the presence of lack of postvocalic [r] can also function as a higher order indexical that points indirectly to traits stereotypically associated with members of the upper or lower class.  In this way, not articulating the [r] in the word "fourth" could index, for example, a lack of education (the trait) in addition to a lower social class (the group). According to this theory, any linguistic variable has its own indexical field spanning any number of potential meanings; the meanings actually associated with the variable are determined by social context and the style in which the variable is being used.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; These indexical fields are fluid and often change depending on their usage in different contexts or in combination with other variables. This view of style revolves around variation, and interpretation of variation as a purely indexical system built from [[Ideology|ideological]] connections.

===Ideology===
In [[Judith Irvine]]'s conception of style she emphasizes the fact that a style is defined only within a social framework.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;[[Judith Irvine|Irvine, Judith]]. Style as distinctiveness: The culture and ideology of linguistic differentiation. In Penelope Eckert and John Rickford (eds.) Style and Sociolinguistic Variation. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2001, 21–43.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant and the social meanings it indexes are not inherently linked, rather, the social meanings exist as ideologically mediated interpretations made by members of the social framework. She highlights the fact that social meanings such as group membership mean nothing without an [[ideology]] to interpret them.

[[Mary Bucholtz|Mary Bucholtz's]] approach to style also relies heavily on ideology. She defines style as "a unidimensional continuum between vernacular and standard that varies based on the degree of speaker self-monitoring in a given speech context".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/~tylers/notes/emotion/Bucholtz_2009_reading_notes_Schnoebelen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This continuum depends on the ideology of the speaker, for they self-monitor depending on their ideologies concerning particular words. Bucholtz explains the ideology of gendered slang, in particular, the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] slang for "dude", guey. Guey indexes a stance of cool solidarity, and indirectly, [masculinity]. Ochs's framework for stance dictates that stances are ideologically connected with social groups. Bucholtz argues that ideology connects the stylistic feature of using guey with particular groups of people based on age, gender (male), and race. She also defines the concept of stylization as a set of deviations from the style one would expect from a situation according to the ideology of the style and how it matches up to the situation at hand. This leads to the [[indexicality|indexing]] of groups with which the style is associated, and thus simplifies the indexical field at hand.

===Stance-taking===
Other theories on style often incorporate the role of stance-taking. These theories maintain that style is best viewed as consisting of smaller, more variable units known as stances. In this view, a stance is essentially a form of contextualization; it indicates the position of an interlocutor with respect to a particular utterance, conversation or other interlocutors.&lt;ref name="Johnstone"&gt;Johnstone, Barbara. "Stance, Style, and the Linguistic Individual" Sociolinguistic Perspectives on Stance,. Ed. Alexandra Jaffe. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An interlocutor's use of language could imply, for instance,  that they feel a certain way about an issue at hand, or that they do not care for the subject, or the people around them; these positions with respect to the context are different stances.

According to stance theory, a given interlocutor uses certain variations among linguistic variables to take a stance or stances in an interaction. The set of stances interlocutors tend to repeat or use the most often in certain contexts (or in general) comprise their style. [[File:Stances.png|thumb|400px|Robert Podesva's depiction of the indexical relationships between linguistic resources, acts or activities, stance and style.]] This approach focuses more on interaction and reaction in a linguistic context, rather than a static identity or social group. Linguistic variables do not index specific social groups by themselves, but instead combine with other linguistic variables to index various stances and styles, which are in turn associated with social groups.&lt;ref name="Kiesling"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. A variable, a style, a stance: Word-final -er and ethnicity in Australian English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkham, Sam. 2011. Personal style and epistemic stance in classroom discussion. Language and Literature 20(3). 207-217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;  Kiesling writes:

{{cquote|In this view, personal styles are composed of a set, or repertoire, of stances, and a way of speaking represents not simply a personal style but a stance that a person tends to adopt repeatedly over time ... Because some stances are more favored by one group than another, this gives the appearance that a linguistic item directly indexes ...  that group, where in actuality it also, or primarily, indexes a stance … &lt;ref name=Kiesling/&gt;}}

In this model of linguistic variation, stances are an important middle step between linguistic variables and a style or characteristic social group.

==Emergence of new styles==

===Performative creation of new styles===
The [[Performativity|performative]] creation of style is the result of a desire to project a certain social image or [[#Style and stance|stance]]. [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|Interlocutors]] who wish to present in a certain manner may consciously alter their linguistic style to affect how they appear to others. An example of this performative style is exemplified by non-linguistic situations. In one study, Eckert interviewed several female students at [[Palo Alto High School]] in California. "New-wave" teens who wished to be distinctive adapted a more rebellious fashion style, wearing mostly dark clothes and pegged jeans, whereas popular, "[[preppy]]" girls tended towards light pastel colors and straight designer jeans.  However, a couple girls wished to portray themselves as unique without losing their popular [[Conformity|conformist]] [[Social identity theory|social identity]]. The table below compares resulting styles:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| eye makeup!! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| general color scheme !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| pants
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "New-wave" girls|| dark/black || black || black, pegged
|-
| style="text-align:left;"|  "Preppy" girls|| light/none || pastels || blue designer straight-cut
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "Preppy but unique" girls || light/none || pastels || blue, pegged
|}

As Eckert demonstrates, the "preppy" girls who wished to maintain a slightly distinctive style combined certain aspects of the "preppy" style with the "new-wave" style. They maintained their color choices and shied away from dark eye-makeup—but wore blue pegged jeans instead of the standard designer jeans of their group. This is because they perceive that the eye makeup indexes an "adult" or "slutty" characteristic, while the all-black color scheme is "scary".

In the same way, interlocutors often choose to performatively create their own linguistic style to suit the self-image they desire. In a [[#Gay styles|case study conducted by Podesva]], he studies the style of a gay lawyer, who combines certain aspects of common professional and gay linguistic features to create his own style, indexing both a "professional lawyer" characteristic and a unique "gay" characteristic with his speech.

===Nonperformative emergence of new styles===
Styles are not necessarily consciously created; there are a number of processes that contribute to the construction of meaning for both individual speech variants and styles. Obviously, individual variants can be adopted by multiple styles. When a variant is newly adopted by a style, it changes both the perception of the variant and the perception of the style. In the Eckertian view, a person's linguistic style identifies their position in an indexical field of social meanings. These social meanings are created by a continual analysis and interpretation of the linguistic variants that are observed based on who uses them.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irvine/&gt;

==Style-shifting==
Style shifting refers to a single speaker changing style in response to context. As noted by Eckert and Rickford,&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-59789-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eckert, Penelope |author2=Rickford, John |title=Style and sociolinguistic variation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-521-59789-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in sociolinguistic literature terms style and '''register''' sometimes have been used interchangeably. Also, various connotations of style are a subject of study in [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]].

Style-shifting is a manifestation of intraspeaker (within-speaker) variation, in contrast with interspeaker (between-speakers) variation. It is a voluntary act which an individual effects in order to respond to or initiate changes in sociolinguistic situation (e.g., interlocutor-related, setting-related, topic-related).

[[William Labov]], while conducting [[Sociolinguistics#Traditional sociolinguistic interview|sociolinguistic interviews]], designated two types of spoken style, casual and formal, and three types of reading style (a reading passage, a word list, and a [[minimal pair]] list). Analysing style-shifting Labov postulated that "styles can be arranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech" (1972, as quoted in&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Milroy, Lesley |author2=Gordon, John |title=Sociolinguistics: Method and Interpretation |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-631-22225-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), casual style requiring the least amount of conscious self-monitoring. Such style-shifting is often referred to as responsive (produced in response to normative pressures).&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"/&gt;

In recent developments of stylistic variation analysis scholars such as [[Allan Bell (Sociolinguist)|Allan Bell]], [[Barbara Johnstone]], Natalie Schilling-Estes have been focusing on initiative dimension of style-shifting, which occurs when speakers proactively choose among various linguistic resources (e.g. dialectal, archaic or [[vernacular]] forms) in order to present themselves in a specific way. In initiative style-shifting speakers actively engage in  social practices to construct social meaning.

There have been a large number of suggested motivations for this phenomenon:
;Attention to speech model : In the attention to speech model it is proposed that the style a speaker uses is dependent on how much attention the speaker is paying to their own speech, which in turn is dependent on the formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="Labov1972a"&gt;Labov, William. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labov1972b"&gt;Labov, William.. Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society,1972, 1.97-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, each speaker has one most natural style, which is defined as the style the speaker uses when paying the least attention (i.e. in the most casual situations). Criticisms of this model include that it is difficult to quantify attention paid to speech&lt;ref name="Kies"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. 1998. Men’s identities and sociolinguistic variation: The case of fraternity men. Journal of Sociolinguistics 2/1.69-99&lt;/ref&gt; and the model suggests that a speaker has only one style for a given level of formality.&lt;ref name="Hindle"&gt;Hindle, D. The social and situational conditioning of phonetic variation. Dissertation. University of Pennsylvania, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Communication accommodation theory : Communication accommodation theory (CAT) seeks to explain style-shifting in terms of two processes: convergence, in which the speaker attempts to shift their speech to match that of the interlocuter to gain social approval, and divergence, in which the speaker attempts to distance themselves from the interlocuter by shifting their speech away from that of the interlocuter.&lt;ref name="Schilling-Este"&gt;Kiesling, S. F., and Schilling-Estes, N. Language Style as Identity Construction: A Footing and Framing Approach. Poster presented at NWAVE 27, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Two specific shortcomings of this basic form of CAT include its inability to explain situations in which convergence occurs when the motivation is clearly not social approval (e.g. in arguments)&lt;ref&gt;Mosher, D., Mortimer, L., Grebel, M. Verbal aggressive behavior in delinquent boys. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 1968 73.454-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., and Kendon, A. The experimental analysis of social performance. Advances in experimental social psychology, Berkowitz, L. (ed.), 1967 vol. 3, 55-98. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that non-convergent speech is often used to maintain social distance in asymmetric relationships (e.g. employer-employee).&lt;ref&gt;Montepare, J. M., and Vega, C. Women’s vocal reactions to intimate and casual male friends. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 1988 14.103-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Audience design model : The audience design model is very similar to communication accommodation theory with an added component: the audience design model proposes the existence of nonpresent reference groups, with which a speaker may converge or diverge.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, Allan. Language style as audience design. Language in Society, 1984 13.145-204.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speakers constantly negotiating their relationship, not only with the audience, but also with other nonpresent people or groups that come up in the discourse.&lt;ref name=Schilling-Este/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BellJohnson"&gt;Bell, Allan, and Johnson, Gary. Towards a sociolinguistics of style. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.1: A Selection of Papers from NWAVE, 1997, 25. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Style-shifting as an act of identity: Style shifting can be a creative process, in which speakers shape their speech to associate or disassociate themselves with specific social groups. Furthermore, a speaker does not have an underlying style. Rather, the casual speech style that some sociolinguists consider fundamental is no more fundamental than any other style.&lt;ref name="LePage"&gt;LePage, R.B., and Andrée Tabouret-Keller. Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press,1985&lt;/ref&gt;
;Footing and framing model : A footing is a role that a speaker occupies and may be described as follows:{{Quote| &lt;br&gt;"[footings] may change many times during the course of a single interaction, and speakers often balance a number of roles simultaneously, since footing exist on a number of different levels, from the personal interactional (e.g. the role of `friend') to the institutional (e.g. `CEO of a corporation') to the sociocultural (e.g. `Native American male')."&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;}}By style shifting speakers are able to cast themselves in different footings. Also central to this model is the frame of the discourse, which is the feeling of the interactants about what kind of interaction is occurring (e.g. formal interview, casual conversation, political discussion, etc.). Different frames are being continuously foregrounded and backgrounded relative to one another throughout the discourse. The footings that speakers adopt through style-shifting are dependent on which frames are most prominent at any given time.&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving, Forms of talk. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style matching==
Style matching is defined as the matching of behaviors between a speaker and an [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]].&lt;ref name="N"&gt;Niederhoffer, Kate G. Pennebaker, James W. Linguistic Style Matching in Social Interaction. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, Vol.21No.4,December 2002. 337-360 {{doi|10.1177/026192702237953}} 2002 Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  The premise of the theory is that individuals have the ability to strategically negotiate the social distance between themselves and their interaction partners.  This can be done linguistically, [[paralinguistic]]ally, and non-verbally, for example, by varying speech style, rate, pitch, and [[gaze]].

One theory behind linguistic style matching suggests that the words one speaker uses prime the listener to respond in a specific way. In this fashion, an interlocutor is influenced by her partner’s language at the word level in natural conversation in the same way that one’s non-verbal behavior can be influenced by another’s movement.

Additionally, Kate G. Niederhoffer&lt;ref name=N/&gt; proposes a coordination-engagement hypothesis, which suggests that the degree of engagement should be predictive of both linguistic and nonverbal coordination. There exists an interactional complexity whereby people can converge on some communicative features to meet social needs, but diverge on others for identity management. For example, one can diverge in accent but converge in [[lexical diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Fuller (1996). When cultural maintenance means linguistic convergence: Pennsylvania German evidence for the Matrix Language Turnover hypothesis. Language in Society, 25 , pp 493-514 {{doi|10.1017/S0047404500020790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals in two-person interactions exhibit linguistic style matching on both the conversational level and on a turn-by-turn level.&lt;ref name=N/&gt; This coordinated use of language occurs at a remarkably basic level (e.g., classes of words) and appears to occur independently of the perceived quality of an interaction, the length of the interaction, whether the interaction is face-to-face or on an Internet-like chat, etc.  Socially, two people appear to fall into this coordinated way of interacting almost immediately even if they have never spoken to one another before. The listener is influenced by many linguistic primes set up by the speaker. All of this occurs on an unconscious level and is sensitive to the power differential between the participants, with less dominant participants generally being more attentive to more dominant participants’ words.

==Case studies==

===Urban styles===
An opposition between urban and suburban linguistic variables is common to all metropolitan regions of the United States. Although the particular variables distinguishing urban and suburban styles may differ from place to place, the trend is for urban styles to lead in the use of nonstandard forms and [[negative concord]].
In Penny Eckert’s study of Belten High in the Detroit suburbs, she noted a stylistic difference between two groups that she identified: school-oriented jocks and urban-oriented, school-alienated burnouts.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; The variables she analyzed were the usage of negative concord and the mid and low vowels involved in the [[Northern Cities Shift]], which consists of the following changes: æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, ə &gt; a, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ  ([y] here is equivalent to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol [j]). All of these changes are urban-led, as is the use of negative concord.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Burnouts.PNG|thumb|400px|alt=burnouts diagram|Use of Detroit variables involved in the Northern Cities Shift (NCS) by gender and social category. Black = greatest use, gray = second greatest use.]] --&gt;The older, mostly stabilized changes, æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, and ə &gt; a, were used the most by women, while the newer changes, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ were used the most by burnouts. Eckert theorizes that by using an urban variant such as [foyt], they were not associating themselves with urban youth. Rather, they were trying to [[indexicality|index]] traits that were associated with urban youth, such as "tough" and "street-smart".

This theory is further supported by evidence from a subgroup within the burnout girls, which Eckert refers to as ‘burned-out’ burnout girls. She characterizes this group as being even more anti-establishment than the ‘regular’ burnout girls. This subgroup led overall in the use of negative concord as well as in female-led changes. This is unusual because negative concord is generally used the most by males. ‘Burned-out’ burnout girls were not indexing masculinity &amp;mdash; this is shown by their use of female-led variants and the fact that they were found to express femininity in non-linguistic ways. This shows that linguistic variables may have different meanings in the context of different styles.

===Gay styles===

There is some debate about what makes a style "gay." In stereotypically flamboyant gay speech, the phonemes /s/ and /l/ have a greater duration.&lt;ref name="Christ"&gt;Crist, Sean. 1997. Duration of Onset Consonants in Gay Male Stereotyped Speech. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.3.53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; People are also more likely to identify those with higher frequency ranges as gay.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, Henry, Ron Smyth, and Greg Jacobs. 2000. Vowel and Sibilant Duration in Gay- and Straight-sounding Male Speech. Paper presented at the International Gender and Language Association Conference 1, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are many different styles represented within the gay community. There is much linguistic [[variation (linguistics)|variation]] in the gay community, and each subculture appears to have its own distinct [[feature (linguistics)|features]]. According to Podesva et al., "gay culture encompasses reified categories such as leather daddies, clones, drag queens, circuit boys, guppies (gay yuppies), gay prostitutes, and activists both mainstream and radical, as well as more local communities of practice which may not even have names."&lt;ref name="Podesva"&gt;Podesva, Robert J., Sarah J. Roberts and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler. 2002. Sharing resources and indexing meanings in the production of gay styles. In Kathryn Campbell-Kibler, Robert J. Podesva, Sarah J. Roberts and Andrew Wong (eds.) Language and Sexuality: Contesting Meaning in Theory and Practice. Stanford , California : CSLI Press. 175–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, each of these sub-cultures speaks with a different style than all the other sub-cultures.

There are also many features that are fairly prevalent in all of society but can index homosexuality in particular contexts. "Cooperative discourse" is often considered a feature of gay linguistic style, but is also used by some straight men, as well as by women.&lt;ref&gt;Leap, William L. 1996. Word’s Out: Gay Men’s English. Minneapolis: University of
Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with an approach to style that emphasizes stance.

Podesva et al.&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt; performed a study describing a sub-style within gay culture that some gay activists, lawyers, or other professionals use. The gay lawyer in their study does not want to appear "too gay," lest he also convey frivolity or other characteristics that he deemed unprofessional. It was important to him that he appear rational, educated, and competent as a lawyer. This is in line with the audience approach to style in which styles receive their meaning as a result of their opposition to other styles in their social sphere (in this case other gay styles). The lawyer's high release of word final stops, a variable also often found in the language of geek-girls and Orthodox Jews, indexes a desire to appear educated and not "too gay."  This actually indexes his gay [[identity (social science)|identity]] because he is tailoring his gay style (or lack thereof).&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;

'''Turumsa''' is a possibly extinct [[Papuan language]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It has been classified as a [[Bosavi languages|Bosavi language]], and is 19% lexically similar with the Bosavi language [[Dibiyaso language|Dibiyaso]], but this appears to be due to loans. It has a greater (61%) lexical similarity with [[Doso language|Doso]], its only clear relative.&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt;

The '''Uralic languages''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ʊəˈr|æ|l|ᵻ|k}}; sometimes called '''Uralian languages''' {{IPAc-en|j|ʊəˈr|ei|l|i|ə|n}}) form a [[language family]] of 38&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/uralic|title=Uralic|last1=Simons|first1=Gary F.|last2=Fenning|first2=Charles F.|work=Ethnologue|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[language]]s spoken by approximately 25{{nbsp}}million people, predominantly in Northern [[Eurasia]]. The Uralic languages with the most native speakers are [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], which are official languages in [[Hungary]], [[Finland]], and [[Estonia]], respectively, and in the [[European Union]]. Other Uralic languages with significant numbers of speakers are [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]], and [[Komi language|Komi]], which are [[Languages of Russia|officially recognized languages]] in various regions of [[Russia]].

The name "Uralic" derives from the fact that the areas where the languages are spoken are found on both sides of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Also, the original homeland ([[Urheimat]]) is commonly [[Proto-Uralic homeland hypotheses|hypothesized]] to be in the vicinity of the Urals.

[[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] is sometimes used as a synonym for Uralic, though Finno-Ugric is widely understood to exclude the [[Samoyedic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mood in the Languages of Europe |last=Tommola |first=Hannu |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |location= |isbn=90-272-0587-6 |page=155 |pages= |chapter=Finnish among the Finno-Ugrian languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3L8oKcbZtoC&amp;pg=PA511&amp;dq |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who do not accept the traditional notion that Samoyedic split first from the rest of the Uralic family may treat the terms as synonymous.

==History==
{{further|Proto-Uralic}}

===Homeland===
{{further|Proto-Uralic homeland hypotheses}}
In recent times, linguists often place the [[Urheimat]] (original homeland) of the [[Proto-Uralic language]] in the vicinity of the [[Volga River]], west of the Urals, close to the Urheimat of the [[Indo-European languages]], or to the east and southeast of the Urals. Historian [[Gyula László]] places its origin in the forest zone between the [[Oka River]] and central [[Poland]]. E.&amp;nbsp;N. Setälä and M.&amp;nbsp;Zsirai place it between the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Kama River]]s. According to E.&amp;nbsp;Itkonen, the ancestral area extended to the [[Baltic Sea]]. P.&amp;nbsp;Hajdu has suggested a homeland in western and northwestern [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia'', p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early attestations===
The first plausible mention of a Uralic people is in [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' (c. 98 AD),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Anderson  | first = J.G.C. (ed.)  | authorlink =   | title = Germania  | publisher = Clarendon Press  | location = Oxford  | year = 1938  | page =   | doi =   | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning the ''[[Fenni]]'' (usually interpreted as referring to the [[Sami people|Sami]]) and two other possibly Uralic tribes living in the farthest reaches of Scandinavia. There are many possible earlier mentions, including the [[Iyrcae]] (perhaps related to Yugra) described by [[Herodotus]] living in what is now European Russia, and the [[Budini]], described by Herodotus as notably red-haired (a characteristic feature of the [[Udmurt people|Udmurts]]) and living in northeast Ukraine and/or adjacent parts of Russia. In the late 15th century, European scholars noted the resemblance of the names ''Hungaria'' and ''[[Yugra|Yugria]]'', the names of settlements east of the Ural. They assumed a connection but did not seek linguistic evidence.&lt;ref name="Sebeok-2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sebeok |first=Thomas A.  |title=Portrait Of Linguists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wxjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 |date=15 August 2002 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4411-5874-1 |page=58 |oclc=956101732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uralic studies===
[[File:Herberstein-Moscovia-NE.png|thumb|The Siberian origin of Hungarians was long hypothesized by European scholars. Here, [[Sigismund von Herberstein]]'s 1549 map of [[Moscovia]] shows "[[Yugra]] from where the [[Hungarians]] originated" (''Iuhra inde ungaroru origo''), east of the [[Ob River]]. The Ural Mountains in the middle of the maps are labeled ''Montes dicti Cingulus Terræ'' ("The mountains called the Girdle of the Earth")]]

The affinity of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] was first proposed in the late 17th century. Three candidates can be credited for the discovery: the [[Germany|German]] scholar [[Martin Vogel]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]] scholar [[Georg Stiernhielm]] and the Swedish courtier [[Bengt Skytte]]. Vogel's unpublished study of the relationship, commissioned by [[Cosimo III]] of Tuscany, was clearly the most modern of these: he established several [[grammatical]] and [[Lexical analysis|lexical]] parallels between Finnish and Hungarian as well as [[Sami languages|Sami]]. Stiernhelm commented on the similarities of Sami, Estonian and Finnish, and also on a few similar words between Finnish and Hungarian.{{sfn|Korhonen|1981|p=29}}{{sfn|Wickman|1988|pp=793–794}} These authors were the first to outline what was to become the classification of the Finno-Ugric, and later Uralic family. This proposal received some of its initial impetus from the fact that these languages, unlike most of the other languages spoken in Europe, are not part of what is now known as the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family. In 1717, Swedish professor [[Olaus Rudbeckius, Jr.|Olof Rudbeck]] proposed about 100 etymologies connecting Finnish and Hungarian, of which about 40 are still considered valid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several early reports comparing Finnish or Hungarian with Mordvin, Mari or Khanty were additionally collected by [[Leibniz]] and edited by his assistant [[Johann Georg von Eckhart]].{{sfn|Korhonen|1981|pp=29-30}}

In 1730, [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published his book {{Lang|de|Das Nord- und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia}} (''The North and East Parts of Europe and Asia''), surveying the geography, peoples and languages of Russia. All the main groups of the Uralic languages were already identified here.{{sfn|Wickman|1988|pp=795–796}} Nonetheless, these relationships were not widely accepted. Hungarian intellectuals especially were not interested in the theory and preferred to assume connections with [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes, an attitude characterized by Merritt Ruhlen as due to "the wild unfettered [[Romanticism]] of the epoch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the World's Languages|last=Ruhlen|first=Merritt|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1987|location=Stanford|pages=64–71|language=English|oclc=923421379|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in spite of this hostile climate, the Hungarian [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[János Sajnovics]] travelled with [[Maximilian Hell]] to survey the alleged relationship between Hungarian and Sami. Sajnovics published his results in 1770, arguing for a relationship based on several grammatical features.{{sfn|Wickman|1988|pp=796-798}} In 1799, the Hungarian [[Samuel Gyarmathi|Sámuel Gyarmathi]] published the most complete work on Finno-Ugric to that date.{{sfn|Wickman|1988|p=798}}[[File:Uralic languages in the Russian Empire (1897).svg|upright=1.36|thumb|right|Uralic languages in the Russian Empire (Russian Census of 1897; the census was not held in Finland because it was an autonomous area)]]

Up to the beginning of the 19th century, knowledge on the Uralic languages spoken in Russia had remained restricted to scanty observations by travelers. Already Finnish historian [[Henrik Gabriel Porthan]] had stressed that further progress would require dedicated field missions.{{sfn|Korhonen|1986|32}} One of the first of these was undertaken by [[Anders Johan Sjögren]], who brought the [[Vepsians]] to general knowledge and elucidated in detail the relatedness of Finnish and [[Komi language|Komi]].{{sfn|Korhonen|1986|44-46}} Still more extensive were the field research expeditions made in the 1840s by [[Matthias Castrén]] (1813–1852) and [[Antal Reguly]] (1819–1858), who focused especially on the Samoyedic and the [[Ob-Ugric languages]], respectively. Reguly's materials were worked on by the Hungarian linguist Pál Hunfalvy (1810–1891) and German Josef Budenz (1836–1892), who both supported the Uralic affinity of Hungarian.{{sfn|Wickman|1988|pp=801-803}} Budenz was the first scholar to bring this result to popular consciousness in Hungary, and to attempt a reconstruction of the Proto-Finno-Ugric grammar and lexicon.{{sfn|Wickman|1988|pp=803–804}} Another late-19th-century Hungarian contribution is that of Ignácz Halász (1855–1901), who published extensive comparative material of Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic in the 1890s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ignácz|last=Halász|title=Az ugor-szamojéd nyelvrokonság kérdése|year=1893|journal=Nyelvtudományi Közlemények|volume=23:1|pp=14–34|url=http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/023.pdf|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ignácz|last=Halász|title=Az ugor-szamojéd nyelvrokonság kérdése II|year=1893|journal=Nyelvtudományi Közlemények|volume=23:3|pp=260–278|url=http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/023.pdf|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ignácz|last=Halász|title=Az ugor-szamojéd nyelvrokonság kérdése III|year=1893|journal=Nyelvtudományi Közlemények|volume=23:4|pp=436–447|url=http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/023.pdf|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ignácz|last=Halász|title=Az ugor-szamojéd nyelvrokonság kérdése IV|year=1894|journal=Nyelvtudományi Közlemények|volume=24:4|pp=443–469|url=http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/024.pdf|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose work is at the base of today's wide acceptance of the inclusion of Samoyedic as a part of Uralic.&lt;ref name="Szabo69"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szabó|first=László|date=|year=1969|title=Die Erforschung der Verhältnisses Finnougrisch–Samojedisch|url=|journal=Ural-Altaische Jahrbücher|language=de|volume=41|pages=|via=|pp=317–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], a chair for Finnish language and linguistics at the [[University of Helsinki]] was created in 1850, first held by Castrén.{{sfn|Wickman|1988|pp=799–800}}

In 1883, the [[Finno-Ugrian Society]] was founded in Helsinki on the proposal of [[Otto Donner]], which would lead to Helsinki overtaking St. Petersburg as the chief northern center of research of the Uralic languages.{{sfn|Korhonen|1986|49}} During the late 19th and early 20th century (until the separation of Finland from Russia following the [[Russian revolution]]), a large number of [[wikt:stipendiate|stipendiates]] were sent by the Society to survey the still less known Uralic languages. Major researchers of this period included Heikki Paasonen (studying especially the [[Mordvinic languages]]), Yrjö Wichmann (studying [[Permic languages|Permic]]), Artturi Kannisto ([[Mansi language|Mansi]]), Kustaa Fredrik Karjalainen ([[Khanty language|Khanty]]), Toivo Lehtisalo ([[Nenets languages|Nenets]]), and [[Kai Donner]] ([[Kamassian language|Kamass]]).{{sfn|Wickman|1988|pp=810–811}} The vast amounts of data collected on these expeditions would provide edition work for later generations of Finnish Uralicists for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgr.fi/lexica/lexicaxxxv.html|title=Lexica Societatis Fenno-Ugricae XXXV|last=|first=|date=|work=Suomalais-Ugrilainen Seura|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uralic family comprises nine undisputed groups with no consensus classification between them. (Some of the proposals are listed in the next section.) An agnostic approach treats them as separate branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/fu.html|title=Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) languages|last=Salminen|first=Tapani|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traces of Finno-Ugric substrata, especially in toponymy, in the northern part of European Russia have been proposed as evidence for even more extinct Uralic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helimski |first=Eugene |authorlink=Eugene Helimski |title=The Slavicization of the Russian North (Slavica Helsingiensia 27) |editor-last=Nuorluoto |editor-first=Juhani |chapter=The «Northwestern» group of Finno-Ugric languages and its heritage in the place names and substratum vocabulary of the Russian North |year=2006 |publisher=Department of Slavonic and Baltic Languages and Literatures |location=Helsinki |isbn=978-952-10-2852-6 |pages=109–127 |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/venaja/nwrussia/eng/Conference/pdf/Helimski.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional classification===

All Uralic languages are thought to have descended, through independent processes of [[language change]], from [[Proto-Uralic language|Proto-Uralic]]. The internal structure of the Uralic family has been debated since the family was first proposed.&lt;ref name="Marcantonio-p55-68"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Uralic Language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics|last=Marcantonio|first=Angela|publisher=Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-631-23170-7|series=Publications of the Philological Society|volume=35|location=Oxford|pages=55–68|oclc=803186861|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts about the validity of most of the proposed higher-order branchings (grouping the nine undisputed families) are becoming more common.&lt;ref name=Marcantonio-p55-68/&gt;&lt;ref name="SalmTax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/kuzn.html|title=Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies|last=Salminen|first=Tapani|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional classification of the Uralic languages has existed since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die gegenseitige Verwandtschaft der Finnisch-ugrischen sprachen|last=Donner|first=Otto|publisher=|year=1879|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=|language=de|oclc=1014980747|authorlink=Otto Donner}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has enjoyed frequent adaptation in whole or in part in encyclopedias, handbooks, and overviews of the Uralic family. Donner's model is as follows:

* [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] (Ugrian)
** [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]
** [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]] (Ob Ugrian)
*** [[Khanty language|Khanty]]
*** [[Mansi language|Mansi]]
* [[Finno-Permic languages|Finno-Permic]] (Permian-Finnic)
** [[Permic languages|Permic]]
** [[Finno-Volgaic languages|Finno-Volgaic]] (Finno-Cheremisic, Finno-Mari)
*** Volga-Finnic
**** [[Mari language|Mari]]
**** [[Mordvinic languages|Mordvinic]]
*** [[Finno-Lappic languages|Finno-Lappic]] (Finno-Saamic, Finno-Samic)
**** [[Sami languages|Sami]]
**** [[Finnic languages|Finnic]]

At Donner's time, the [[Samoyedic languages]] were still poorly known, and he was not able to address their position. As they became better known in the early 20th century, they were found to be quite divergent, and they were assumed to have separated already early on. The terminology adopted for this was "Uralic" for the entire family, "[[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]]" for the non-Samoyedic languages (though "Finno-Ugric" has, to this day, remained in use also as a synonym for the whole family). [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] and Samoyedic are listed in [[ISO 639-5]] as primary branches of Uralic.

{{Note label|hajdu|a. Hajdú describes the Ugric and Volgaic groups as areal units.}}

{{Note label|austerlitz|b. Austerlitz accepts narrower-than-traditional Finno-Ugric and Finno-Permic groups that exclude Samic}}

Little explicit evidence has however been presented in favour of Donner's model since his original proposal, and numerous alternate schemes have been proposed. Especially in Finland, there has been a growing tendency to reject the Finno-Ugric intermediate protolanguage.&lt;ref name="SalmTax" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Häkkinen, Kaisa 1984: Wäre es schon an der Zeit, den Stammbaum zu fällen? – Ural-Altaische Jahrbücher, Neue Folge 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent competing proposal instead unites Ugric and Samoyedic in an "East Uralic" group for which shared innovations can be noted.&lt;ref name="EastUralic"&gt;Häkkinen, Jaakko 2009: [http://www.sgr.fi/susa/92/hakkinen.pdf Kantauralin ajoitus ja paikannus: perustelut puntarissa]. – Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Aikakauskirja 92. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Finno-Permic grouping still holds some support, though the arrangement of its subgroups is a matter of some dispute. Mordvinic is commonly seen as particularly closely related to or part of Finno-Samic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Within Ugric, uniting Mansi with Hungarian rather than Khanty has been a competing hypothesis to Ob-Ugric.

===Lexical isoglosses===
[[Lexicostatistics]] has been used in defense of the traditional family tree. A recent re-evaluation of the evidence&lt;ref&gt;Michalove, Peter A. (2002) The Classification of the Uralic Languages: Lexical Evidence from Finno-Ugric. In: Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen, vol. 57&lt;/ref&gt; however fails to find support for Finno-Ugric and Ugric, suggesting four lexically distinct branches (Finno-Permic, Hungarian, Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic).

One alternate proposal for a family tree, with emphasis on the development of numerals, is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

******** Finnic&lt;!--(reshaping *kakta &gt; *kakti "2" on the analogy of "1")--&gt;

===Phonological isoglosses===
Another proposed tree, more divergent from the standard, focusing on consonant isoglosses (which does not consider the position of the Samoyedic languages) is presented by Viitso (1997),&lt;ref&gt;Viitso, Tiit-Rein. Keelesugulus ja soome-ugri keelepuu. Akadeemia 9/5 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and refined in Viitso (2000):&lt;ref&gt;Viitso, Tiit-Rein. Finnic Affinity. Congressus Nonus Internationalis Fenno-Ugristarum I:
Orationes plenariae &amp; Orationes publicae. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finno-Ugric
** Saamic–Fennic ([[consonant gradation]])
*** Saamic
*** Fennic
** Eastern Finno-Ugric
***Mordva
***(node)
**** Mari
**** Permian–Ugric (*δ &gt; *l)
***** Permian
***** Ugric (*s *š *ś &gt; *ɬ *ɬ *s)
****** Hungarian
****** Khanty
****** Mansi
The grouping of the four bottom-level branches remains to some degree open to interpretation, with competing models of Finno-Saamic vs. Eastern Finno-Ugric (Mari, Mordvinic, Permic-Ugric; *k &gt; ɣ between vowels, degemination of stops) and Finno-Volgaic (Finno-Saamic, Mari, Mordvinic; *δʲ &gt; *ð between vowels) vs. Permic-Ugric. Viitso finds no evidence for a Finno-Permic grouping.&lt;!-- see also [[Proto-Samic language#From Proto-Uralic]] for two isoglosses exclusively shared by Saamic, Finnic and Mordvinic: merger of *ë with *a and of *δʲ with *δ --&gt;

Extending this approach to cover the Samoyedic languages suggests affinity with Ugric, resulting in the aforementioned East Uralic grouping, as it also shares the same sibilant developments. A further non-trivial Ugric-Samoyedic isogloss is the reduction *k, *x, *w &gt; ɣ when before *i, and after a vowel (cf. *k &gt; ɣ above), or adjacent to *t, *s, *š, or *ś.&lt;ref name = EastUralic/&gt;

*Note: Proto-Khanty *ɬ in many of the dialects yields *t; Häkkinen assumes this also happened in Mansi and Samoyedic.

The inverse relationship between consonant gradation and medial lenition of stops (the pattern also continuing within the three families where gradation ''is'' found) is noted by [[Eugene Helimski|Helimski]] (1995): an original allophonic gradation system between voiceless and voiced stops would have been easily disrupted by a spreading of voicing to previously unvoiced stops as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Helimski|Helimski, Eugen]].

==Typology==
Structural characteristics generally said to be typical of Uralic languages include:

===Grammar===
* extensive use of independent [[suffix]]es ([[agglutination]])
* a large set of [[grammatical case]]s marked with agglutinative suffixes (13–14 cases on average; mainly later developments: Proto-Uralic is reconstructed with 6 cases), e.g.:
** Erzya: 12 cases
** Estonian: 14 cases (15 cases with instructive)
** Finnish: 15 cases
** Hungarian: 18 cases (together 34 grammatical cases and case-like suffixes)
** Inari Sami: 9 cases
** Komi: in certain dialects as many as 27 cases
** Moksha: 13 cases
** Nenets: 7 cases
** North Sami: 6 cases
** Udmurt: 16 cases
** Veps: 24 cases
* unique Uralic case system, from which all modern Uralic languages derive their case systems.
** nominative singular has no case suffix.
** accusative and genitive suffixes are nasal sounds (''-n'', ''-m'', etc.)
** three-way distinction in the local case system, with each set of local cases being divided into forms corresponding roughly to "from", "to", and "in/at"; especially evident, e.g. in Hungarian, Finnish and Estonian, which have several sets of local cases, such as the "inner", "outer" and "on top" systems in Hungarian, while in Finnish the "on top" forms have merged to the "outer" forms.
** the Uralic locative suffix exists in all Uralic languages in various cases, e.g. Hungarian [[superessive case|superessive]], Finnish [[essive case|essive]] (''-na''), North Sami [[essive case|essive]], Erzyan [[inessive case|inessive]], and Nenets [[locative case|locative]].
** the Uralic [[lative case|lative]] suffix exists in various cases in many Uralic languages, e.g. Hungarian [[illative case|illative]], Finnish [[lative case|lative]] (''-s'' as in ''rannemmas''), Erzyan [[illative case|illative]], Komi [[approximative case|approximative]], and Northern Sami [[locative case|locative]].
* a lack of [[grammatical gender]], including one pronoun for both ''he'' and ''she''; for example, ''hän'' in Finnish, ''tämä'' in Votic, ''tema'' in Estonian, ''sijə'' in Komi, ''ő'' in Hungarian.
* [[negative verb]], which exists in almost all Uralic languages (notably absent in Hungarian)
* use of postpositions as opposed to prepositions (prepositions are uncommon).
* [[possessive suffix]]es
** the [[Genitive case|genitive]] is also used to express possession in some languages, e.g. [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''mu koer'', [[Spoken Finnish|colloquial Finnish]] ''mun koira'', [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sami]] ''mu beana'' 'my dog' (literally 'dog of me'). Separate [[possessive adjective]]s and [[possessive pronoun]]s, such as ''my'' and ''your'', are rare.
* [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], in the Samoyedic, Ob-Ugric and Samic languages and reconstructed for Proto-Uralic
* [[plural]] markers -j (i) and -t (-d, -q) have a common origin (e.g. in Finnish, Estonian, Võro, Erzya, Samic languages, Samoyedic languages). Hungarian, however, has -i- before the possessive suffixes and -k elsewhere. In the old orthographies, the plural marker -k was also used in the Samic languages.
* Possessions are expressed by a possessor in the adessive or dative case, the verb "be" (the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], instead of the verb "have") and the possessed with or without a possessive suffix. The grammatical subject of the sentence is thus the possessed. In Finnish, for example, the possessor is in the [[adessive case]]: "Minulla on kala", literally "At me is fish", i.e. "I have a fish", whereas in Hungarian, the possessor is in the [[dative case]], but appears overtly only if it is contrastive, while the possessed has a possessive ending indicating the number and person of the possessor: "(Nekem) van egy halam", literally "(To me [dative]) is a fish-my", i.e. "(As for me,) I have a fish".
* expressions that include a [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]] are singular if they refer to things which form a single group, e.g. "négy csomó" in Hungarian, "njeallje čuolmma" in Northern Sami, "neli sõlme" in Estonian, and "neljä solmua" in Finnish, each of which means "four knots", but the literal approximation is "four knot". (This approximation is inaccurate for Finnish and Estonian, where the singular is in the [[partitive]] case, such that the number points to a part of a larger mass, like "four of knot(s)".)

===Phonology===
* [[Vowel harmony]]: this is present in many but by no means all Uralic languages. It exists in Hungarian and various [[Baltic-Finnic]] languages, and is present to some degree elsewhere, such as in Mordvinic, Mari, Eastern Khanty, and Samoyedic. It is lacking in Sami, Permic and standard Estonian, while it does exist in [[Võro language|Võro]] and elsewhere in [[South Estonian language|South Estonian]].&lt;ref&gt;Austerlitz, Robert (1990). "Uralic Languages" (pp. 567–576) in Comrie, Bernard, editor. ''The World's Major Languages''. Oxford University Press, Oxford (p. 573).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Language|url=http://www.utlib.ee/liber2012/tekstid/eestikeel.pdf|publisher=Estonian Institute|accessdate=2013-04-16|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Although umlaut letters are used in writing Uralic languages, the languages do not exhibit [[Germanic umlaut]]; front and back values are intrinsic features of words and modify suffixes, not vice versa as in umlaut.)
* Large vowel inventories. For example, some [[Selkup language|Selkup]] varieties have over twenty different [[monophthong]]s, and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] has over twenty different [[diphthong]]s.
* [[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]] of consonants; in this context, palatalization means a secondary articulation, where the middle of the tongue is tense. For example, pairs like {{IPA|[ɲ]}} – [n], or [c] – [t] are contrasted in Hungarian, as in ''hattyú'' {{IPA|[hɒcːuː]}} "swan". Some Sami languages, for example [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], distinguish three degrees: plain {{angle bracket|l}} [l], palatalized {{angle bracket|'l}} {{IPA|[lʲ]}}, and palatal {{angle bracket|lj}} {{IPA|[ʎ]}}, where {{angle bracket|'l}} has a primary alveolar articulation, while {{angle bracket|lj}} has a primary palatal articulation. Original Uralic palatalization is phonemic, independent of the following vowel and traceable to the millennia-old [[Proto-Uralic]]. It is different from Slavic palatalization, which is of more recent origin. The [[Finnic languages]] have lost palatalization, but the eastern varieties have reacquired it, so Finnic palatalization (where extant) was originally dependent on the following vowel and does not correlate to palatalization elsewhere in Uralic.
* Lack of phonologically contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].
* In many Uralic languages, the stress is always on the first syllable, though Nganasan shows (essentially) penultimate stress, and a number of languages of the central region (Erzya, Mari, Udmurt and Komi-Permyak) synchronically exhibit a lexical accent. The Erzya language can vary its stress in words to give specific nuances to sentential meaning.

===Lexicography===
Basic vocabulary of about 200 words, including body parts (e.g. eye, heart, head, foot, mouth), family members (e.g. father, mother-in-law), animals (e.g. viper, partridge, fish), nature objects (e.g. tree, stone, nest, water), basic verbs (e.g. live, fall, run, make, see, suck, go, die, swim, know), basic pronouns (e.g. who, what, we, you, I), numerals (e.g. two, five); derivatives increase the number of common words.

====Selected cognates====

&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: this is a table of COGNATE WORDS, not simply words of the same meaning across different languages. Cognate words are words that share the same historical origin. Do NOT add any words in this table simply on the basis of their meanings, but only if reliable sources consider them to be cognate with the other words in the row. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ATTENTION! Thank you for caring about the accuracy of Wikipedia. However, please do not add translations. This is a list of words of common origin. For example, it does not matter what is the translation of "to wash" to Finnish, because the Finnish word "pestä" has a different origin from "mõskma", etc., and as such, does not belong to this list.  --&gt;

The following is a very brief selection of cognates in basic vocabulary across the Uralic family, which may serve to give an idea of the sound changes involved. This is not a list of translations: cognates have a common origin, but their meaning may be shifted and loanwords may have replaced them.

Orthographical notes: The hacek denotes postalveolar articulation ({{angbr|ž}} {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, {{angbr|š}} {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, {{angbr|č}} {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}}) (In Northern Sami, ({{angbr|ž}} {{IPA|[dʒ]}}), while the acute denotes a secondary palatal articulation ({{angbr|ś}} {{IPA|[sʲ ~ ɕ]}}, {{angbr|ć}} {{IPA|[tsʲ ~ tɕ]}}, {{angbr|l}} {{IPA|[lʲ]}}) or, in Hungarian, vowel length. The Finnish letter {{angbr|y}} and the letter {{angbr|ü}} in other languages represent the high rounded vowel {{IPA|[y]}}; the letters {{angbr|ä}} and {{angbr|ö}} are the front vowels {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[ø]}}.

As is apparent from the list, Finnish is the most conservative of the Uralic languages presented here, with nearly half the words on the list below identical to their Proto-Uralic reconstructions and most of the remainder only having minor changes, such as the conflation of *ś into /s/, or widespread changes such as the loss of *x and alteration of *ï. Finnish has even preserved old Indo-European borrowings relatively unchanged as well. (An example  is ''porsas'' ("pig"), loaned from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*porḱos'' or pre-[[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*porśos'', unchanged since loaning&lt;!--NB the Uralic proto-form is *porśas--&gt; save for loss of [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], *ś &gt; s.&lt;!--Another well-known example is ''kuningas'' ("king"), a loan from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*kuniŋgaz'', again preserved unchanged since loaning except for an assimilation *ŋg &gt; {{IPA|/ŋː/}}, contrary to any of the [[Germanic languages]].--&gt;)

====Mutual intelligibility====
The Estonian philologist [[Mall Hellam]] proposed cognate sentences that she asserted to be mutually intelligible among the three most widely spoken Uralic languages: Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian:&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{citation |title = The Finno-Ugrics: The dying fish swims in water |work = [[The Economist]] |pages = 73–74 |date = December 24, 2005 – January 6, 2006 |url = http://www.economist.com/node/5323735 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{lang-et|Elav kala ujub vee all}}.
*{{lang-fi|Elävä kala ui veden alla}}.
*{{lang-hu|Eleven hal úszik a víz alatt}}.
*English: A live fish is swimming underwater.

However, linguist [[Geoffrey Pullum]] reports that neither Finns nor Hungarians could understand the other language's version of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pullum|first=Geoffrey K.|authorlink=Geoffrey Pullum|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002729.html|title=The Udmurtian code: saving Finno-Ugric in Russia|date=2005-12-26|accessdate=2009-12-21|work=[[Language Log]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No Uralic language has exactly the idealized typological profile of the family.

==Possible relations with other families==

Many relationships between Uralic and other language families have been suggested, but none of these are generally accepted by linguists at the present time.

===Indo-Uralic===

{{Main|Indo-Uralic languages}}

The [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]] (or Uralo-Indo-European) hypothesis suggests that Uralic and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] are related at a fairly close level or, in its stronger form, that they are more closely related than either is to any other language family.

===Uralic–Yukaghir===

{{Main|Uralic–Yukaghir languages}}

The [[Uralic–Yukaghir languages|Uralic–Yukaghir]] hypothesis identifies Uralic and [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]] as independent members of a single language family. It is currently widely accepted that the similarities between Uralic and Yukaghir languages are due to ancient contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Rédei, Károly 1999: Zu den uralisch-jukagirischen Sprachkontakten. – Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the hypothesis is accepted by a few linguists and viewed as attractive by a somewhat larger number.

===Eskimo–Uralic===

{{Main|Eskimo–Uralic languages}}

The [[Eskimo–Uralic languages|Eskimo–Uralic]] hypothesis associates Uralic with the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]]. This is an old thesis whose antecedents go back to the 18th century. An important restatement of it is [[Knut Bergsland|Bergsland]] 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergsland|first=Knut|date=1959|title=The Eskimo-Uralic hypothesis|journal=Journal De La Société Finno-Ougrienne|volume=61|pages=1–29|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uralo-Siberian===

{{Main|Uralo-Siberian languages}}

[[Uralo-Siberian languages|Uralo-Siberian]] is an expanded form of the Eskimo–Uralic hypothesis. It associates Uralic with Yukaghir, [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]], and Eskimo–Aleut. It was propounded by [[Michael Fortescue]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Relations Across Bering Strait: Reappraising the Archaeological and Linguistic Evidence|last=Fortescue|first=Michael D|publisher=Cassell|year=1998|isbn=978-0-304-70330-2|series=Open linguistics series|location=London|language=English|oclc=237319639|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ural–Altaic===

{{Main|Ural–Altaic languages}}

Theories proposing a close relationship with the [[Altaic languages]] were formerly popular, based on similarities in vocabulary as well as in grammatical and phonological features, in particular the similarities in the Uralic and Altaic pronouns and the presence of [[agglutination]] in both sets of languages, as well as [[vowel harmony]] in some. For example, the word for "language" is similar in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (''keel'') and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] (''хэл'' (''hel'')). These theories are now generally rejected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Georg|first1=Stefan|last2=Michalove|first2=Peter A.|last3=Ramer|first3=Alexis Manaster|last4=Sidwell|first4=Paul J.|date=March 1999|title=Telling general linguists about Altaic|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan_Georg/publication/231787164_Telling_general_linguists_about_Altaic/links/59b113d9aca2728472d0f8bb/Telling-general-linguists-about-Altaic.pdf|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=35|issue=1|pages=65-98|issn=1469-7742|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most such similarities are attributed to [[language contact]] or coincidence.

===Nostratic===

{{Main|Nostratic languages}}

[[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] associates Uralic, Indo-European, Altaic, Dravidian, and various other language families of Asia. The Nostratic hypothesis was first propounded by [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] in 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=Holger|date=1903|title=Türkische Lautgesetze|trans-title=Turkish Phonetic Laws|url=|journal=Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft|language=German|volume=57|issue=3|pages=535-561|issn=0341-0137|oclc=5919317968|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently revived by [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]] in the 1960s.

===Eurasiatic===

{{Main|Eurasiatic languages}}

[[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]] resembles Nostratic in including Uralic, Indo-European, and Altaic, but differs from it in excluding the South Caucasian languages, Dravidian, and Afroasiatic and including Chukotko-Kamchatkan, [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]], [[Ainu languages|Ainu]], and Eskimo–Aleut. It was propounded by [[Joseph Greenberg]] in 2000–2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo-European and Its Closest Relatives: The Eurasiatic Language Family. Volume 1: Grammar|last=Greenberg|first=Joseph Harold|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8047-3812-5|location=Stanford, Calif.|language=English|oclc=491123067|ref=harv}}

===Uralo-Dravidian===

The hypothesis that the [[Dravidian languages]] display similarities with the Uralic language group, suggesting a prolonged period of contact in the past,&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Stephen (1968), "Dravidian and Uralian: the lexical evidence". ''Language'' 44:4. 798–812&lt;/ref&gt; is popular amongst Dravidian linguists and has been supported by a number of scholars, including [[Robert Caldwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Webb | first1 = Edward | year = 1860 | title = Evidences of the Scythian Affinities of the Dravidian Languages, Condensed and Arranged from Rev.

''Proceedings of the Second International Conference of Tamil Studies'' Madras. 267–277.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis has, however, been rejected by some specialists in Uralic languages,&lt;ref&gt;Zvelebil, Kamil (1970), ''Comparative Dravidian Phonology'' Mouton, The Hauge. at p. 22 contains a bibliography of articles supporting and opposing the hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt; and has in recent times also been criticised by other Dravidian linguists, such as [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurti, Bhadriraju (2003) ''The Dravidian Languages'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-77111-0}} at p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uralic skepticism===

In her book, ''The Uralic language family: facts, myths, and statistics'', linguist Angela Marcantonio argues against the existence of the Uralic family, claiming that the languages are no more closely related to each other than they are to various other Eurasian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.safarmer.com/Indo-Eurasian/Vajda.review.pdf|title=The Uralic language family: facts, myths, and statistics review by Dr. Edward Vajda|work=Dr. Edward Vajda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these hypotheses are minority views at the present time in Uralic studies.

===Other comparisons===
{{see also|Alternative theories of the Hungarian language relations}}
Various unorthodox comparisons have been advanced such as Finno-[[Basque language|Basque]]&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  Hungarian-Etruscan&lt;ref&gt;Alinei, Mario (2003), Etrusco: una forma arcaica di ungherese, Bologna, Il Mulino.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Cal-Ugrian theory|Cal-Ugrian]]. These are considered at best spurious fringe-theories by specialists.

'''Vernon A. Walters''' (January 3, 1917&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kZMeeXLSQhsC&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=Vernon+A.+Walters+January+3,+1917&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisn5Op5L_aAhUCQJoKHWhyBz0Q6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Vernon%20A.%20Walters%20January%203%2C%201917&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; – February 10, 2002) was a [[United States Army]] officer and a [[diplomat]]. Most notably, he served from 1972 to 1976 as [[Deputy Director of Central Intelligence]], from 1985 to 1989 as the [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] and from 1989 to 1991 as [[Ambassador]] to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] during the decisive phase of [[German Reunification]]. Walters rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]] in the U.S. Army and is a member of the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]].

==Background==
Walters was born in [[New York City]]. His father was a [[United Kingdom|British]] immigrant and [[insurance]] salesman. From age 6, Walters lived in Britain and [[France]] with his family. His formal education beyond elementary school consisted entirely of boarding school instruction at [[Stonyhurst College]], a 400-year-old [[Jesuit]] school in [[Lancashire, England]]. He did not attend a university. At the age of sixteen, he left school and returned to the United States, to work for his father as an insurance [[claims adjuster]] and investigator.

In later years, he seemed to enjoy reflecting on the fact that he had risen high and accomplished much despite a near-total lack of formal academic training.

He was fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as well as his native English. He also spoke [[German language|German]] fluently but, as he joked, inaccurately, and knew the basics of several other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/vawalters.htm www.arlingtoncemetery.net]&lt;/ref&gt; His simultaneous translation of a speech by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in France prompted [[President of France|French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] to say to Nixon, "You gave a magnificent speech, but your interpreter was eloquent."&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Appelbaum: [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no1/article01.html Vernon Walters—Renaissance Man In Memoriam], Central Intelligence Agency, April 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==

===1940s and 50s===
[[File:Vernon A Walters 02.jpg|thumb|Walters in 1976 as Lieutenant General]]
Walters joined the Army in 1941 and was soon commissioned. He served in [[Africa]] and [[Italy]] during [[World War II]]. He served as a link between the commands of [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] and [[U.S. Fifth Army]], earning medals for distinguished military and intelligence achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-library.usma.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/mltmedia&amp;CISOPTR=83&amp;REC=12 CONTENTdm Collection: Item Viewer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as an aide and interpreter for several Presidents. He was at President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s side as an interpreter in key meetings with America's [[Spanish language|Spanish]]- and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking [[Latin America]]n allies. His language skills helped him win Truman's confidence, and he accompanied the President to the Pacific in the early 1950s, serving as a key aide in Truman's unsuccessful effort to reach a reconciliation with an insubordinate General [[Douglas MacArthur]], the Commander of [[United Nations]] forces in [[Korea]].

In [[Europe]] in the 1950s, Walters served President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and other top US officials as a translator and aide at a series of [[NATO]] summit conferences. During this period he participated in the famous visit of Eisenhower to [[General Franco]]. He also worked in [[Paris]] at [[Marshall Plan]] headquarters and helped set up the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe]]. He was with then-[[Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1958 when an anti-American crowd stoned their car in [[Caracas, Venezuela]].  Walters suffered facial cuts from flying glass. The Vice President avoided injury.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, Walters served as a U.S. military attaché in [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Brazil]]. In 1961, he proposed an American military intervention in Italy if the [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] had participated in the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Crainz, ''Autobiografia di una Repubblica. Le radici dell'Italia attuale'' (Donzelli, 2009), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving as a military attaché in Paris from 1967 to 1972, Walters played a role in secret peace talks with [[North Vietnam]]. He arranged to smuggle [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] into France for secret meetings with a senior North Vietnamese official, and then smuggle him out again. He accomplished this by borrowing a private airplane from an old friend, French President [[Georges Pompidou]].

===1970s===
[[File:Vernon A Walters.jpg|thumb|Walters in 1972 as Deputy Director for Central Intelligence]]
President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Walters as Deputy Director for Central Intelligence (DDCI) in 1972. (Walters also served as Acting DCI for two months in mid-1973.) During his four years as DDCI, he worked closely with four successive Directors as the Agency&amp;mdash;and the nation&amp;mdash;confronted such major international developments as the [[1973 Arab-Israeli war]], the subsequent oil crisis, the turbulent end of the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Chile]]an [[Chilean Coup of 1973|military coup]] against the [[Salvador Allende|Allende]] government and the [[Letelier assassination]]. According to a close colleague, Walters also "averted a looming catastrophe" for the CIA in connection with the [[Watergate]] scandal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite numerous importunings from on high, [Walters] flatly refused to...cast a cloak of national security over the guilty parties. At the critical moment, he... refused to involve the Agency, and bluntly informed the highest levels of the executive [branch] that further insistence from that quarter would result in his immediate resignation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Walters himself reflected on those challenging days in his 1978 autobiography, ''Silent Missions'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told [President Nixon's White House counsel] that on the day I went to work at the CIA I had hung on the wall of my office a color photograph showing the view through the window of my home in Florida…When people asked me what it was, I told them [this] was what was waiting [for me] if anyone squeezed me too hard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Diplomatic career==
[[File:Reagan cabinet 1989-01-11.jpg|thumb|Walters in the Reagan Cabinet 1989 as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, back row, third from right]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F088867-0010, Bonn, BMI, Abschiedsempfang Botschafter der USA.jpg|thumb|Walters as ambassador to Germany with [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], 1991]]
Beginning in 1981, Walters served under [[Ronald Reagan]] as roving ambassador. 
Reagan used prominent Catholics in his government such as Walters to brief the pope during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bono |first=Agostino |title=Officials say pope, Reagan shared Cold War data, but lacked alliance |publisher=Catholic News Service |date=November 17, 2004 |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0406342.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118230515/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0406342.htm |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Walters was then [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] from 1985 to 1989 and ambassador to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] from 1989 to 1991.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Here he was responsible on behalf of the United States for the preparations of the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]].

==Retirement and death==
During the 1990s, after he had retired from [[public servant|public life]], Walters worked as a business [[consultant]] and was active on the lecture circuit.  On November 18, 1991, he was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]]. He wrote another book, ''[[The Mighty and the Meek]]'' (published in 2001), which profiled famous people with whom he had worked during his life.

On February 9, the day before his death he gave an interview (in French language) for the [[mockumentary]] ''[[Dark Side of the Moon (film)|Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (original title: ''Opération Lune'') by [[William Karel]]. This mockumentary suggests that the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'''s article on his death included the following paragraph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;General Walters' last known public appearance was on a French Television documentary in which he talked about the White House's involvement with the Apollo program in the late 1960s. Both the producer and director noted that Walters was in perfect shape. [February 15, 2002]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the web version of the article at the ''New York Times'' website uses a different paragraph: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 'He was great as our James Bond, getting us in and out secretly, even giving us code names,' said Winston Lord, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who accompanied Mr. Kissinger to the secret talks with the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Citation |last=Kelley |first=Tina |title=Vernon Walters, Ex-Envoy And Deputy C.I.A. Chief, 85 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 15, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/world/vernon-a-walters-85-former-envoy-to-un.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
Walters was portrayed by [[Garrick Hagon]] in the 2002 [[BBC]] production of [[Ian Curteis]]'s controversial ''[[The Falklands Play]]''.

'''Video game writing''' is the art and craft of writing [[script (video games)|scripts]] for [[video game]]s. Similar to [[screenwriting]], it is typically a [[freelancer|freelance]] profession.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; It includes many differences from writing for film, due to the [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] and [[Interactivity|interactive]] nature of most video games, and the necessity to work closely with [[video game design]]ers and [[Voice acting|voice actors]]. There are many differing types of text in video games in comparison to stage shows or movies, including [[written text]], [[foreign language|foreign]] or [[Fictional language|made-up languages]], and often situation-based information. Especially when developing [[AAA (video game industry)|Triple A games]], more than one writer will be required to create the game, split into different roles.&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/15/12455728/how-to-get-a-job-writing-games-maybe | title=Do you want to write video games? 28 An industry veteran explains the difficulty in getting the position everyone wants. | publisher=[[Polygon]] | date=August 15, 2016 | accessdate=March 31, 2018 | author=Gaider, David | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426223115/http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/15/12455728/how-to-get-a-job-writing-games-maybe | archivedate=April 26, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writers ==
People who write video games are part of the [[video game design|design team]], during [[Video game development#Pre-production|pre-production]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gameindustrycareerguide.com/how-to-become-a-video-game-writer/ ''How To Become A Video Game Writer''], interview with [[Darby McDevitt]], posted on [http://www.gameindustrycareerguide.com Game industry career guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and creates the main plot of a [[video game]] but can also focus on the dialogue, the [[Player character|character]] creation and development or the [[worldbuilding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3935/the_gamasutra_20_top_game_writers.php?print=1 ''The Gamasutra 20: Top Game Writers''], by Bonnie Ruberg on [[Gamasutra]]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the game development process, the design may change and a video game writer can also be asked to fix the eventual [[narrative]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/arts/video-games/gears-of-war-judgment-and-the-writing-of-its-narrative.html?pagewanted=all ''Building a Narrative That’s Explosive''], by Chris Suellentrop, published on [[The New York Times]] March 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the plot can be minimized by some video game designers, for instance [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] of [[Arkane Studios]] claimed that "''The world is very important. The characters are very important. The plot? It can be thrown away. Because each gamer will build his own story.''".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/12/27/dans-un-jeu-video-le-joueur-s-inventera-toujours-sa-propre-histoire_5054442_4408996.html ''Dans un jeu vidéo, « le joueur s’inventera toujours sa propre histoire »''] by  Corentin Lamy , published 27 december 2016 on [[Le Monde]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to academic and video game designer [[Ian Bogost]] video games can be much more than narrative media, by puting together, in a non-linear structure, elements of everyday life, as in ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/video-games-stories/524148/ ''Video Games Are Better Without Stories''] by [[Ian Bogost]], published in April 2017, in [[The Atlantic]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue specific to the medium is that priority is given to [[gameplay|interactive play mechanics]] over narrative&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5988751/what-in-the-world-do-video-game-writers-do-the-minds-behind-some-of-last-years-biggest-games-explain ''What In The World Do Video Game Writers Do?

Graphics Improve But Video Game Endings Still Come Up Short''], by Stephen Totilo&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to ''[[Ludonarrative |Ludonarrative dissonance]]'' : a situation when ludic and narrative elements are opposed to each other as ''[[Far Cry 2]]'' director, Clint Hocking defined the concept in his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2007/10/ludonarrative-d.html| title =Ludonarrative Dissonance in Bioshock| first =  Clint|last = Hocking| work = clicknothing.typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.destructoid.com/ludonarrative-dissonance-the-roadblock-to-realism-235197.phtml| title =Ludonarrative dissonance: The roadblock to realism| first =  Brett|last = Makedonski}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.thunderboltgames.com/opinion/ludonarrative-dissonance-we-still-need-to-learn-from-hocking| title =Ludonarrative Dissonance: we still need to learn from Hocking| first =  Matt|last = Sawrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as video games are more recent than other media, video game writing is still a field to be conquered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge-online.com/features/opinion-bad-lines/ ''Bad lines''] by Clint Hocking, published 9 february 2012 on the [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no specific training to video game writing and some video game writers – such as [[Tim Schafer]] and [[Sam Barlow (game designer)|Sam Barlow]] – are also in charge of other game development tasks. In the video game industry, it is also one area where some women are very famous such as [[Roberta Williams]] and [[Jane Jensen]].

== Types ==

Video game writing differs from writing for arts, due to the [[Nonlinear gameplay|non-linear]] and [[Interactivity|interactive]] nature of most video games, and the necessity to work closely with [[video game design]]ers and [[Voice acting|voice actors]]. There are many differing types of text in video games in comparison to stage shows or movies, including [[written text]], [[foreign language|foreign]] or [[Fictional language|made-up languages]], and often situation-based information. Subsequently, more than one writer will often be used to create the game, split into different roles,&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; with more specific job titles that can range from being a traditional writer, developing an [[Overview article|overview]] of the story and how it reacts to the player, or creating a [[translation]] or [[Video game localization|localization]].

=== Pitch writing ===

A pitch writer specializes in writing [[Sales presentation|pitches]] for video games to publishers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/814380325|title=Professional Techniques for Video Game Writing|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=A.K. Peters|others=|year=|isbn=1439875383|editor-last=Despain|editor-first=Wendy|location=Wellesley, Mass.|pages=21–22, 55, 165|oclc=814380325}}&lt;/ref&gt; They create collaborative pitch documents within a [[Game Studio|game studio]] that often contain design [[mockup]]s or [[Concept art|art concepts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main parts of a pitch document, in order from first to last, are the [[executive summary]], [[audience analysis]], story, [[Competitive analysis (marketing)|competition analysis]], [[market analysis]], [[gameplay]], and [[budget]] and [[schedule]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Narrative design ===

[[Narrative designer]] is a hybrid role of [[video game design]] and writing that creates not only the [[Narrative|story]], but also how it is communicated to players and how the [[game mechanics]] work to reinforce that story.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Bioware]] writer David Gaider described the role as "the person who shapes the game’s narrative, as well as the one who writes all the words."&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

=== Script work ===
==== Script writing ====
The [[Script (video games)|script]] writer focuses on the [[dialogue]] said by characters and the [[Voice-over|voice over]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The script's dialogue can be written in [[flowchart]]s to illustrate the various dialogue resulting from both decision and indecision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stormthecastle.com/video-game-design/writing-a-video-game-script.htm|title=Flowchart a video game script|last=|first=|date=|website=Storm The Castle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922213346/http://www.stormthecastle.com/video-game-design/writing-a-video-game-script.htm|archive-date=2017-09-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a script writer is less involved with the video game's [[video game mechanics|mechanics]], and is tasked with writing and working with [[voice actors]].&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

==== Script doctoring ====

Similarly to [[Script doctor|screenplay script doctors]], video game writers can be brought in to assist with writing-related tasks. However, the term is more vague than in screenplays due to the wide variety of potential tasks needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Industry practice ==
Similar to [[screenwriting]], it is typically a [[freelancer|freelance]] profession.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt; Writing roles may also be filled by other members of the development team.&lt;ref name="Polygon" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9501">[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|250px|A Video Interpreter sign used in several countries for locations offering VRS or VRI services]]

'''Video remote interpreting''' ('''VRI''') is a [[videotelephony|videotelecommunication]] service that uses devices such as [[webcam|web cameras]] or [[videophone]]s to provide [[sign language]] or [[Language interpretation|spoken language interpreting]] services. This is done through a remote or offsite interpreter, in order to communicate with persons with whom there is a [[Communication|communication barrier]]. It is similar to a slightly different technology called [[video relay service]], where the parties are each located in different places. VRI is a type of [[telecommunications relay service]] (TRS) that is not regulated by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rid.org/UserFiles/File/pdfs/Standard_Practice_Papers/VRI_SPP.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119001737/http://www.rid.org/UserFiles/File/pdfs/Standard_Practice_Papers/VRI_SPP.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of use ==

In a typical VRI situation, the two parties are located together at one location with a [[videophone]] or [[webcam|web camera]], and a [[television]] or [[Computer monitor|computer screen]]. The interpreter works from another location—either an office, home-based studio or call center—also using a videophone or web camera and television or computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nad.org/issues/technology/vri Video Remote Interpreting], National Association of the Deaf&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment must provide video and audio connectivity, or a separate telephone line can be used for audio. The video interpreter facilitates communication between the participants who are located together at the other site. In the case of Sign Language interpretation, the interpreter hears the voices of the hearing people through the microphone or telephone, and renders the message into sign language, via a video camera, which the deaf person views on his or her video display. In turn, when the deaf participants sign to the camera, interpreters view it from their screen, and speaks the aural interpretation into a microphone or telephone for the hearing people.

VRI is a growing field. One popular application is in the hospital [[emergency room]]. In this setting, it is essential that patients and caregivers communicate readily with medical personnel, but it may take time for a face-to-face interpreter to arrive onsite. Hospitals with VRI capability can connect with a remote interpreter quickly and conduct triage and intake surveys with the patient or caregiver without significant delay. Also, employees who work in office settings are increasingly converting to VRI services to accommodate brief interactions or regular meetings which would be difficult to schedule with an onsite interpreter. Schools and businesses located in areas not adequately served by existing community interpreters can also benefit from increased access to professional interpreters and save the expense of vendor travel reimbursements.

Using VRI for medical, legal and mental health settings is seen as controversial by some in the deaf community, where there is an opinion that it does not provide appropriate communication access—particularly in medical settings where the patient's ability to watch the screen or sign clearly to the camera may be compromised. This is balanced by many in the services and public services sectors who identify with the benefits of being able to communicate in otherwise impossible (and sometimes life-threatening) situations without having to wait hours for an interpreter to turn up, even if this initial contact is used just to arrange a further face-to-face appointment. Therefore, businesses and organizations contend that it meets or exceeds the minimum threshold for reasonable accommodation as its principle is built around offering "reasonable adjustment" through increasing initial accessibility.

VRI is distinct from Video Relay Service (VRS): typically VRI is a contracted service used by organizations to help them communicate with Limited English Proficient or Deaf/Hard of Hearing customers. VRS is principally a service provided to the deaf community, whereby a deaf person can contact the service, and use the interpreter to contact a third-party organisation. In the past, the term 'video relay service' had been used interchangeably with 'video relay interpreting', but currently the terms refer to two separate and distinct services. However, a 'video interpreter' (V.I.) may refer to the practitioner working in either setting. 

According to [[United States|U.S.]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations, deaf and hearing people in the same room are not permitted to use VRS to communicate, because the service is designated only for telephone calls,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/videorelay.html Video Relay Services], Federal Communications Commission&lt;/ref&gt; and receives funding from [[telecommunications relay service]] taxes. In the United States the FCC requires that if a VRS interpreter determines callers are in the same location, they must advise both parties that the interpreter must terminate the call. Video remote interpreting however, can either be provided for persons in the same location, or different locations, as long as the parties can see or hear the interpreter respectively, and vice versa.

== Deployment examples ==


Despite criticism, VRI is proving to be a crucial tool in facilitating communication between those who ordinarily could not converse. For unplanned or emergency interactions, many organizations recognize significant benefits with the instant support provided by [[videotelephony]]. Face-to-face interpreting support is a much more personal method of advocacy, however such an interpreter needs to be scheduled in advance and is subject to travel (and associated) delays, also costing more than any other method.

In 2010, [[Chicago]]'s [[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center]] carried out an investigation into new ways that the hospital could effectively meet the needs of its [[Deafness|deaf and hard of hearing]] patients, with the ultimate goal to improve patient care and satisfaction, increase hospital efficiency and provide better value for money for all. Their conclusion focused on implementing an on-demand VRI service whereby hospital staff were able to access qualified, experienced [[Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf]] (RID) / [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] (NAD) certified [[American Sign Language]] interpreters via the Internet with delays as short as minutes. Dedicated [[laptop computer]]s were made available for use by clinicians and are to this day the service is utilized across the hospital's departments. Notably the hospital has measured tangible results in increased patient flow and overall satisfaction.

In June 2011, the [[Windsor Police Service|Windsor, Ontario, Canada, Police Service]] piloted a VRI service aimed at improving communication with the deaf, hard of hearing and people with other language barriers. The 30-day trial was deployed in the Emergency 911 Center, and proved so successful that they went on to incorporate the program into their Windsor Police Service Human Rights Project as a way of expanding services to people who are deaf or are Limited English Proficient.&lt;ref name="WindsorStar-2012.05.12"&gt;Windsor Star.

'''Winning and Score Predictor (WASP)''' is a calculation tool used in [[cricket]] to predict scores and possible results of a [[List A cricket|limited overs]] match, e.g. One Day and [[Twenty20|Twenty 20]] matches.
 
The prediction is based upon factors like the ease of scoring on the day according to the pitch, weather and boundary size. For the team batting first, it gives the prediction of the final total.  For the team batting second, it gives the probability of the chasing team winning, although it does not just take the match situation into the equation. Predictions are based on the average team playing against the average team in those conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's WASP all about?|url=http://www.blackcaps.co.nz/news/whats-wasp-all-about/11200/article.aspx|work=Corporate News|publisher=New Zealand Cricket|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The models are based on a database of all non-shortened [[One Day International]] (ODI) matches and [[Twenty20]] games played between top-eight countries since late 2006 (slightly further back for Twenty20 games). The batting-first model estimates the additional runs likely to be scored as a function of the number of balls and wickets remaining. The batting-second model estimates the probability of winning as a function of balls and wickets remaining, runs scored to date, and the target score. Projected score or required run-rate will not qualitatively show the real picture as they fail to take into the account the quality of the batting team and the quality of the bowling attack. WASP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upcric.com/cric-updates/what-is-wasp-percentage-cricket.html |title=What is wasp |publisher=ESPN Upcricinfo |date= |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a very good quantitative parameter.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan |first=Seamus |url=http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.in/2012/11/cricket-and-wasp-shameless-self.html |title=Offsetting Behaviour: Cricket and the Wasp: Shameless self promotion (Wonkish) |publisher=Offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.in |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The WASP technique is a product of some extensive research from PhD graduate Dr Scott Brooker and his supervisor Dr Seamus Hogan at the [[University of Canterbury]] (UC) in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand.  They worked on this project for four years and started after they received a phone call from the university's economics department asking them to investigate alternatives to the [[Duckworth–Lewis method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charley Mann |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/6820689/Cricket-formula-fairer |title=Cricket formula 'fairer' |newspaper= The Press |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand Limited |date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WASP was first introduced by [[Sky Sport (New Zealand)|Sky Sport New Zealand]] in November 2012 during [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]]'s [[HRV Cup]] Twenty20 game against [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/wasp-winning-and-score-predictor-makes-for-an-interesting-watch-on-television-87588/ |first=Abhijit |last=Banare |title=WASP: Winning and Score Predictor makes for an interesting watch on television |newspaper=CricketCountry |date=January 20, 2014 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The WASP system is grounded in the theory of [[dynamic programming]]. It looks at data from past matches and estimates the probability of runs and wickets in each game situation, and works backwards to calculate the total runs or probability of winning in any situation.

This is how Dr Seamus Hogan – one of the creators of WASP – described the system:

Let ''V''(''b'',''w'') be the expected additional runs for the rest of the innings when ''b'' (legitimate) balls have been bowled and ''w'' wickets have been lost, and let ''r''(''b'',''w'') and ''p''(''b'',''w'') be, respectively, the estimated expected runs and the probability of a wicket on the next ball in that situation.

We can then write,

: &lt;math&gt; V(b,w) = r(b,w) + p(b,w) V(b+1,w+1) + (1-p(b,w))V(b+1,w)&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''V''(''b*'',''w'')=0 where ''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; equals the maximum number of legitimate deliveries allowed in the innings (300 in a 50 over game), we can solve the model backwards.

This means that the estimates for ''V''(''b'',''w'') in rare situations depends only slightly on the estimated runs and probability of a wicket on that ball, and mostly on the values of ''V''(''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,''w'') and ''V''(''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,''w''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1), which will be mostly determined by thick data points.

The batting second model is a bit more complicated, but uses essentially the same logic.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"/&gt;

==Drawbacks==
If a batsman gets retired hurt, the model will not work well as it does not know the position in which the retired hurt batsman will come to bat again. This happened in a match between England and New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/569240.html |title=1st ODI: New Zealand v England at Hamilton, Feb 17, 2013 &amp;#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as injured [[Martin Guptill]] came to the crease again in the ninth position and gave a staggering performance which is unusual for a ninth position batsman and helped his team to win the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan |first=Seamus |url=http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.in/2013/11/more-cricket-return-of-wasp.html |title=Offsetting Behaviour: More Cricket: The Return of the Wasp |publisher=Offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.in |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Selvey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/17/new-zealand-england-odi |title=England beaten after injured Martin Guptill digs in for New Zealand &amp;#124; Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WASP also fails when a team beats the predicted score batting first, as was the case when Black Caps beat the predicted score at Otago University Oval of 270 in the fourth game of the seven-game series against Sri Lanka by a large margin, when [[Grant Elliott]] and [[Luke Ronchi]] set the record for their highest 6th wicket partnership to set a score of 360/5, at which case, runs per over rate will resume showing.  The team batting second  will not have WASP showing if the likelihood of winning falls below 5% before the 5th over. These reasons make this unpopular outside of Sky broadcasts.  Two days later, due to a greener surface, the predicted score at the same ground drops to 257 at the start of the match, which Black Caps still went on to post a score of 315/8.  After those matches, Sky abandoned showing this statistic in future matches, and it was not featured during 2015 Cricket World Cup.  WASP, however, was featured again in [[NatWest t20 Blast|NatWest T20 Blast]], ODI and Twenty20 broadcasts in England.

__NOTOC__
'''Well-formedness''' is the quality of a [[clause]], [[word]], or other linguistic element that conforms to the [[grammar]] of the language of which it is a part. Well-formed words or phrases are [[Grammaticality|grammatical]], meaning they obey all relevant rules of grammar. In contrast, a form that violates some grammar rule is '''ill-formed''' and does not constitute part of the language.

A word may be [[phonology|phonologically]] well-formed, meaning it conforms to the sound pattern of the language. A word, phrase, clause, or utterance may be grammatically well-formed, meaning it obeys the rules of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]]. A [[semantics|semantically]] well-formed utterance or sentence is one that is [[meaningful]]. Grammatical well-formedness and semantic well-formedness do not always coincide. For example, the following sentence is grammatically well-formed, but has no clear meaning.
:''[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|title=Syntactic Structures|year=1957|publisher=Mouton|location=The Hague/Paris|page=15|isbn=3-11-017279-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of well-formedness was developed in [[generative grammar]] during the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Semantics: An Introduction|last=Lyons|first=John|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=0521438772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes [[native speaker]]s of a language do not agree whether a particular word, phrase, or clause is well-formed. This problem of gradient well-formedness, uncertainty about the well-formedness of a particular example, is a problem for [[generative linguistics]], which assumes that grammar follows some [[universal grammar|universal patterns]] that should not vary among speakers.

==Gradient well-formedness==
Gradient well-formedness is a problem that arises in the analysis of data in generative linguistics, in which a linguistic entity is neither completely grammatical nor completely ungrammatical. A native speaker may judge a word, phrase or pronunciation as "not quite right" or "almost there", rather than dismissing it as completely unacceptable or fully accepting it as well-formed. Thus, the acceptability of the given entity lies on a "[[gradient]]" between well-formedness and ill-formedness. Some generative linguists think that ill-formedness might be strictly additive, thus trying to figure out [[universal grammar|universal]] constraints by acquiring scalar [[grammaticality]] judgements from [[informant (linguistics)|informants]]. Generally, however, gradient well-formedness is considered an [[unsolved problems in linguistics|unsolved problem in generative linguistics]].

'''Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi''' was a 15th century Indian chronicler who wrote ''Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi'', a [[Persian language]] chronicle of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Written during the reign of [[Mubarak Shah (Sayyid dynasty)|Mubarak Shah]], his work is an important source of information for the [[Sayyid dynasty]].

== ''Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi'' ==

Yahya expected to become a courtier of [[Mubarak Shah (Sayyid dynasty)|Mubarak Shah]] (r. 1431-1434), a ruler of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Therefore, he wrote ''Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi'' and presented it to the Sultan, hoping to win the royal patronage.{{sfn|Mohibbul Hasan|1968|p=174}}

The book begins with the conquests of [[Muhammad of Ghor]] (1149-1206), and ends abruptly in 1434.{{sfn|Jagadish Narayan Sarkar|1977|p=33}} Several earlier royal chroniclers had written texts describing the 13th-15th century history of the Delhi Sultanate. For example, [[Minhaj-i-Siraj]] covered the period up to 1259 in his ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'', [[Ziauddin Barani]] covered 1259-1356, and Shams-i Siraj Afif covered 1356-1388. Yahya carried forward this chronology all the way to 1434.{{sfn|Khaliq Ahmad Nizami|1981|p=70}}

For the events up to 1351, Yahya selectively borrowed from the earlier writers, and arranged the material in a chronological order. For the events after 1351, he relied on personal memory and observations, besides the accounts of some trustworthy narrators. His work is a regional history, generally limited to military and political events. For example, Yahya omitted the [[revenue reforms of Alauddin Khalji|economic reforms]] of [[Alauddin Khalji]] (r. 1296-1316).{{sfn|Mohibbul Hasan|1968|p=174}}
