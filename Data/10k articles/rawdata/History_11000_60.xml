      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3393">'''Zahir al-Din Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn Zayd-i Bayhaqi''' ({{lang-fa|ظهیرالدین ابوالحسن علی بن زید بیهقی}}; ca. 1097 – 1169) also known as '''Ebn Fondoq''' (ابن فندق) was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] [[polymath]] of [[Arabs|Arab]] descent.{{sfn|Halm|1988|pages=895-896}} He is the author of ''[[Tarikh-i Bayhaq]]''.{{sfn|Bosworth|2010|p=81}}

==Ancestry==
Bayhaqi was a descendant of [[Khuzaima ibn Thabit]] (died 657), a companion of [[Muhammad]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2010|p=82}} Most of his forefathers were either judges or Imams.{{sfn|Bosworth|2010|p=82}}

==Biography==
Bayhaqi was born in [[Sabzevar]], the main city of the Bayhaq district, where his father’s estates were located.{{sfn|Halm|1988|pages=895-896}}

In 1114, Bahyaqi along with his father visited [[Omar Khayyam]], the famous Persian mathematician and astronomer, in [[Nishapur]] and while there Bayhaqi began his education in literature and science. He moved to [[Merv|Marv]] to complete his studies in Islamic [[feqh|jurisprudence]] by 1123. He returned to Nishapur in c.1127 where according to [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], his studies were "interrupted by marriage".

Bayhaqi became the [[qadi]] of Bayhaq through the efforts of his father-in-law, Shehab-al-Din Moḥammad b. Mas'ud, along with patronage from the Seljuq Sultan Sanjar.{{sfn|Bosworth|2010|p=83}} He may have made some enemies while in charge, he soon grew tired and resigned.

Bayhaqi then traveled to Ray and devoted himself to mathematics and astrology, and later studied in Nishapur to improve his understanding of astrology. While living in [[Sarakhs]] he squandered all of his money, and returned to Nishapur.

After an attempt to establish himself in Bayhaq failed "because of his relatives’ envy", Bayhaqi finally returned again to Nishapur and settled down to life in the seminary and the mosque.{{sfn|Halm|1988|pages=895-896}}

In 1148, [[Demetrius I of Georgia|Demetrius I]] of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] presented inquiries ("of unknown purport") in Syriac and Arabic to [[Sultan Sanjar]] through an envoy.{{sfn|Halm|1988|pages=895-896}} Bayhaqi was given the task of responding to Demetrius' inquiries by Sultan Sanjar.{{sfn|Halm|1988|pages=895-896}}

==Works==
Bayhaqi authored over 70 works ranging from Arabic grammar to astrology to philology.{{sfn|Bosworth|2010|p=83}}

The '''Academia Mexicana de la Historia''' (''Mexican Academy of History'', also known by the acronym '''AMH''') is a [[national academy]] in [[Mexico]], whose purpose is to promote and propagate [[history|historical studies]] within Mexico, conduct research into all aspects of the [[history of Mexico]], and to contribute towards the preservation of the national [[cultural heritage]]. It is a correspondent academy to the ''[[Real Academia de la Historia]]'' in [[Madrid]], the equivalent national academy of history in [[Spain]].

The AMH was formally constituted on September 12, 1919, after several previous attempts to form such a body had not come to fruition. Originally the AMH was established with 24 positions or numbered chairs (''sillones de número'') for full members (''académicos de número''). In 1990 this number was increased to 30, made up of 22 members resident in [[Mexico City]] (''miembros residentes'') and 8 external members from the [[States of Mexico|Mexican states]] (''miembros foráneos''). In addition, there are a number of correspondent members (''corresponsales'') from both within Mexico (''corresponsales nacionales'') and from other countries (''corresponsales extranjeros'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3369">'''Ahmad bey Jafargulu bey oglu Javanshir''' ({{lang-az| Əhməd bəy Cavanşir}}) (2 March 1828, near [[Agjabadi]] – 9 January 1903, [[ibid.]]) was an [[Azerbaijan]]i historian and military personality. He was the great-grandnephew of [[Ibrahim Khalil Khan]], the last ruling [[Karabakh khanate|khan of Karabakh]], and the father of philanthropist and feminist [[Hamida Javanshir]].

==Life==
Little is known about Ahmad bey Javanshir's personal life. His autobiography attached to the manuscript of his work ''On the Political Affairs of the Karabakh khanate in 1747–1805'' disappeared probably between 1905 and 1907. Historians have established that he was born in his family estate of Kahrizli, located near the town of Agjabadi in present-day Azerbaijan. His parents, Jafargulu bey and Zahra khanum descended from [[Panah Ali Khan]], the first khan of [[Karabakh]]. Until age 15, Ahmad bey studied at a religious school (''mollakhana''). The integration of the [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] [[upper class]] into the Imperial Russian political system required among other things the knowledge of the [[Russian language]], which is why Ahmad bey was sent to study to the [[Cadet Corps (Russia)|Pavlov Cadet Corps]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="shukurzadeh"&gt;{{az icon}} Preface to [http://www.anl.az/el/q/qarabaqnqmeler1.pdf The Karabakhnamehs] by A.Shukurzadeh.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1848 he served in a [[hussar]] regiment where he was advanced to the rank of Stabs-Captain. In 1853–1854 he participated in the [[Crimean War]]. In 1854 he was injured during a [[duel]] with Ali bey Sultanov, a fellow officer, and could not continue his military service. After returning to his native village, Ahmad bey Javanshir carried out economic reforms. In the 1860s he built an 8-[[verst]] (ca. 8.5&amp;nbsp;km) irrigation channel across the [[Mil plain]].&lt;ref name="shukurzadeh"/&gt; In the 1880s he was appointed member of the [[Shusha]]-based Bey Committee aimed at verifying the claims of some locals of having noble origins (if proven, they were exempt from some taxes according to the Russian law). His denunciations caused resentment among the committee members which led to Javanshir being temporarily imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;''Literature of the Azerbaijani Tatars'' by [[Firudin bey Kocharli]]. Tiflis: 1903; p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Javanshir spent his last years in Kahrizli, engaged in translation of the poems by [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]] and [[Vasily Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]] into Azeri, as well as writing his own historical work in Russian, entitled ''On the Political Affairs of the Karabakh khanate in 1747–1805'' (1883). It was published two years after his death in the ''Geyrat'' publishing house in [[Tiflis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hamida Javanshir]]'s Memoirs. Part 1, pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; His other works are ''Asar-i Ahmad bey Javanshir'' (a collection of children's poems) and ''Turk zarb-misallar majmuasi'' (an explanatory Azeri dictionary).

For the 17th/18th century [[Sufi]] writer of the zawiyya Nasiriyya see [[Ahmed ibn Nasir]].

'''Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Khalid al-Nasiri al-Salawi''',  (1834/5-1897) was born in [[Salé|Sla]], Morocco and is considered to be the greatest Moroccan historian of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;David Robinson, Jean-Louis Triaud, Ghislaine Lydon, ''Le temps des marabouts: itinéraires et stratégies islamiques en Afrique occidentale francaise v. 1880-1960'', p. 136, Paris: Karthala editions, 1997, Islam and state {{ISBN|2-86537-729-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prominent scholar and a member of the family that founded the [[Nasiriyya]] [[Sufi]] order in the 17th century. He wrote an important multivolume history of [[Morocco]]: ''Kitab al-Istiqsa li-Akhbar duwal al-Maghrib al-Aqsa''.&lt;ref&gt;New annotated edition in 8 volumes, Keta Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The work is a general history of Morocco and the Islamic west from the Islamic conquest to the end of the 19th century. He died in 1897 shortly after having put the finishing touches to his chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Pennell ''Morocco Since 1830: A History'', p. 109,&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2728">'''Albert Konstantinovich Chernenko''' ({{lang-ru|Альбе́рт Константи́нович Черне́нко}}; January&amp;nbsp;6, 1935&amp;nbsp;– April&amp;nbsp;11, 2009) was a [[Russia]]n [[philosophy|philosopher]], best known for his innovations in the field of [[Social philosophy|social]] and [[legal philosophy]]. He was the son of [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the fifth [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

During the rule of the [[Soviet Union]], Chernenko created the theory of "historical [[causality]]," which asserts that the multilevel nature of cause-effect relationships plays a significant part in historical processes.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Chernenko, ''Causality In History'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; This was an essential step in the development of the Soviets' understanding of historical events. According to Chernenko, causality in history has three levels of self-development: "general" (the building of a concrete formation), "special" (historical conditions), and "individual" (actions of historic figures).&lt;ref&gt;Albert Chernenko, ''Features of Causality In History And Dialectics of Its Research'', 1971, ''Socially-Philosophical Problems of The Theory of Historical Causality'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, he developed the idea of "legal technology," in which the methodology of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] is used to design social processes and to reform a social system. The purpose of legal technology, according to Chernenko, is the creation of a rational and effective legal system in light of the multilevel nature of causality and system-substantial understanding of the right. In this sense as the social phenomenon has the right not only external (the social environment), but also internal potential of inconsistent "self-development", that allows to consider the legal phenomena in a context sociocultural determinations (at a macrolevel) and self-determinations (microlevel).

[[Image:Casa de Osambela.JPG|thumb|250px|Facade of Osambela palace.]]
'''Osambela House''' ({{Lang-es|Casa de Osambela}}) is one of the biggest houses built in [[Lima]] during the colonial  [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] period. It is located at Conde de Superunda Street 298, in the [[historic centre of Lima]]. It is also called ''Casa de Oquendo''.

==History==
This mansion was built between 1803 and 1805. It has five [[Balconies of Lima|balconies]] and a ''mirador'' from which the first owner of the place, Don Martín de Osambela, watched with a spyglass the arrival of galleons to the port of [[Callao]]. It was renovated in 2003 and serves as a venue for art exhibitions and cultural events.

Founded in 1945, with its first volume published in 1960, the '''''Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum''''' is a scholarly journal documenting the work of international scholars interested in classical tradition during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

Each article treats a separate classical author, beginning with a detailed essay on the author’s reception from antiquity to 1600. This is followed by a comprehensive list both of printed and manuscript commentaries in Latin on the author and, in the case of Greek authors, a list of Latin translations as well.

In 2015, the ''Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum'' moved to online [[Open access journal|Open Access]] for previous editions while continuing to produce the current volume in print for sale through the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]].

== Purpose ==
The ''Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum'' is intended to illustrate the transmission of the ideas, and the influence, of ancient Greek and Latin authors (up to a.d. 600) during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (up to a.d. 1600).

It does so by a complete listing of all traceable Latin translations of these authors and of commentaries. For each translation or commentary, the ''Catalogus'' provides a brief introductory statement on the date and circumstances of the work; each translation or commentary is described and identified by ''Incipit'' and ''Explicit'', and there is a list of all known manuscripts and printed editions, with locations for both. As part of its movement online, the ''Catalogus'' has been able to provide these listings as searchable indices combining work from all volumes into four databases: Index of Articles, Index of Manuscripts, Index of Translators and Commentators, and an Index of Ancient Authors.

For each translator or commentator, there is a brief bio-bibliography. Finally each article on a classical author begins with a ''Fortuna'' outlining the author's history during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

In terms of the purpose of the ''Catalogus'', the list of Latin translations helps to establish the facts about the gradual reception of ancient Greek material in the West up to a.d. 1600. These Latin translations from the Greek had a much wider circulation, even during the Renaissance, than either the Greek originals or the vernacular translations, which were in fact usually based upon one of the Latin versions rather than upon the original Greek text. Hence a study of the fortunes and influence of any Greek author in the West must begin with an investigation of the existence and relative merit of the Latin translations of his works.

The list of Latin commentaries serve a similar purpose, especially for the fortunes and influence of the ancient Latin authors. The commentaries represent an important though comparatively neglected branch of literature, and they provide valuable evidence for the use made of authors commented on. The commentaries also illustrate the mental slant and characteristic interests of the commentator and of his period; they help us to understand the many and often diverse 'perceptions' of an ancient author.

Finally, the study of the commentaries throws light upon the curricula of schools and universities for whose use they were often composed.

== History ==
The original plans for the ''Catalogus'' were developed during 1945–46 under the aegis of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]]. Its organizational form was established in 1946 with an Editorial Board, an Executive Committee, and an International Committee. In 1965 the organization formed itself into The Mediaeval and Renaissance Latin Translations and Commentaries Association. The project was adopted by the [[Union Académique Internationale]] on the initiative of the [[Medieval Academy of America]] in 1951.

The general aims of the ''Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum'', which have been followed to this date, are set out in the 1958 Preface to Volume I,&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogustranslationum.org/PDFs/volume01/v01_preface.pdf Preface to Volume I]&lt;/ref&gt; by its founder and first Executive Editor [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]] of Columbia University.

The current editor is Greti Dinkova-Bruun of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4283">The '''City Council of Singapore''', or the '''[[Singapore Municipal Commission]]''' before 1951, was the administrative council of the [[Singapore City (historical entity)|City of Singapore]] responsible for the provision of water, electricity, gas, roads and bridges and street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39 Supreme Court: History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016121211/http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39 |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dissolved in 1959 when Singapore became self-governing and subsequently abolished upon Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia in 1965. The first fully elected council was elected in [[Singapore City Council election, 1957|1957]], followed with a by-election in [[Singaporean City Council by-election, 1958|1958]]. Prior to 1957 franchise was limited and there were appointed members.

==History==
As a British colony, Singapore was conferred city status by a royal charter from [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1951, when [[history of Singapore#Post-war period .281945 .E2.80.93 1955.29|Singapore]] was then a [[crown colony]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. The original Municipal Council was therefore renamed City Council, and the Municipal Building was renamed [[City Hall, Singapore|City Hall]]. In 1965, upon Singapore's expulsion from [[Malaysia]], the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 provided the following clause
{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0 style=background:Transparent width=90% align=center
|-
|width=10 valign=top|" ||'' [[President of Singapore|President]] may by order make such modifications in any written law as appear to him to be necessary or expedient in consequence of the abolition of the City Council and of the Rural Board and of the assumption of the powers of the local authorities by the [[Singapore Government|Government]]. '' ||valign=bottom align=right width=15|"
|}
that empowered the President to abolish the City Council and the Rural Board, with the powers of the local authorities assumed by the Government. The City Council of the City of Singapore and the Singapore Rural Board were abolished in 1965.

==Elections==
Prior to the 1957 City Council elections, franchise was limited and the council was party appointed. From 1949 to 1953 there were 6 seats on council:

* [[Singapore municipal election, April 1949|1949 (April 2)]]
* [[Singapore municipal election, December 1949|1949 (November 7)]]
* [[Singapore municipal election, 1950|1950 (December 2)]]
* [[Singapore City Council election, 1951|1951 (December 1)]]
* 1952 (December 6)
* 1953 (December 5)

After 1953 the yearly elections ended and the council term lasted 4 years. The elections in [[Singapore City Council election, 1957|1957]] and [[Singapore City Council by-election, 1958|1958]] eliminate all appointed seats on council. The number of seats increased to 32 for the last two elections before council was abolished.

'''Edmund of Hadenham''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1307), was a monk of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and an English chronicler.

On the authority of [[William Lambard]], the [[Kent]]ish topographer, a historical work preserved in the [[Cottonian Library]] in the [[British Museum]] is ascribed to Edmund. This manuscript, according to [[Henry Wharton]], contains a chronicle, which is a copy of the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]''. It is in one handwriting down to 1307, except{{clarify|date=July 2018}} that it contains a number of interspersed notices relating to the history of Rochester. These Rochester annals are printed in Wharton's '[[Anglia Sacra]],' i. 341-355 (1691). After 1307 there is a continuation in another hand, extending to 1377, but not dealing with Rochester affairs.

The manuscript formerly belonged to [[John Joscelin]]; Lambard, in attributing the work to Hadenham, may have had a different copy before him.

[[Josiah Cox Russell]] argued in 1935 that John of Renham, prior of Rochester, was at least a part-author of the annals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=11852|first=M. C.|last=Buck|title=Hadenham, Edmund of}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''exhumation of Yagan's head''' was the result of a [[Archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] and [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig at a grave site in the [[Everton Cemetery]], [[Liverpool]] in 1997.

==Background==
{{main|Yagan}}
[[Yagan]] was an [[indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian]] warrior of the [[Noongar]] nation who played a key part in early indigenous resistance to European settlement and rule around the area of [[Perth, Western Australia]].  He was shot dead by a young settler, James Keates in 1833. Yagan's head was removed, preserved by smoking, and taken to England by Robert Dale, who gave it to the Liverpool Institute for display in a museum.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turnbull, Paul|year=1998|title="Outlawed Subjects": The Procurement and Scientific Uses of Australian Aboriginal Heads, ca. 1803&amp;ndash;1835|journal=Eighteenth-Century Life|volume=22|issue=1|pages=156&amp;ndash;171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1964, Yagan's head was badly decomposed, and the decision was made to dispose of it.  The head was placed in a [[plywood]] box, along with a [[Peru]]vian [[mummy]] and a [[Mokomokai|Māori head]], and buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years, a number of burials were made around the grave, and in 1968 a local hospital buried 20 stillborn babies and two babies who had lived less than twenty-four hours, directly over the museum box.&lt;ref name="Fforde"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fforde, Cressida|year=2002|chapter=Chapter 18: Yagan|title=The Dead and Their Possessions: Repatriation in Principle, Policy, and Practice|editor1=Fforde, Cressida |editor2=Hubert, Jane |editor3=Turnbull, Paul |location=London | publisher=Routledge|pages=229&amp;ndash;241|isbn=0-415-23385-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yagan's grave surface EM data.png|thumbnail|right|A horizontal colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site.]]
For many years, members of Perth's Noongar community sought to have Yagan's head returned and buried according to tribal custom.  An application for exhumation of the head was made in 1994, but it was refused because [[next of kin]] permission to disturb the remains of the twenty-two babies could not be obtained.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

==The geophysical survey==
[[Image:Yagan's grave excavation pit.png|thumbnail|right|The excavation pit used for the exhumation of Yagan's head.]]
[[Image:Yagan's grave vertical EM data.png|thumbnail|right|A vertical colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site.]]
In 1997, two brothers, Dr Martin Bates of the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]] and Dr Richard Bates of the [[University of St Andrews]], were commissioned by the [[Home Office]] to conduct a [[Archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] of the grave site, with a view to exhuming the remains via an adjacent plot without disturbing any other remains.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

The pair conducted surface surveys using [[ground penetrating radar]] and ground conductivity techniques.  The ground penetrating radar yielded no information about the location of Yagan's head, as the highly disturbed graveyard soil contained many reflecting sources.  However, the ground conductivity measurements showed an anomaly in the electromagnetic signature that it was thought might be caused by metal artifacts buried with the head.  The apparent location of the remains confirmed the feasibility of accessing them via an adjacent plot.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"&gt;{{cite web | title=Archaeological Geophysics: Yagan's Head | url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~crb/web/arch/yagan.htm | accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;Bates, C. R. (2005) ''pers. comm.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A pit was then dug in an adjacent plot, to a depth of around six feet, and a vertical ground conductivity test was conducted from within the pit.  This test failed to detect the anomaly recorded in the surface test, however the conductivity plot did show an anomaly at the centre of the grave, indicating that the grave was dug to its full depth of nine feet only at its centre.  This suggested the burial of a small box, confirming the memory of the grave digger who claimed to have constructed a small box to house the buried remains.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt;

==The exhumation==
After gathering evidence on the position and depth of Yagan's head, Bates reported the survey results to the Home Office, which eventually granted permission to proceed with the exhumation.  Yagan's head was exhumed by tunnelling horizontally into the grave from the adjacent pit.  The tunneling operation was "delicate and risky", as the tunnel passed underneath the remains of the babies, such that any collapse could potentially disturb them.  According to Richard Bates, "the first shovel of dirt from the grave showed signs of the decayed box and the Peruvian mummy came next followed by the Māori head and finally Yagan's head".&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt;

The following day, a [[forensics|forensic]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] from the [[University of Bradford]] positively identified the skull as Yagan's, by correlating the fractures with those described in an 1834 report by [[Thomas Pettigrew]].&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Later that year, Yagan's head was handed over to a delegation of Noongars, who took it back to Australia.  Reburial of the head was delayed, however, due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body and disagreement by elders about the importance of burying the head with the body.&lt;ref name="Fforde"/&gt; They finally buried it in July 2010, in a traditional Noongar ceremony in the [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]] in Western Australia, 177 years after Yagan's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm/ Warrior reburied 170 years after death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623230023/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm |date=2013-06-23 }}, Australian Geographic, 12 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hazara people}}
'''Faiz Mohammad Kātib Hazāra''' ([[Dari-Persian]]: {{nq|فیض‌محمد کاتب هزاره}}, {{lang-ar|فيض محمد كاتب هزاره}}) most known as '''Kātib''' was son of ''Saeed Mohammad b.  Khudydad'' was born in 1862 or '63, in Zard Sang village of [[Qarabagh District, Ghazni|Qarabagh District]], [[Ghazni Province]] of [[Afghanistan]], he spent a part of his life in Nahoor another district of Ghazni, and died in [[Kabul]] in March 3, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Kabul Under Siege: Fayz Muhammad's Account of the 1929 Uprising By Fayz Muḥammad, translated by R. D. McChesney p 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was an ethnic [[Hazara people|Hazara]] and was of [[Muhammad Khwaja|Muhammad Khwaja Hazara]] clan. He was [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] court chronicler, a skilled [[calligrapher]] and secretary to [[Habib Ullah Khan|Emir Habib Ullah Khan]] from 1901 to 1919.&lt;ref name="Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 20"&gt;Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as "Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe" Moscow, 1988. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He was a well known historian, writer and intellectual, among the renowned group of Afghans seeking social and political changes in the country at the beginning of the 20th century, which shaped early regional politics from [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] to [[Morocco]] therefore many of the Afghan people say the government should have named him as the Father of Afghanistan History. He was a member of what became known as Junbish-i Mashrutyat or ''The Constitutionalist Movement''.&lt;ref name="IranicaOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fayz-mohammad-kateb|title=FAYŻ MOḤAMMAD KĀTEB|author=R. D. McChesney and A. H. Tarzi|publisher=Iranica|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Faiz Mohammad spent  his youth in [[Qarabagh District, Ghazni|Qarabagh District,]] tutored in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and the [[Koran]] by local [[Mullah|mullahs]], in 1880 he and his family moved first to [[Nawur District|Nawur]] and then, because of sectarian strife, to [[Qandahar]] in the same year. In 1887 he left Qandahar for a year’s travel that took him to [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] where he spent some time studying [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. He eventually landed in [[Jalalabad]] and was invited in 1888 to join the administration of the Afghan amir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]].&lt;ref name="IranicaOnline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 13"&gt;Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as "Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe" Moscow, 1988. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
He was soon attached to the entourage of the amir’s eldest son, Habib Ullah Khan, at the recommendation of one of his teachers, Mullah Sarwar Ishaq'zai.&lt;ref name="Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 13" /&gt; Faiz Mohammad accompanied the prince from Kabul to Jalalabad in 1311/1893-94.&lt;ref&gt;Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara, "Siraj al-Tawarikh", Kabul, 1331-1333/1913-1915. III, p. 990&lt;/ref&gt; There is a manuscript attributed to him, dated 29 Rajab 1311/5 February 1894, which places him in Jalalabad at this time. In 1314/1896, when Habib Ullah’s younger brother [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasr Ullah Khan]] toured [[England]] on a state visit, Habib Ullah assigned Faiz Mohammad to copy and post in the Charsuq, Kabul’s main market-place, the detailed letters sent back by Nasr Ullah recounting his activities, so that “noble and commoner alike would be apprised of the honor and respect that the English were according him”.&lt;ref&gt;Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara, "Siraj al-Tawarikh", Kabul, 1331-1333/1913-1915. III, p. 1107&lt;/ref&gt;

During Habib Ullah’s reign, Faiz Mohammad was involved, if only peripherally, with the Young Afghan movement led by [[Mahmud Tarzi|Mahmud Baig Tarzi]]. He is said to have been associated with the publication of Tarzi’s reformist journal, ''Siraj al-Akbar'', and three other journals, ''Anis'', ''Ḥayy alal-falah'', and ''Aina-ye Irfan''. After the assassination of his patron in 1337/1919, Faiz Mohammad worked for a time at the [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Education]] on textbook revision. Sometime later, he was appointed to a teaching position at the [[Habibia High School|Habibiya Laycee]] ''(Habibiya High School)'' in Kabul.&lt;ref name="Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 13" /&gt;

During the reign of [[Aman Ullah Khan]] (1919–29), the Iranian minister in Kabul Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh compiled a “who’s who” of contemporary Afghan leaders. His sketch of Faiz Mohammad characterizes him as a devout [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]], highly regarded by the [[Qizilbash]] community of Kabul, as well as a leader among his own people, the Hazaras, and an important source of information for the Persian mission about what was going on in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;M. Farrokh, "Tarikh-e Siasi-ye Afghanistan", Tehran, 1314 Š./1935; Reprinted, Qom, 1371 Š./1992, pp. 252-54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the [[Tajik people|Tajik]] outlaw [[Habibullāh Kalakāni|Habib Ullah Kalakani]], known to history as Bacha ye Saqqao (son of the water-carrier), ousted Aman Ullah Khan and took control of Kabul for nine months (January to October 1929). During this uprising Faiz Mohammad, who spent almost the entire period inside the city, kept a journal which was the basis for an unfinished monograph entitled ''Kitab-e Tadakoor-e Enqilab'' which he began shortly after the fall of Bacha ye Saqqao.

During the occupation, Faiz Mohammad was forced to take part in a delegation sent by Kalakani to negotiate with Hazara groups opposing the Tajik leader. According to his account, he managed to subvert Kalakani’s plans and caused the mission to fail. However, he and the mission’s leader, Noor al-Din Agha, a Qizilbash Shiʿite from Kabul, paid a heavy price for this: both were sentenced to death by beating. Faiz Mohammad alone survived the ordeal and was saved by a colleague. The Persian mission in Kabul, under a directive from [[Rezā Shāh|Reza Shah]] to do what it could to aid the Shiʿites of Kabul, sent medicines to his house. He eventually recovered enough to travel the following year to Tehran for more medical care. After less than a year there, he returned to Kabul, where he died on 6 Shawal 1349/3 March 1931, at the age of sixty-eight or sixty-nine.&lt;ref&gt;Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as "Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe" Moscow, 1988. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Faiz Mohammad  is best known for his books on Afghan history. During Habib Ullah’s reign, he accepted two commissions to write a comprehensive history of Afghanistan covering events from the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah]] down through the reign of Habib Ullah Khan. The first was a history of Afghanistan entitled ''Tohfat ul-Habib'' (Ḥabib’s gift) in honor of the amir, but Habib Ullah Khan deemed the finished work unacceptable and ordered Faiz Mohammad to start over. The revised version is the three-volume history of Afghanistan entitled Siraj al-Tawarikh (Lamp of Histories), an allusion to the amir’s honorific “Lamp of the Nation and Religion” (Siraj al-mella waʾl-din). There were also problems in publishing it, the third volume never being completely printed. It is thought that the process of publishing the third volume lasted several years and only ended after Habib Ullah Khan’s death.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Romodin, “Sources of the Siraj al-Tawarikh,” in Pis’mennye pamyatniki i problemy istorii kul’tury narodov Vostoka, May 1969, p. 114 (Abstracts of papers presented at the Fifth Annual Session of the Literary Division of the Institute of Orientalistics, Academy of Sciences)&lt;/ref&gt; Some say the publication on the third volume was halted at page 1,240 for unspecified reasons.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ghobar, "Tariḵ-e Adabiyat-e Afghanistan", Kabul, n.d. ʿA. Ḥabibi, "Jonbesh-e mashrutiyat dar Afghanistan", Kabul, 1363 Š./1984. p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; Habib Ullah Khan’s successor, Aman Ullah Khan, was initially interested in the work and typesetting resumed in the mid-1920s, but when the amir reviewed the material in it on Anglo-Afghan relations, he reportedly changed his mind, and ordered all published but still incomplete copies of the third volume taken from the press and burned.&lt;ref&gt;Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as "Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe" Moscow, 1988 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this reaction, Faiz Mohammad continued work on his chronicle. The manuscript of the remainder of the third volume is widely believed to have been finished, and the autograph was reportedly turned over to the Afghan archives by Faiz Mohammad’s son. Volumes devoted to Habib Ullah Khan and Aman Ullah Khan may also have been written. A ''farman'' issued by the latter announced that Faiz Mohammad had been ordered to complete the ''Siraj'' and then begin work on a chronicle of the reign of Aman Ullah Khan to be entitled ''Tarikh-e Asr-e Amaniya''. There is some evidence to suggest he did indeed carry out these commissions, although nothing more was ever published.&lt;ref&gt;Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as "Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe" Moscow, 1988. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the monumental ''Siraj al-Tawrikh'', Faiz Mohammad wrote the following works:

* '''Tuhfatul Habib'''' Afghan History (1747–1880), in two volumes.  (The original script, hand-written by Faiz Mohammed, exists in the National Archive in Kabul)
* '''Tazkeratul Enqilaab'''  accounts of the days of Habibullah, Bacha-e Saqaw
* '''History of Ancient Prophets/Rulers''', from Adam to Jesus
* '''[[hdl:2333.1/4xgxd2pg|Hidāyat-i kisht-i gul-hā va qalamah-hā va ḥubūbāt va ghayrah]]''' (1921–1922)
* '''[[hdl:2333.1/0k6djhsv|Jughrāfiyā-yi ṭabʻī va Afrīqā]]'''
* '''Tarikh-e Hokama-ye Motaqaddem''', compiled while he was working at the Ministry of Education;
* '''Fayz al-Foyuzat''', a fragment of which, called ''Afghan treaties and agreements'' (ʿahd wa misaq-e afghan) was published in Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh’s ''Tarikh-e Siasi-ye Afghanistan'' (Tehran, 1314 Š./1935) and which, in tune with the times, was a sharp critique of the Abdul Rahman’s relations with the British;
* '''Faqarat-e Sharʿiya''', which is not known to have survived; and
* '''Nasab-nama-ye Tawaʾef-e afghena wa taʿaddod-e nofus-e ishan''', also known as ''Nijhad-nama-ye Afghan'', a description of Afghan tribes and non-Afghans residing in Afghanistan. The ''Nijhad-nama'' was published in Persia in 1933 from a manuscript thought to be the autograph and held in the ''Kitab Khana-ye Milli-ye Malik'' in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nijhad-nama-ye Afghan, editors. K. Yazdani and A. Raḥimi, Qom, 1372 Š./1993. pp. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the works he is known to have copied is a 230 folio collection of ''farmans'' issued by the Mughal ruler [[Aurangzeb]] (1068–1118/1658–1707) which he completed in Jalalabad in 1312/1894; the divan of ''Šehab-e Torshizi'', a late 18th-century poet from [[Herat Province|Herat]]; and ''Risala-ye fiuz'', a treatise on explosives.&lt;ref name="Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 20" /&gt;

In the late 20th century American scholar [[Robert D. McChesney]] extensively researched Faiz Mohammed's life and written works, in particular the Sirajul Tawarikh. In 1999 McChesney published a translation of Tazkeratul Enqilaab's under the title ''Kabul under siege: Fayz Muhammad's account of the 1929 Uprising.'' &lt;ref name="kus"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Kabul under siege: Fayz Muhammad's account of the 1929 Uprising|last=McChesney|first=R.D.|author2=Fayz Muhammad|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55876-154-4|location=Princeton|page=|pages=|authorlink=Robert D.

'''Francisco José Freire''' ({{IPA-pt|fɾɐ̃ˈsiʃku ʒuˈzɛ ˈfɾɐjɾ(ɨ)}}) (January 3, 1719 – July 5, 1773), [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[historian]] and [[philologist]], was born in [[Lisbon]].

He belonged to the monastic society of [[St Philip Neri]], and was a zealous member of the literary association known as the Academy of Arcadians, in connexion with which he adopted the pseudonym of '''Cândido Lusitano'''.

He contributed much to the improvement of the style of Portuguese prose literature, but his endeavour to effect a reformation in the national poetry by a translation of [[Horace]]'s ''Ars poetica'' was less successful.

The work in which he set forth his opinions regarding the vicious taste pervading the current Portuguese prose literature is entitled ''Maximas sabre a Arte Oratoria'' (1745) and is preceded by a chronological table forming almost a social and physical history of Portugal.

His best known work, however, is his ''Vida do Infante D. Henrique'' (1758), which has given him a place in the first rank of Portuguese historians, and has been translated into French (Paris, 1781).

He also wrote a poetical dictionary (''Diccionario poetico'') and a translation of [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s ''Athalie'' (1762), and his ''Reflexions sur la langue portugaise'' was published in 1842 by the Lisbon society for the promotion of useful knowledge. He died at [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]] on July 5, 1773.

He was a partisan of the [[Protestant Reformation]], and by most accounts was a libertine, despite his vocation.

He was the son of Louis Bonivard, Seigneur de Lunes, and was born at [[Seyssel, Haute-Savoie|Seyssel]] into an old family of [[Savoy]]. He was educated by various monks under the jurisdiction of his uncle, Jean-Aimé de Bonivard, who was [[prior]] of St.-Victor, a [[monastery]] just outside the walls of [[Geneva]]. At the age of seven, Bonivard was sent to study at [[Pinerolo]], Italy; for most of his youth, he reportedly preferred amusements to learning.&lt;ref name= "Amstel" /&gt; He attended the [[University of Turin]] and, on his uncle's death, succeeded him at St.-Victor in 1510.&lt;ref name= "Cyclo"&gt;{{cite book |last= McClintock |first= John |author2=James Strong |title= Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 11 |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Brothers |year= 1889 |page= 555 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=THZPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA555&amp;lpg=PA555&amp;dq=fran%C3%A7ois+bonivard+turin+1510#v=onepage&amp;q=fran%C3%A7ois%20bonivard%20turin%201510&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy]], seized the Bonivards' property except for the priory, Bonivard sided with the patriots of Geneva who opposed the Savoy efforts to control the region. In 1519 he fled Geneva, disguised as a monk, upon news that the Duke was approaching. He was cozened by friends, the Lord of Varuz and a monk named Brisset, the Abbot of Montheron of the Pays de Vaud, who betrayed him.&lt;ref name= "Chr"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bacon |first= Leonard Woolsey |title= The Real Prisoner of Chillon: A Curious Episode in Ecclesiastical History |journal= Christian Literature |volume= 12 |number= 6 |date= April 1895 |location= England |publisher= Lightning Source |page= 316 |isbn= 1-278-82967-9 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=LOXbAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=bonivard+chaponniere#v=onepage&amp;q=bonivard%20chaponniere&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Spon |first= Jacob |title= The History of the City and State of Geneva |location= London|publisher= Bernard White |year= 1687 |pages= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; They turned him over to the Duke, who imprisoned him at [[Grolée]], one of his castles on the [[Rhone]], from 1519 to 1521. The Abbot of Montheron was given the monastery St.-Victor, but he was evidently poisoned by friends of Bonivard, who also worked to release him from prison.&lt;ref name= "Chr" /&gt; Bonivard returned to the priory in 1527.

The experience was not much of a deterrent; Bonivard continued his political activism. In 1530, he was set upon by Duke's men when he thought he could spend a safe night in [[Moudon]], and he was again handed over to the Duke of Savoy. The Duke imprisoned him again, this time underground in the [[Château de Chillon|Castle of Chillon]]. Bonivard was released by the [[Bern]]ese when they conquered [[Vaud]] in 1536. His priory had meanwhile been razed, but Geneva awarded him a pension. He was made ''bourgeois'' of Geneva in 1537, a position he felt compelled to renounce due to his precarious finances.&lt;ref name= "Reg"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingdon |first= Robert M |author2=Thomas Lambert |author3=Isabella M.

He lived chiefly in Bern and [[Lausanne]] after 1538, but returned to Geneva permanently in 1544.

Bonivard was married four times. The first marriage was to Catherine Baumgartner, perhaps in 1542, which appears to have ended in 1543&lt;ref name= "Reg" /&gt; upon her death.&lt;ref name= "Amstel" /&gt; He was next married to Jeanne Darmeis, the widow of Pierre Corne, from 1544 until her death in 1552; they "lived very little and very badly together."&lt;ref name= "Reg" /&gt; His third marriage was to another widow, Pernette Mazue or Mazure; they were married 1550-1562. Mazure's fortune, however, was left to her son; though Bonivard's first wife seems to have been a good manager of his estate, he was dedicated to spending money and hosting dinners for his friends, and reportedly scandalized the neighborhood with his parties. He was urged to marry again by neighboring citizens to reduce the scandal. His fourth wife, therefore, was an unfrocked nun, Catherine de Courtaronel or Courtavonne; he was sixty-nine, and there is no evidence that they wished to marry except to quiet the neighbors.&lt;ref name= "Gribble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Chroniques de Genève'') was sent to [[John Calvin]] for correction in 1551, but not actually published until 1831.&lt;ref name= "Cyclo" /&gt; It is not a highly regarded work, being both biased and uncritical. In his later years, he enlisted the help of [[Antoine Froment]] to help with the chronicle.

Other published works include ''Advis et Devis de la Source de l'Idolatrie et Tryannie Papale'', ''Advis et Devis de Langues'' (1563), and ''Advis et Devis sur l'Ancienne et Nouvelle Police de Genève''.

In 1551, he donated his considerable library to the public. He left everything to the city of Geneva in his will. He died in 1570 at the age of seventy-seven. His exact date of death is not known because of a gap in the death records of the city.

The '''Gustav Mahler Stube''', formerly Trenkenhof, is a [[farmhouse]] in Altschluderbach, near [[Toblach]] in [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]]. It has a restaurant with a [[Austrian cuisine#Tyrol|Tyrolean cuisine]] and two apartments. The ''Stube'' furthermore manages an animal park with domestic, wild and exotic animals.

The farmhouse is especially known as the former residence of the Austrian composer [[Gustav Mahler]] (1860-1911), who stayed here from 1908 to 1910. The first floor was a museum on his life and work. His composing hut is located in the park and is still equipped as a small museum and memorial.

== Gustav Mahler ==
=== History ===
Mahler and his wife [[Alma Werfel|Alma]] visited the place for the first time in 1907. They lived here in the summer from 1908 to 1910; after his death, she stayed here in 1911 too. After their daughter Putzi died in 1907 at the [[Wörthersee]], where Mahler had previously had his [[Composing hut of Gustav Mahler (Wörthersee)|composing hut]], they decided not to return there anymore but to live on the first floor of this farmhouse instead. Aside, the wooden little house near Trenkenhof was prepared for Mahler, so he could compose music there.&lt;ref name="Opus Klassiek"&gt;Opus Klassiek, [https://www.opusklassiek.nl/componisten/mahler_in_toblach.htm Componisten/werken - Gustav Mahler in Toblach (1908 ~ 1910)], 2004 {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Altschluderbach he composed [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|his ninth]] and (not completed) [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|tenth symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Hochpustertal, [http://www.hochpustertal.net/freizeit/familie/wildpark-toblach/ Der Wildpark in Toblach] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Museum ===
[[File:Mahlers Komonierhäuschen.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Composing hut of Gustav Mahler]]
In 2004, the first floor was still equipped as a museum. With furniture from his life and other memorabilia, it presented the way he lived here.&lt;ref name="Opus Klassiek" /&gt; This floor is no longer open to the public.&lt;ref name="FAZ"&gt;Frankfurter Algemeine, [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/reise/nah/gustav-mahler-in-toblach-flucht-vor-den-kuhgaesten-12143263.html Flucht vor den Kuhgästen], 9 April 2017 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a distance of five minutes, the little composing hut in the animal park still functions as a museum and memorial. Here, he had three pianos at his disposal in order to compose music during his stay. There are a number of presentation plates that recall his work and life.&lt;ref name="Opus Klassiek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAZ" /&gt;

There are more former composing huts of Mahler that still exist. There is also a [[Composing hut of Gustav Mahler (Attersee)|composing hut at the Attersee]], [[Upper Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;Georg Föttinger, [https://www.mahler-steinbach.at/english/composing-cottage/  Composing hut of Gustav Mahler Steinbach], Mahler Steinbach&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Composing hut of Gustav Mahler (Wörthersee)|one at the Wörthersee]] in [[Carinthia]].&lt;ref&gt;Die Presse, [https://diepresse.com/home/leben/reise/5463721/In-Gustav-Mahlers-Komponierhaeuschen-am-Woerthersee In Gustav Mahlers Komponierhäuschen am Wörthersee], Madeleine Napetschnig, 14 July 2018 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clearleft}}

== Gustav Mahler Wild Park ==
Next to the farmhouse, an animal park was created around 1985 with the character of a spacious [[petting zoo]]. The animals vary from domestic and exotic animals to wild animals from the [[Alps]], like [[deer]], [[roe deer]], [[wild boar]]s, [[Procyon (genus)|washing bears]], [[true owl|owls]] and [[lynx]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Peer TV, [https://www.peer.tv/de/263 Gustav Mahler Wildpark]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical demography''' is the [[quantitative study]] of [[human population]] in the past. It is concerned with population size, with the three basic components of population change--[[fertility]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], and  [[Human migration|migration]], and with population characteristics related to those components, such as marriage, [[socioeconomic status]], and the configuration of families.

==Sources==
The sources of historical demography vary according to the period and topics of the study.

For the recent period - beginning in the early nineteenth century in most European countries, and later in the rest of the world - historical demographers make use of data collected by governments, including [[census]]es and [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]].&lt;ref name="EoPH"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern period, historical demographers rely heavily on ecclesiastical records of baptisms, marriages, and burials, using methods developed by French historian [[Louis Henry]], as well as hearth and poll tax records.

For population size, sources can also include the size of cities and towns, the size and density of smaller settlements, relying on [[field survey]] techniques, the presence or absence of agriculture on [[marginal land]], and inferences from historical records. For population health and life expectancy, [[paleodemography]], based on the study of skeletal remains, is another important approach for populations that precede the modern era, as is the study of ages of death recorded on funerary monuments.

The PUMS (Public User Microdata Samples) data set allows researchers to analyze contemporary and historical data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Andrews, "Public User Microdata Samples (PUMS): Do-lt-Yourself Census Data."

==Development of  techniques==
Historical analysis has played a central role in the study of population, from [[Thomas Malthus]] in the eighteenth century to major twentieth-century demographers such as [[Ansley Coale]] and [[Samuel H. Preston]]. The French historian [[Louis Henry]] (1911-1991) was chiefly responsible for the development of historical demography as a distinct subfield of demography.&lt;ref name="Rosental"&gt;Paul-André Rosental, [http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=POPE&amp;ID_NUMPUBLIE=POPE_301&amp;ID_ARTICLE=POPE_301_0097 The Novelty of an Old Genre: Louis Henry and the Founding of Historical Demography], ''Population'' (English edition), Volume 58 –2003/1, Retrieved on 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, new research in historical demography has proliferated owing to the development of massive new population data collections, including the Demographic Data Base in Umeå, Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddb.umu.se/index_eng.html, Retrieved on 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the Historical Sample of the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iisg.nl/hsn/, Retrieved on 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]] (IPUMS).

According to Willigan and Lynch, the main sources used by demographic historians include archaeological methods, parish registers starting about 1500 in Europe, civil registration records, enumerations, national [[census]] beginning about 1800, genealogies and family reconstruction studies, population registers,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Cotts Watkins and Myron P. Gutmann. "Methodological issues in the use of population registers for fertility analysis." ''Historical Methods: A Journal of Quantitative and Interdisciplinary History'' (1983) 16#3: 109-120.&lt;/ref&gt; and organizational and institutional records.  Statistical methods have included model life tables, time series analysis, event history analysis, causal model building and hypothesis testing, As well as theories of the demographic transition and the epidemiological transition.&lt;ref&gt;Willigan and  Lynch, ''Sources and methods of historical demography'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David S.

{{History of Honduras}}

Authoritarian General [[Tiburcio Carias Andino]] controlled [[Honduras]] during the [[Great Depression]], until 1948. In 1955—after two authoritarian administrations and a [[General strike of 1954 (Honduras)|general strike]] initiated by [[Banana production in Honduras|banana workers]]—young military reformists staged a coup that installed a provisional [[Military dictatorship|junta]] and paved the way for constituent assembly elections in 1957. This assembly appointed [[Ramón Villeda Morales]] as President and transformed itself into a national legislature with a 6-year term. 

In 1963, conservative military officers preempted [[Honduran general election, 1963|constitutional elections]] and deposed Villeda in a [[1963 Honduran coup d'état|bloody coup]]. The armed forces, led by Gen. [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], governed until 1970. Popular discontent continued to rise after a 1969 border war with [[El Salvador]], known as the "[[Soccer War]]". A civilian President—[[Ramón Ernesto Cruz]] of the [[National Party of Honduras|National Party]]—took power briefly in 1970 but proved unable to manage the government. 

In 1972, Gen. Lopez staged another coup. Lopez adopted more progressive policies, including land reform, but his regime was brought down in the mid-1970s by corruption scandals. The regimes of Gen. [[Juan Alberto Melgar Castro]] (1975–78) and Gen. [[Policarpo Paz García]] (1978–82) largely built the current physical infrastructure and telecommunications system of Honduras. The country also enjoyed its most rapid economic growth during this period, due to greater international demand for its products and the availability of foreign commercial lending.

Following the overthrow of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] in [[Nicaragua]] in 1979 and general instability in El Salvador at the time, Hondurans elected a constituent assembly in 1980 and voted in general elections in 1981; the [[Liberal Party of Honduras|Liberal Party]] government of President [[Roberto Suazo Córdova]] took office.

==The era of Tiburcio Carías Andino, 1932–1954==
Despite growing unrest and severe economic strains, the 1932 presidential elections in Honduras were relatively peaceful and fair. The peaceful transition of power was surprising because the onset of the depression had led to the overthrow of governments elsewhere throughout Latin America, in nations with much stronger democratic traditions than those of Honduras. [[Vicente Mejía Colindres]], however, resisted pressure from his own party to manipulate the results to favor the [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (''Partido Liberal de Honduras'', PLH) candidate, Angel Zúñiga Huete. As a result, the [[National Party of Honduras]] (''Partido Nacional de Honduras'', PNH) candidate, [[Tiburcio Carías Andino]], won the election by a margin of some 20,000 votes. On November 16, 1932, Carías assumed office, beginning what was to be the longest period of continuous rule by an individual in Honduran history.

Lacking was any immediate indication that the Carías administration was destined to survive any longer than most of its predecessors. Shortly before Carías's inauguration, dissident liberals, despite the opposition of Mejía Colindres, had risen in revolt. Carías had taken command of the government forces, obtained arms from [[El Salvador]], and crushed the uprising in short order. Most of Carías's first term in office was devoted to efforts to avoid financial collapse, improve the military, engage in a limited program of road building, and lay the foundations for prolonging his own hold on power.

The economic situation remained extremely bad throughout the 1930s. In addition to the dramatic drop in banana exports caused by the [[Great Depression|depression]], the [[Banana production in Honduras|Honduran banana industry]] was further threatened by the outbreak in 1935 of epidemics of [[Panama disease]] (a debilitating fungus) and [[black sigatoka]] (leaf blight) in banana-producing areas. Within a year, most of the country's production was threatened. Large areas, including most of those around [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], were abandoned, and thousands of Hondurans were thrown out of work. By 1937 a means of controlling the disease had been found, but many of the affected areas remained out of production because a significant share of the market formerly held by Honduras had shifted to other nations.

Carías had made efforts to improve the military even before he became president. Once in office, both his capacity and his motivation to continue and to expand such improvements increased. He gave special attention to the fledgling air force, founding the Military Aviation School in 1934 and arranging for a United States colonel to serve as its commandant.

As months passed, Carías moved slowly but steadily to strengthen his hold on power. He gained the support of the banana companies through opposition to [[strike action|strikes]] and other labor disturbances. He strengthened his position with domestic and foreign financial circles through conservative economic policies. Even in the height of the depression, he continued to make regular payments on the Honduran debt, adhering strictly to the terms of the arrangement with the British bondholders and also satisfying other creditors. Two small loans were paid off completely in 1935.

Political controls were instituted slowly under Carías. The [[Communist Party of Honduras]] (''Partido Comunista de Honduras'', PCH) was outlawed, but the PLH continued to function, and even the leaders of a small uprising in 1935 were later offered free air transportation should they wish to return to Honduras from their [[exile]] abroad. At the end of 1935, however, stressing the need for peace and internal order, Carías began to crack down on the opposition press and political activities. Meanwhile, the PNH, at the president's direction, began a propaganda campaign stressing that only the continuance of Carías in office could give the nation continued peace and order. The constitution, however, prohibited immediate reelection of presidents.

The method chosen by Carías to extend his term of office was to call a constituent assembly that would write a new constitution and select the individual to serve for the first presidential term under that document. Except for the president's desire to perpetuate himself in office, there seemed little reason to alter the nation's basic charter. Earlier constituent assemblies had written thirteen constitutions (only ten of which had entered into force), and the latest had been adopted in 1924. The handpicked Constituent Assembly of 1936 incorporated thirty of the articles of the 1924 document into the 1936 constitution. 

The major changes were the elimination of the prohibition on immediate reelection of a president and vice president and the extension of the presidential term from four to six years. Other changes included restoration of the death penalty, reductions in the powers of the legislature, and denial of citizenship and therefore the right to vote to women. Finally, the new constitution included an article specifying that the incumbent president and vice president would remain in office until 1943. But Carías, by then a virtual dictator, wanted even more, so in 1939 the legislature, now completely controlled by the PNH, obediently extended his term in office by another six years (to 1949).

The PLH and other opponents of the government reacted to these changes by attempting to overthrow Carías. Numerous efforts were made in 1936 and 1937, but all were successful only in further weakening the PNH's opponents. By the end of the 1930s, the PNH was the only organized functioning political party in the nation. Numerous opposition leaders had been imprisoned, and some had reportedly been chained and put to work in the streets of [[Tegucigalpa]]. Others, including the leader of the PLH, Zúñiga Huete, had fled into exile.

=== 1940s ===
During his presidency, Carías cultivated close relations with his fellow Central American dictators, generals [[Jorge Ubico]] in [[Guatemala]], [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]] in [[El Salvador]], and [[Anastasio Somoza García]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Relations were particularly close with Ubico, who helped Carías reorganize his [[secret police]] and also captured and shot the leader of a Honduran uprising who had made the mistake of crossing into Guatemalan territory. Relations with Nicaragua were somewhat more strained as a result of the continuing border dispute, but Carías and Somoza managed to keep this dispute under control throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

The value of these ties became somewhat questionable in 1944 when popular revolts in Guatemala and El Salvador deposed Ubico and Hernández Martínez. For a time, it seemed as if revolutionary contagion might spread to Honduras as well. A plot, involving some military officers as well as opposition civilians, had already been discovered and crushed in late 1943. In May 1944, a group of women began demonstrating outside of the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa, demanding the release of political prisoners. 

Despite strong government measures, tension continued to grow, and Carías was ultimately forced to release some prisoners. This gesture failed to satisfy the opposition, and antigovernment demonstrations continued to spread. In July several demonstrators were killed by troops in [[San Pedro Sula]]. In October a group of exiles invaded Honduras from El Salvador but were unsuccessful in their efforts to topple the government. The military remained loyal, and Carías continued in office.

Anxious to curb further disorders in the region, the United States began to urge Carías to step aside and allow free elections when his current term in office expired. Carías, who by then was in his early seventies, ultimately yielded to these pressures and announced October 1948 elections, in which he would refrain from being a candidate. He continued, however, to find ways to use his power. The PNH nominated Carías's choice for president—[[Juan Manuel Gálvez]], who had been minister of war since 1933. Exiled opposition figures were allowed to return to Honduras, and the PLH, trying to overcome years of inactivity and division, nominated Zúñiga Huete, the same individual whom Carías had defeated in 1932. The PLH rapidly became convinced that it had no chance to win and, charging the government with manipulation of the electoral process, boycotted the elections. This act gave Gálvez a virtually unopposed victory, and in January 1949, he assumed the presidency.

Evaluating the Carías presidency is a difficult task. His tenure in office provided the nation with a badly needed period of relative peace and order. The country's fiscal situation improved steadily, education improved slightly, the road network expanded, and the armed forces were modernized. At the same time, nascent democratic institutions withered, opposition and labor activities were suppressed, and national interests at times were sacrificed to benefit supporters and relatives of Carías or major foreign interests.

Once in office, Gálvez demonstrated more independence than had generally been anticipated. Some policies of the Carías administration, such as road building and the development of coffee exports, were continued and expanded. By 1953 nearly one-quarter of the government's budget was devoted to road construction. Gálvez also continued most of the prior administration's fiscal policies, reducing the external debt and ultimately paying off the last of the British bonds. The fruit companies continued to receive favorable treatment at the hands of the Gálvez administration; for example, the [[United Fruit Company]] received a highly favorable twenty-five-year contract in 1949.

Galvez, however, instituted some notable alterations from the preceding fifteen years. Education received increased attention and began to receive a larger share of the national budget. Congress actually passed an income tax law, although enforcement was sporadic at best. The most obvious change was in the political arena. A considerable degree of press freedom was restored, the PLH and other groups were allowed to organize, and even some labor organization was permitted. Labor also benefited from legislation during this period. Congress passed, and the president signed, legislation establishing the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], paid holidays for workers, limited employer responsibility for work-related injuries, and regulations for the employment of women and children.

==Labor unrest and political transition 1954–1957==
The relative peace that Honduras had enjoyed for nearly two decades was shattered by a series of events during 1954, Gálvez's last year in office. Tension throughout the region had been increasing steadily as a confrontation developed between the United States and the left-leaning government of President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] in Guatemala. Part of the confrontation involved the expropriation of United Fruit Company lands and charges that the Guatemalan government was encouraging agitation among the banana workers.

In 1952, the United States had begun considering actions to overthrow the Guatemalan government. Honduras had given asylum to several exiled opponents of Arbenz, including Colonel [[Carlos Castillo Armas]], but Gálvez was reluctant to cooperate in direct actions against Guatemala, and the plans were not activated. By early 1954, however, a major covert operation against Guatemala was being organized, this time with greater Honduran cooperation. One reason for the cooperation was the Honduran government's concern over increased labor tensions in the banana-producing areas, tensions that the fruit companies blamed, in part, on Guatemalan influence.

Starting in early May 1954, the tensions escalated to strikes. First, a series of strikes broke out against United Fruit Company operations on Honduras's Caribbean coast. Within a few days, the strike spread to include the [[Standard Fruit Company]] operations, bringing the banana industry in the country to a near standstill. The strikers presented a wide range of grievances, involving wages, working conditions, medical benefits, overtime pay, and the right to collective bargaining. Initial government efforts to end the strike failed, and work stoppages began to spread into other industries. By May 21, the number of strikers was approaching 30,000, and the nation's economy was under severe strain.

As the strike was spreading, Honduras was also becoming more deeply involved in the [[Operation PBSUCCESS|movement to topple the Arbenz government in Guatemala]]. In late May, a military assistance agreement was concluded between the United States and Honduras, and large quantities of United States arms were quickly shipped to Honduras. Much of this incoming assistance was passed on to anti-Arbenz rebels commanded by Castillo Armas. In June these forces crossed into Guatemala and after several days of political maneuvering but little actual fighting, Arbenz fled into exile, and Castillo Armas became president. 

With the spectre of foreign influence over the strike thus removed, negotiations began, and the strike ended in early July. Labor leaders who had been accused of having ties with Guatemala were jailed, and the final settlement, which met few of the original demands, was signed with elements more acceptable to the government and the fruit companies than to the workers. Despite the limited gains, however, the strike did mark a major step toward greater influence for organized labor in Honduras and a decline in the power of the fruit companies.

=== 1954 election ===
In the midst of these conflicts, the campaign for the [[Honduran general election, 1954|1954 elections]] continued. Unhappy with some of Gálvez's gestures toward liberalization, Carías, despite his advanced age, decided to run for president and secured the PNH nomination. This move, however, split the party, and more moderate members broke away to form the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (Honduras)|Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (''Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario'', MNR). Their nominee was former vice president Abraham Williams Calderón. The split in the ruling party encouraged the PLH, who united behind [[Ramón Villeda Morales]], a Tegucigalpa physician who was seen as somewhat to the left of center in the party's political spectrum.

Both the campaign and the election were remarkably free and honest. On October 10, 1954, approximately 260,000 out of over 400,000 eligible voters went to the polls. Villeda Morales won a large plurality with 121,213 votes, Carías received 77,041, and Williams carried 53,041. The PLH also gained a plurality in the legislature. Under Honduran law, however, a majority of the total votes was required to be elected president; Villeda Morales lacked a majority by just over 8,000 votes. The stage was set for a repeat of the confusing paralysis of 1924 because the constitution required, first, that two-thirds of the members of the new legislature must be present and vote to choose a president and, second, that the victor must receive two-thirds of the legislature's vote. To complicate matters further, Gálvez left for [[Miami]] (reportedly to obtain medical treatment, although some sources claim he merely fled the country), leaving the government in the hands of Vice President [[Julio Lozano Díaz]].

Unable to reconcile their differences and unwilling to accept Villeda Morales as president, the PNH and MNR deputies boycotted the legislature, producing a national crisis. The constitution provided that in case of congressional deadlock the Supreme Court of Justice would select the president. Dominated as the court was by Carías appointees, the PLH opposed such a course of action. At this juncture, Lozano Díaz suddenly suspended the legislature and announced that he would act as president until new elections could be held. He declared that he would form a national government with cabinet members taken from all major parties and received pledges of support from all three candidates in the 1954 election. A [[Council of State]], headed by a PLH member but including members of all three major parties, was appointed to replace the suspended congress until a constituent assembly could be chosen to write yet another constitution.

Lozano Díaz began his period as president with a broad base of support that eroded rapidly. He unveiled an ambitious development plan to be financed by international loans and increased taxes and also introduced the nation's first labor code. This document guaranteed workers the right to organize and strike but gave employers the right of [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] and forbade strikes in public services. The code also embodied some [[social welfare]] and [[minimum-wage]] provisions and regulated hours and working conditions. All these provisions gained him some labor support, but in later months relations between the president and labor began to sour.

As time passed, it became clear that Lozano Díaz had ambitions to replace the traditional parties with one that he controlled and could use to help prolong his hold on power. He reduced the Council of State to a consultative body, postponed elections, and set about forming his own party, the National Unity Party (''Partido de Unidad Nacional'', PUN). The activities of other parties were limited, and, in July 1956, Villeda Morales and other PLH leaders were suddenly arrested and flown into exile. A few weeks later, the government crushed an uprising by 400 troops in the capital. Public opinion, however, was becoming increasingly hostile to the president, and rumors of his imminent fall had begun to circulate.

Following the August 1956 uprising, Lozano Díaz's health began to deteriorate, but he clung stubbornly to power. Elections for the legislature in October were boycotted by most of the opposition, who charged that the process was openly rigged to favor the president's supporters. The results seemed to confirm this charge, as the PUN candidates were declared the winners of all fifty-six seats in the congress. The joy of their victories was short, however. On October 21, the armed forces, led by the commanders of the army and air force academies and by Major Roberto Gálvez, the son of the former president, ousted Lozano Díaz and set up a military [[Military dictatorship|junta]] to rule the country.

This coup marked a turning point in Honduran history. For the first time, the armed forces had acted as an institution rather than as the instrument of a political party or of an individual leader. The new rulers represented younger, more nationalistic, and reform-minded elements in the military. They were products of the increased professionalization of the 1940s and 1950s. Most had received some training by United States military advisers, either in Honduras or abroad. For decades to come, the military would act as the final arbiter of Honduran politics.

The military's largest problem was the holding of elections for a legislature and the selection of a new president. A system of [[proportional representation]] was agreed upon, and elections were held in October. The PLH won a majority, and in November, by a vote of thirty-seven to twenty, the assembly selected Villeda Morales as president for a six-year term beginning January 1, 1958.

== Villeda Morales government, 1958–1963 ==

The new PLH administration undertook several major efforts to improve and modernize Honduran life. Funds were obtained from the [[International Monetary Fund]] to stabilize the currency and from the [[World Bank]] to begin paving a highway from the Caribbean coast to the capital. Other efforts were undertaken to expand education. The greatest attention was devoted to passing a new labor code, establishing a social security system, and beginning a program of [[agrarian reform]].

The reform program produced increasing opposition among the more conservative elements in Honduran society. There were scattered uprisings during Villeda Morales's initial years in power, but the military remained loyal and quickly crushed the disturbances. Military support began to evaporate in the early 1960s, however. Waning military support was in part a result of rising criticism of the government by conservative organizations such as the National Federation of Agriculturists and Stockraisers of Honduras (''Federación Nacional de Agricultores y Ganaderos de Honduras'', Fenagh), which represented the large landowners. 

The shift in the military's attitude also reflected concern over what were viewed as more frequent rural disorder and growing radical influences in labor and peasant groups. Deteriorating relations with neighboring states, notably Nicaragua, also contributed to the tension. The major causes of friction, however, were the president's 1957 creation of the [[Law enforcement in Honduras|Civil Guard]] (''Guardia Civil'')—a militarized police commanded directly by the president rather than the chief of the armed forces—and the prospect of another PLH victory in the 1963 elections.

The elections were scheduled for October 1963. As in 1954, the PLH was confronting a divided opposition. The PNH nominated [[Ramón Ernesto Cruz]], but a faction split off and ran the son of ex-president Carías. The PLH ignored the wishes of their president and nominated [[Modesto Rodas Alvarado]], a charismatic, highly partisan figure believed to be to the left of Villeda Morales. All signs pointed to an overwhelming victory for the PLH, an outcome that the military found increasingly unpalatable.

=== 1963 Honduran coup d'état ===
{{further|1963 Honduran coup d'état}}
Rumors of a coup began circulating in late summer of 1963. The United States endeavored to make clear its opposition to such action—even dispatching a high-ranking officer from the [[United States Southern Command]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to try to convince the chief of the armed forces, Air Force Colonel [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], to call off the coup. Villeda Morales also tried to calm military fears, taking the [[carbines]] away from the Civil Guard and opposing plans for a constitutional amendment to restore direct command of the military to the president. All these efforts failed. 

Before dawn on October 3, 1963, the military moved to seize power. The president and the PLH's 1963 presidential candidates were flown into exile, Congress was dissolved, the constitution was suspended, and the planned elections were canceled. Colonel López Arellano proclaimed himself president, and the United States promptly broke diplomatic relations.

López Arellano rapidly moved to consolidate his hold on power. Growing radical influence had been one of the reasons advanced to justify the coup. Once in power the government disbanded or otherwise attacked [[communist]], pro-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]], and other elements on the left. The Agrarian Reform Law was effectively nullified, in part by the regime's refusal to appropriate money for the National Agrarian Institute (''Instituto Nacional Agrario'', INA). 

The country's two peasant unions were harassed, although a new organization of rural workers, the National Union of Peasants (''Unión Nacional de Campesinos'', UNC), which had [[Christian Democratic]] ties, actually expanded in the mid- and late-1960s. López Arellano promised to call elections for yet another legislature, and early in 1964 his government was recognized by the new United States administration of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Shortly thereafter, military assistance, which had been suspended following the coup, was resumed.

Close ties soon developed between the military government and the PNH. A key factor in the development of these links was PNH leader Ricardo Zúñiga Augustinius, who became [[secretary of state]] for the presidency, the key cabinet position. Numerous other party members served in the government, giving it a civil-military character but widening the gap between the administration and the PLH. Also linked to the government was a secret organization used to attack the left and intimidate political opponents. Known as the ''Mancha Brava'' (Tough Spot), it reputedly drew much of its membership from the ranks of public employees.

To give a semblance of legality to his government, López Arellano promulgated a new constitution with a unicameral Congress. He then called elections for this new Congress. A general amnesty for political figures was decreed in November, exiles were allowed to return, and the PLH resumed political activity. The PNH had pledged throughout the campaign that if it gained control of the Congress, its members would select López Arellano as president. The vote was held on February 16, 1965; the PNH won 35 seats, the PLH 29. The PLH charged the government with fraudulently manipulating the results, and some party leaders urged their supporters to boycott meetings of the assembly. The PLH was unable to agree on this tactic, and enough PLH members took their seats when the Congress convened on March 15 to provide the necessary [[quorum]]. The PNH delegates kept their promise and elected López Arellano as president for a new six-year term, from 1965 to 1971.

For a time, López Arellano had success in foreign affairs. One of his government's first acts had been to join with Guatemala and Nicaragua in establishing the [[Central American Defense Council]] (''Consejo de Defensa Centroamericana'', Condeca), which was a military pact among these Central American states and the United States for coordination of [[counterinsurgency]] activities. El Salvador joined shortly thereafter, and in 1965 Condeca held its first joint military exercise on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. That same year, Honduras contributed a small contingent of troops to the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) forces monitoring the election in the Dominican Republic.

As the 1960s progressed, Honduras's relations with Nicaragua and with the United States improved, but increasing problems developed between Honduras and El Salvador. In May and June 1967, a series of incidents along the border aggravated tensions considerably. One incident involved the capture of two Salvadoran officers and thirty-nine enlisted men whose truck convoy had penetrated several kilometers into Honduras. The Salvadoran troops were finally returned over a year later, but the tensions continued to mount.

===War with El Salvador (1969)===
{{See|Football War}}

By 1968, the López Arellano regime seemed to be in serious trouble. The economic situation was producing growing labor conflicts, political unrest, and even criticism from conservative groups such as Fenagh. Municipal elections were held in March 1968 to the accompaniment of violence and charges of open fraud, producing PNH victories but also fueling public discontent and raising the concern of the United States Embassy. Efforts at opening up a dialogue were made in mid-1968 but had little success. Later in the year a general strike was kept brief by government action that helped break the strike and exiled the leader of the major Caribbean coast labor federation. Unrest continued, however; in the spring of 1969 new strikes broke out among teachers and other groups.

As the political situation deteriorated, the Honduran government and some private groups came increasingly to place blame for the nation's economic problems on the approximately 300,000 undocumented Salvadoran immigrants in Honduras. Fenagh began to associate Salvadoran immigrants with illegal land invasions, and in January 1969, the Honduran government refused to renew the 1967 Bilateral Treaty on Immigration with El Salvador that had been designed to regulate the flow of individuals across their common border. In April INA announced that it would begin to expel from their lands those who had acquired property under agrarian reform without fulfilling the legal requirement that they be Honduran by birth. Attacks were also launched in the media on the impact of Salvadoran immigrant labor on unemployment and wages on the Caribbean coast. By late May, Salvadorans began to stream out of Honduras back to an overpopulated El Salvador.

Tensions continued to mount during June 1969. The soccer teams of the two nations were engaged that month in a three-game elimination match as a preliminary to the World Cup. Disturbances broke out during the first game in Tegucigalpa, but the situation got considerably worse during the second match in [[San Salvador]]. Honduran fans were roughed up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. Actions against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several [[vice consul]]s, became increasingly violent. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, and tens of thousands began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near- hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador.

The '''Mancha Brava''', during the war with El Salvador had other purposes besides intimidating political party's. With the  membership of Honduran civilians it was used against Salvadorian residents and temporary workers to exterminate any Salvadorian presence. Methods used against the Salvadorians was being hanged, castrated, removal of females breast and genital and burned alived during the early days of the war.

Early on the morning of July 14, 1969, concerted military action began in what came to be known as the [[Soccer War]]. The Salvadoran air force attacked targets inside Honduras and the Salvadoran army launched major offensives along the main road connecting the two nations and against the Honduran islands in the Golfo de Fonseca. At first, the Salvadorans made fairly rapid progress. By the evening of July 15, the Salvadoran army, which was considerably larger and better equipped than its Honduran opponent, pushed the Honduran army back over eight kilometers and captured the departmental capital of [[Nueva Ocotepeque]]. Thereafter, the attack bogged down, and the Salvadorans began to experience fuel and ammunition shortages. A major reason for the fuel shortage was the action of the Honduran air force, which—in addition to largely destroying the smaller Salvadoran air force—had severely damaged El Salvador's oil storage facilities.

The day after the fighting had begun, the OAS met in an urgent session and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A [[cease-fire]] was arranged on the night of July 18; it took full effect only on July 20. El Salvador continued until July 29 to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS [[economic sanctions]] against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would take more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.

The war produced only losses for both sides. Between 60,000 and 130,000 Salvadorans had been forcibly expelled or had fled from Honduras, producing serious economic disruption in some areas. Trade between the two nations had been totally disrupted and the border closed, damaging the economies of both nations and threatening the future of the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM). Up to 2,000 people, the majority Honduran civilians, had been killed, and thousands of other Hondurans in the border area had been made homeless. Airline service between the two nations was also disrupted for over a decade.

=== Post-war (1969-1972) ===
After the war, public support for the military plummeted. Although the air force had performed well the army had not. Criticism of the army was not limited to the public; junior officers were often vocal in their criticism of superiors, and a rift developed between junior and senior officers.

The war, however, led to a new sense of Honduran nationalism and national pride. Tens of thousands of Honduran workers and peasants had gone to the government to beg for arms to defend their nation. Local defense committees had sprung up, with thousands of ordinary citizens, often armed only with [[machetes]], taking over local security duties. This response to the fighting made a strong impression on a sector of the officer corps and contributed to an increased concern over national development and social welfare among the armed forces.

The main key figure in the Salvadorian military victory was General Jose Alberto "Chele" Medrano. In charged and being main head of the National Guard (GN) he was the first to lead the wave of guards into Honduras. In order to infiltrate the Honduran government and reach the Honduran president Osvaldo Lopex Arellano, General Jose Alberto "Chele" Medrano disguised himself as a priest in order to have the Honduran president Confess with him. Disguised as a member of the Catholic Church with orders to go to the president himself he was able to gather information straight from the president himself, as the president confessed his intentions, struggles and fears to General Medrano. Once the information was gathered he returned to El Salvador with first hand information about the conflict, with those plans he was able to move quickly and where to move. Eventually He was the hero to the Salvadorian Military community and Salvadorian people.

The internal political struggle had been briefly suspended during the conflict with El Salvador, but by the start of 1970 it was again in full swing. The government was under pressure to initiate administrative and electoral reforms, allow open elections in 1971, reorganize the military, and adopt new economic programs, including a revision of Honduran relations with the CACM. Labor, peasant, and business organizations were meeting together in what were known as the ''fuerzas vivas'' (living forces). Their representatives met with López Arellano and proposed a Plan of National Unity, calling for free elections, a coalition cabinet, and a division of government posts and congressional seats. These proposals failed to elicit immediate response, but discussions continued. Meanwhile, a general political amnesty was decreed, the creation of the [[Honduran Christian Democratic Party]] (''Partido Demócrata Cristiano de Honduras'', PDCH) was announced, and a decree was issued calling for presidential and congressional elections on March 28, 1971.

After considerable discussion and debate the PHL and PNH parties responded to pressures from labor, business and the military. On January 7, 1971, they signed a political pact agreeing to establish a national-unity government after the March elections. The purposes of the pact were twofold. The first was to present a single slate of congressional candidates that would divide the Congress equally between the PLH and PNH (each party would run its own candidate for the presidency). 

The second goal was to promote the Minimum Government Plan (''Plan Mínimo de Gobierno''), which included achieving agrarian reform, increasing technical education, passing a civil service law, attempting to resolve the conflict with El Salvador, restructuring the CACM, and reforming government administration. A later agreement between the parties—the "little pact" (''pactito'')—agreed to a division of government posts, including those in the Supreme Court of Justice.

The 1971 elections were relatively free and honest. Both parties offered presidential candidates who were compromise choices of the major party factions. The PLH ran Jorge Bueso Arias, and the PNH nominated [[Ramón Ernesto Cruz]]. Most observers anticipated a PLH victory, but the PNH ran a more aggressive campaign, making use of the mass media and of modern campaign techniques for the first time in Honduran history. On election day, Cruz scored an impressive victory, gaining 299,807 votes to 269,989 for Bueso Arias. However, a disturbing note for the PNH was that popular participation in the election had declined significantly from 1965. Only slightly over two-thirds of those registered to vote had done so, although the constitution made voting obligatory.

At first, Cruz appeared to be living up to the terms of the agreements between the parties. He appointed five PLH members, five PNH members, and one military officer to his cabinet. López Arellano remained as chief of the armed forces. As time passed, however, the split between PLH and PNH widened steadily. In order to deal with the budget crisis, Cruz pushed through a reluctant Congress a bill that cut tax benefits and import exemptions. This bill produced opposition from both business and labor sectors. In the area of agrarian reform, the president soon removed INA's dynamic director, Roberto Sandoval, and replaced him with a PNH member, Horacio Moya Posas, who slowed the pace of reform. The PLH protested this action and also argued that the appointment of PNH supporters to the Supreme Court of Justice violated the agreement. Finally, in March 1972, the president dismissed two of the PLH cabinet members. By mid-1972, the government had lost most of its non-PNH support.

===Military rule and reform (1972-1978)===
During the autumn of 1972, with the support of the military, the two parties attempted to revise the arrangements between the parties and the major labor and business groups. These efforts were not unsuccessful, and opposition to what was increasingly perceived as an ineffectual and divisive administration spread steadily. The virtual halting of agrarian reform and the killing of several peasants by the military in the department of [[Olancho]] had angered peasant groups. Labor and business were alienated by the ineffective efforts to deal with the problems of the economy. 

The PLH felt that its position within the government was steadily eroding and that its agreement with the PNH was regularly violated. In December peasant and labor organizations announced a hunger march by 20,000 individuals to Tegucigalpa to protest the government's agrarian policies. Supported by a prior agreement with the labor movement, the military on December 4, 1972, overthrew Cruz in a bloodless coup and once again installed López Arellano as the president.

Problems for the López Arellano regime began to increase in 1974. The economy was still growing at a slow pace, partly because of the immense damage caused to the Caribbean coast by [[Hurricane Fifi]] in September 1974. The storm was the most devastating natural disaster in recent Honduran history, claiming 10,000 or more lives and destroying a vast number of banana plants. The disaster also increased calls for agrarian reform.

The government's greatest problem, however, centered on another aspect of the banana industry. Honduras had joined other banana-exporting nations in a joint agreement to levy an export tax on that fruit. The Honduran tax had taken effect in April 1974 but was suddenly canceled four months later. Shortly thereafter, reports began to circulate that the United Fruit Company had paid more than US$1 million to Honduran officials to secure the repeal of the tax. Prominently implicated in these accusations were López Arellano and his minister of economy and commerce.

Reacting to these charges on March 31, 1975, the military relieved López Arellano of his position as chief of the armed forces, replacing him with Colonel [[Juan Alberto Melgar Castro]]. Just over three weeks later, they completed the process by removing López Arellano from the presidency and replacing him with Melgar Castro. These decisions had been made by the increasingly powerful Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (''Consejo Superior de las Fuerzas Armadas'', Consuffaa), a group of approximately twenty to twenty-five key colonels of the armed forces who provided the institution with a form of collective leadership.

In July 1976, the border with El Salvador was still disputed. In July, a minor upsurge of conflict there brought prompt OAS intervention, which helped to keep the conflict from escalating. In October, both nations agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration. This development raised hopes for a rapid peace settlement. Progress, however, proved slow; and tensions were raised again, briefly, in 1978, when the Honduran government abruptly canceled all permits for travel to El Salvador. The rise of [[guerrilla conflict]] in El Salvador, plus strong pressures from other nations, made a settlement increasingly urgent in subsequent months. In October 1980, with [[Peru]]vian mediation, the bilateral General Peace Treaty was finally signed in [[Lima]], Peru. Trade and travel were soon resumed, but numerous problems, including final adjudication of some small parcels of territory along the frontier, remained for later consideration.

Relations with Nicaragua had also become more difficult, especially after civil conflict had increased in that nation in the late 1970s. In March 1978, Honduran soldiers captured Germán Pomares, a leader of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (''Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional'', FSLN), the guerrilla force fighting against the regime of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] in Nicaragua. Pomares was held until the end of June, but Nicaraguan requests for [[extradition]] were denied, and he was ultimately flown to [[Panama]]. As fighting in Nicaragua escalated in 1978 and early 1979, Honduras found itself in a difficult position. Honduras did not want to support the unpopular Somoza regime but feared the [[Marxist]] leanings of the FSLN. In addition, beginning in September 1978, Honduras had become burdened with an ever-growing number of refugees from Nicaragua.

==Return to civilian rule, 1978–82==
Melgar Castro's hold on power began to dissolve in 1978. Charges of government corruption and of military links with [[narcotics]] traffic had become increasingly widespread, leading to accusations that the government had failed to adequately defend the country. Melgar's hold on power had weakened because he lacked support among large landowners. In addition, the Melgar government had seemed to be making little progress toward promised elections, leading to suspicions that it hoped to prolong its time in office. 

Right-wing political forces criticized the Melgar administration's handling of the Ferrari Case, which involved drug trafficking and murder of civilians and in which members of the military had been implicated. Unions and student organizations correctly interpreted the right wing's criticism as a prelude to a coup. When demonstrators took to the streets to support Melgar, right-wing elements within the military charged Melgar had lost control of public order and ousted him. 

On August 7, 1978, Melgar Castro and his cabinet were replaced by a three-member junta. Led by General [[Policarpo Paz García]], chief of the armed forces, and including the air force commander and the chief of military security, the junta had close ties to the large landowners and moved to protect the military men involved in the Ferrari Case.

From its inception, the government of Paz García had promised to return Honduras to civilian rule. In April 1980, the Honduran citizenry was summoned to the polls to choose delegates for a new Congress. The Congress would select an interim government and would establish procedures for presidential and congressional elections in 1981.

Early indications for the 1980 elections pointed toward a victory for the PNH, headed by Ricardo Zúñiga. The PNH appeared more unified and organized than the rival PLH, and most people assumed that the PNH would be favored by the ruling military. The PLH suffered from internal divisions and a lack of leadership. Former president Villeda Morales had died in 1971, and the party's leader after his death, Modesto Rodas Alvarado, had died in 1979. 

A split had developed between the more conservative followers of Rodas and the party's left wing, which had formed the Popular Liberal Alliance (''Alianza Liberal del Pueblo'', Alipo). In addition, a third party, the [[Innovation and Unity Party]] (''Partido de Inovación y Unidad'', Pinu) had been registered and was expected to draw support away from the PLH. The PNH had succeeded in blocking the inscription of the PDCH, leading the PDCH adherents to join with groups further to the left in denouncing the elections as a farce and a fraud and urging popular abstention.

The April 1980 election produced a record registration and voter turnout. More than 1.2 million Hondurans registered, and over 1 million voted—over 81 percent of those eligible. The high number of voters evidently favored the PLH, which won 49.4 percent of the votes cast. Under a complex [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] system, the PLH won thirty-five seats in the Congress; the PNH, thirty-three; and Pinu, three. This result produced considerable debate over the composition of the next government. 

There was general agreement on naming Paz García as interim president, and the disputes centered on the composition of the cabinet. Ultimately, a PLH leader, [[Roberto Suazo Córdova]], was made president of the Congress, while the PLH also gained five of the seats on the new Supreme Court of Justice. The cabinet was divided among all three parties and the military; the armed forces received the Ministry of National Defense and Public Security, as well as the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and the PNH acquired key economic positions.

The Congress took more than a year to draft a new constitution and an electoral law for the 1981 presidential and congressional elections. The work went slowly, and the elections originally scheduled for August 1981 had to be postponed until November. In the interim, the National Elections Tribunal (''Tribunal Nacional de Elecciones'', TNE) unanimously granted the PDCH the legal status needed for a place on the 1981 ballot.

Despite the presence of candidates for the Pinu and the PDCH on the November 1981 ballot, it was clear that the election would be essentially a two-party affair between the PLH and PNH. On November 29, 1981, a total of 1,214,735 Hondurans, 80.7 percent of those registered, voted, giving the PLH a sweeping victory. Suazo Córdova won 636,392 votes (52.4 percent), the PNH 491,089 votes, and 48,582 votes were divided between the Pinu and the PDCH. The PLH also took control of Congress, winning forty-four seats; the PNH, thirty-four; the Pinu, three; and the PDCH, one. The PLH also won 61 percent of the municipal councils. Suazo Córdova was inaugurated as president of Honduras in January 1982, ending nearly a decade of military presidents.

'''Judah Halevi''' (also '''Yehuda Halevi''' or '''ha-Levi'''; {{lang-he-n|יהודה הלוי}} and Judah ben Shmuel Halevi {{Hebrew|יהודה בן שמואל הלוי}}; {{lang-ar|يهوذا اللاوي}}; {{c.}} 1075 – 1141) was a [[Sephardic|Spanish Jewish]] physician, poet and [[philosopher]]. He was born in Spain, either in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] or [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]],&lt;ref&gt;"The question of Judah Halevi's birthplace is still unsolved. Schirmann (Tarbiz, 10 (1939),237-9) argued in favor of Tudela, rather than Toledo..." [Encyclopedaedia Judaica, pages 355–356]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1075&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica,&lt;/ref&gt; or 1086, and died shortly after arriving in [[the Holy Land]] in 1141, at that point the [[Crusader states|Crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Halevi is considered one of the greatest Hebrew poets, celebrated both for his religious and secular poems, many of which appear in present-day liturgy. His greatest philosophical work was ''[[Kuzari|The Kuzari]]''.

== Biography ==
Convention suggests that Judah ben Shmuel Halevi was born in Toledo, Spain in 1075.&lt;ref&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |no-prescript=1 |title=Judah Ha-Levi |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9005-judah-ha-levi#2221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He often referred to himself as coming from Christian territory. [[Alfonso the Battler]] conquered Tudela in 1119; Toledo was conquered by [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] from the Muslims in Halevi's childhood (1086).  As a youth, he seems to have gone to [[Granada]], the main centre of Jewish literary and intellectual life at the time, where he found a mentor in [[Moses Ibn Ezra]].  Although it is often said that he studied in the academy at [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]], there is no evidence to this effect. He did compose a short elegy on the death of [[Isaac Alfasi]], the head of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, "Diwan des Abul-Ḥasan Jehuda ha-Levi," ii., No. 14, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; His aptitude as a poet was recognized early. He was educated in traditional Jewish scholarship, in Arabic literature, and in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sciences and philosophy that were available in [[Arabic]]. As an adult he was a physician, apparently of renown, and an active participant in Jewish communal affairs. For at least part of his life he lived in Toledo and may have been connected with the court there as a physician. In Toledo he complains of being too busy with medicine to devote himself to scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, l.c. i. 224, 225&lt;/ref&gt; At other times he lived in various Muslim cities in the south.

Like most Jewish intellectuals of Muslim Spain, Halevi wrote prose in Arabic and poetry in Hebrew. During the "[[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Hebrew Golden Age]]" of the 10th to 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory B. Kaplan, Review of: ''The Compunctious Poet: Cultural Ambiguity and Hebrew Poetry in Muslim Spain'', Ross Brann, Johns Hopkins UP, 1991.  ''[[Hispanic Review]]'', Vol. 61, No. 3 (Summer, 1993), pp. 405–407. {{JSTOR|475075}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he was the most prolific of the Hebrew poets and was regarded by some of his contemporaries, as well as by modern critics, as the greatest of all the medieval Hebrew poets. Like all the Hebrew poets of the Hebrew Golden Age, he employed the formal patterns of Arabic poetry, both the classical monorhymed patterns and the recently invented strophic patterns. His themes embrace all those that were current among Hebrew poets: panegyric odes, funeral odes, poems on the pleasures of life, gnomic epigrams, and riddles. He was also a prolific author of religious verse. As with all the Hebrew poets of his age, he strives for a strictly biblical diction, though he unavoidably falls into occasional [[Calque|calques]] from Arabic. His verse is distinguished by special attention to acoustic effect and wit.

Nothing is known of Halevi's personal life except the report in his poems that he had a daughter and that she had a son, also named Judah. He could well have had other children. The tradition that this daughter was married to Abraham Ibn Ezra does not rest on any evidence, though Halevi and Abraham Ibn Ezra were well acquainted, as we know from the writings of the latter.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |no-prescript=1 |title=Judah Ha-Levi |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9005-judah-ha-levi#2223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journey to Israel ==

Halevi's various residences in Spain are not known; he seems to have lived at times in Christian Toledo, at other times in Islamic Spain ([[al-Andalus]]). Although he occupied an honored position as a physician, intellectual, and communal leader, his religious convictions compelled him to abandon his homeland in order to end his days in [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. His motivations were complex. His personal piety intensified as he aged, leading him to desire to devote himself entirely to religious life. The uncertainties of Jewish communal status in the period of the [[Reconquista]] led him to doubt the future security of the Jewish position in the diaspora. The failure of messianic movements weighed on him. His earlier commitment to philosophy as a guide to truth gave way to a renewed commitment to faith in revelation. He came to the conviction, elaborated in his treatise known as the ''[[Kuzari]]'', that true religious fulfillment is possible only in the presence of the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]], which, he believed, was most palpable in the Land of Israel. Contrary to a prevalent theory, his poetry shows beyond doubt that his pilgrimage was a completely individual act and that he had no intention of setting off a mass pilgrimage.

Halevi sailed for Alexandria. Arriving on September 8, 1140, he was greeted enthusiastically by friends and admirers. He then went to Cairo, where he visited several dignitaries, including the Nagid of Egypt, Samuel ben Hanania, and his friend Halfon ben Nathaniel Halevi. He did not permit himself to be persuaded to remain in Egypt, but returned to Alexandria and sailed for Israel on May 14, 1141. Little is known of his travels after. He died during the summer, presumably after having reached Palestine. Legend, however, has it that Halevi was killed after being run over by an Arab horseman as he arrived in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

Halevi dealt with his pilgrimage extensively in the poetry written during his last year, which includes
[[panegyric]] to his various hosts in Egypt, explorations of his religious motivations, description of storms at sea, and expressions of his anxieties and doubts. We are well informed about the details of his pilgrimage thanks to letters that were preserved in the [[Cairo geniza]]. Poems and letters bearing on Halevi's pilgrimage are translated and explicated in Raymond P. Scheindlin, ''The Song of the Distant Dove'' (Oxford University Press, 2007).

The life-work of Judah Halevi was devoted to poetry and philosophy. The scholar Jose de la Fuente Salvat elevates him as the "most important poet in judaism of all times".&lt;ref&gt;De la Fuente Salvat, Jose. "Yehudá Ha-Leví: el poeta judío más grande de todos los tiempos"&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts give some grounds for believing that Halevi himself divided his ouvre into sacred (''shirē haq-qodesh'') and profane (''shirē ha-hol'') poetry. The poetry can be divided as follows (following the 1895-1904 edition by Hayyim Brody):
# Poems about friendship and laudatory poems (''shirē yedidut we-shirē hak-kabod''): 138 poems.
# Pieces of correspondence in rhymed prose (''miktabim''): 7 pieces.
# Love poems (''shirē ahabah''): 66 poems.
# Elegies (''qol bokim; qinot we-hespēdim''): 43 pieces.
# Elevation of the soul to Zion; travelling poems (''massa‘ nefesh Ṣiyyonah''; ''shirē Ṣiyyon we-shirē massa‘''): 23 poems.
# Riddle poems (''ḥidot''): 49 poems.
# Other poems, various poems (''she’ērit Yehudah''; ''shirim shonim''): 120 poems.&lt;ref&gt;Arie Schippers, ''Spanish Hebrew Poetry and the Arabic Literary Tradition: Arabic Themes in Hebrew Andalusian Poetry'', Medieval Iberian Peninsula Texts and Studies, 7 (Leiden: Brill, 1994), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secular poetry ===

Judah's secular or non-liturgical poetry is occupied by poems of friendship and eulogy. Judah must have possessed an attractive personality; for there gathered about him as friends, even in his earliest youth, a large number of illustrious men, like Levi al-Tabban of [[Zaragoza]], the aged poet Judah ben Abun, Judah ibn Ghayyat of Granada, [[Moses ibn Ezra]] and his brothers Judah, Joseph, and Isaac, the vizier Abu al-Hasan, Meïr ibn Kamnial, the physician and poet Solomon ben Mu'allam of Seville, besides his schoolmates [[Joseph ibn Migas]] and Baruch Albalia. Also the grammarian [[Abraham ibn Ezra]].

In [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], Judah addressed a touching farewell poem to Joseph ibn Ẓaddiḳ, the philosopher and poet. In Egypt, where the most celebrated men vied with one another in entertaining him, his reception was a veritable triumph. Here his particular friends were Aaron ben Jeshua Alamani in Alexandria, the nagid Samuel ben Hananiah in [[Cairo]],&lt;ref&gt;"Monatsschrift," xl. 417 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Halfon ha-Levi in Damietta, and an unknown man in Tyre, probably his last friend. In their sorrow and joy, in the creative spirit and all that moved the souls of these men, Judah sympathetically shared; as he says in the beginning of a short poem: "My heart belongs to you, ye noble souls, who draw me to you with bonds of love".&lt;ref&gt;Brody, l.c. i., No. 45)&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially tender and plaintive is Judah's tone in his elegies&lt;ref&gt;Brody, l.c. ii. 67 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are dedicated to friends such as the brothers Judah (Nos. 19, 20), Isaac (No. 21), and Moses ibn Ezra (No. 16), R. Baruch (Nos. 23, 28), Meïr ibn Migas (No. 27), his teacher [[Isaac Alfasi]] (No. 14), and others.  In the case of Solomon ibn Farissol, who was murdered on May 3, 1108, Judah suddenly changed his poem of eulogy (Nos. 11, 22) into one of lamentation (Nos. 12, 13, 93 et seq.).  Child mortality due to plague was high in Judah's time and the historical record contains five elegies written for the occasion of the death of a child.  Biographer Hillel Halkin hypothesizes that at least one of these poems may have been written in honor of one of Judah's own children that did not reach adulthood and who is lost to history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hillel Halkin|Halkin, Hillel]].  ''Yehuda Halevi''.  New York: Nextbook, 2010.  p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Love songs ====

Joyous, careless youth, and merry, happy delight in life find their expression in his love-songs.  Many of these are [[Epithalamium|epithalamia]] and are characterized by a brilliant near-eastern coloring, as well as by a chaste reserve. In Egypt, where the muse of his youth found a glorious "Indian summer" in the circle of his friends, he wrote his "swan-song:"&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, l.c. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; "Wondrous is this land to see, With perfume its meadows laden, But more fair than all to me Is yon slender, gentle maiden. Ah, Time's swift flight I fain would stay, Forgetting that my locks are gray."

[[Drinking song]]s by Judah have also been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hillel Halkin|Halkin, Hillel]].  ''Yehuda Halevi''.  New York: Nextbook, 2010. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Riddles ====

Judah is noted for composing riddles, which often have religious themes underlying their challenges to the wit; his diwan contains forty-nine of them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dream of the Poem: Hebrew Poetry from Muslim and Christian Spain, 950–1492'', ed. and trans.  by Peter Cole (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
: What is it that's blind with an eye in its head,
:: But the race of mankind its use can not spare;
: Spends all its life in clothing the dead,
:: But always itself is naked and bare?&lt;ref&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |no-prescript=1 |first=Joseph |last=Jacobs |title=Riddle }}. The answer is 'a needle'.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religious poetry ===

After living a life devoted to worldly pleasures, Halevi was to experience a kind of "awakening"; a shock, that changed his outlook on the world. Like a type of "conversion" experience, he turned from the life of pleasure, and his poetry turned to religious themes.

It seems that his profound experience was the consequence of his sensitivity to the events of history that were unfolding around him. He lived during the [[First Crusade]] and other wars. There was a new kind of religio-political fanaticism emerging in the [[Christian]] and Muslim worlds. [[religious war|Holy war]]s were brewing, and Halevi may have recognized that such trends had never been good for the Jews. At the time, life was relatively good in Spain for the Jewish community. He may have suspected things were about to change for the worse, however.

His attachment to the Jewish people is an equally significant theme: he identifies his sufferings and hopes with that of the broader group. Like the authors of the [[Psalm]]s, he gladly sinks his own identity in the wider one of the people of Israel; so that it is not always easy to distinguish the personality of the speaker.

Often Judah's poetic fancy finds joy in the thought of the "return" of his people to the Promised Land. He believed that perfect Jewish life was possible only in the [[Land of Israel]]. The period of political agitation about 1130, when the conflict between [[Islam]] and Christianity intensified, giving Judah reason to hope for such a return in the near future. The vision of the night, in which this was revealed to him,&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, l.c. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; remained indeed but a dream; yet Judah never lost faith in the eventual deliverance of Israel, and in "the eternity" of his people. On this subject, he has expressed himself in poetry:
:Lo! Sun and moon, these minister for aye; The laws of day and night cease nevermore: Given for signs to Jacob's seed that they Shall ever be a nation — till these be o'er. If with His left hand He should thrust away, Lo! with His right hand He shall draw them nigh.&lt;ref&gt;Luzzatto, l.c. No. 61; transl. by Nina Davis in "Songs of Exile," p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[piyyut]], ''Mi Kamoka'', was translated by [[Samuel di Castelnuovo]] and published in Venice in 1609.

==== Liturgical poetry ====
The longest, and most comprehensive poem is a "Kedushah," which summons all the universe to praise God with rejoicing, and which terminates, curiously enough, in Psalm 103. These poems were carried to all lands, even as far as [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;Zunz, "Ritus," p.&amp;nbsp;57&lt;/ref&gt;, and they influenced the rituals of the most distant countries. Even the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] incorporated some of them into their prayer-book; so that there is scarcely a synagogue in which Judah's songs are not sung in the course of the service.&lt;ref name=Zunz231&gt;Zunz, "S. P." p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The following observation on Judah's synagogal poems is made by Zunz:
:As the perfume and beauty of a rose are within it, and do not come from without, so with Judah word and Bible passage, meter and rime, are one with the soul of the poem; as in true works of [[art]], and always in nature, one is never disturbed by anything external, arbitrary, or extraneous.&lt;ref name=Zunz231 /&gt;

Judah also wrote several [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] hymns. One of the most beautiful of them ends with the words:
:On Friday doth my cup o'erflow / What blissful rest the night shall know / When, in thine arms, my toil and woe / Are all forgot, Sabbath my love!
:'Tis dusk, with sudden light, distilled / From one sweet face, the world is filled; / The tumult of my heart is stilled / For thou art come, Sabbath my love!
:Bring fruits and wine and sing a gladsome lay, / Cry, 'Come in peace, O restful Seventh day!'

Judah used complicated [[Arabic language|Arabic]] meters in his poems, with much good taste.&lt;ref&gt;For further details see Brody, H. ''Studien zu den Dichtungen Jehuda ha-Levi's'', Berlin, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; A later critic, applying a [[Talmud]]ic [[witticism]] to Judah, has said: "It is hard for the dough when the baker himself calls it bad." Although these forms came to him naturally and without effort, unlike the mechanical versifiers of his time,&lt;ref&gt;see "Cuzari," v. 16)&lt;/ref&gt; he would not except himself from the number of those he had blamed. His pupil Solomon Parḥon, who wrote at [[Salerno]] in 1160, relates that Judah repented having used the new metrical methods, and had declared he would not again employ them. That Judah felt them to be out of place, and that he opposed their use at the very time when they were in vogue, plainly shows his desire for a national Jewish art; independent in form, as well as in matter.

Judah was recognized by his contemporaries as "the great Jewish [[national poet]]",{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in succeeding generations, by all the great scholars and writers in Israel. His poetry and writing have also been considered an early expression of support for Jewish nationalism. &lt;ref&gt;http://thegreatthinkers.org/halevi/introduction/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis of his poetry ===

The remarkable, and apparently indissoluble, union of [[religion]], [[nationalism]], and [[patriotism]], which were so characteristic of post-exilic Judaism, reached its acme in Judah Halevi and his poetry. Yet this very union, in one so consistent as Judah, demanded the fulfillment of the supreme politico-religious ideal of medieval Judaism—the "return to Jerusalem". Though his impassioned call to his contemporaries to return to "[[Zion]]" might be received with indifference, or even with mockery;&lt;ref&gt;Luzzatto, l.c. No. 86&lt;/ref&gt; his own decision to go to Jerusalem never wavered. "Can we hope for any other refuge either in the East or in the West where we may dwell in safety?" he exclaims to one of his opponents (ib.). The songs that accompany his pilgrimage&lt;ref&gt;Brody, l.c. ii. 153&lt;/ref&gt; sound like one great symphony, wherein the "[[Zionides]]" — the single motive never varied — voice the deepest "soul-life" alike; of the Jewish people and of each individual Jew.

The most celebrated of these "Zionides" is commonly in the synagogue on [[Tisha B'Av]]:&lt;ref&gt;Brody, l.c. ii. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
:Zion, wilt thou not ask if peace's wing / Shadows the captives that ensue thy peace / Left lonely from thine ancient shepherding?
:Lo! west and east and north and south — world-wide / All those from far and near, without surcease / Salute thee: Peace and Peace from every side."

=== As a philosopher ===

Judah Halevi's vision of a God that is accessed through tradition and devotion, and not philosophical speculation, dominates his later work. His position in domain of Jewish philosophy is parallel to that occupied in Islam by [[Ghazali]], by whom he was influenced, yet Judah Halevi strongly despised Islam. Like Ghazali, Judah endeavored to liberate religion from the bondage of the various philosophical systems in which it had been held by his predecessors, [[Saadia Gaon|Saadia]], [[David ben Marwan al-Mekamez]], [[Gabirol]], and [[Bahya]]. In a work written in Arabic, and entitled ''Kitab al-Ḥujjah wal-Dalil fi Nuṣr al-Din al-Dhalil'', كتاب الحجة و الدليل في نصرة الدين الذليل, (known in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of [[Judah ibn Tibbon]] by the title ''Sefer ha-[[Kuzari]]''), Judah Halevi expounded his views upon the teachings of Judaism, which he defended against the attacks of non-Jewish philosophers, Aristotelean Greek philosophers and against those he viewed as "[[heresy|heretics]]".

'''Karl Alberti''' (15 December 1856, [[Aš|Asch]], [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]] (now [[Czech Republic]]) – 7 November 1953, [[Bayreuth]], Germany) was a [[Bohemian German]] teacher and local historian.

Alberti was the eldest son of 14 children of Asch's Evangelical superintendent Traugott Alberti. The pastor's family came in 1820 from the Saxon [[Vogtland]] to Asch. He attended the College of Education in the [[Bielitz-Biala]], on completion of which he contributed to the related training school before he went to the training school in [[Troppau]]. In [[Vienna]] he was employed as a national and then as a teacher at the local {{ill|Bürgerschule|de}}. Already at that time he worked as a writer, especially for the Bayreuther Blätter. In 1893, Alberti was the director of the first girls' elementary and grammar school in Asch. From 1921 onwards, he led the city chronicle of Asch. As a local historian, he presented over 80 works on the history of Asch, which dealt, among other things, with the stone crosses the area, the presence of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] in the region, and the history of the land around Asch, including [[Neuberg (castle)|Neuberg Castle]].

These are '''lists of countries in the nineteenth century by their estimated [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] [[gross domestic product]] (GDP)''' in terms of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), the value of all final goods and services produced within a country/region in a given year. GDP dollar ([[international dollar]]) estimates here are derived from PPP estimates.

== Methodology ==
Due to the absence of sufficient data for nearly all economies until the 20th century, earlier GDP is only roughly estimated. In a first step, economic historians try to reconstruct the [[GDP per capita]] of a given political or geographical entity from the meagre evidence. This value is then multiplied by the estimated [[population]] size, another determinant for which as a rule only little ancient data is available.

A key notion in the whole process is that of [[subsistence]], the [[income]] level which is necessary for sustaining one's life. Since [[pre-modern societies]], by modern standards, were characterized by a very low degree of [[urbanization]] and a large majority of people working in the [[agricultural sector]], economic historians prefer to express income in [[cereal]] units. To achieve comparability over space and time, these numbers are then converted into monetary units such as [[International Dollar]]s, a third step which leaves a relatively wide margin of interpretation.

The formula is: GDP (PPP) = GDP per capita (PPP) × population size

It should be stressed that, historically speaking, population size is a far more important multiplier in the equation. This is because, in contrast to [[Industrial age|industrial economies]], the average income ceiling of premodern [[agrarian societies]] was quite low everywhere, possibly not higher than twice the subsistence level.&lt;ref&gt;Milanovic 2006, p. 460, 468: {{quote|In conclusion, the fact that the average incomes in the most developed agricultural economies like [[Augustus|Augustan]] [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Basil II|Basil]]'s [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] were about twice or less than the subsistence minimum might indicate that the [[pre-industrial societies]] were unlikely to ever exceed that ceiling. This in turn has implications for our assessment of the average standard of living in other, non-Western, pre-industrial economies like those of China, India, [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]], and [[Africa]]....A further implication of these calculations is that a realistic maximum income that could be envisaged for the pre-industrial societies might be a bit more than twice the subsistence minimum, or around $PPP 1000 (at 1990 international prices).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the total GDP as given below primarily reflects the respective historical population size, and is much less indicative of contemporary [[living standard]]s than, for example, [[List of regions by past GDP (PPP) per capita|estimations of past GDP per capita]].

According to 20th-century macroeconomist [[Paul Bairoch]], a pioneer in historical economic analysis, 
{{quote|it is obvious that by itself the volume of total [[GNP]] has no important significance, and that the volume of GNP is not by itself the expression of the economic strength of a nation.}}

Rather, Bairoch advocates a formula combining GNP per capita and total GNP to provide a better measure of the economic performance of national economies.&lt;ref&gt;Bairoch 1976, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

The total GDPs of the [[British Empire]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] were difficulty to calculate due to lack of information from some localities in Maddison's work. There is no information to speculate the GDP of many colonies and national subdivisions. In the case of Austria-Hungary, the data given is about the modern territory of the [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]], while the majority of the population and economy lied out today's borders. There were data about future countries that were once part of the Empire. Using that, the Czechoslovakia's GDP was split in the rate of 2:1 to Austria and Hungary respectively because of the location of each part in the former empire and the population rate between Czech and Slovakian territories of 2:1. Data about the GDP of the territory of the future Yugoslavian kingdom in 1890s existed, so the proportion of the population among Croatia-Slavonia, Serbia and the other constituents of the future kingdom where used deduce the GDP of each place. Information about Galician GDP was deduced using the proportion of the people it had in what would become Poland. Information about other parts were missing, so the GDP of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was actually bigger than shown, as well as the British Empire.

This is a list of [[cultural heritage|cultural-heritage]] sites that have been damaged or destroyed accidentally, deliberately, or by a [[natural disaster]], sorted by country.

Cultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types—tangible and [[intangible heritage]]. The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites, as well as movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is meant by "cultural heritage"?|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|website=[[UNESCO]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316203151/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|archivedate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stenning|first1=Stephen|title=Destroying cultural heritage: more than just material damage|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/destroying-cultural-heritage-more-just-material-damage|website=[[British Council]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145358/http://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/destroying-cultural-heritage-more-just-material-damage|archivedate=24 September 2015|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectable heritage is dealt with in [[art destruction]], whilst the destruction of movable [[industrial heritage]] remains almost totally ignored.

Deliberate and systematic destruction of cultural heritage, such as [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|that carried out by ISIL]], is regarded as a form of [[cultural genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Lizzie|title=Destruction of Middle East's heritage is 'cultural genocide'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middle-east/articles/Destruction-of-Middle-Easts-heritage-is-cultural-genocide/|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sehmer|first1=Alexander|title=Isis guilty of 'cultural cleansing' across Syria and Iraq, Unesco chief Irina Bokova says|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/unesco-chief-irina-bokova-accuses-islamist-groups-of-cultural-cleansing-isis-a6679761.html|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Destruction of Art in Afghanistan}}
* During the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]], large-scale looting occurred in various archaeological sites including [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], ancient site of [[Ai-Khanoum]], the [[Buddhist]] monastery complex in Tepe Shortor which dates back to the 2nd century CE, and the National Kabul Museum. These sites were ransacked by various pillagers, including the pro-Russian government forces, destitute villagers, and the local crime rings. The [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] suffered the greatest damage, in which the systematic looting has plundered the museum collection and the adjacent Archaeological Institute. As a result, more than two thirds of one hundred thousand pieces of museum treasures and artifacts were lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22–26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Anti-Azerbaijani sentiment in Armenia#Destruction of mosque in Armenia}}
*Hundreds of mosques in the Armenian region were destroyed during the late 19th-century and the early 20th-century. In 1870, a report by the [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Viceroyalty of the Caucasus]] recorded 269 [[Shia]] mosques in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Кавказский календарь на 1870 год|year=1869|publisher=Тифлис, типография Главного Управления Наместника Кавказского|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to the [[Anti-Azerbaijani sentiment in Armenia]], a mosque in [[Yerevan]] was pulled down with a bulldozer in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cullen, A Reporter at Large, “Roots,” The New Yorker, April 15, 1991, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Waal.

NYU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-1945-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-1945-9}}, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Today there is only one mosque remaining in the city. The destruction is considered facilitated by the systematic erasure of Azeri names from the history of the city.&lt;ref name=dewaal&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Thomas|title=Black garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through peace and war|year=2003|publisher=New York University Press|page=80|quote=That the Armenians could erase an Azerbaijani mosque inside their capital city was made easier by a linguistic sleight of hand: the Azerbaijanis of Armenia can be more easily written out of history because the name “Azeri” or “Azerbaijani” was not in common usage before the twentieth century. In the premodern era these people were generally referred to as “Tartars”, “Turks” or simply “Muslims”. Yet they were neither Persians nor Turks; they were Turkic-speaking Shiite subjects of Safavid dynasty of the Iranian Empire – in other words, the ancestors of people, whom we would now call “Azerbaijanis”. So when the Armenians refer to the “Persian mosque” in Yerevan, the name obscures the fact that most of the worshippers there, when it was built in the 1760s, would have been, in effect, Azerbaijanis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Azure Window]] , was a 28-metre-tall (92&amp;nbsp;ft) limestone natural arch on the island of Gozo in Malta. It was located in Dwejra Bay in the limits of San Lawrenz, close to the Inland Sea and the Fungus Rock. It was one of Malta's major tourist attractions. The arch, together with other natural features in the area of Dwejra, is featured in a number of international films and other media representations. The formation was anchored on the east end by the seaside cliff, arching over open water, to be anchored to a free standing pillar in the sea to the west of the cliff. It was created when two limestone sea caves collapsed. Following years of natural erosion causing parts of the arch to fall into the sea, the arch and free standing pillar collapsed completely during a storm on March 2017.

===World War II===
The resulting carnage and the aftermath of the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]] (followed by the [[Manila massacre]]) is responsible for the near total obliteration and evisceration of irreplaceable cultural, and historical heritage &amp; treasures of the "Pearl of the Orient" (an international melting pot and a living monument of the meeting and confluence of Spanish, American and Asian cultures). Countless government buildings, universities and colleges, convents, monasteries and churches, and their accompanying treasures, all dating back to the 16th century and in a variety of style, were wiped out and ruined by both Japanese and inadvertently the American forces battling for the control of the city.

The most devastating damage happened at the ancient walled city of [[Intramuros]], as a result of the assault from 23–26 February, until its total liberation on 4 March, Intramuros was a shell of its former glory (except [[San Agustin Church (Manila)|the church of San Agustin]], the sole survivor of the carnage). Outside the walls, large areas of the city had been levelled.

After the Liberation, as part of rebuilding Manila, most of the buildings damaged during the war were either demolished in the name of "Progress", or rebuilt in a manner that bears no resemblance to the original; replacing European architectural styles during the Spanish and early American era with modern American- and imitation-style architecture. Only a few surviving old buildings remain intact, though even those that remain are continuously endangered to deterioration &amp; neglect, political mismanagement brought on by graft and corruption, rapid urbanization &amp; economic redevelopment, low public awareness &amp; ignorance.

===2013 Bohol earthquake===

Several historic buildings were damaged or destroyed during the [[2013 Bohol earthquake]], including the [[Loboc Church]], the [[Loon Church]], the [[Maribojoc Church]] and the [[Baclayon Church]].

* During February–March 1944, the Soviet conducted the [[Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush|expulsion of the Chechens and Ingush]] from the [[North Caucasus]] as a part of the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Soviet forced settlement program]] of the non-Russian ethnic minorities. The operation was resulted in the deportation of 496,000 [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] populations, and the death of around quarter of them. It was also accompanied by the destruction of local cultural and societal heritages; names of these nations were erased from the books and records; placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques were demolished; villages were razed; and the historical [[Nakh language]] manuscripts were almost completely destroyed.   
* Around 191,000 [[Crimean Tatars]] faced the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deportation by the Soviets]] in May 1944. This was accompanied by virtual "ethnic cleansing" from the [[Crimea]], with all the [[Tatar]] placenames being replaced with Russian ones, and the Muslim graveyards and religious objects were destroyed or converted into secular places.
* [[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917–1941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. A number of churches were demolished, including the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow and [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Izhevsk)|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in Izhevsk. Both of these were rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s.

Controversially, the above-ground portions of the station were demolished in 1963, making way for the construction of the [[Madison Square Garden]] arena.  The controversy energized a historic preservation movement in New York City and the United States.
*Since the 1960 start of the [[National Historic Landmark]] (NHL) program and the 1966 start of the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP), numerous landmarks designated in those programs have been destroyed.  In some cases the destruction was mitigated by documentation of the artifact and/or reproduction.
**Losses by flood and wind damage include:
***The 1855-built NHL [[Old Blenheim Bridge]], the longest surviving [[covered bridge]], was destroyed by [[Hurricane Irene]]-related flooding in 2011.
***Numerous NRHP-listed coastal properties in Mississippi and Louisiana, destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina]]
**Losses by fire, arson or otherwise, include:
***Russian-built NHL [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross Chapel]], pre-1841, destroyed 1970, subsequently reproduced
*** on July 12, 1973, fire destroyed about 80% of the military personnel records held at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, MO.  &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/fire-1973 The 1973 Fire, National Personnel Records Center]&lt;/ref&gt;
**Losses by permitted processes include:
***NHL [[Soldier Field]] stadium, 1924-built, altered by 2002 renovation
***NHL [[Edwin H. Armstrong House]], demolished 1983
***NHL [[Army Medical Museum and Library]]. 1887–1969, demolished
***NHL [[NASA]] wind tunnels [[Eight-Foot High Speed Tunnel]] (1936–2011) and [[Full Scale 30- by 60-Foot Tunnel]] (1936–2010).
**Ships broken up include:
***NHL [[Wapama (steam schooner)|''Wapama'' (steam schooner)]] (1915–2013), scrapped, though documented by [[Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER) throughout its dismantling
***NHL [[President (1924 steamboat)|''President'' (steamboat)]] (1924–2009), disassembled
*Other losses of covered bridges, landmarked or not, include:
**[[Dooley Station Covered Bridge]] (1917–1960), arson; replaced by move of 1856-built [[Portland Mills Covered Bridge]]
**[[Bridgeton Covered Bridge]] (1868–2005), arson, since replaced by replica
**NRHP [[Jeffries Ford Covered Bridge]] (1915–2002), arson
**[[Welle Hess Covered Bridge No. S1]] (1871–1981), collapsed, partially reproduced off-site
**[[Whites Bridge]] (1869–2013), arson
**[[Babb's Bridge]] (1864–1973), arson, replaced by replica

*In 1969, an original [[Flag of the Treinta y Tres]] from the [[Cisplatine War]] was stolen from the history museum. The national symbol was taken on July 16, 1969 by a revolutionary group called [[OPR-33]]. The historical flag was last seen in 1975 in [[Buenos Aires]] but has been considered missing since the day of its theft.

'''Mikayel Chamchian''' ({{lang-hy|Միքայէլ Չամչեան}}, 4 December 1738 – 30 November 1823), known also in [[English language|English]] as '''Michael Chamich''',  was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Mekhitarist| Mekhitarist monk]] and historian. He is best known for writing a comprehensive and influential history of Armenia in three volumes, which remained a reference in [[Armenian studies]] for over a century.

==Career==
Chamchian was born in [[Constantinople]] and trained as a jeweler by the imperial jeweler Mikayel Chelebi Duzian. He joined the [[Mechitarists|Mkhitarian Congregation]] in Venice in 1762.

In 1774 he was appointed instructor of [[Armenian language]] in the monastery. In 1779 he wrote ''Kerakanutiun Haykazian Lezvi'' (''Քերականութիւն Հայկազեան լեզուի'', Grammar of the Armenian Language). By 1784 he had finished his ''Patmutiun Hayots i Skzbane Ashkharhi Minchev tsam diarn'' (''Պատմութիւն Հայոց'', ''Armenian history from the beginning of the world to the year 1784''). The work marks the beginning of Romantic Armenian nationalism. 

Chamchian provided a chronology for the Armenian patriarchs (as laid down by [[Moses of Chorene|Movses Khorenatsi]] in his ''[[History of Armenia (Moses of Chorene)|History of Armenia]]''), dating [[Hayk]]'s battle with [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], and thus the formation of the Armenian people, to August 11, 2492 BC. He is also the source for the traditionally accepted date for the foundation of official Christiandom in [[Armenia]] as AD 301.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panossian|first=Razmik|title=The Armenians: From Kings and Priests to Merchants and Commissars|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231511339|authorlink=Razmik Panossian|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795 he was sent back to Constantinople as the resident Mekhitarian representative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">'''Miloš Hájek''' (May 12, 1921 – February 25, 2016) was a Czech [[historian]], [[politician]] and [[Czechoslovak]] [[resistance fighter]] during the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] (1938–1945). Hájek, who signed the [[Charter 77]] [[human rights]] [[manifesto]] in 1977, became the spokesman for the Charter 77 movement in 1988.&lt;ref name=pdm&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Historian, former Charter 77 spokesman Milos Hajek dies |url=http://praguemonitor.com/2016/02/26/historian-former-charter-77-spokesman-milos-hajek-dies |work=[[Prague Daily Monitor]]|date=2016-02-25 |accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hájek was born in [[Dětenice]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1921. In 1938, Nazi Germany began its occupation of Czechoslovakia. Together with his later wife [[Alena Hájková]], Hájek became involved with the Czech resistance and other anti-Nazi groups to help [[Jews]] obtain hideouts and false [[identity papers]] during World War II.&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt; He was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in August 1944 and sentenced to death in March 1945.&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt; However, his execution was not carried out before the [[Prague uprising]] and the end of the German occupation.&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt; He was later honored as "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]" by [[Israel]] for his work to save Jews during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4015185 Miloš Hájek] at [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt;

Hájek became a member of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ) following the war, but opposed the KSČ's party leadership throughout the country's Communist era.&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt; He broke with the party's leaders during the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 to join the reform movement.&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt; He was expelled from the Communist Party following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], which ended the Prague Spring. He was also fired from his job, but went into retirement because he had been a World War II resistance fighter, thanks to the help of his [[Alena Hájková|ex wife]].&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt;

In 1977, Hájek joined with a group of Czechoslovak dissidents, including [[Václav Havel]], to sign the Charter 77 human rights manifesto.

Miloš Hájek died in Prague on February 25, 2016, at the age of 94.&lt;ref name=pdm/&gt; His granddaughter Anna is a Holocaust historian at the [[University of Warwick]].

'''Mods and rockers''' were two conflicting [[United Kingdom|British]] youth [[subculture]]s of the early/mid 1960s to early 1970s. Media coverage of [[Mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]] fighting in 1964 sparked a [[moral panic]] about British youth, and the two groups became widely perceived as violent, unruly troublemakers.

The rocker subculture was centred on [[motorcycling]], and their appearance reflected that. Rockers generally wore protective clothing such as [[Motorcycle leathers|black leather jackets]] and motorcycle boots (although they sometimes wore [[brothel creeper]] shoes). The style was heavily influenced by Marlon Brando in ''[[The Wild One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rockers!|last=Stuart|first=Johnny|publisher=Plexus|year=1987|isbn=0-85965-125-8|location=London|pages=24|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common rocker hairstyle was a [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], while their music genre of choice was 1950s [[rock and roll]], played by artists including [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Gene Vincent]], and [[Bo Diddley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://subcultureslist.com/mods-and-rockers/ Subcultures List – Mods and Rockers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502155023/http://subcultureslist.com/mods-and-rockers/ |date=2 May 2016 }} Retrieved 14 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The mod subculture was centred on fashion and music, and many mods rode [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]]. Mods wore [[Suit (clothing)|suits]] and other cleancut outfits, and preferred 1960s music genres such as [[Soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[ska]], [[beat music]], and British blues-rooted bands like [[The Yardbirds]], the [[Small Faces]], and [[The Who]], who wrote an evocative portrait of the cultures with their 1973 album [[Quadrophenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stthomasu.ca/~pmccorm/modsandrockers2.html The Liverpool Project; The Scotland Road Group website; Part 2 – The Mods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501150209/http://www.stthomasu.ca/~pmccorm/modsandrockers2.html |date=1 May 2016 }} Retrieved 14 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of rockers were isolated on Brighton beach where they – despite being protected by police – were overwhelmed and assaulted by mods. Eventually calm was restored and a judge levied heavy fines, describing those arrested as "sawdust [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]]."&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ainsworth|first1=Clark|title=Margate capitalises on 1964 Mods and Rockers' riots |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-15094293|accessdate=30 June 2014 |publisher= BBC News | date=1 October 2011 |location=Margate, Kent |quote=An exhibition called Talking Bout My Generation is being hosted in the building where the offenders were sentenced.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers described the mod and rocker clashes as being of "disastrous proportions", and labelled mods and rockers as "vermin" and "louts".&lt;ref name="Moral_Panics" /&gt; Newspaper editorials fanned the flames of hysteria, such as a ''Birmingham Post'' editorial in May 1964, which warned that mods and rockers were "internal enemies" in the UK who would "bring about disintegration of a nation's character".  The magazine ''Police Review'' argued that the mods and rockers' purported lack of respect for law and order could cause violence to "surge and flame like a forest fire".&lt;ref name="Moral_Panics" /&gt;

As a result of this media coverage, two British Members of Parliament travelled to the seaside areas to survey the damage, and MP [[Harold Gurden]] called for a resolution for intensified measures to control hooliganism.  One of the prosecutors in the trial of some of the Clacton brawlers argued that mods and rockers were youths with no serious views, who lacked respect for law and order.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

There were occasional incidents thereafter. The punk band ''[[The Exploited]]'' recorded the song ''Fuck the Mods'' on the B-side of their first release and the record's back cover stated "To all the Edinburgh punks and skins - keep on mod-bashing!!".  The band performed in [[Finsbury Park, London]] in 1981 on the same night that [[The Jam]] were playing nearby, and there was fighting after the gigs between the mods who had watched The Jam and the rockers who had watched The Exploited.&lt;ref&gt;George Same (2009), ''Backward Moddy Boy'', AuthorHouse, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic debunking==
His retrospective study of the mods and rockers conflict led sociologist [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] to develop the term ''[[moral panic]]''. In his 1972 study ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'',&lt;ref name=Moral_Panics&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohen | first = Stanley | author-link = Stanley Cohen (sociologist) | title = Folk devils and moral panics: the creation of the Mods and Rockers | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415267120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he examined media coverage of the mod and rocker riots in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.filmeducation.org/filmlib/BFC.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080704060550/http://www.filmeducation.org/filmlib/BFC.pdf | archivedate = 4 July 2008 | format = PDF | title = British Film Commission (BFC) | publisher = Film Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concedes that mods and rockers had some fights in the mid-1960s, but argues that they were no different from the evening brawls that occurred between youths throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, both at seaside resorts and after football games. He argues that the UK media turned the mod subculture into a negative symbol of delinquent and deviant status.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Stanley page 27"&gt;Cohen, Stanley. ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen argues that as media hysteria about knife-wielding, violent mods increased, the image of a fur-collared anorak and scooter would "stimulate hostile and punitive reactions".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Stanley. ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics''. page 28&lt;/ref&gt; He says the media used possibly faked interviews with supposed rockers such as "Mick the Wild One".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Stanley. ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics''. page 31&lt;/ref&gt;
As well, the media would try to get mileage from accidents that were unrelated to mod-rocker violence, such as an accidental drowning of a youth, which resulted in the headline "Mod Dead in Sea".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Stanley. ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics''. page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, when the media ran out of real fights to report, they would publish deceptive headlines, such as using a subheading "Violence", even when the article reported that there was no violence at all.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Stanley page 27"/&gt; Newspaper writers also began to associate mods and rockers with various social issues, such as teen pregnancy, contraceptives, amphetamines, and violence.&lt;ref name="Moral_Panics" /&gt;

'''''Noise: The Political Economy of Music''''' is a non-fiction book by French economist and scholar, [[Jacques Attali]].

Attali's essential argument in ''Noise: The Political Economy of Music'' (French title: ''Bruits: essai sur l'economie politique de la musique'') is that music, as a cultural form, is intimately tied up in the mode of production in any given society. For [[Marxism|Marxist]] critics, this idea is nothing new. The novelty of Attali's work is that it reverses the traditional understandings about how revolutions in the mode of production take place:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Attali] is the first to point out the other possible logical consequence of the “reciprocal interaction” model—namely, the possibility of a superstructure to anticipate historical developments, to foreshadow new social formations in a prophetic and annunciatory way. The argument of ''Noise'' is that music, unique among the arts for reasons that are themselves overdetermined, has precisely this annunciatory vocation; that the music of today stands both as a promise of a new, liberating mode of production, and as the menace of a [[dystopia]]n possibility which is that mode of production’s baleful mirror image."&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, from the "Foreword" to ''Noise''&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Attali's Four Stages of Music==
Attali believes that music has gone through four distinct cultural stages in its history: ''Sacrificing'', ''Representing'', ''Repeating'', and a fourth cultural stage which could roughly be called ''Post-Repeating''. These stages are each linked to a certain "mode of production"; that is to say, each of these stages carries with it a certain set of technologies for producing, recording and disseminating music, and also concomitant cultural structures that allow for music's transmission and reception.

'''Sacrificing''' refers to the pre-history of modern music—the period of purely oral tradition. In historical terms, this period could be dated to anytime before about 1500 AD. This is the period before mass-produced, notated music—a period when the musical tradition exists solely in the memory of people, generally in the form of oral songs and folktales. Here, Attali characterizes music as being contrasted to the "noise" of nature—of death, chaos and destruction. In other words, music stands in contrast to all of those natural forces that threaten man and his cultural heritage. The purpose of music in this era is to preserve and transmit that cultural heritage, by using music to reinforce memory. Music in this period is ubiquitous and often tied up in festival. He calls the chapter '''Sacrificing''' because in this era, music is a ritualized, structuralized sublimation of the violence of nature.

'''Representing''' refers to the era of printed music—roughly 1500-1900 AD. During this era, music becomes tied to a physical medium for the first time, and therefore becomes a commodity for sale in the marketplace. During this era, Attali characterizes music as being a spectacle that is contrasted to silence—think of the hushed anticipation that greets the professional performer in the concert hall. During this era, music also becomes separated from the human life-world: no longer the purview of peasants at their labor, music becomes a highly complex, mechanical process that is articulated by specialists. He calls this chapter '''Representing''' because the project of the performer is to "re-present" music—to bring it out of absence and into presence by drawing the intent of the composer from the page and articulating it to a waiting audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Beginning in the eighteenth century, ritualized belonging became representation. The musician… became a producer and seller of signs who was free in appearance, but in fact almost always exploited and manipulated by his clients…''
The attitude of music then changed profoundly: in ritual, it was one element in the totality of life… In contrast, in representation there was a gulf between the musicians and the audience; the most perfect silence reigned in the concerts of the bourgeoisie… The trap closed: the silence greeting the musicians was what created music and gave it autonomous existence, a reality. Instead of being a relation, it was no longer anything more than a monologue of specialists competing in front of consumers. The artist was born, at the same time that his work went on sale…" (Attali, 46-47) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Repeating''' refers to the era of recorded and broadcast sound—roughly 1900 AD-present. During this period, notation (which could be thought of as a highly coded, written guide to how music should be sounded) was replaced by recording (which is the sounding of music, trapped and preserved on vinyl, tape or disc). During this era, Attali asserts that the goal of music is not memory or quality, but fidelity—the goal of those engaged in the musical project (which includes not only composers and performers, but sound engineers, studio execs and the like) is to record sound as clearly and flawlessly as possible, and to perfectly reproduce these recordings. In this era, each musical work is contrasted to the other versions of itself—the key question for the musician becomes: how faithfully can he re-produce the "original" recording? Attali calls this chapter '''Repeating''', then, because each musical act is a repetition of what came before: music is made up of ever-more-perfect echoes of itself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The advent of recording thoroughly shattered representation. First produced as a way of preserving its trace, it instead replaced it as the driving force of the economy of music… for those trapped by the record, public performance becomes a simulacrum of the record: an audience generally familiar with the artist’s recordings attends to hear a live replication… For popular music, this has meant the gradual death of small bands, who have been reduced to faithful imitations of recording stars. For the classical repertory, it means the danger… of imposing all of the aesthetic criteria of repetition—made of rigor and cold calculation—upon representation." (Attali, 85) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also important to '''Repeating''' are Attali’s ideas of Exchange-Time and Use-Time.  Attali defines Exchange-Time as the time spent towards earning the money needed to purchase a recording, whereas Use-Time involves the time spent listening to recordings by the purchaser.  In a society made up of recording labels and radio stations, far more recordings are produced than an individual can listen to in a lifetime, and in an effort to spend more time in Use-Time than in Exchange-Time people begin to stockpile recordings of what they want to hear.  Attali states that this stockpiling has become the main method of use by consumers, and in doing so, shorter musical works have been valorized.  More importantly, according to Attali, this process of stockpiling removes the social and political power from music. (Attali, 101)

Attali hints at a '''Post-Repeating''' era in his chapter 'Composing', but never fully develops his theory of it. While many readers consider this to be influenced by electronic musical techniques such as [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], [[remix]]ing and electronic manipulation (which were common in 1985 when the English translation was published), it is doubtful that they would have influenced Attali given that "Noise" was first published in French in 1977 (and one can assume the manuscript was completed at least several months prior to publication).

      <comment>The term "Roman" is imprecise.  Although commonly used, it is not as correct as simply "Catholic Church" as there are many non-"Roman" churches within the Catholic Church. Yes Mr McInerny was a Latin or "Roman" Rite Catholic, but for a generic audience it has little relevance as it dose not constitute a different faith, but a liturgical style/type. The lone relevance it does is for anti-Catholics that use it a pejoratively.- Thank you.  ~~~~</comment>

McInerny wrote his PhD dissertation entitled ''The Existential Dialectic of Soren Kierkegaard'' under Professor [[Charles De Koninck]] at Laval University (Quebec).

He was [[Professor]] of [[Philosophy]], Director of the [[Jacques Maritain]] Center, and [[Michael P. Grace]] Professor of Medieval Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]].  He taught there from 1955 until his retirement in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

McInerny was also a Fulbright Scholar, receiving educational funds from the [[Fulbright Commission Belgium]].

'''Repatriation''' is the return of art or [[cultural heritage]], usually referring to ancient or [[looted art]], to their country of origin or former owners (or their heirs). The disputed cultural property items are physical artifacts of a group or society that were taken from another group usually in an act of looting, whether in the context of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]] or war. The contested objects range widely from [[sculpture]]s and paintings to monuments and human remains.

== Background ==

===War and looting===

==== Ancient world====
[[File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9066.jpg|thumb|Victory Stele of Naram Sin, Akkadian Dynasty, reign of Naram-Sin (2254-2218 BC). Musée du Louvre, Paris.]]
War and the subsequent looting of defeated peoples has been common practice since ancient times. The stele of King [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]], which is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, is one of the earliest works of art known to have been looted in war. The stele commemorating Naram-Sin's victory in a battle against the [[Lullubi]] people in 2250 BCE was taken as war plunder about a thousand years later by the [[Elamites]] who relocated it to their capital in [[Susa]], Iran. There, it was uncovered in 1898 by French archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Sumerian poem titled ''[[Curse of Akkad]]'', Naram-Sin was responsible for the collapse of the [[Akkadian Empire]] as he looted and destroyed the [[Temple of Enlil]] and incited the wrath of the gods as a result, see Miles, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palladion]] was the earliest and perhaps the most important stolen statue in western literature.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Miles, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The small carved wooden statue of an armed [[Athena]] served as Troy's protective [[talisman]], which is said to have been stolen by two Greeks who secretly smuggled the statue out of the [[Temple of Athena]]. It was widely believed in antiquity that the conquest of Troy was only possible because the city had lost its protective talisman. This myth illustrates the sacramental significance of statuary in Ancient Greece as divine manifestations of the gods that symbolized power and were often believed to possess supernatural abilities. The sacred nature of the statues is further illustrated in the supposed suffering of the victorious Greeks afterward, including [[Odysseus]], who was the mastermind behind the robbery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

According to Roman myth, Rome was founded by [[Romulus]], the first victor to dedicate spoils taken from an enemy ruler to the [[Temple of Jupiter Feretrius]]. In Rome's many subsequent wars, blood-stained armor and weaponry were gathered and placed in temples as a symbol of respect toward the enemies' deities and as a way to win their patronage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Miles, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman power spread throughout Italy where Greek cities once reigned, Greek art was looted and ostentatiously displayed in Rome as a triumphal symbol of foreign territories brought under Roman rule.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; However, the triumphal procession of [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the fall of Syracuse in 211 is believed to have set a standard of reverence to conquered sanctuaries as it engendered disapproval by critics and a negative social reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[Emperor Augustus]] was sufficiently embarrassed by the history of Roman plunder of Greek art to return some pieces to their original homes.&lt;ref&gt;Isager, Jacob, ''Pliny on Art and Society: The Elder Pliny's Chapters On The History Of Art'', p. 173, 2013, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-135-08580-3}}, 978-1-135-08580-3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIwWTaEXQM0C&amp;pg=PA173 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern era====
One of the most infamous cases of esurient art plundering in wartime was the [[Nazi]] appropriation of art from both public and private holdings throughout Europe and Russia. The looting began before [[World War II]] with illegal seizures as part of a systematic persecution of Jews, which was included as a part of Nazi crimes during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;See film, ''Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War'' by L.H. Nicholas, New York, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Germany plundered 427 museums in the [[Soviet Union]] and ravaged or destroyed 1,670 [[Russian Orthodox]] churches, 237 [[Catholic]] churches and 532 synagogues.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unplundering Art|newspaper=Economist|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known recent case of wartime looting was the plundering of ancient artifacts from the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in Baghdad at the outbreak of the war in 2003. Although this was not a case in which the victors plundered art from their defeated enemy, it was result of the unstable and chaotic conditions of war that allowed looting to happen and which some would argue was the fault of the invading US forces.

Archaeologists and scholars criticized the US military for not taking the measures to secure the museum, a repository for a myriad of valuable ancient artifacts from the ancient [[Mesopotamian]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barry Meier and James Glanz|title=Looted treasure returning to Iraq national museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/world/africa/26iht-treasure.2300298.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 November 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the several months leading up to the war, scholars, art directors, and collector met with [[the Pentagon]] to ensure that the US government would protect Iraq's important archaeological heritage, with the National Museum in Baghdad being at the top of the list of concerns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Greenfield, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Between April 8, when the museum was vacated and April 12, when some of the staff returned, an estimated 15,000 items and an additional 5,000 cylinder seals were stolen.&lt;ref name="poole1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Poole|first=Robert M.|title=Looting Iraq|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|date=February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120703020429/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|archivedate=3 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the National Library was plundered of thousands of [[cuneiform]] tablets and the building was set on fire with half a million books inside; fortunately, many of the manuscripts and books were preserved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; A US task force was able to retrieve about half of the stolen artifacts by organizing and dispatching an inventory of missing objects and by declaring that there would be no punishment for anyone returning an item.&lt;ref name="poole1"/&gt; In addition to the vulnerability of art and historical institutions during the Iraq war, Iraq's rich archaeological sites and areas of excavated land (Iraq is presumed to possess vast undiscovered treasures) have fallen victim to widespread looting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Greenfield, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Hordes of looters disinterred enormous craters around Iraq's archaeological sites, sometimes using bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 archaeological sites in Iraq have been despoiled.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

=== Modern imperialism and looting ===
[[File:Paris Louvre c1845.jpg|thumb|Paris Louvre ca. 1845]]
The scale of plundering that took place under [[Napoleon]]'s French Empire was unprecedented in modern history with the only comparable looting expeditions taking place in ancient Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;Well known examples include [[Lucius Mummius]]' sack of Corinth or [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]' plunder of Syracuse, See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; They also supported their actions with the opinion that their sophisticated artistic taste would allow them to appreciate the plundered art.&lt;ref&gt;See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's soldiers crudely dismantled the art by tearing paintings out of their frames hung in churches and sometimes causing damage during the shipping process.  Napoleon's soldiers appropriated private collections and even the papal collection.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Of the most famous artworks plundered included the [[Horses of Saint Mark|Bronze Horses of Saint Mark]] in Venice and the [[Laocoön and His Sons]] in Rome (both since returned), with the later being considered the most impressive sculpture from antiquity at the time.

[[File:Gruppo del laocoonte, 04.JPG|thumb|left|Laocoön group, ca. 40-20 BCE. Museo Pio Clementino, Vatican]]
The Laocoön had a particular meaning for the French because it was associated with a myth in connection to the founding of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The Laocoön was the fabled Trojan priest who warned the Trojans not to accept the Wooden Horse that the Greeks offered to Athena. A god hostile to Troy sent sea serpents to kill him and his sons, which led to the fall of Troy and heralded the eventual founding of Rome, see Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; When the art was brought into Paris, the pieces arrived in the fashion of a triumphal procession modeled after the common practice of ancient Romans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

Napoleon's extensive plunder of Italy was criticized by such French artists as [[Antoine-Chrysostôme Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755–1849), who circulated a petition that gathered the signatures of fifty other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically one of the names included [[Vivant Denon]], the future Director of the [[Louvre]] and future facilitator of Napoleon's despoliation of artifacts from Egypt (see Miles, p. 326)&lt;/ref&gt; With the founding of the [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris in 1793, Napoleon's aim was to establish an encyclopedic exhibition of art history, which later both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] would attempt to emulate in their respective countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|L'Expédition d'Égypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte by Leon Cogniet, ca. 1835. Musée du Louvre, Paris. Depicts Napoleon and his savants studying Egypt.]]
Napoleon continued his art conquests in 1798 when he invaded Egypt in an attempt to safeguard French trade interests and to undermine Britain's access to India via Egypt. His expedition in Egypt is noted for the 167 "savants" he took with him including scientists and other specialists equipped with tools for recording, surveying and documenting ancient and modern Egypt and its natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the expedition discoveries included the [[Rosetta Stone]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]] near Thebes. The French military campaign was short-lived and unsuccessful and the majority of the collected artifacts (including the Rosetta Stone) were seized by British troops, ending up in the [[British Museum]]. Nonetheless, the information gathered by the French expedition was soon after published in the several volumes of ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'', which included 837 copperplate engravings and over 3,000 drawings. In contrast to the disapproving public reaction to the looting of Italian works of art, the appropriation of Egyptian art saw widespread interest and fascination throughout Europe, inciting a phenomenon which came to be called "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Miles, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demands for restitution ===
A precedent for art repatriation was set in Roman antiquity when [[Cicero]] prosecuted [[Verres]], a senate member and illegal appropriator of art. Cicero's speech influenced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] European thought and had an indirect impact on the modern debate about art repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's argument uses military episodes of plunder as "case law" and expresses certain standards when it comes to appropriating cultural property of another people.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero makes a distinction between public and private uses of art and what is appropriate for each and he also asserts that the primary purpose of art is religious expression and veneration. He also sets standards for the responsibilities of imperial administration abroad to the code of ethics surrounding the collection of art from defeated Greece and Rome in wartime. Later, both Napoleon and Lord Elgin would be likened to Verres in condemnations of their plundering of art.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Allied victory in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the Napoleonic Era.]]Art was repatriated for the first time in modern history when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] overturned art plundered by Napoleon to Italy after he and Marshal Bluchers armies defeated the French at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This decision contrasted sharply to a long-held tradition to the effect that "[[Spoils system|to the victors go the spoils]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This is remarkable considering that in the battle of Waterloo alone, the financial and human costs were colossal; the decision to not only refrain from plundering France but to repatriate France's prior seizures from the Netherlands, Italy, Prussia, and Spain, was extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the British paid for the restitution of the papal collection to Rome because the Pope could not finance the shipping himself.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; When British troops began packing up looted art from the Louvre, there was a public outcry in France. Crowds reportedly tried to prevent the taking of the [[Horses of Saint Mark]] and there were throngs of weeping ladies outside the Louvre Museum.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Miles, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unprecedented nature of this repatriation effort, there are recent estimations that only about 55 percent of what was taken was actually repatriated: the Louvre Director at the time, [[Vivant Denon]], had sent out many important works to other parts of France before the British could take them.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;  Wellington viewed himself as representing all of Europe's nations and he believed that the moral decision would be to restore the art in its apparently proper context.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Lord Castlereagh]] he wrote:

{{cquote|The Allies then, having the contents of the museum justly in their power, could not do otherwise than restore them to the countries form which, contrary to the practice of civilized warfare, they had been torn during the disastrous period of the French revolution and the tyranny of Bonaparte. ... Not only, then, would it, in my opinion, be unjust in the Sovereigns to gratify the people of France on this subject, at the expense of their own people, but the sacrifice they would make would be impolitic, as it would deprive them of the opportunity of giving the people of France a great moral lesson. |||Excerpt from letter of Wellington to Viscount Castlereagh, K.G., Paris| September 23, 1815&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;}}

Wellington also forbade pilfering among his troops as he believed that it led to the lack of discipline and distraction from military duty. He also held the view that winning support from local inhabitants was an important break from Napoleon's practices.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The great public interest in art repatriation helped fuel the expansion of public museums in Europe and launched museum-funded archaeological explorations. The concept of art and cultural repatriation gained momentum through the latter decades of the twentieth century and began to show fruition by the end of the century when key works were ceded back to claimants.

== Legal issues ==

=== National government laws ===
In 1863 US President [[Abraham Lincoln]] summoned [[Francis Lieber]], a German-American jurist and political philosopher, to write a legal code to regulate Union soldiers' behavior toward Confederation prisoners, noncombatants, spies and property.  The resulting ''General Orders No.100'' or the [[Lieber Code]], legally recognized cultural property as a protected category in war.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lieber Code had far-reaching results as it became the basis for the Hague Convention of 1907 and 1954 and has led to Standing Rules of Engagement (ROE) for US troops today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Miles, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the ROE clauses instruct US troops not to attack "schools, museums, national monuments, and any other historical or cultural sites unless they are being used for a military purpose and pose a threat".&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

In 2004 the US passed the Bill HR1047 for the Emergency Protection for Iraq Cultural Antiquities Act, which allows the President authority to impose emergency import restrictions by Section 204 of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCIPA).&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Britain and Switzerland put into effect statutory prohibitions against illegally exported Iraqi artifacts.  In the UK, the Dealing in Cultural Objects Bill was established in 2003 that prohibited the handling of illegal cultural objects.

=== International conventions ===
The Hague Convention of 1907 aimed to forbid pillaging and sought to make wartime plunder the subject of legal proceedings, although in practice the defeated countries did not gain any leverage in their demands for repatriation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;  The Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict took place in the wake of widespread destruction of cultural heritage in [[World War II]] is the first international treaty of a worldwide vocation focusing exclusively on the protection of cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict.

The [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law) Convention on Stolen or Illicitly Exported Cultural Objects of 1995 called for the return of illegally exported cultural objects &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326162020/http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm |date=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
The 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention against Illicit Export under the Act to implement the Convention (the Cultural Property Implementation Act) allowed for stolen objects to be seized if there were documentation of it in a museum or institution of a state party and the following agreement in 1972 promoted world cultural and natural heritage&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978 UNESCO Convention strengthened existing provisions; the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of illicit Appropriation was established.  It consists of 22 members elected by the General Conference of UNESCO to facilitate bilateral negotiations for the restitution of "any cultural property which has a fundamental significance from the point of view of the spiritual values and cultural heritage of the people of a Member State or Associate Member of UNESCO and which has been lost as a result of colonial or foreign occupation or as a result of illicit appropriation".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riviere|first=Francoise|title=Editorial|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also created to "encourage the necessary research and studies for the establishment of coherent programmes for the constitution of representative collections in countries whose cultural heritage has been dispersed".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"/&gt;

In response to the Iraqi National Museum looting, UNESCO Director-General, [[Kōichirō Matsuura]] convened a meeting in Paris on April 17, 2003 in order to assess the situation and coordinate international networks in order to recover the cultural heritage of Iraq.  On July 8, 2003, [[Interpol]] and UNESCO signed an amendment to their 1999 Cooperation Agreement in the effort to recover looted Iraqi artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bouchenaki|first=Mounir|title=Return and restitution of cultural property in the wake of the 1970 Convention|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political issues ==

=== Colonialism and identity ===
From early on, the field of archaeology was deeply involved in political endeavors and in the construction of national identities. This early relationship can be seen during the [[Renaissance]] and the proto-Italian reactions against the [[High Gothic]] movement, but the relationship became stronger during 19th century Europe when archaeology became institutionalized as a field of study furnished by artifacts acquired during the rise of European colonialism led by the British and French.&lt;ref&gt;Silberman, pp. 249-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonialism and the field of archaeology mutually supported one another as the need to acquire knowledge of ancient artifacts justified further colonial dominance.

As further justification for colonial rule, the archaeological discoveries also shaped the way European colonialists identified with the artifacts and the ancient people who made them.  In the case of Egypt, colonial Europe's mission to bring the glory and magnificence of ancient Egypt closer to Europe and incorporate it into knowledge of world history, or better yet, European history placed ancient Egypt in a new spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Said 86&lt;/ref&gt;  With the archaeological discoveries, ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Colla 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization;&lt;ref&gt;Miles 320&lt;/ref&gt; by the same token, the appropriation of ancient Egyptian history as European history further legitimated Western colonial rule over Egypt.  But while ancient Egypt became patrimony of the West, modern Egypt remained a part of the Muslim world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  The writings of European archaeologists and tourists illustrate the impression that modern Egyptians were uncivilized, savage, and the antithesis of the splendor of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Museums furnished by colonial looting have largely shaped the way a nation imagines its dominion, the nature of the human beings under its power, the geography of the land, and the legitimacy of its ancestors, working to suggest a process of political inheriting.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 164&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to understand the paradoxical way in which the objects on display at museums are tangible reminders of the power held by those who gaze at them.&lt;ref&gt;Colla 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliot Colla describes the structure of the Egyptian sculpture room in the British Museum as an assemblage that "form[s] an abstract image of the globe with London at the center".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Colla 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Museum]], as Colla describes, presents a lesson of human development and progress:  "the forward march of human civilization from its classical origins in Greece and Rome, through Renaissance Italy, to modern-day London".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

The restoration of monuments was often made in colonial states to make natives feel as if in their current state, they were no longer capable of greatness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Anderson 181&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sometimes colonial rulers argued that the ancestors of the colonized people did not make the artifacts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Some scholars also argue that European colonialists used monumental archaeology and tourism to appear as the guardian of the colonized, reinforcing unconscious and undetectable ownership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Colonial rulers used peoples, religions, languages, artifacts, and monuments as source for reinforcing European nationalism, which was adopted and easily inherited from the colonial states.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

=== Nationalism and identity ===
As a direct reaction and resistance to colonial oppression, archaeology was also used for the purpose of legitimating the existence of an independent nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Andreu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Egyptian Nationalists utilized its ancient history to invent the political and expressive culture of "[[Pharaonism]]" as a response to Europe’s "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Colla 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Masada02 ST 04.jpg|thumb|Masada fortress, Israel]]  Some argue that in colonized states, nationalist archaeology was used to resist colonialism and racism under the guise of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, pp. 3-11&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is true that both colonialist and nationalist discourse use the artifact to form mechanisms to sustain their contending political agendas, there is a danger in viewing them interchangeably since the latter was a reaction and form of resistance to the former.  On the other hand, it is important to realize that in the process of emulating the mechanisms of colonial discourse, the nationalist discourse produced new forms of power.  In the case of the Egyptian nationalist movement, the new form of power and meaning that surrounded the artifact furthered the Egyptian independence cause but continued to oppress the rural Egyptian population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=June 2015}} argue that archaeology can be a positive source of pride in cultural traditions, but can also be abused to justify cultural or racial superiority as the Nazis argued that Germanic people of Northern Europe was a distinct race and cradle of Western civilization that was superior to Jewish race.{{citation needed|reason=We need a source that substantiates the relationship between archaeology and the Nazi concept of Germanic racial superiority.|date=June 2015}} In some conflicts that involve land ownership, archaeology is used to encourage confrontation by means of constructing of national myth as seen with the ancient fortress of [[Masada]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Paul|title=Masada legend galvanizes Israel|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7830416.stm|accessdate=6 November 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, archaeology allows rulers to justify the domination of neighboring peoples as [[Saddam Hussein]] used [[Mesopotamia]]'s magnificent past to justify his [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars employ the idea that identity is fluid and constructed, especially national identity of modern nation-states, to argue that the post-colonial countries have no real claims to the artifacts plundered from their borders since their cultural connections to the artifacts are indirect and equivocal.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xx-xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; This argument asserts that artifacts should be viewed as universal cultural property and should not be divided among artificially created [[nation-states]]. Moreover, that encyclopedic museums are a testament to diversity, tolerance and the appreciation of many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars would argue that this reasoning is a continuation of colonialist discourse attempting to appropriate the ancient art of colonized states and incorporate it into the narrative of Western history.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Controversy ==

}}
The debate surrounding art repatriation differs case by case due to the specific nature of legal and historical issues surrounding each case, but below are listed general arguments commonly used:

=== Arguments against repatriation ===
* Artifacts are a part of a universal human history and encyclopedic museums like the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] cultivate the dissemination of knowledge, tolerance, and broad cultural understanding.
* Artifacts were frequently excavated or uncovered by looters, who brought to light a piece of artwork that would otherwise never have been seen; foreign-led excavation teams have uncovered items that contribute to cultural knowledge and understanding.
* Nationalist retentionist cultural property laws claiming ownership are founded on constructed boundaries of modern nations with weak connections to the culture, spirit, and race to the ancient peoples who produced those antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuno|first=James|title=Who Owns Antiquity? The Battle Over Our Ancient Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2010/10/20101022140412aidan0.7519953.html#By_James_Cuno|title=Who’s Right? Repatriation of Cultural Property|first=James|last=Cuno|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural identities are dynamic, inter-related and overlapping so no modern nation-state can claim cultural property as their own or else they are promoting a sectarian view of culture.
* Having artwork disseminated around the world encourages international scholarly and professional exchange.
* Encyclopedic museums are located in cosmopolitan cities such as London, Paris and New York, and if the artworks were to be moved, they would be seen by far fewer people. If the [[Rosetta Stone]] were to be moved from The British Museum to The [[Cairo Museum]], the number of people who view it would drop from about 5.5 million visitors to 2.5 million visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone] The Telegraph. By Charlotte Edwardes and Catherine Milner, 20 Jul 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for repatriation ===
* Encyclopedic museums such as the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] were established as repositories for looted art during imperial and colonial rule, and thus are located in metropolitan cities out of view and reach of the cultures from which they were appropriated.
* Precedence of repatriated art has already been set in many cases but the artworks that museums currently refuse to repatriate are the most valuable and famous artworks.
* Foreign-led excavations have justified colonial rule; in the pursuit of obtaining knowledge about the artifacts, there was a need to establish control over the artifacts and the countries where they were located.
* The argument that art is a part of a universal human history is a derivative of colonial discourse that appropriated ancient art of other cultures into the Western historical narrative.
* The encyclopedic museums that house much of the world's artworks and artifacts are located in Western cities and privilege European scholars, professionals and people.
* The argument that artwork will not be protected outside of the Western world is hypocritical as much of the artwork transported out of colonized countries was crudely removed and damaged and sometimes lost in transportation. The [[Elgin marbles]] for example, were also damaged during the cleaning and "preservation" process.
* Art is best appreciated and understood in its  original historical and cultural context. Moreover the ''Napried'', one of the ships commissioned by [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola|di Cesnola]] to transport approximately 35,000 pieces of antiquities that he had collected from [[Cyprus]], was lost at sea carrying about 5,000 pieces in its cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://napried.com/|title=Napried Exploration|website=napried.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Art taken out of the country as a spoil of war, looting, imperialism, and colonialism is unethical, even if it isn't reflected in legislation.  The possession of artwork taken under these conditions is a form of continued colonialism.
* The lack of existing legal recourse for claiming the return of illicitly appropriated cultural property is a result of colonization.
* Cultural property is a symbol of cultural heritage and identity and the appropriation of historical artworks is an affront to a nation's pride.

== International examples ==
[[File:Nofretete Neues Museum.jpg|thumb|The iconic bust of Nefertiti]]

=== Egypt ===
Egypt is seeking the repatriation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] from the [[British Museum]] and the [[Nefertiti bust]] from the [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin.

=== Greece ===
Greece is seeking repatriation of the [[Elgin Marbles]] from the [[British Museum]], taken from the [[Parthenon]] by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]]. Since 1816, the [[British Museum]] has held the Parthenon Marbles ("In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while other critics compared The British Consul at Greece Elgin's actions to vandalism or looting", text from the Marbles article), and, despite the tortuous and ill explained path from Greece to England, the museum strongly defends its right to own and display the marbles.
[[File:Euphronios krater side A MET L.2006.10.jpg|thumb|Euphronios Krater]]

=== Italy ===
In February 2006, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] negotiated the repatriation of the [[Euphronios krater]] to [[Italy]], from where it was thought to have been looted in the early 1970s.

=== Canada ===
The [[Haisla people|Haisla]] [[totem Pole]] of [[Kitimat, British Columbia]] was originally prepared for chief G'psgoalux in 1872.  This aboriginal artifact was donated to a Swedish museum in 1929. According to the donor, he had purchased the pole from the [[Haisla people]] while he lived on the Canadian west coast and served as Swedish consul. After being approached by the Haisla people, the Swedish government decided in 1994 to return the pole, as the exact circumstances around the acquisition were unclear. The pole was returned to Kitimat in 2006 after a building had been constructed in order to preserve the pole.

=== India ===
The U.K. has rejected India's fresh demand to return its priceless artifacts like "[[Koh-i-Noor|Kohinoor Diamond]]" and "[[Sultanganj Buddha]]" that were stolen/looted/smuggled during British colonial rule citing a law (The British Museum Act, 1963) that prevents it from giving back the items. ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) is planning to join a campaign with the support of UNESCO and other countries to regain the artifacts.

=== South Korea ===
In November 2010, Japan agreed to return some 1,000 cultural objects to South Korea that were plundered during its colonial occupation from 1910-45. The collection includes a collection of royal books called [[Uigwe]] from the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392-1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tong|first=Xiong|title=S Korea to retrieve stolen cultural property from Japan: media|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-11/08/c_13596596.htm|accessdate=15 November 2010|newspaper=Xinhua News Agency|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
During an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea [[Donald Gregg]] received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely. Former Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge [[Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.]] in Washington, D.C. awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as "extensive and shocking." The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgment from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">'''Rodrigo Sánchez de Arévalo''' ({{lang-la|Rodericus Zamorensis}}; [[Santa María la Real de Nieva]], diocese of [[Segovia]], 1404 &amp;ndash; 4 October 1470) was a Spanish churchman, historian and political theorist.

A learned Spanish bishop, after studying law at [[Salamanca]] for ten years and there graduating as Doctor, he became secretary to [[John II of Castile]], and [[Henry IV of Castile]]. They employed him as envoy on various missions, notably to the [[Holy See]] apropos of the [[Council of Basle]], whose conciliarist theories he opposed. While on a mission to the Holy Roman Empire, he was addressed in a letter by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] setting forth the latter's theory of ''explicatio Petri'', the unfolding of the Church from Peter.

In 1450 Arévalo gave the annual encomium in honor of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] at the Church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] to the academic community of the College of St. Thomas, the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/7428931/I_panegirici_in_onore_di_s._Tommaso_d_Aquino_alla_Minerva_nel_XV_secolo_Memorie_Domenicane_N.S._30_1999_pp._19-146_recensito_su_Medioevo_latino_XXII_2001_n._4538_ Accessed 31 Dec. 2014; J. BLÁZQUEZ, Sermón de Rodrigo Sánchez de Arévalo en la fiesta de Santo Tomás de  Aquino (7 marzo 1450), “Revista española de teologia” 34 (1974), 396-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elevation of [[Calixtus III]], he remained at Rome, became [[Bishop of Oviedo]] in Spain, and later commander of the papal fortress, the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], under [[Pope Paul II|Paul II]], who transferred him successively to the Spanish sees of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], [[Calahorra]], and [[Palencia]]. Rodrigo was the jailer of [[Julius Pomponius Laetus]] (Giulio Pomponio Leto), [[Bartolomeo Platina]] and other members of the [[Academia Romana (Italy)|Academia Romana]] (Roman Academy) suspected of conspiracy by Pope Paul.
 
==Works==
His writings, mostly unedited, are in the Vatican and at Padua, and deal with ecclesiastical and political matters. The following have been printed: "Speculum Vitae Humanae" (Rome, 1468), a popular work, frequently reprinted in the next two centuries; it treats of the lights and shadows of the various estates of life; "Historia Hispanica," from the earliest times to 1469 (Rome, 1470), reprinted in the first volume of [[Andreas Schott]]'s ''Hispania Illustrata''.

In "De Monarchia Orbis et de origine et differentiâ principatus imperialis et regalis" (Rome, 1521), he asserts for the pope the sole right to punish kings. His bold reproofs of certain ecclesiastical dignitaries caused [[Matthias Flacius]] to put him down as a forerunner of [[Martin Luther]], but quite unjustly, as [[Nicolás Antonio]] has shown in his ''Bibliotheca Hispanica Vetus'' (II, 397, 608, 614).

'''Saint Petersburg''' ({{lang-rus|Санкт-Петербу́рг|a=Ru-Sankt Peterburg Leningrad Petrograd Piter.ogg|r=Sankt-Peterburg|p=ˈsankt pʲɪtʲɪrˈburk}}) is Russia's [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|second-largest city]] after [[Moscow]], with 5&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants in 2012,&lt;ref name="2010Census"/&gt; part of the Saint Petersburg agglomeration with a population of 6.2&amp;nbsp;million (2015).

==Name==
An admirer of everything German, Peter the Great originally named the city, '''Sankt-Peterburg''' ({{lang-ru|Санкт-Петербург}};{{efn|name=orth|In the [[Reforms of Russian orthography#The post-revolution reform|pre-1918 Russian orthography]], these names were spelled {{lang|ru|Санкт'''ъ'''-Петербург'''ъ'''}} and {{lang|ru|Петроград'''ъ'''}} with a trailing [[hard sign]].}} note that the Russian name lacks the letter ''s'' between ''Peter'' and ''burg'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/13/world/leningrad-petersburg-and-the-great-name-debate.html|title=Leningrad, Petersburg and the Great Name Debate|first=Serge|last=Schmemann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], the Imperial government renamed the city '''Petrograd''' ({{lang-rus|Петрогра́д{{efn|name=orth}}|p=pʲɪtrɐˈgrat}}),&lt;ref name="vokrugsveta.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/encyclopedia/?title=%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4|title=Петроград — Энциклопедия "Вокруг света"|website=www.vokrugsveta.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Peter's city", in order to expunge the German name ''[[wikt:Sankt#German|Sankt]]'' and ''[[wikt:Burg#German|Burg]]''. On 26 January 1924, shortly after the death of Lenin, it was renamed to '''Leningrad''' ({{lang-rus|Ленингра́д|p=lʲɪnʲɪnˈgrat}}), meaning "Lenin's City". On 6 September 1991, the original name, Sankt-Peterburg, was returned. Today, in English the city is known as "Saint Petersburg". Local residents often refer to the city by its shortened nickname, '''Piter''' ({{lang-rus|Пи́тер|p=ˈpʲitʲɪr}}).

The city's traditional nickname among Russians is the ''Window to the West''.

===Imperial Era (1703–1917)===
[[File:Bronze Horseman 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Bronze Horseman]], monument to Peter the Great]]

Swedish colonists built [[Nyenschantz|Nyenskans]], a fortress at the mouth of the [[Neva River]] in 1611, in what was then called [[Ingria|Ingermanland]], which was inhabited by [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] tribe of [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]]. The small town of Nyen grew up around it.

At the end of the 17th century, Peter the Great, who was very interested in seafaring and maritime affairs, wanted Russia to gain a seaport in order to trade with the rest of Europe.&lt;ref name="wilson82"&gt;{{cite book |title=Peter the Great |last=Wilson |first=Derek |publisher=Macmillan |isbn= 9781429964678|page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N-K6Fp445CIC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=peter+the+great+maritime#v=onepage&amp;q=maritime&amp;f=false |access-date=25 February 2012 |date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He needed a better seaport than the country's main one at the time, [[Arkhangelsk]], which was on the [[White Sea]] in the far north and closed to shipping during the winter.

On {{OldStyleDate|12 May|1703|1 May}}, during the [[Great Northern War]], [[Peter the Great]] captured Nyenskans and soon replaced the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Russia of the Russians |last=Williams |first=Harold |year=1914 |publisher=Pitman &amp; Sons |isbn= |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMJoAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA33&amp;dq |accessdate=2016-02-12|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On {{OldStyleDate|27 May|1703|16 May}},&lt;ref name="hughes66"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Lindsey|title=Peter the Great: a Biography|year=2004|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=0-300-10300-X|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; closer to the [[estuary]] {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} inland from the [[Gulf of Finland|gulf]]),{{clarify|date=October 2018}} on [[Zayachy Island|Zayachy (Hare) Island]], he laid down the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], which became the first brick and stone building of the new city.&lt;ref name="spenc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/museums/peter-paul-fortress.asp |title=Peter and Paul Fortress |access-date=19 June 2009 |publisher=Saint-Petersburg.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720042332/http://www.saint-petersburg.com/museums/peter-paul-fortress.asp |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was built by [[serfdom|conscripted peasants]] from all over Russia; a number of Swedish [[POWs|prisoners of war]] were also involved in some years under the supervision of [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swedenabroad.com/Page____41937.aspx |title=Consulate General of Sweden – Sweden and Saint Petersburg |publisher=Swedenabroad.com |date=17 October 2005 |access-date=6 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108171800/http://www.swedenabroad.com/Page____41937.aspx |archivedate=8 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of serfs died building the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-paris-of-the-north-or-city-of-bones-407069.html "St Petersburg: Paris of the North or City of Bones?"], ''The Independent''. 8 July 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120215411/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-paris-of-the-north-or-city-of-bones-407069.html |date=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the city became the centre of the [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]]. Peter moved the capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg in 1712, 9 years before the [[Treaty of Nystad]] of 1721 ended the war; he referred to Saint Petersburg as the capital (or seat of government) as early as 1704.&lt;ref name="wilson82"/&gt;

[[File:Map spb 1744 high.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=1.2|Map of Saint Petersburg, 1744]]
During its first few years, the city developed around Trinity Square on the right bank of the Neva, near the Peter and Paul Fortress. However, Saint Petersburg soon started to be built out according to a plan. By 1716 the [[Swiss Italian]] [[Domenico Trezzini]] had elaborated a project whereby the city centre would be located on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] and shaped by a rectangular grid of canals. The project was not completed but is evident in the layout of the streets. In 1716, Peter the Great appointed Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond]] as the [[architecture|chief architect]] of Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/famous-people/jean-baptiste-le-blond/|title=Jean-Baptiste Le Blond, architect in St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg, Russia |publisher=saint-petersburg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of [[Petrine Baroque]], developed by Trezzini and other architects and exemplified by such buildings as the [[Menshikov Palace]], [[Kunstkamera]], [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], [[Twelve Collegia]], became prominent in the city architecture of the early 18th century. In 1724 the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]], [[Saint Petersburg State University|University]] and Academic Gymnasium were established in Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great.

In 1725, Peter died at the age of fifty-two. His endeavours to modernize Russia had met with opposition from the [[Russian nobility]]—resulting in several attempts on his life and a treason case involving his son.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Anderson, ''Peter the Great'' (London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson|Thames and Hudson]], 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1728, [[Peter II of Russia]] moved his seat back to Moscow. But four years later, in 1732, under Empress [[Anna of Russia]], Saint Petersburg was again designated as the capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. It remained the seat of the [[Romanov dynasty]] and the Imperial Court of the [[Russian Tsars]], as well as the seat of the Russian government, for another 186 years until the [[Russian Revolution|communist revolution of 1917]].

In 1736–1737 the city suffered from catastrophic fires. To rebuild the damaged boroughs, a committee under [[Burkhard Christoph von Münnich]] commissioned a new plan in 1737. The city was divided into five boroughs, and the city center was moved to the Admiralty borough, situated on the east bank between the Neva and [[Fontanka]].

[[File:Дворцовая_площадь_Санкт-Петербурга._Вид_из_Эрмитажа..JPG|thumb|[[Palace Square]] backed by the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General staff arch and building]], as the main square of the Russian Empire it was the setting of many events of historic significance]]

It developed along three radial streets, which meet at the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]] and are now one street known as [[Nevsky Prospekt]] (which is considered the main street of the city), [[Gorokhovaya Street]] and [[Voznesensky Prospekt]]. [[Baroque architecture]] became dominant in the city during the first sixty years, culminating in the Elizabethan Baroque, represented most notably by Italian [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] with such buildings as the [[Winter Palace]]. In the 1760s, Baroque architecture was succeeded by [[neoclassical architecture]].

Established in 1762, the Commission of Stone Buildings of Moscow and Saint Petersburg ruled that no structure in the city can be higher than the Winter Palace and prohibited spacing between buildings. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] in the 1760s–1780s, the banks of the Neva were lined with [[granite]] embankments.

However, it was not until 1850 that the first permanent bridge across the Neva, [[Blagoveshchensky Bridge]], was allowed to open. Before that, only [[pontoon bridge]]s were allowed. [[Obvodny Canal]] (dug in 1769–1833) became the southern limit of the city.

The most prominent neoclassical and [[Empire style|Empire-style]] architects in Saint Petersburg included:

* [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] ([[Imperial Academy of Arts]], [[Hermitage Museum|Small Hermitage]], [[Great Gostiny Dvor|Gostiny Dvor]], [[New Holland Island|New Holland Arch]], [[Catholic Church of St. Catherine (Saint Petersburg)|Catholic Church of St. Catherine]])
* [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]] ([[Marble Palace]])
* [[Yury Felten]] ([[Hermitage Museum|Old Hermitage]], [[Chesme Church]])
* [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] (Academy of Sciences, [[Hermitage Theatre]], [[Moika Palace|Yusupov Palace]])
* [[Andrey Voronikhin]] ([[Saint Petersburg Mining Institute|Mining Institute]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]])
* [[Andreyan Zakharov]] ([[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]])
* [[Jean-François Thomas de Thomon]] ([[Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and Rostral Columns|Spit of Vasilievsky Island]])
* [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] ([[Yelagin Palace]], [[Russian Museum|Mikhailovsky Palace]], [[Alexandrinsky Theatre|Alexandrine Theatre]], [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate and Synod Buildings]], [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General staff Building]], design of many streets and squares)
* [[Vasily Stasov]] ([[Moscow Triumphal Gate]], [[Trinity Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Trinity Cathedral]])
* [[Auguste de Montferrand]] ([[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], [[Alexander Column]])

[[File:Kolman decembrists.jpg|thumb|[[Decembrists]] at the [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]], December 26, 1825.]]

In 1810, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] established the first engineering [[Higher learning institution]], the [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Saint Petersburg Main military engineering School]] in Saint Petersburg. Many monuments commemorate the Russian victory over [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] in the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]], including the [[Alexander Column]] by Montferrand, erected in 1834, and the [[Narva Triumphal Gate]].

In 1825, the suppressed [[Decembrist revolt]] against [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas&amp;nbsp;I]] took place on the [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]] in the city, a day after Nicholas assumed the throne.

By the 1840s, neoclassical architecture had given way to various romanticist styles, which dominated until the 1890s, represented by such architects as [[Andrei Stackenschneider]] ([[Mariinsky Palace]], [[Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace]], [[Nicholas Palace]], [[Andrei Stackenschneider|New Michael Palace]]) and [[Konstantin Thon]] ([[Moskovsky railway station (Saint Petersburg)|Moskovsky railway station]]).

With the [[emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] undertaken by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1861 and an [[Industrial Revolution]], the influx of former peasants into the capital increased greatly. Poor boroughs spontaneously emerged on the outskirts of the city. Saint Petersburg surpassed Moscow in population and industrial growth; it developed as one of the largest industrial cities in Europe, with a major naval base (in [[Kronstadt]]), river and sea port.

The names of Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], bestowed upon [[Peter and Paul Fortress|original city's citadel]] and its [[Peter and Paul Cathedral|cathedral]] (from 1725—a [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] of Russian emperors) coincidentally were the names of the first two assassinated Russian Emperors, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter&amp;nbsp;III]] (1762, supposedly killed in a conspiracy led by his wife, [[Catherine the Great]]) and [[Paul I of Russia|Paul&amp;nbsp;I]] (1801, [[Nicholas Zubov]] and other conspirators who brought to power [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;I]], the son of their victim). The third emperor's assassination took place in Saint Petersburg in 1881 when [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;II]] fell victim to [[narodniki]] (see the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]]).

The [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]] began in Saint Petersburg and spread rapidly into the provinces.

On 1 September 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], the Imperial government renamed the city ''Petrograd'',&lt;ref name="vokrugsveta.ru" /&gt; meaning "Peter's City", to remove the German words ''[[wikt:Sankt#German|Sankt]]'' and ''[[wikt:Burg#German|Burg]]''.

===Revolution and Soviet Era (1917–1941)===
In March 1917, during the [[February Revolution]] Nicholas II abdicated both for himself and on behalf of his son, ending the Russian monarchy and over three hundred years of [[Romanov dynasty|Romanov]] [[dynastic rule]].

[[File:Desfile-uno-mayo-II--rusia--russianbolshevik00rossuoft.png|thumb|right|[[Bolsheviks]] celebrating [[International Workers' Day|May 1]] near the [[Winter Palace]] year after [[October Revolution|taking power]], 1918]]On {{OldStyleDate|7 November|1917|25 October}}, the [[Bolshevik]]s, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], stormed the [[Winter Palace]] in an event known thereafter as the [[October Revolution]], which led to the end of the post-Tsarist [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]], the transfer of all political power to the [[Worker's council|Soviets]], and the rise of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade ''The Russian Revolution, 1917'' 2005 [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-84155-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that the city acquired a new descriptive name, "the city of three revolutions",&lt;ref name="russia-travel"&gt;{{cite web|title=The common characteristic of Saint-Petersburg |publisher=russia-travel.ws |url=http://www.russia-travel.ws/regions/The_common_characteristic/|year=2005–2008|access-date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the three major developments in the political history of Russia of the early 20th-century.

In September and October 1917, German troops [[Operation Albion|invaded]] the [[West Estonian archipelago]] and threatened Petrograd with bombardment and invasion. On 12 March 1918, the Soviets transferred the government to Moscow, to keep it away from the state border. During the ensuing [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], in 1919 general [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]] advancing from Estonia repeated the attempt to capture the city, but [[Leon Trotsky]] mobilized the army and forced him to retreat.

On 26 January 1924, five days after Lenin's death, Petrograd was renamed ''Leningrad''. Later some streets and other [[wiktionary:toponym|toponyms]] were renamed accordingly. The city has over 230 places associated with the life and activities of Lenin. Some of them were turned into museums,&lt;ref name="Kann"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kann, Pavel Yakovlevich |title=Leningrad: A Short Guide|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |location=Moscow |year=1963 |pages=132–133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7TIaAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Lenin%20places%20in%20Leningrad |access-date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Russian cruiser Aurora|cruiser ''Aurora'']]&amp;nbsp;– a symbol of the October Revolution and the oldest ship in the [[Russian Navy]].

In the 1920s and 1930s, the poor outskirts were reconstructed into regularly planned boroughs. [[Constructivist architecture]] flourished around that time. Housing became a government-provided [[social utility|amenity]]; many "bourgeois" apartments were so large that numerous families were assigned to what were called "communal" apartments (''[[kommunal apartment|kommunalka]]s''). By the 1930s, 68% of the population lived in such housing. In 1935 a new general plan was outlined, whereby the city should expand to the south. Constructivism was rejected in favor of a more pompous [[Stalinist architecture]]. Moving the city center further from the border with Finland, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] adopted a plan to build a new city hall with a huge adjacent square at the southern end of [[Moskovsky Prospekt]], designated as the new main street of Leningrad. After the [[Winter War|Winter (Soviet-Finnish) war]] in 1939-1940, the Soviet-Finnish border moved northwards. Nevsky Prospekt with Palace Square maintained the functions and the role of a city center.

In December 1931, Leningrad was administratively separated from [[Leningrad Oblast]]. At that time it included the Leningrad Suburban District, some parts of which were transferred back to Leningrad Oblast in 1936 and turned into [[Vsevolozhsky District]], [[Krasnoselsky District, Saint Petersburg|Krasnoselsky District]], Pargolovsky District and Slutsky District (renamed Pavlovsky District in 1944).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenobltrans.narod.ru/adm1.html |title=Ленинградская область в целом: Административно-территориальное деление Ленинградской области |publisher=Lenobltrans.narod.ru |access-date=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608000817/http://lenobltrans.narod.ru/adm1.html |archivedate=8 June 2009 }}

On 1 December 1934, [[Sergey Kirov]], the popular communist leader of Leningrad, was assassinated, which became the pretext for the [[Great Purge]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stalin's Terror: High Politics and Mass Repression in the Soviet Union'', Barry McLoughlin and Kevin McDermott (eds).

===World War II (1941–1945)===
{{Main|Siege of Leningrad}}
[[File:RIAN archive 2153 After bombing.jpg|left|thumb|Citizens of Leningrad during the 872-day [[siege of Leningrad|siege]], in which more than one million civilians died, mostly from starvation.]]
During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany|German forces]] besieged Leningrad following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Siege of Leningrad. [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130309105019/http://www.britannica.com/bps/topic/335949/Siege-of-Leningrad Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The siege lasted 872 days, or almost two and a half years,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Baldack, Richard H. "Leningrad, Siege of", ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'', Chicago, 2002, vol. 12, page 195.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siege of Leningrad]] proved one of the longest, most destructive, and [[Most lethal battles in world history#Sieges and urban combat|most lethal sieges]] of a major city in [[modern history]]. It isolated the city from food supplies except those provided through the [[Road of Life]] across [[Lake Ladoga]], which could not make it through until the lake literally froze. More than one million civilians were killed, mainly from starvation. Many others escaped or were evacuated, so the city became largely depopulated.

On 1 May 1945 [[Joseph Stalin]], in his Supreme Commander Order No. 20, named Leningrad, alongside [[Stalingrad]], [[Sevastopol]], and [[Odessa]], [[Hero City|hero cities]] of the war. A law acknowledging the honorary title of "Hero City" passed on 8 May 1965 (the 20th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War), during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev era]]. The [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR awarded Leningrad as a Hero City the [[Order of Lenin]] and the [[Gold Star medal]] "for the heroic resistance of the city and tenacity of the survivors of the Siege". The [[Hero-City Obelisk]] bearing the [[Gold Star medal|Gold Star sign]] was installed in April 1985.

=== Soviet Era Continued (1945–1991) ===
In October 1946 some territories along the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], which had passed to the USSR from Finland in 1940 under the [[Moscow Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] following the [[Winter War]], were transferred from Leningrad Oblast to Leningrad and divided into [[Sestroretsk|Sestroretsky District]] and [[Kurortny District]]. These included the town of [[Zelenogorsk, Saint Petersburg|Terijoki]] (renamed [[Zelenogorsk]] in 1948).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Leningrad and many of its suburbs were rebuilt over the post-war decades, partially according to pre-war plans. The 1948 general plan for Leningrad featured radial [[urban planning|urban development]] in the north as well as in the south. In 1953 [[Pavlovsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Pavlovsky District]] in Leningrad Oblast was abolished, and parts of its territory, including Pavlovsk, merged with Leningrad. In 1954 the settlements [[Levashovo, Saint Petersburg|Levashovo]], [[Pargolovo]] and [[Pesochny, Russia|Pesochny]] merged with Leningrad.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Leningrad gave its name to the [[Leningrad Affair]] (1949–1952), a notable event in the postwar political struggle in the [[USSR]]. It was a product of rivalry between Stalin's potential successors where one side was represented by the leaders of the city [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] organization—the second most significant one in the country after Moscow. The entire elite leadership of Leningrad was destroyed, including the former mayor [[Alexey Kuznetsov|Kuznetsov]], the acting mayor Pyotr Sergeevich Popkov, and all their deputies; overall 23 leaders were sentenced to the death penalty, 181 to prison or exile (exonerated in 1954). About 2,000 ranking officials across the USSR were expelled from the party and the Komsomol and removed from leadership positions. They were accused of Russian [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Zubkova"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zubkova, Elena Yurievna |title=Russia after the war: hopes, illusions, and disappointments, 1945–1957 |chapter=Chronology of Major Events |editor=Hugh Ragsdale |publisher=M.

The [[Saint Petersburg Metro|Leningrad Metro]] underground [[rapid transit|rapid transit system]], designed before the war, opened in 1955 with its first eight stations decorated with [[marble]] and [[bronze]]. However, after the death of Stalin in 1953, the perceived ornamental excesses of the Stalinist architecture were abandoned. From the 1960s to the 1980s many new residential boroughs were built on the outskirts; while the [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] apartment blocks were nearly identical to each other, many families moved there from ''kommunalkas'' in the city centre in order to live in separate apartments.

===Contemporary Era (1991–present)===
[[File:Spb Views from Isaac Cathedral May2012 09.jpg|thumb|left|View from the Colonnade, St. Isaac's Cathedral, Saint Petersburg]]
On 12 June 1991, simultaneously with the [[Russian presidential election, 1991|first Russian presidential elections]], the city authorities arranged for the mayoral elections and a referendum upon the name of the city. The turnout was 65%; 66.13% of the total count of votes went to [[Anatoly Sobchak]], who became the first directly elected [[list of heads of Saint Petersburg government|mayor of the city]].

Meanwhile, economic conditions started to deteriorate as the country tried to adapt to major changes. For the first time since the 1940s, food [[rationing]] was introduced, and the city received humanitarian [[World Food Programme|food aid]] from abroad.&lt;ref name="Orttung"/&gt; This dramatic time was depicted in photographic series of Russian photographer [[Alexey Titarenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ollman |first=Leah |date=2001-08-03 |title=Russian Photos Trace Images of Mortality and Memory |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/03/entertainment/ca-30027 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-08-25 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunne |first=Aiden |authorlink=Aidan Dunne |date=2007-05-17 |title=Camera in a City of Shadows |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/camera-in-a-city-of-shadows-1.1206242 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |location=[[Dublin]] |access-date=2018-08-25 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions began to improve only at the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://petrostat.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_ts/petrostat/resources/58cc7e804f0a97d5bbddbb22524f7e0f/SPB15.pdf | title=CАНКТ ПЕТЕРБУРГ ВАЛОВОЙ РЕГИОНАЛЬНЫЙ ПРОДУКТ в 1998-2003 гг. | language=ru | publisher=gks.ru | accessdate=13 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 a northern section of the [[Line 1 of Saint Petersburg Metro|Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line]] of the [[Saint Petersburg Metro]] was cut off by underground flooding, creating a major obstacle to the city development for almost ten years.

In 1996, [[Vladimir Anatolyevich Yakovlev|Vladimir Yakovlev]] defeated [[Anatoly Sobchak]] in the elections for the head of the [[Saint Petersburg City Administration|city administration]]. The title of the city head was changed from "mayor" to "governor". In 2000 Yakovlev won re-election. His second term expired in 2004; the long-awaited restoration of broken subway connection was expected to finish by that time. But in 2003 Yakovlev suddenly resigned, leaving the governor's office to [[Valentina Matviyenko]].

[[File:Ushinskogo St Saint Petersburg 15May2010.JPG|thumb|right|Standard "Home-Ship" (1970s–1980s)]]
The law on election of the City Governor was changed, breaking the tradition of democratic election by a universal suffrage. In 2006 the [[Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg|city legislature]] re-approved Matviyenko as governor. Residential building had intensified again; [[real estate pricing|real-estate prices]] inflated greatly, which caused many new problems for the preservation of the historical part of the city.

Although the central part of the city has a [[UNESCO]] designation (there are about 8,000 architectural monuments in Petersburg), the preservation of its historical and architectural environment became controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sergey|last=Zagraevsky|authorlink=Sergey Zagraevsky|title=Will Saint Petersburg share the same fate as Moscow? |date=2008 |url=http://zagraevsky.com/piter_engl.htm|publisher=Zagraevsky.com |access-date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2005, the demolition of older buildings in the historical centre was permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusarch.ru/attn_spb3.htm |title=Photos of the violations of the historical environment of Saint Petersburg |publisher=Rusarch.ru |access-date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Gazprom]] announced an ambitious project to erect a {{cvt|403|m}} skyscraper (the [[Okhta Center]]) opposite to [[Smolny]], which{{according to whom|date=April 2013}} could result in the loss of the unique line of Petersburg landscape.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Urgent protests by citizens and prominent public figures of Russia against this project were not considered by Governor [[Valentina Matviyenko]] and the city authorities until December 2010, when after the statement of President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], the city decided to find a more appropriate location for this project. In the same year, the new location for the project was relocated to [[Lakhta, Saint Petersburg|Lakhta]], a historical area northwest of the city center, and the new project would be named [[Lakhta Center]]. Construction was approved by Gazprom and the city administration and commenced in 2012. The {{cvt|462|m}} high Lakhta Center has become the first [[List of tallest buildings in Russia|tallest skyscraper in Russia]] and [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|Europe]] that is outside of [[Moscow]].

&lt;/div&gt;
The area of Saint Petersburg city proper is {{convert|605.8|km2|abbr=in}}. The area of the federal subject is {{cvt|1439|km2}}, which contains Saint Petersburg proper (consisting of eighty-one municipal [[okrug]]s), nine municipal towns – ([[Kolpino]], [[Krasnoye Selo]], [[Kronstadt]], [[Lomonosov, Russia|Lomonosov]], [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], [[Petergof]], [[Pushkin (town)|Pushkin]], [[Sestroretsk]], [[Zelenogorsk, Saint Petersburg|Zelenogorsk]]) – and twenty-one municipal settlements.

Petersburg is situated on the middle [[taiga]] lowlands along the shores of the [[Neva Bay]] of the [[Gulf of Finland]], and islands of the river delta. The largest are [[Vasilyevsky Island]] (besides the [[artificial island]] between Obvodny canal and [[Fontanka]], and [[Kotlin Island|Kotlin]] in the [[Neva Bay]]), [[Petrogradsky Island|Petrogradsky]], [[Dekabristov Island|Dekabristov]] and [[Krestovsky Island|Krestovsky]]. The latter together with [[Yelagin Island|Yelagin]] and [[Kamenny Island]] are covered mostly by parks. The [[Karelian Isthmus]], North of the city, is a popular [[Tourist destination|resort area]]. In the south Saint Petersburg crosses the [[Baltic Klint|Baltic-Ladoga Klint]] and meets the [[Izhora Plateau]].

The elevation of Saint Petersburg ranges from the sea level to its highest point of {{cvt|175.9|m}} at the Orekhovaya Hill in the [[Duderhof Heights]] in the south. Part of the city's territory west of [[Liteyny Prospekt]] is no higher than {{cvt|4|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], and has suffered from numerous floods. [[Floods in Saint Petersburg]] are triggered by a long wave in the [[Baltic Sea]], caused by meteorological conditions, winds and shallowness of the [[Neva Bay]]. The five most disastrous floods occurred in 1824 ({{cvt|4.21|m|ftin|disp=or}} above sea level, during which over 300 buildings were destroyed{{efn|The level of flooding is measured near [[Saint Petersburg Mining Institute]], which is normally {{cvt|11|cm}} above sea level&lt;/ref&gt;}}), 1924 ({{cvt|3.8|m|ftin|disp=comma}}), 1777 ({{cvt|3.21|m|ftin|disp=comma}}), 1955 ({{cvt|2.93|m|ftin|disp=comma}}), and 1975 ({{cvt|2.81|m|ftin|disp=comma}}). To prevent floods, the [[Saint Petersburg Dam]] has been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Nezhikhovsky, R. A. ''Река Нева и Невская губа'' [''The Neva River and Neva Bay''], Leningrad: Gidrometeoizdat, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 18th century the terrain in the city has been raised artificially, at some places by more than {{cvt|4|m}}, making mergers of several islands, and changing the hydrology of the city. Besides the Neva and its tributaries, other important rivers of the federal subject of Saint Petersburg are [[Sestra River (Leningrad Oblast)|Sestra]], [[Okhta River (Neva basin)|Okhta]] and [[Izhora River|Izhora]]. The largest lake is Sestroretsky Razliv in the north, followed by [[Lakhtinsky Razliv]], Suzdal Lakes and other smaller lakes.

Due to its northerly location at ca. 60° N [[latitude]] the [[day length]] in Petersburg varies across seasons, ranging from 5 hours 53 minutes to 18 hours 50 minutes. A period from mid-May to mid-July when twilight may last all night is called ''the [[Midnight sun|white night]]s''.

Saint Petersburg is about {{convert|165|km|abbr=in}} from the border with Finland, connected to it via the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 highway]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Saint Petersburg}}

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Saint Petersburg is classified as ''Dfb'', a [[humid continental climate]]. Distinct moderating influence of the [[Baltic Sea]] cyclones result in warm, humid and short summers and long, moderately cold wet winters. The climate of Saint Petersburg is close to that of [[Helsinki]], although colder in winter and warmer in summer because of its more eastern location.

The average maximum temperature in July is {{convert|23|C}}, and the average minimum temperature in February is {{convert|-8.5|C}}; an extreme temperature of {{convert|37.1|C}} occurred during the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave]]. A winter minimum of {{convert|-35.9|C}} was recorded in 1883. The average annual temperature is {{convert|5.8|C}}. The Neva River within the city limits usually freezes up in November–December and break-up occurs in April. From December to March there are 118 days average with snow cover, which reaches an average snow depth of {{cvt|19|cm}} by February.&lt;ref name= pogoda/&gt; The frost-free period in the city lasts on average for about 135 days. Despite St. Petersburg's northern location, its winters are warmer than Moscow's due to the [[Gulf of Finland]] and some [[Gulf Stream]] influence from Scandinavian winds that can bring temperature slightly above freezing. The city also has a slightly warmer climate than its suburbs. Weather conditions are quite variable all year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/St_Peterburg/260630.htm |title=Climate St. Peterburg – Historical weather records |publisher=Tutiempo.net |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rp5.ru/archive.php?wmo_id=26063 |title=Архив погоды в Санкт-Петербурге, Санкт-Петербург |publisher=Rp5.ru |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;div class="noprint"&gt;
Average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] varies across the city, averaging {{cvt|660|mm}} per year and reaching maximum in late summer. Soil moisture is almost always high because of lower [[evapotranspiration]] due to the cool climate. [[Relative humidity|Air humidity]] is 78% on average, and there are, on average, 165 [[overcast]] days per year.

===Toponymy===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}

The first and fairly rich chapter of the history of the local [[wiktionary:toponym|toponymy]] is the story of the own name of the city itself. The [[name day]] of [[Saint Peter|Peter I]] falls on 29 June,&lt;!--https://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosjan/peter/paragraf1_2_3.html--&gt; when the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] observes the memory of [[Saint]] [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. The consecration of the small wooden church in their names (its construction began simultaneously with the citadel) made them the heavenly patrons of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], while St.&amp;nbsp;Peter at the same time became the [[eponym]] of the whole city. In June 1703 [[Peter the Great]] officially gave the site the name ''Sankt Pieter Burkh'' (an emulation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] topografical suffix ''-burg'', which refers to fortified towns and places, as Peter was a [[Netherlands|Neerlandophile]]) which was subsequently [[Russification|russified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/13/world/leningrad-petersburg-and-the-great-name-debate.html|title=Leningrad, Petersburg and the Great Name Debate|date=13 June 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=HeJzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT395&amp;dq=saint+petersburg+named+after+dutch&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1o5fX_snWAhUJfRoKHRrzACsQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=saint+petersburg+named+after+dutch&amp;f=false|title=Lonely Planet St Petersburg|first1=Lonely|last1=Planet|first2=Tom|last2=Masters|first3=Simon|last3=Richmond|date=1 February 2015|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|upright|thumb|right|While not originally named for Tsar [[Peter the Great]], during World War I the city was changed from the Germanic "Peterburg" to "Petrograd" in his honour]]
A 14- to 15-letter-long name, composed of the three [[word root|roots]] proved too cumbersome, and a lot of shortened versions appeared in habitual use. The first General Governor of the city [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Menshikov]] is maybe also the author of the first nickname of Petersburg which he called ''Петри'' (''Petri''). It took some years until the known Russian spelling of this name finally settled. In 1740s [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] uses a derivative of {{lang-el|Πετρόπολις}} (''Petropolis'', ''Петрополис'') in a russified form ''Petropol{{'}}'' (''Петрополь''). A combo ''Piterpol'' (''Питерпол'') also appears at this time.&lt;ref name="nester"&gt;Nesterov, V. "''Знаешь ли ты свой город''" ("Do you know your city?"). Leningrad, 1958, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, eventually the usage of prefix "''Sankt-''" ceased except for the formal official documents, where a three-letter abbreviation "СПб" (''SPb'') was very widely used as well.

In the 1830s [[Alexander Pushkin]] translated the "foreign" city name of "Saint Petersburg" to the more Russian ''Petrograd'' in one of his poems. However, it was only on {{OldStyleDate|31 August|1914|18 August}}, after [[World War I|the war]] with Germany had begun, that tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] renamed the capital to Petrograd. Since the prefix 'Saint' was omitted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiokarnaval.ru/news/show/3042?radio=bd09712698pcpirbfrg1bjne86 |title=31 August 1914 St.Petersburg renamed to Petrograd |access-date=14 January 2011 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825131522/http://radiokarnaval.ru/news/show/3042?radio=bd09712698pcpirbfrg1bjne86 |archivedate=25 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this act also changed the [[eponym]] and the "patron" of the city, from [[Apostle Peter]] to Peter the Great,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} its founder.

[[File:St Petersburg port entrance cropped.jpg|left|thumb|From 1924 to 1991 the city was known as 'Leningrad'. This is a picture of the Saint Petersburg port entrance with an old 'Ленинград' (Leningrad) sign]]
After the [[October Revolution]] the name ''Red Petrograd'' (''Красный Петроград'') was often used in newspapers and other prints until the city was renamed ''Leningrad'' in January 1924.

A referendum on reversing the renaming of ''Leningrad'' was held on 12 June 1991, with 54.86% of voters (with a turnout of 65%) supporting "''Saint Petersburg''". Renaming the city ''Petrograd'' was not an option. This change officially took effect on 6 September 1991.&lt;ref name="Orttung"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orttung |first=Robert W. |title=From Leningrad to Saint Petersburg |chapter=Chronology of Major Events |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=London and New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-312-12080-X |pages=273–277 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UjbaxYyS2MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=From+Leningrad+to+Saint+Petersburg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the oblast whose administrative center is also in Saint Petersburg is still named [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad]].

Having passed the role of capital to Petersburg, Moscow never relinquished the title of "capital", being called ''pervoprestolnaya'' ("first-throned") for 200 years. An equivalent name for Petersburg, the "Northern Capital", has re-entered usage today since several federal institutions were recently moved from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. Solemn descriptive names like "the city of three revolutions" and "the cradle of the [[October revolution]]" used in Soviet era are reminders of the pivotal events in national history that occurred here. For their part, poetic names of the city, like the "[[Venice of the North]]" and the "Northern [[Palmyra]]" emphasize town-planning and architectural features contrasting these parallels to the northern location of this [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-the-venice-of-the-north-gets-its-own-fleet-of-gondolas-733899.html |title=St Petersburg, the 'Venice of the North', gets its own fleet of gondolas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |date=29 June 2004 |access-date=7 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020191228/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/st-petersburg-the-venice-of-the-north-gets-its-own-fleet-of-gondolas-733899.html |archivedate=20 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Petropolis'' is a translation of a city name to Greek, and is also a kind of descriptive name: [[:el:Πέτρωμα|Πέτρ-]] is a Greek root for "stone", so the "city from stone" emphasizes the material that had been forcibly made obligatory for construction from the very first years of the city.&lt;ref name="nester"/&gt; (Its official Greek name is ''Αγία Πετρούπολη''.)

The 2010 Census recorded the ethnic composition as follows:&lt;ref name="2010Census"/&gt; Russian 80.1%, [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] 1.3%, [[Belarusians in Russia|Belarusians]] 0.8%, [[Tatars|Tatar]] 0.6%, [[Armenians in Russia|Armenian]] 0.6%, Jewish 0.5%, [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] 0.4%, [[Tajiks|Tajik]] 0.3%, [[Azeris in Russia|Azeri]] 0.3%, [[Georgians|Georgian]] 0.2%, [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] 0.2%, [[Ingrian Finns|Finns]] 0.1%, other – 1.3%. The ethnicity of the remaining 13.4% of the inhabitants was not specified.

During the 20th century, the city experienced dramatic population changes. From 2.4&amp;nbsp;million residents in 1916 its population dropped to less than 740,000 by 1920 during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] and [[Russian Civil War]]. The minorities of Germans, Poles, Finns, Estonians and Latvians were almost completely [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|transferred]] from Leningrad during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941 to the end of 1943, population dropped from 3&amp;nbsp;million to less than 600,000, as people died in battles, starved to death during the [[Siege of Leningrad]], or were evacuated. After the siege, some of the evacuees returned, but most influx was due to migration from other parts of the Soviet Union. The city absorbed about 3&amp;nbsp;million people in the 1950s and grew to over 5&amp;nbsp;million in the 1980s. From 1991 to 2006 the city's population decreased to 4.6&amp;nbsp;million, while the suburban population increased due to privatization of land and massive move to suburbs.

People in urban Saint Petersburg lived mostly in apartments. Between 1918 and the 1990s, the Soviets [[Nationalization|nationalised]] housing and forced residents to share communal apartments (''[[kommunal apartment|kommunalka]]s''). With 68% living in shared flats in the 1930s, Leningrad was the city in the USSR with the largest number of ''kommunalkas''. Resettling residents of ''kommunalkas'' is now on the way out, albeit shared apartments are still not uncommon. As new boroughs were built on the outskirts in the 1950s–1980s, over half a million low income families eventually received free apartments, and about an additional hundred thousand condos were purchased. While economic and social activity is concentrated in the [[Central Saint Petersburg|historic city centre]], the richest part of Saint Petersburg, most people live in [[Metropolitan area|commuter areas]]. For the first half of 2007, the birth rate was 9.1 per 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0301/barom04.php |title=В первом полугодии продолжалось умеренное повышение числа рождений |publisher=Demoscope.ru |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Petersburg is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of Russia (a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-01.htm |title=The Constitution of the Russian federation |publisher=Constitution.ru |accessdate=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political life of Saint Petersburg is regulated by the [[Charter of Saint Petersburg]] adopted by the city legislature in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.spb.ru/law?d&amp;nd=8308279&amp;prevDoc=8308279&amp;spack=000listid%3D010000000100%26listpos%3D0%26lsz%3D1%26nd%3D9111570%26nh%3D0%26 |title=Russian source: Charter of Saint Petersburg City |publisher=Gov.spb.ru |accessdate=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superior executive body is the [[Saint Petersburg City Administration]], led by the [[Governor of Saint Petersburg|city governor]] (mayor before 1996). Saint Petersburg has a [[unicameralism|single-chamber]] legislature, the [[Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly]], which is the city's [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

According to the federal law passed in 2004, heads of federal subjects, including the governor of Saint Petersburg, were nominated by the [[President of Russia]] and approved by local legislatures. Should the legislature disapprove the nominee, the President could dissolve it. The former governor, [[Valentina Matviyenko]], was approved according to the new system in December 2006. She was the only woman governor in the whole of Russia until her resignation on 22 August 2011. Matviyenko stood for elections as member of the Regional Council of Saint Petersburg and won comprehensively with allegations of rigging and ballot stuffing by the opposition. Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] has already backed her for the position of Speaker to the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation]] and her election qualifies her for that job. After her resignation, [[Georgy Poltavchenko]] was appointed as the new acting governor the same day. In 2012, following passage of a new federal law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://base.garant.ru/70169404/|title=Федеральный закон от 02.05.2012 N 40-ФЗ "О внесении изменений в Федеральный закон "Об общих принципах организации законодательных (представительных) и исполнительных органов государственной власти субъектов Российской Федерации" и Федеральный закон "Об основных гарантиях избирательных прав и права на участие в референдуме граждан Российской Федерации" |publisher=garant.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; restoring direct elections of heads of federal subjects, the city charter was again amended to provide for direct elections of governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppt.ru/texts/index.phtml?id=64263|title=Закон Санкт-Петербурга от 26.06.2012 N 339-59|website=ppt.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 October 2018, Poltavchenko resigned, and [[Alexander Beglov]] was appointed acting governor.&lt;ref name="beglov"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.rambler.ru/other/40954610-aleksandr-beglov-naznachen-vrio-gubernatora-sankt-peterburga-dose/|title=Александр Беглов назначен врио Губернатора Санкт-Петербурга|date=3 October 2018|publisher=Rambler news|language=Russian|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Petersburg city is divided into [[Administrative divisions of Saint Petersburg|eighteen districts]]. Saint Petersburg is also the unofficial but ''de facto'' administrative centre of [[Leningrad Oblast]], and of the [[Northwestern Federal District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.szfo.ru/ |title=Official website of the Northwestern Federal District (Russian) |publisher=Szfo.ru |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216171819/http://www.szfo.ru/ |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation|Constitutional Court of Russia]] moved to Saint Petersburg from Moscow in May 2008.

Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast, being two different federal subjects, share a number of local departments of federal executive agencies and courts, such as court of arbitration, police, [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]], postal service, drug enforcement administration, penitentiary service, federal registration service, and other federal services.

Saint Petersburg is a major trade gateway, serving as the financial and industrial centre of Russia, with specializations in oil and gas trade; shipbuilding yards; [[aerospace|aerospace industry]]; technology, including radio, electronics, software, and computers; machine building, heavy machinery and transport, including tanks and other [[military technology and equipment|military equipment]]; mining; [[Tool|instrument]] manufacture; ferrous and nonferrous [[metallurgy]] (production of aluminium alloys); chemicals, [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], and [[medical equipment]]; publishing and printing; food and catering; wholesale and retail; textile and [[clothing|apparel]] industries; and many other businesses. It was also home to [[Lessner]], one of Russia's two pioneering automobile manufacturers (along with [[Russo-Balt]]ic); it was founded by machine tool and boiler maker G. A. Lessner in 1904, with designs by [[Boris Loutsky]], and it survived until 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten percent of the world's power [[turbine]]s are made there at the [[Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod|LMZ]], which built over two thousand turbines for [[power station|power plants]] across the world. Major local industries are [[Admiralty Shipyard]], [[Baltic Shipyard]], [[LOMO]], [[Kirov Plant]], [[Elektrosila]], [[Izhorskiye Zavody]]; also registered in Saint Petersburg are [[Sovcomflot|Sovkomflot]], [[Petersburg Fuel Company]] and [[SIBUR]] among other major Russian and international companies.

Saint Petersburg has three large cargo [[ports of the Baltic Sea|seaports]]: Bolshoi Port Saint Petersburg, [[Kronstadt]], and [[Lomonosov, Russia|Lomonosov]]. International [[cruise ship|cruise liners]] have been served at the passenger port at [[Morskoy Vokzal]] on the south-west of [[Vasilyevsky Island]]. In 2008 the first two berths were opened at the [[Passenger Port of St. Petersburg|New Passenger Port]] on the west of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverthebaltic.com/spb/index.htm Discoverthebaltic.com] Discover the Baltic online guide to Baltic cruise ports {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230231453/http://www.discoverthebaltic.com/spb/index.htm |date=30 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new port is part of the city's "Marine Facade" development project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfspb.ru/ |title=ЗАО "Терра-Нова" &amp;#124; Крупнейший в Европе проект по образованию и комплексному развитию территории в западной части Васильевского острова Санкт-Петербурга |publisher=Mfspb.ru |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is due to have seven berths in operation by 2010.

A complex system of riverports on both banks of the [[Neva River]] are interconnected with the system of seaports, thus making Saint Petersburg the main link between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the rest of Russia through the [[Volga–Baltic Waterway|Volga-Baltic Waterway]].

The [[Saint Petersburg Mint]] (Monetny Dvor), founded in 1724, is one of the largest [[mint (coin)|mints]] in the world, it mints [[Russian ruble|Russian coins]], medals and badges. Saint Petersburg is also home to the oldest and largest Russian foundry, [[Monumentskulptura]], which made thousands of sculptures and statues that are now gracing public parks of Saint Petersburg, as well as many other cities. Monuments and [[bronze sculpture|bronze statues]] of the Tsars, as well as other important historic figures and dignitaries, and other world famous monuments, such as the sculptures by [[Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg]], [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]], [[Mark Antokolsky]], and others, were made there.

In 2007, [[Toyota]] opened a [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] plant after investing 5&amp;nbsp;billion roubles (approx. 200 mln dollars) in Shushary, one of the southern suburbs of Saint Petersburg. [[Opel]], Hyundai and Nissan have signed deals with the [[Politics of Russia|Russian government]] to build their automotive plants in Saint Petersburg too. Automotive and auto-parts industry is on the rise there during the last decade.

Saint Petersburg is the location of a significant brewery and distillery industry. It is known as the "beer capital" of Russia, due to the supply and quality of local water, contributing over 30% of the domestic production of beer with its five large-scale breweries including Europe's second largest brewery [[Baltika Breweries|Baltika]], Vena (both operated by BBH), [[Heineken International|Heineken Brewery]], [[Stenka Razin|Stepan Razin]] (both by [[Heineken Pilsener|Heineken]]) and [[Tinkoff brewery]] (SUN-[[InBev]]).

The city has a lot of local [[distillery|distilleries]] that produce a broad range of [[vodka]] brands. The oldest ones is [[:ru:Ливиз|LIVIZ]] (founded in 1897). Among the youngest is [[Russian Standard Vodka]] introduced in Moscow in 1998, which opened in 2006 a new $60&amp;nbsp;million distillery in Petersburg (an area of {{convert|30000|m2|abbr=on}}, production rate of 22,500 bottles per hour). In 2007 this brand was exported to over 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianstandard.com/corporation/press_center/press_releases/1.smx Russian Standard Vodka Ranked 4th Fastest Growing Premium Spirits Brand Worldwide] Impact, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715220016/http://www.russianstandard.com/corporation/press_center/press_releases/1.smx |date=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Petersburg has the second largest [[construction|construction industry]] in Russia, including commercial, housing and road construction.

In 2006 Saint Petersburg's city budget was 179.9&amp;nbsp;billion rubles (about 6.651&amp;nbsp;billion US$ at [[Tables of historical exchange rates to the USD|2006 exchange rates]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Budget of Saint Petersburg (Russian document) |url=http://www.gov.spb.ru/law?d&amp;nd=8421328&amp;prevDoc=8421328&amp;spack=000listid%3D010000000100%26listpos%3D0%26lsz%3D1%26nd%3D8372689%26nh%3D0%26 |publisher=City of Saint Petersburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is planned to double by 2012.

In 2008, the [[World Monuments Fund]] included the Saint Petersburg historic skyline on the watch list of the 100 most endangered sites due to the expected construction, which threatens to alter it drastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wmf.org/watch2008/watch.php?id=S8352 |title=St. Petersburg Historic Skyline, Russian Federation |publisher=Wmf.org |accessdate=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Okhta Center project has been finally cancelled at the end of 2010 and instead of that [[Lakhta Center]] project is started at the city outskirts. The complex will include {{convert|463|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} office skyscraper and several low rise mixed use buildings. The Lakhta Center project has caused much less controversy and, unlike the previous unbuilt project, is not seen by [[UNESCO]] as a potential threat to the city's cultural heritage because it is located far away from the historical centre. Skyscraper construction has already started, and the building is set to be completed in 2018. It is assumed that the building will be the tallest in Russia and Europe.[[File:Saint Isaac's Square SPB (01).jpg|thumb|[[Saint Isaac's Square]]|left]]Unlike in Moscow, in Saint Petersburg the historic architecture of the city centre, mostly consisting of [[Baroque]] and neoclassical buildings of the 18th and 19th centuries, has been largely preserved; although a number of buildings were demolished after the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] and in recent years. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The oldest of the remaining building is a wooden house built for [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] in 1703 on the shore of the [[Neva]] near Trinity Square. Since 1991 the [[Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments]] in Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].

The ensemble of [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] with the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] takes a dominant position on [[Zayachy Island]] along the right bank of the [[Neva River]]. Each noon a cannon fires a blank shot from the fortress. The [[Saint Petersburg Mosque]], the largest mosque in Europe when opened in 1913, is situated on the right bank nearby. The [[Spit of Vasilievsky Island]], which splits the river into two largest armlets, the [[Bolshaya Neva]] and [[Malaya Neva]], is connected to the northern bank ([[Petrogradsky Island]]) via the [[Exchange Bridge]] and occupied by the [[Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and Rostral Columns]]. The southern coast of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] along the Bolshaya Neva features some of the city's oldest buildings, dating from the 18th century, including the [[Kunstkamera]], [[Twelve Collegia]], [[Menshikov Palace]] and [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. It hosts one of two campuses of [[Saint Petersburg State University]].[[File:Peter &amp; Paul fortress in SPB.jpg|thumb|[[Peter and Paul Fortress]]]]On the southern, left bank of the Neva, connected to the spit of Vasilyevsky Island via the [[Palace Bridge]], lie the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]], the vast [[Hermitage Museum]] complex stretching along the [[Palace Embankment]], which includes the baroque [[Winter Palace]], former official residence of Russian emperors, as well as the neoclassical [[Marble Palace]]. The [[Winter Palace]] faces [[Palace Square]], the city's main square with the [[Alexander Column]].

[[Nevsky Prospekt]], also situated on the left bank of the [[Neva]], is the main avenue in the city. It starts at the [[Admiralty]] and runs eastwards next to [[Palace Square]]. Nevsky Prospekt crosses the [[Moyka River|Moika]] ([[Green Bridge (Saint Petersburg)|Green Bridge]]), [[Griboyedov Canal]] ([[Kazansky Bridge]]), [[Sadovaya Street|Garden Street]], the [[Fontanka]] ([[Anichkov Bridge]]), meets [[Liteyny Prospekt]] and proceeds to [[Vosstaniya Square|Uprising Square]] near the [[Moskovsky Rail Terminal (Saint Petersburg)|Moskovsky railway station]], where it meets [[Ligovsky Prospekt]] and turns to the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. [[Passage (department store)|The Passage]], [[Catholic Church of St. Catherine (Saint Petersburg)|Catholic Church of St. Catherine]], [[Singer House|Book House]] (former [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Company]] Building in the [[Art Nouveau]] style), [[Grand Hotel Europe]], [[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]], [[Great Gostiny Dvor]], [[National Library of Russia|Russian National Library]], [[Alexandrinsky Theatre|Alexandrine Theatre]] behind [[Mikhail Mikeshin|Mikeshin]]'s statue of [[Catherine the Great]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], [[Stroganov Palace]], [[Anichkov Palace]] and [[Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace]] are all situated along that avenue.[[File:Night Nevskiy Flickr.jpg|thumb|[[Nevsky Prospect]] at Christmas.|left]]
[[File:Singer_House_SPB_01.jpg|thumb|[[Singer House]]]]The [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]], intended to house the relics of [[Alexander Nevsky|St. Alexander Nevsky]], is an important centre of [[Religious studies|Christian education]] in Russia. It also contains the [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] with graves of many notable Petersburgers.

On the territory between the Neva and Nevsky Prospekt the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], Mikhailovsky Palace housing the [[Russian Museum]], [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]], [[Saint Michael's Castle|St. Michael's Castle]], [[Summer Garden]], [[Tauride Palace]], [[Smolny Institute]] and [[Smolny Convent]] are located.[[File:Auferstehungskirche (Sankt Petersburg).JPG|thumb|[[Church of the Savior on Blood]]|left]][[File:Smolny Cathedral SPB 02.jpg|thumb|[[Smolny Convent]]]]Many notable landmarks are situated to the west and south of the Admiralty Building, including the [[Trinity Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Trinity Cathedral]], [[Mariinsky Palace]], [[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]], famous [[Mariinsky Theatre]], [[New Holland Island]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], the largest in the city, and [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]], also known as [[Decembrist's Square]] with the [[Bronze Horseman]], 18th century equestrian monument to [[Peter the Great]], which is considered among the city's most recognisable symbols.
Other symbols of Saint Petersburg include the [[weather vane]] in the shape of a small ship on top of the Admiralty's golden spire and the golden angel on top of the Peter and Paul Cathedral. The Palace Bridge [[drawbridge|drawn]] at night is yet another symbol of the city. Every night during the navigation period from April to November, 22 bridges across the Neva and main canals are drawn to let ships pass in and out of the Baltic Sea according to a schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mr7.ru/info/most/|title=График разводки мостов на Неве в Санкт-Петербурге|accessdate=3 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827013819/http://www.mr7.ru/info/most/|archivedate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2004 that the first high bridge across the Neva, which does not need to be drawn, [[Big Obukhovsky Bridge]], was opened. There are hundreds of smaller [[List of bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges in Saint Petersburg]] spanning across numerous canals and distributaries of the Neva, some of the most important of which are the [[Moyka River|Moika]], [[Fontanka]], [[Griboyedov Canal]], [[Obvodny Canal]], [[Karpovka River|Karpovka]] and [[Smolenka River|Smolenka]]. Due to the intricate web of canals, Saint Petersburg is often called ''[[Venice of the North]]''. The rivers and canals in the city centre are lined with granite embankments. The embankments and bridges are separated from rivers and canals by [[granite]] or [[cast iron]] [[parapet]]s.[[File:Peter the Great Bridge2.jpg|thumb|[[Bolsheokhtinsky Bridge]]]]Southern suburbs of the city feature former imperial residences, including [[Petergof]], with majestic fountain cascades and parks, [[Tsarskoye Selo|Tsarskoe Selo]], with the baroque [[Catherine Palace]] and the neoclassical [[Alexander Palace]], and [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]], which contains a domed palace of [[Paul I of Russia|Emperor Paul]] and one of the largest English-style parks in Europe. Some other residences situated nearby and making part of the world heritage site, including a castle and park in [[Gatchina]], actually belong to [[Leningrad Oblast]] rather than Saint Petersburg. Another notable suburb is [[Kronstadt]] with its 19th-century fortifications and naval monuments, occupying the [[Kotlin Island]] in the Gulf of Finland.

Since around the end of the 20th century a great deal of active building and restoration works have been carried out in a number of the city's older districts.
The authorities have recently been compelled to transfer the ownership of state-owned private residences in the city centre to private lessors.
Many older buildings have been reconstructed to allow their use as apartments and penthouses.

Some of these structures, such as the [[Saint Petersburg Commodity and Stock Exchange]] have been recognised as town-planning errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bn.ru/articles/2008/12/03/39306.html|trans-title=Virtual protection of Petersburg |title=Виртуальная защита Петербурга|last=Hudyakov |first=Artyom|date=12 March 2008|publisher=bn.ru/|language=Russian|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th and 19th-century architectural ensemble of the city and its environs is preserved in virtually unchanged form. For various reasons (including large-scale destruction during [[World War II]] and construction of modern buildings during the postwar period in the largest historical centers of Europe), Saint Petersburg has become a unique reserve of European architectural styles of the past three centuries. Saint Petersburg's loss of capital city status helped the city to retain many of its pre-revolutionary buildings, as modern architectural 'prestige projects' tended to be built in Moscow; this largely prevented the rise of mid-to-late-20th-century architecture and helped maintain the architectural appearance of the historic city center.

Saint Petersburg is inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage list as an area with 36 historical architectural complexes and around 4000 outstanding individual monuments of architecture, history and culture. New tourist programs and sightseeing tours have been developed for those wishing to see Saint Petersburg's cultural heritage.
[[File:Ermitáž (26).jpg|thumb|The Small Italian Skylight Room in the [[Hermitage Museum]].]]

The city has 221 museums, 2000 libraries, more than 80 theaters, 100 concert organizations, 45 galleries and exhibition halls, 62 cinemas and around 80 other cultural establishments. Every year the city hosts around 100 festivals and various competitions of art and culture, including more than 50 international ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Despite the [[Economic history of the Russian Federation|economic instability of the 1990s]], not a single major theatre or museum was closed in Saint Petersburg; on the contrary many new ones opened, for example a private museum of puppets (opened in 1999) is the third museum of its kind in Russia, where collections of more than 2000 dolls are presented including 'The multinational Saint Petersburg' and '[[Pushkin's Petersburg]]'. The museum world of Saint Petersburg is incredibly diverse. The city is not only home to the world-famous [[Hermitage Museum]] and the [[Russian Museum]] with its rich collection of [[Russian art]], but also the palaces of Saint Petersburg and its suburbs, so-called small town museums and others like the museum of famous Russian writer [[Dostoyevsky]]; [[Museum of Musical Instruments (Saint Petersburg)|Museum of Musical Instruments]], the museum of decorative arts and the museum of professional orientation.

The [[Music of Russia|musical life]] of Saint Petersburg is rich and diverse, with the city now playing host to a number of annual carnivals.

Ballet performances occupy a special place in the cultural life of Saint Petersburg. The Petersburg School of Ballet is named as one of the best in the world. Traditions of the Russian classical school have been passed down from generation to generation among outstanding educators. The art of famous and prominent Saint Petersburg dancers like [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Natalia Makarova]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] was, and is, admired throughout the world. Contemporary Petersburg ballet is made up not only of traditional Russian classical school, but also ballets by those like [[Boris Eifman]], who expanded the scope of strict classical [[Russian ballet]] to almost unimaginable limits. Remaining faithful to the classical basis (he was a choreographer at the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet]]), he combined [[classical ballet]] with the [[avant-garde|avant-garde style]], and then, in turn, with acrobatics, rhythmic gymnastics, dramatic expressiveness, [[Cinema of Russia|cinema]], color, light, and finally with spoken word.

==Media and communications==
All major Russian newspapers are active in Saint Petersburg. The city has a developed telecommunications system. In 2014 [[Rostelecom]], the national operator announced it began a major modernization of the fixed-line network in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.telecompaper.com/news/rostelecom-to-invest-rub-15-bln-in-st-petersburg--1011519| title =Rostelecom to invest RUB 15 bln in St Petersburg| work =Telecom Paper|date=2 May 2014| accessdate = 3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===
{{wide image|Sankt_Petersburg.palatul_de_iarna.N.jpg|900px|The [[State Hermitage Museum]] (building on the right)}}
Saint Petersburg is home to more than two hundred museums, many of them hosted in historic buildings. The largest of the museums is the [[Hermitage Museum]], featuring interiors of the former imperial residence and a vast collection of art. The [[Russian Museum]] is a large museum devoted specifically to Russian fine art. The apartments of some famous Petersburgers, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Mikhail Zoshchenko]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], as well as some palace and park ensembles of the southern suburbs and notable architectural monuments such as St. Isaac's Cathedral, have also been turned into public museums.

The [[Kunstkamera]], with its collection established in 1714 by Peter the Great to collect curiosities from all over the world, is sometimes considered the first museum in Russia, which has evolved into the present-day [[Kunstkamera|Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography]]. The [[Russian Ethnography Museum]], which has been split from the Russian Museum, is devoted to the cultures of the people of Russia, the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] and Russian Empire.

A number of museums provide insight into the Soviet history of Saint Petersburg, including the Museum of the Blockade, which describes the [[Siege of Leningrad]] and the Museum of Political History, which explains many authoritarian features of the [[U.S.S.R.]].

Other notable museums include the [[Central Naval Museum]], and [[Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Zoological Museum]], [[The Central Soil Museum by V. V. Dokuchaev|Central Soil Museum]], the [[Russian Railway Museum]], [[Suvorov Museum]], Museum of the Siege of Leningrad, [[Erarta|Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art]], the largest non-governmental Museum of contemporary art in Russia, [[Saint Petersburg Museum of History]] in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and [[Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps|Artillery Museum]], which includes not only artillery items, but also a huge collection of other military equipment, uniforms and decorations.

===Music===
[[File:Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg.jpg|right|thumb|The main auditorium of the Mariinsky Theatre]]

Among the city's more than fifty theatres is the world-famous [[Mariinsky Theatre]] (also known as the Kirov Theatre in the USSR), home to the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] company and opera. Leading ballet dancers, such as [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Rudolf Nureyev|Rudolph Nureyev]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Galina Ulanova]] and [[Natalia Makarova]], were principal stars of the Mariinsky ballet.

The first music school, the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]], was founded in 1862 by the Russian pianist and composer [[Anton Rubinstein]]. The school alumni have included such notable composers as [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Artur Kapp]], [[Rudolf Tobias]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], who taught at the conservatory during the 1960s, bringing it additional fame. The renowned Russian composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] also taught at the conservatory from 1871 to 1905. Among his students were [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Alexander Glazounov]], [[Anatoly Liadov]] and others. The former St. Petersburg apartment of Rimsky-Korsakov has been faithfully preserved as the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum|composer's only museum]].

[[File:Shou alie parusa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration on the [[Neva]] River in Saint Petersburg]]
Dmitri Shostakovich, who was born and raised in Saint Petersburg, dedicated his [[Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich)|Seventh Symphony]] to the city, calling it the "Leningrad Symphony". He wrote the symphony while based in the city during the siege of Leningrad. It was premiered in Samara in March 1942; a few month later, it received its first [[Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7|performance]] in the besieged Leningrad at the Bolshoy Philharmonic Hall under the baton of conductor [[Karl Eliasberg]]. It was heard over the radio and was said to have lifted the spirits of the surviving population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Close |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/oct/16/classicalmusicandopera.russia.stpetersburg |title=Where a symphony silenced guns |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=16 October 2005|accessdate=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the 7th Symphony was performed by the 14 surviving orchestral players of the Leningrad premiere in the same hall as half a century before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,605454,00.html |title=Orchestral manoeuvres (part one) |newspaper=The Observer |date=25 November 2001|accessdate=22 October 2009 |location=London |first=Ed |last=Vulliamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra|Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra]] remained one of the best known [[orchestra|symphony orchestras]] in the world under the leadership of conductors [[Yevgeny Mravinsky]] and [[Yuri Temirkanov]]. Mravinsky's term as artistic director of the Leningrad Philharmonic – a term that is possibly the longest of any conductor with any orchestra in modern times – led the orchestra from being a little-known provincial ensemble to it becoming one of the world's most highly regarded orchestras today, especially for the performance of Russian music.

The Imperial Choral Capella was founded and modeled after the royal courts of other European capitals.
[[File:Alexandrinsky Theatre.jpg|thumb|The [[Alexandrinsky Theater|Alexander theatre]], Saint Petersburg]]

Saint Petersburg has been home to the newest movements in [[popular music]] in the country. The first [[jazz]] band in the Soviet Union was founded here by [[Leonid Utyosov]] in the 1920s, under the patronage of [[Isaak Dunayevsky]]. The first jazz club in the Soviet Union was founded here in the 1950s and was later named [[jazz club]] Kvadrat. In 1956 the popular ensemble [[Druzhba (band)|Druzhba]] was founded by [[Aleksandr Bronevitsky]] and [[Edita Piekha]] to become the first popular band in the USSR during the 1950s. In the 1960s student rock-groups [[Argonavty]], [[Kochevniki]] and others pioneered a series of unofficial and [[underground music|underground rock]] concerts and festivals. In 1972 [[Boris Grebenshchikov]] founded the band [[Aquarium (band)|Aquarium]], which later grew to huge popularity. Since then "Peter's rock" [[music genre|music style]] was formed.

In the 1970s many bands came out from the "underground" scene and eventually founded the [[Leningrad Rock Club]], which provided a stage to bands such as [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], headed by [[Viktor Tsoi]], [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]], [[Zemlyane]], [[Zoopark]], [[Piknik]], [[Secret (Russian band)|Secret]], and many other popular bands. The first Russian-style happening show [[Pop Mekhanika]], mixing over 300 people and animals on stage, was directed by the multi-talented [[Sergey Kuryokhin]] in the 1980s. The annual International Music Festival SKIF ([[Sergey Kuriokhin International Festival]]) is named after him. In 2004 the [[Kuryokhin Center]] was founded, were the SKIF as well as the Electro-Mechanica and Ethnomechanica festivals take place. SKIF focuses on [[experimental pop music]] and [[avant garde music]], Electro-Mechanica on [[electronic music]], and Ethnomechanica on [[world music]].

Today's Saint Petersburg boasts many notable musicians of various genres, from popular Leningrad's [[Sergei Shnurov]], [[Tequilajazzz]], [[Splean]], and [[Korol i Shut]], to rock veterans [[Yuri Shevchuk]], [[Vyacheslav Butusov]], and [[Mikhail Boyarsky]]. In the early 2000s the city saw a wave of popularity of [[metalcore]], [[rapcore]], and [[emocore]], and there are bands such as [[Amatory (band)|Amatory]], [[Kirpichi]], Psychea, [[Stigmata (Russian band)|Stigmata]], [[Grenouer]] and [[Animal Jazz]].

The [[White Nights Festival]] in Saint Petersburg is famous for spectacular fireworks and a massive show celebrating the end of the [[Academic term|school year]].

The rave band [[Little Big (group)|Little Big]] also hails from Saint Petersburg.

Over 250 international and Russian movies were filmed in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&amp;&amp;locations=St.%20Petersburg,%20Russia&amp;&amp;heading=18;with+locations+including;St.%20Petersburg,%20Russia|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching "St. Petersburg, Russia"|publisher=IMDb |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well over a thousand feature films about tsars, revolution, people and stories set in Saint Petersburg have been produced worldwide but not filmed in the city. The first [[Movie studio|film studio]]s were founded in Saint Petersburg in the 20th century and since the 1920s [[Lenfilm]] has been the largest film studio based in Saint Petersburg. The first foreign feature movie filmed entirely in Saint Petersburg was the 1997 production of Tolstoy's ''[[Anna Karenina (1997 film)|Anna Karenina]]'', starring [[Sophie Marceau]] and [[Sean Bean]] and made by an international team of British, American, French and Russian filmmakers.

The cult comedy ''[[The Irony of Fate|Irony of Fate]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traveldk.com/st-petersburg/topten/films-set-in-st-petersburg|title=the irony of fate sat in st.petersburg|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also Ирония судьбы, или С лёгким паром!) is set in Saint Petersburg and pokes fun at Soviet city planning. The 1985 film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' received considerable Western attention for having captured genuine Leningrad street scenes at a time when filming in the [[Soviet Union]] by Western production companies was generally unheard of. Other movies include ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995), ''[[Midnight in Saint Petersburg]]'' (1996), ''[[Brother (1997 film)|Brother]]'' (1997) and [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] romantic [[thriller (genre)|thriller film]]-''[[Dhaam Dhoom]]'' (2008). ''[[Eugene Onegin#Film|Onegin]]'' (1999) is based on the [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] poem and showcases many [[tourist attraction]]s. In addition, the Russian romantic comedy, ''[[Piter FM]]'', intricately showcases the cityscape, almost as if it were a main character in the film.

Several international film festivals are held annually, such as the [[Festival of Festivals, Saint Petersburg]], as well as the [[Message to Man International Documentary Film Festival]], since its inauguration in 1988 during the White Nights.&lt;ref name="Message To Man"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m2m.iffc.ru/index_E.htm |title=The XIX International "Message To Man" Film Festival |publisher=IFC Centaur |accessdate=9 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515190814/http://m2m.iffc.ru/index_E.htm |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

Saint Petersburg has a longstanding and world famous tradition in literature. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] called it "The most abstract and intentional city in the world", emphasizing its artificiality, but it was also a symbol of modern disorder in a changing Russia. It frequently appeared to [[List of Russian language writers|Russian writers]] as a menacing and inhuman mechanism. The grotesque and often nightmarish image of the city is featured in Pushkin's last poems, the Petersburg stories of [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], the novels of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]], the verse of [[Alexander Blok]] and [[Osip Mandelstam|Osip Mandelshtam]], and in the symbolist novel ''[[Petersburg (novel)|Petersburg]]'' by [[Andrei Bely|Andrey Bely]]. According to Lotman in his chapter, 'The Symbolism of Saint Petersburg' in ''Universe and the Mind'', these writers were inspired by symbolism from within the city itself. The effect of life in Saint Petersburg on the plight of the poor clerk in a society obsessed with hierarchy and status also became an important theme for authors such as [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], Gogol and Dostoyevsky. Another important feature of early Saint Petersburg literature is its mythical element, which incorporates [[urban legend]]s and popular [[ghost story|ghost stories]], as the stories of Pushkin and Gogol included ghosts returning to Saint Petersburg to haunt other characters as well as other fantastical elements, creating a surreal and abstract image of Saint Petersburg.

20th-century writers from Saint Petersburg, such as [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Ayn Rand]], Andrey Bely and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], along with his apprentices, The [[Serapion Brothers]] created entire new styles in literature and contributed new insights to the understanding of society through their experience in this city. [[Anna Akhmatova]] became an important leader for [[List of Russian language poets|Russian poetry]]. Her poem ''Requiem'' adumbrates the perils encountered during the Stalinist era. Another notable 20th-century writer from Saint Petersburg is [[Joseph Brodsky]], recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] (1987). While living in the United States, his writings in English reflected on life in Saint Petersburg from the unique perspective of being both an insider and an outsider to the city in essays such as, "A Guide to a Renamed City" and the nostalgic "In a Room and a Half".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Brodsky. ''Less Than One: Selected Essays'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[File:Spb 06-2017 img46 ZSD bridge at Krestovsky Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the [[Western Rapid Diameter|Western High-Speed Diameter]]]]

Saint Petersburg is a major transport hub. The first Russian railway was built here in 1837, and since then the city's transport infrastructure has continued to develop and keep pace with the growth of the city. Petersburg has an extensive system of local roads and railway services, maintains a large public transport system that includes the [[Tramways in Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg tram]] and the [[Saint Petersburg Metro]], and is home to a number of riverine services that convey passengers around the city efficiently and in relative comfort.

The city is connected to the rest of Russia and the wider world by a number of federal highways and national and international rail routes. [[Pulkovo Airport]] serves the majority of air passengers departing from or arriving to the city.

Saint Petersburg has an extensive city-funded network of public transport (buses, [[Tramways in Saint Petersburg|trams]], [[trolleybus]]es) and several hundred routes served by ''[[marshrutka]]s''. [[Tramways in Saint Petersburg|Trams in Saint Petersburg]] used to be the main mean of transport; in the 1980s this was the largest tram network in the world, but many tracks were dismantled in the 2000s.

Buses carry up to three million passengers daily, serving over 250 urban and a number of suburban bus routes. [[Saint Petersburg Metro]] underground rapid transit system was opened in 1955; it now has 5 lines with 69 stations, connecting all five railway terminals, and carrying 2.3&amp;nbsp;million passengers daily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.spb.ru/en/metro.html "St. Petersburg Metro"]. Accessed 5 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Metro stations are often elaborately decorated with materials such as marble and bronze.

As of 2018, the Saint Petersburg Metro will include new stations: Prospekt Slavy, Dunayskaya, Shushary, Begovaya, and Novokrestovskaya, the latter built specifically to offer convenient access to the stadium during the 2018 FIFA World Cup games and games played by FC Zenit.[http://www.metro.spb.ru/noviestansii.html]

[[Traffic congestion|Traffic jams]] are common in the city due to daily commuter traffic volumes, intercity traffic and excessive winter snow. The construction of [[Controlled-access highway|freeways]] such as the [[Saint Petersburg Ring Road]], completed in 2011, and the [[Western Rapid Diameter|Western High-Speed Diameter]], completed in 2017, helped partially reduce the traffic in the city. The controversial [[Moscow–Saint Petersburg motorway|M11]], also known as the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Motorway, would connect Saint Petersburg and Moscow by a freeway and is expected to be completed before the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|Russia FIFA World Cup 2018]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eurasiatx.com/moscow-st-petersburg-motorway-believed-to-be-opened-by-2018/|title=Moscow-St. Petersburg motorway believed to be opened by 2018 - eurasiatx|date=2016-04-18|publisher=eurasiatx|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction has started in 2010 and the first sections of the freeway was finished in 2014 and 2015.

As a result, the steadily increasing passenger traffic has triggered a massive modernization of the entire airport infrastructure. A newly built Terminal 1 of the Pulkovo airport was put into operation on 4 December 2013 and integrated international flights of the former terminal Pulkovo-2. The renovated terminal Pulkovo-1 has been opened for domestic flights as an extension of the Terminal 1 in 2015.

==Crime==
{{See also|Crime in Russia|Tambov gang}}
{{wide image|Kresty Prison.jpg|500px|align-cap=center|The [[Kresty Prison]]}}
The crime dynamic in Saint Petersburg is tightly associated with the general social situation in the country. A sharp spike in the crime level occurred in the late 1980s/early 1990s as a result of the [[Perestroika]]-time turmoils (redistribution of property, privatization, decline of living standards, decrease of the effectiveness of [[militsiya]] etc.) By then the city had fallen under the control of a number of organized criminal groups such as [[Tambov Gang]], Malyshev Gang, [[Kazan phenomenon|Kazan Gang]] and ethnic criminal groups, engaged in [[racket (crime)|racket]], [[extortion]], paying off local government and violent clashes with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwmr.org/mafia.htm ''Russian Mafia Shakes Down the Country''] by Steven R. Van Hook, ''Santa Barbara News-Press'', 20 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

After the assassinations of City Property Committee chairman and vice-Governor [[Mikhail Manevich]] (1997), [[State Duma]] deputy [[Galina Starovoytova]] (1998), acting City Legislature Speaker [[Viktor Novosyolov]] (1999) and a number of prominent businesspeople, Saint Petersburg was dubbed ''Capital of Crime'' in the Russian press.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, Nathaniel S.

''Newsweek International'', 15 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There were a number of movies filmed in Saint Petersburg about the life of crime, ''[[Bandit Petersburg]]'' and ''[[Brother (1997 film)|Brother]]'', reinforcing its image as the Crime Capital of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0394150/ |title="Banditskiy Peterburg: Advokat" (2000) |publisher=IMDb |date=27 February 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118767/ |title=Brat (1997) |publisher=IMDb |date=16 April 1998 |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official sources the number of crimes committed by foreigners in Saint Petersburg in 2010 increased by 11.1%. Law enforcement authorities consider this was associated with an increased number of people from some [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS republics]] who live in Saint Petersburg illegally.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.spb.ru/news7408.html |title=Crime preventing measures have made good results. – An official portal of the administration of St. Petersburg |publisher=Gov.spb.ru |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324052941/http://gov.spb.ru/news7408.html |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some media reported that in recent years there had been a notable increase in racially motivated violence, in particular towards [[International student|foreign students]].&lt;ref name="Racist"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/09/F799BAE9-D2BD-4994-AFEA-61DAD5A63BDD.html ''Russia: Racist Attacks Plague St. Petersburg''] [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] 30 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; One of the notable [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] groups, ''Belaya Energia'' (White Energy, inspired by US "[[White Power]]" groups) has reportedly been one of the gangs involved in murdering foreign university students.&lt;ref name="Racist"/&gt;

The official portal of the Government of Saint Petersburg provided data on significant improvements in the crime situation.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt; In particular, it was reported that the number of crimes against tourists had decreased by more than half during 2009–2011.

In 2012, Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs warned LGBT travellers about a vaguely worded law in Saint Petersburg that came into effect on 17 March 2012, making it a criminal offence to publicize acts of male or female homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgenderism. The intention of the law is to protect minors. A Russian travel advisory on the Foreign Affairs website notes that while homosexuality is legal in Russia (it was decriminalized in 1993), LGBT Canadian travellers should avoid "displaying affection in public, as homosexuals can be targets of violence.... Public actions (including dissemination of information, statements, displays or conspicuous behaviour) contradicting or appearing to contradict this law may lead to arrest, prosecution and the imposition of a fine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Postmedia News|title=Canada warns gay travellers to Russia on heels of law banning homosexual "propaganda"|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-warns-gay-travellers-to-russia-on-heels-of-law-banning-homosexual-propaganda|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=National Post|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''semis''' literally meaning half was a small Roman bronze coin that was valued at half an [[as (coin)|as]]. During the Roman Republic, the semis was distinguished by an 'S' (indicating semis) or 6 dots (indicating a theoretical weight of 6 [[Uncia (coin)|uncia]]). Some of the coins featured a bust of [[Saturn_(mythology)|Saturn]] on the obverse, and the prow of a ship on the reverse.

Initially a [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] coin, like the rest of Roman Republican bronzes, it began to be struck from dies shortly before the Second Punic War 218-201 BC.  The coin was issued infrequently during the Roman Empire, and ceased to be issued by the time of Hadrian 117-138 AD.

'''Sevdalinka''' ({{IPA-sh|seʋdǎliːŋka|pron}}) (also known as ''Sevdah'' music)  is a traditional [[Musical genre|genre]] of [[folk music]] from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Sevdalinka is an integral part of the [[Bosniak]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEHnuObu1D4C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=sevdalinka+bosnian+muslims&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QB-iUOavH8j64QTZwIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Women in the Ottoman Balkans: Gender, Culture and History, 2007, p 80.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93qZerStffMC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=sevdalinka+bosnian+muslims&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QB-iUOavH8j64QTZwIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Retuning Culture: Musical Changes in Central and Eastern Europe, 1996, p 123.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awgJ2LtnU6oC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=sevdalinka+bosniaks&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2x6iUM3PAamm4gTNz4HQAw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Manifold Identities: Studies on Music and Minorities, 2004, p 197.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML-aXrrBrv8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:hvj0wmuy2gYC&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyGiUO3OAq3T4QSQ34HYDg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&amp;q=Bosniak%20tradition&amp;f=false|title=World and its peoples: Western Balkans, 2009, p 1641.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://balkanist.net/story-sevdalinke-part-i-saz/ |title=The Story of Sevdalinke, Balkanist, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is also spread across the ex-[[Yugoslavia]] region, including [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]].  The actual composers of many Sevdalinka songs are largely unknown because these are traditional folk songs.

In a musical sense, Sevdalinka is characterized by a slow or moderate [[tempo]] and intense, emotional melodies. Sevdalinka songs are very elaborate, emotionally charged and are traditionally sung with [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] and fervor. The combination of Oriental, European and [[Sephardic]] elements make this type of music stand out among other types of folk music from the [[Balkans]]. Just like a majority of Balkan folk music, Sevdalinka features very somber, [[Minor mode|minor]]-sounding [[Mode (music)|modes]], but unlike other types of Balkan folklore music it more intensely features [[minor second]] intervals, thus hinting at Oriental [[makam]]s and the [[Phrygian mode]]. As a result, the melodies are noted for leaving a strong [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]] feeling with the listener.

The singer will often impose the [[rhythm]] and [[tempo]] of the song, both of which can vary throughout the song. Traditionally, Sevdalinka-s are women's songs, most addressing the issue of love and longing, unfulfilled and unfortunate love, some touch on a woman's physical desire for her loved one, and some have various comic elements. There are Sevdah songs written and sung by men as well. Traditionally, they were performed without any instrument, hence their elaborate melody. As with most old folk styles, it is pure assumption what the sound of original melodies were like, as in modern days their interpretations are fully aligned to the Western chromatic system due to instruments used for accompaniment (whereas Oriental modes often use intervals smaller than a [[semitone]]). Modern interpretations are followed by a small [[orchestra]] featuring the [[accordion]] (as the most prominent instrument), the [[violin]], nylon-string [[guitar]]s and/or other string instruments, occasionally (such as [[oud]], [[Bağlama|saz]] or [[šargija]]), the [[flute]] or [[clarinet]] (occasionally), upright [[bass guitar|bass]] and the [[snare drum]]. In modern interpretations, between the [[Verse (popular music)|verse]]s, an accordion or violin [[Solo (music)|solo]] can almost always be heard.

==Etymology==
The word itself comes from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''sevda'' which, in turn, derives from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''sawda'' (meaning ''[[black bile]]'', from the root s-w-d, "black"), which in earlier times was used by doctors to denote one of the [[four humors]] purported to control human feelings and emotions. In [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] sevda doesn't simply mean black bile; it also refers to a state of being in love, and more specifically to the intense and forlorn longing associated with love-sickness and unrequited love. This is connected with the related Persian word (سودازده) meaning both "melancholic" and "enamored".   It was these associations that came with the word when it was brought to Bosnia by the [[Ottoman empire|Ottomans]]. Today it is a richly evocative [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] word, meaning ''pining'' or a ''longing (for a loved one, a place, a time)'' that is both joyous and painful, being the main theme of Sevdalinka lyrics.

Thus the people of Bosnia employ the words "Sevdalinka" and "Sevdah" interchangeably as the name of this music, although the word ''Sevdah'' can also be used in other meanings. [[Saudade]], the central term in Portuguese [[Fado]], is of the same origin, likewise emerging from the Arabic language medical discourse used for centuries in both [[Al-Andalus]] and the Ottoman empire. N.B., the term [[Melancholia|melancholy]] is of similar origin, stemming from original Greek medical term for black bile - ''melan kholé''.

==Origins and history==
The origins of Sevdalinka are not known for certain, though it is known to date from sometime after the arrival of the [[Ottomans]] in the [[medieval]] [[Balkans]], but melodies and the venerable "Aman, aman" lyrical figure hint at strong [[Sephard]]ic and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] influence which can be explained by the arrival of Sephardic refugees in Ottoman Bosnia.

The first historically mentioned Sevdalinka is considered to be "''Bolest Muje Carevića''" (''The Illness of Mujo Carević''), which is believed to have been written around the year 1475. Another early written document that notes Sevdalinka was from the year 1574 when an Italian man was passing through the Bosnian city of [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]] and heard what he described as "sad songs sung by the locals" that made him feel [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=473636|title=Geologija pesme|publisher=Vreme|date=7 December 2006|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 16th century, a [[Duke]] from [[Split, Croatia|Split]] mentioned a song about the forbidden love of a Christian girl named Mara Vornić and a Muslim boy named [[Fadil]] or [[Adel (name)|Adel/Adil]] (accounts vary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.dw.de/bolje-da-ne-peva%C5%A1/a-16941264|title=Bolje da ne pevaš|publisher=dw.de|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, Bosniak poet [[Umihana Čuvidina]] contributed greatly to Sevdalinka with her poems about her lost love, which she sang.

==Performers==
A couple of significant singers of the Sevdalinka in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were [[Rešad Bešlagić]] and [[Vuka Šeherović]]. Towards the end of World War II, Radio Sarajevo was founded and signed some of the most prominent ''Sevdalije'' (Sevdalinka performers) among them were [[Zaim Imamović (musician)|Zaim Imamović]] in 1945, [[Himzo Polovina]] in 1953, [[Beba Selimović]] in 1954, [[Safet Isović]] in 1955 and [[Zehra Deović]] in 1960. [[Nada Mamula]] was signed to Radio Beograd in 1946. Others like [[Silvana Armenulić]], [[Emina Zečaj]], [[Hanka Paldum]] and [[Meho Puzić]] were signed to record for such production companies, as [[Jugoton]], [[Diskoton]] or other Yugoslav labels.

Although sung mainly by traditional [[Bosniak]] singers, the Sevdalinka made its way to many "mainstream" musicians. Sevdalinka-s were covered by [[Josipa Lisac]], [[Željko Bebek]], [[Ibrica Jusić]], [[Jadranka Stojaković]], [[Toše Proeski]], and [[Zdravko Čolić]].

In 1990s a band [[Mostar Sevdah Reunion]] was assembled in Mostar and in early 2000s they became widely popular on the ''[[world music]]'' scene, receiving high awards for their lively interpretations of Sevdalinka-s (that [[Fusion (music)|fuse]] Sevdalinka with contemporary musical styles like [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]] and [[funk]]) and introducing many people outside Bosnia to the genre of Sevdalinka. Equally popular today is [http://balkanist.net/story-of-sevdalinke-part-iii-the-music-today/ Amira Međunjanin] dubbed by music journalist and author Garth Wainwright "Bosnia's Billie Holiday."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6805">'''Sporoi''' ({{lang-el|Σπόροι}}) or '''Spori''' was according to Eastern Roman scholar [[Procopius]] (500–560) the old name of the [[Antes (people)|Antes]] and [[Sclaveni]], two [[Early Slav]]ic branches. Procopius stated that the Sclaveni and Antes [[Proto-Slavic|spoke the same language]], but he did not trace their common origin back to the [[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]] (as per Jordanes) but to a people he called "Sporoi".&lt;ref name=Barford-36&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Paul M. Barford|title=The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z9ItAtbJ5AC|date=January 2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-3977-3|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived the name from Greek {{lang|el|σπείρω}} ("I scatter grain"), because "they populated the land with scattered settlements".&lt;ref name=Hrushevskyi&gt;{{cite book|author1=Михайло Грушевський|author2=Andrzej Poppe|author3=Marta Skorupsky |author4=Uliana M.

Roman bureaucrat [[Jordanes]] wrote about the Slavs in his work ''[[Getica]]'' (551): "although they derive from one nation, now they are known under three names, the Veneti, Antes and Sclaveni" ({{lang|la|ab unastirpe exorti, tria nomina ediderunt, id est Veneti, Antes, Sclaveni}}); that is, the West Slavs, East Slavs, and South Slavs.&lt;ref name="Kmietowicz1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank A. Kmietowicz|title=Ancient Slavs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amTxAAAAMAAJ|year=1976|publisher=Worzalla Publishing Company|quote=Jordanes left no doubt that the Antes were of Slavic origin, when he wrote: 'ab unastirpe exorti, tria nomina ediderunt, id est Veneti, Antes, Sclaveni' (although they derive from one nation, now they are known under three names, the Veneti , Antes and Sclaveni). The Veneti were the West Slavs, the Antes thf; Fast Slavs and the_Srlaveni, the South or Balkan Slavs.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the Veneti were the ancestors of the Sclaveni and the Antes, the two having used to be called ''Veneti'' but are now "chiefly" called Sclaveni and Antes.&lt;ref&gt;Getica 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Studies==
*According to Bohemian historian [[Josef Dobrovský]] (1753–1829) and Slovak historian [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] (1795–1861), the name "Sporoi" was a corruption of ''Srbi'' ([[Serbs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B. Bury|title=History of the Later Roman Empire, Vol. 2: From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5c-uJvg3eJsC&amp;pg=PA295|date=23 April 2013|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-14339-2|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Šafárik deemed that it was the oldest generic name of the Slavs.&lt;ref name="institute1879"&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal anthropological institute|title=The Journal of the Anthropological institute|volume=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqIEAAAAQAAJ|year=1879|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to English ethnologist [[James Cowles Prichard]], writing in 1841, it was "an erraneous orthography of ''Sorbi'', a name common to several tribes of the Slavonian family", and that they were called so "because they were scattered over the country in cabins separated from each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=James Cowles Prichard|title=Ethnography of Europe. 3d ed. 1841|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BQaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA406|year=1841|publisher=Houlston &amp; Stoneman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ukrainian historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]] (1866–1934) noted the scholarly view on the matter: Procopius' etymology was rejected as mistaken, and many scholars linked the term with the Serbs; some sought a connection to [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Serboi]], but "these Serboi lived far to the east, in the [[Volga]] region". He noted that the Slavic Serbs appear in historical records in the 9th century, and ''Serbs'' may have had a broader sense suggested by two completely distinct Slavic peoples (Balkan Serbs and [[Lusatian Sorbs]]), however, according to him, identical names occurred frequently among the Slavs and the "[Early] Slavs may not even have had their own common name to designate nationality. Such names often emerged only with time.".&lt;ref name=Hrushevskyi/&gt;
*According to Czech historian [[Francis Dvornik]] (1893–1975), the Sporoi were probably the ''[[Spali]]'' mentioned by [[Jordanes]] ({{floruit}} 551) and ''Spalei'' mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] ({{floruit}} 77–79).&lt;ref name="Dvorník1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Dvorník|title=The making of central and Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QEXAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Academic International Press|isbn=978-0-87569-023-0|pages=277–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the North American Society for Serbian Studies, rather than connecting the ethnonym to the poorly known Spali, it was more likely, as per the old view, a Greek rendering of the name Sorpoi/Sorboi – connected to the Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Serbian Studies|volume=2|issue=1-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOcVAQAAMAAJ|year=1982|publisher=North American Society for Serbian Studies|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to British archaeologist [http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n2001038535/ Paul M. Barford], writing in 2001, it most likely derived from the [[Proto-Slavic]] word for "multitude" (cf. e.g. ''[[wikt:sporo#Polish|sporo]]'').&lt;ref name=Barford-36/&gt;
*A connection has also been made with the ''[[Zeriuani]]'' mentioned by the 9th-century [[Bavarian Geographer]].&lt;ref name="Cross1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Hazzard Cross|title=Slavic civilization through the ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9RmAAAAMAAJ|year=1963|publisher=Russell &amp; Russell|page=6|quote=Zeruiani}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that the Zeriuani "which is so great a realm that from it, as their tradition relates, all the tribes of the Slavs are sprung and trace their origin" (Zeriuani tantum est reguum, utex eo cunctae gentes Sclavorum exortae sint, et originem, sicut affirmant, ducant).&lt;ref name="Cross1963"/&gt; In turn, that ethnonym is also commonly conntected to Serbs and Sorbs, and more recently, Severians.

'''Stjepan Krasić''' ({{IPA-hr|stjêpaːn krásit͡ɕ|pron}}) (6 October 1938) is Croatian [[historian]], [[theologian]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[friar]] of the [[Order of Preachers]], member of the [[Croatian Dominican Province]]&lt;ref name="ENC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Krasić, Stjepan|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=33752|website=enciklopedija.hr|publisher=Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the International Academy of Engineering.&lt;ref name="OPORG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fr Stjepan Krasic has been elected as a member of the International Academy of Engineering|url=http://www.op.org/en/content/fr-stjepan-krasic-has-been-elected-member-international-academy-engineering|website=op.org|publisher=Order of Preachers|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Stjepan Krasić was born in [[Čitluk]],  in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (present [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) to Ivan and Luce née Pervan. In Čitluk he attended elementary school and from 1950 to 1957 continued his education in the Classical Grammar School in [[Bol, Croatia|Bol]]. After serving a military service, from 1960 he studied philosophy in [[Dubrovnik]] and theology in [[Zagreb]] and at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]] in [[Rome]]. The study of history Krasić attended at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]].&lt;ref name="ENC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DKK&gt;{{cite web|title=Stjepan Krasić|url=http://www.danikrscanskekulture.info/sudionik.php?id=205|website=danikrscanskekulture.info|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific vocation ==
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
In addition to the theological study, Krasić also attended the Vatican school of Palaeography, Diplomatics and Archive Administration. Krasić received his first doctorate at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas making a historical dissertation on the subject of the [[Croatian Dominican Province#Dubrovnik Congregation|Dominican Congregation of Dubrovnik]] in 1970. In 1985 Krasić received a doctorate in the field of history by dissertation about [[Stjepan Gradić]]. His professorship  Krasić started as a research assistant in 1973 at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Ten years later he became a full professor teaching history and methodology of scientific work.

In the book ''General University of the Dominican Order in Zadar or ''Universitas Jadertina'' 1396 - 1807'' published in 1996 Krasić discovered that in [[Zadar]] the first Croatian university was founded in 1396.  It had faculties of philosophy and theology with the privilege of giving the highest academic titles of baccalaureate and doctorate. His work had a great scientific and cultural importance for the Croatian society. Until then, the University of Zagreb founded in 1669 was considered the oldest in Croatia. Based on that discovery the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 2003 awarded the title of the University to the Faculty of Humanities in Zadar.

In october 2015, Krasic has been unanimously elected as a member of the International Academy of Engineering because of his distinguished studies in the Humanities which has uncovered many hitherto unknown aspects of the history of engineering and technology.&lt;ref name="OPORG"/&gt;

Solar eclipses are impossible at Passover.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomy: The Solar System and Beyond'' by Michael A. Seeds, Dana Backman, 2009 {{ISBN|0-495-56203-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Thallus''' ({{lang-el|Θαλλός}}) was an early [[historian]] who wrote in [[Koine Greek]]. He wrote a three-volume history of the [[Mediterranean]] world from before the [[Trojan War]] to the 167th Olympiad, c. 112-109 BC. Most of his work, like the vast majority of ancient literature, has been lost, although some of his writings were quoted by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] in his ''History of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 19–20  [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;q=%22the+eclipse%22+%22earliest+possible%22+Thallos&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai= Google Link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Africanus, in Syncellus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Garstad, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBLtIGhU9UYC&amp;pg=PA207 "Theophilus of Antioch, Pseudo-Justin and Thallus' treatment of Moses"] Studia Patristica XXXVI, 207 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works are considered important by some Christians because they believe them to confirm the [[historicity of Jesus]] and provide non-Christian validation of the [[Gospel]] accounts: a reference to a historical eclipse, attributed to Thallus, has been taken as a mention of the darkness described in the [[Synoptic gospels]] account of the death of Jesus, although an eclipse could not have taken place during Passover when this took place.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Levine, D. C. Allison &amp; J. D.

==The fragments of Thallus==
# There are fragments from the 3 books of Thallus, in which he made a summary in abbreviated fashion from the sack of [[Troy]] to the 167th Olympiad [''i.e.'' 109 BC] ([[Eusebius]], ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'', I. K125.2)
# [[Castor of Rhodes|Castor]] and Thallus [recorded] [[Syrian]] events. (Africanus, in Eusebius, PE X.10)
# The archives of the most ancient races—the Egyptians, Chaldaeans, and Phoenicians—need to be opened, and their citizens must be called upon, through whom knowledge must be provided—a certain Manetho the Egyptian and Berosus the [[Babylon|Chaldaean]], but also Jerome the Phoenician king of Tyre; and their followers, too: Ptolemy the Mendesian and Menander the Ephesian and Demetrius the Phalerean and king Juba and Apion and Thallus and the one who either proves or refutes these men, Josephus the Jew. ([[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticum'' 19)
# On the whole world there pressed a fearful darkness, and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. Thallos calls this darkness an eclipse of the sun in the third book of histories, without reason it seems to me. (Africanus, in Syncellus)
# For Thallus also remembers Belus the ruler of Assyria and Cronos the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], asserting that Belus waged war along with the Titans against Zeus and the select gods who were with him, stating at this point: 'and defeated, Ogygus fled to Tartessus. While at that time that region was famous as Akte, now it is called Attica, which Ogygus then took over.' (Theophilus, Ad Autolycum 3.29)
# For according to the history of Thallus, we find that Belus was born 322 years prior to the Trojan War. ([[Lactantius]], ''Divine Institutions'' I.23)
# And so ... neither Diodorus the Greek nor Thallus, neither [[Cassius Severus]] nor [[Cornelius Nepos]], nor any commentator on such ancient matters, prints that Saturn was anything but a man. (Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 10).
# Therefore, not only all poets, but even all historians and all writers on ancient matters, who have published for posterity his deeds done in Italy, agree he was a man: in Greek, Diodorus and Thallus, and in Latin, Nepos and Cassius and Varro. (Lactantius Div. Int. I.13).
# All writers of Greek and Roman antiquities tell us that Saturn, the first of his kind, was a man: Nepos knows this, and Cassius in history, as well as Thallus and Diodorus, say this.  (Minucius Felix 21)
# Regarding the events before the Olympiads, consider how the Attic chronologers reckon: from the time of Ogygus, during whose tenure the first great flood occurred in Attica, while Phoroneus was ruling the Argives, as Acusilaus records, up to the time of the first year of the first Olympiad, the point after which the Greeks consider time to be reckoned more accurately, 1020 years passed, which agrees with those mentioned earlier and with those who were listed in order. For the writers on Athenian history, Hellanicus and Philochorus (who wrote ''Atthis'') and writers on Syrian affairs, Castor and Thallus, and writers on world affairs, Diodorus (who wrote the ''Library'') and Alexander Polyhistor, and some of our contemporaries record these events even more accurately than all the Attic historians. (Africanus, in Eusebius PE X.10)
# So know this: of all those among us [the Jews] happen to be more ancient than many: [for instance] ... Moses ... as is clear to us in the histories of the Greeks. ... For in the times of Ogygus and Inachus ... they record Moses ... so does Polemon in his first book of history of the Greeks, and Apion ... and Ptolemaeus the Mendesian, who wrote a history of Egypt, all these men agree. And the writers on Athenian history, Hellanicus and Philochorus (who wrote Atthis), Castor and Thallus and Alexander Polyhistor, and also those most wise of men, Philo and Josephus ... [all these men] mention Moses, as they do the very old and ancient origin of the Jews. (Justin, Cohortatio 9)
# 41 Assyrian kings ruled the kingdom of the Arabs, who also ruled from the [?] year of the world to the [?] year of the world, enduring all of [?] years from the first of them, Belus, until the 41st king, Macoscolerus, the son of Sardanapallus, as most noted historians agree, including Polybius, Diodorus, Cephalion, Castor, Thallus and others. (Syncellus)
# After the 70th year of the captivity, Cyrus was king of the Persians in the first year of the 55th Olympiad, as we find in the Library of Diodorus and the Histories of Thallus and Castor, and also in the works of Polybius and Phlegon, but also in those of others who concern themselves with Olympiads: they are all in agreement about the date. (Africanus, in Eusebius PE X.10)
# Those most wise men, Thallus, Castor [259 F 11], and Polybius [254 F 4]...and among others, Herodotus...and the wise Theophilus, all recorded the chronology of the reign of Croesus. (John Malalas VI).

==Commentary==
Thallus is sometimes cited for details on [[Syria]]n and [[Assyria]]n [[history]].  [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in a list of sources mentions his work:

::From the three books of Thallus, in which he collects (events) briefly from the fall of Ilion to the 167th Olympiad.&lt;ref name=Petermann&gt;H. Petermann, col. 265; Karst, ''Eusebius Werke''.&lt;/ref&gt;

However the text is preserved in an Armenian translation where many of the numerals are corrupt.  The fall of Troy is 1184 BC, but the editors, Petermann and Karst, highlight that the end-date of the 167th Olympiad (109 BC) is contradicted by [[George Syncellus]], who quotes [[Julius Africanus]], and suggest that the end-date should read "217th Olympiad", a change of one character in Armenian.

Thallus is first mentioned around AD 180 by [[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]] Bishop of [[Antioch]] in his ''Ad Autolycum'' ('To Autolycus') 3.29:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thallus makes mention of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], the King of the [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Cronus]] the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]; and says that Belus, with the Titans, made war against [[Zeus]] and his compeers, who are called gods. He says, moreover, that Gygus was smitten, and fled to [[Tartessus]]. At that time Gygus ruled over that country, which was then called Acte, but is now named [[Attica]]. And whence the other countries and cities derived their names, we think it unnecessary to recount, especially to you who are acquainted with history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Ho gygos'' 'that Gygus' is probably an error for ''Ogygos'', referring to the [[Ogygus]] associated by chronographers with [[Attica]]. See [[Kings of Athens]].

==Thallus and Josephus==
The name Thallus is too common to make a probable identification with any other known Thallus.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The identification sometimes made with a certain Thallus of Samaria who is mentioned in some editions of [[Josephus]]' ''Antiquities'' (18.167) fails because that name only appears in those editions because of an idiosyncratic alteration of the text by [[John Hudson (classicist)|John Hudson]] in 1720. Until Hudson's time all texts had &lt;small&gt;ALLOS&lt;/small&gt; (meaning "another") not &lt;small&gt;THALLOS&lt;/small&gt;. See the external link below to [[Felix Jacoby|Jacoby]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller|Müller]].

==Early Christian use of Thallus==
The 9th-century Christian chronologer [[George Syncellus]] cites [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] as writing in reference to the darkness mentioned in the synoptic gospels as occurring at the death of [[Jesus]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julius Africanus - Extant Writings, Fragment XVIII|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0614.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his 'History', calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Africanus then goes on to point out that an eclipse cannot occur at [[Passover]] when the moon is full and therefore diametrically opposite the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorst|first1=Robert E. Van|title=Jesus Outside the New Testament : An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence|date=2000|publisher=Eerdmans|isbn=0802843689|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius (fourth century) mentions a history of Thallus in three books that according to an Armenian translation of Eusebius ranged from the sack of Troy to the 167th Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;http://rbedrosian.com/euseb14.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that the reason Africanus doubted the eclipse is because Easter happens near the full moon and a solar eclipse would have been impossible at that time, as was well known. Compounding the matter is the Armenian translation of Eusebius has many corrupt numerals and so many apologists claim that 167th Olympiad (or 109 BCE) should really be 217th Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden E., ''The Chronicle of Eusebius and Greek Chronographic Tradition'' Bucknell University Press (Lewisburg, PA: 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''''' (published as '''''Holy Blood, Holy Grail''''' in the United States) is a book by [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] and [[Henry Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Baigent |authorlink1=Michael Baigent |first2=Richard |last2=Leigh |authorlink2=Richard Leigh (author) |first3=Henry |last3=Lincoln |authorlink3=Henry Lincoln |title=The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail |location=London |publisher=Jonathan Cape |year=1982 |isbn=0-224-01735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was first published in 1982 by [[Jonathan Cape]] in London as an unofficial follow-up to three [[BBC Two]] TV documentaries that were part of the ''[[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]]'' series. The [[paperback]] version was first published in 1983 by Corgi books. A sequel to the book, called '' [[Priory of Sion#The Messianic Legacy|The Messianic Legacy]]'',&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1986"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Baigent |first2=Richard |last2=Leigh |first3=Henry |last3=Lincoln |title=The Messianic Legacy |location=London |publisher=Jonathan Cape |year=1986 |isbn=0-224-02185-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally published in 1986. The original work was reissued in an illustrated hardcover version with new material in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Published by Century, part of The Random House Group Limited. {{ISBN|1-84413-840-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', the authors put forward a hypothesis that the [[historical Jesus]] married [[Mary Magdalene]], had one or more children, and that [[Jesus bloodline|those children or their descendants]] emigrated to what is now [[southern France]]. Once there, they intermarried with the [[nobility|noble families]] that would eventually become the [[Merovingian dynasty]], whose special claim to the throne of France is championed today by a [[secret society]] called the [[Priory of Sion]]. They concluded that the legendary [[Holy Grail]] is simultaneously the womb of Mary Magdalene and the sacred [[royal descent|royal bloodline]] she gave birth to.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1552009.shtml |title=The Secret of the Priory of Sion |series=[[60 Minutes]] |date=30 April 2006 |people=Ed Bradley (presenter); Jeanne Langley (producer) |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international [[bestseller]] upon its release, ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' spurred interest in a number of ideas related to its central thesis. Response from professional historians and scholars from related fields was negative. They argued that the bulk of the claims, ancient mysteries, and [[conspiracy theories]] presented as facts are [[pseudohistorical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Damian |last=Thompson |title=[[Counterknowledge|Counterknowledge.

In a 1982 review of the book for ''[[The Observer]]'', novelist and literary critic [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote:  "It is typical of my unregenerable soul that I can only see this as a marvellous theme for a novel." Indeed, the theme was later used by [[Margaret Starbird]] in her 1993 book ''[[The Woman with the Alabaster Jar]]'', and by [[Dan Brown]] in his 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref name="Brown 2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=Dan |last=Brown |authorlink=Dan Brown |title=[[The Da Vinci Code]] |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-385-50420-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Dan Brown from [[NBC Today]], 3 June 2003: "Robert Langdon is fictional, but all of the art, architecture, secret rituals, secret societies, all of that is historical fact" (found in {{cite book |first1=Carl E. |last1=Olson |authorlink1=Carl E.

== Background ==
One of the books that the authors claim influenced the project was ''L'Or de Rennes'' (later re-published as ''Le Trésor Maudit''), a 1967 book by [[Gérard de Sède]], with the collaboration of [[Pierre Plantard]].&lt;ref&gt;Plantard de Saint-Clair, Pierre, ''L'Or de Rennes, mise au point'' (La Garenne-Colombes, 35 bis, Bd de la République, 92250; Bibliothèque Nationale, Depot Legal 02-03-1979, 4° Z Piece 1182).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean-Luc |last=Chaumeil |title=Rennes-le-Château – Gisors – Le Testament du Prieuré de Sion (Le Crépuscule d'une Ténébreuse Affaire) |publisher=Editions Pégase |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reading it, Henry Lincoln persuaded [[BBC Two]]'s factual television series of the 1970s, ''[[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]]'', to make a series of documentaries, which became quite popular and generated thousands of responses. Lincoln then joined forces with Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh for further research. This led them to the pseudohistorical ''[[Dossiers Secrets]]'' at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] which, though alleging to portray hundreds of years of medieval history, were actually all written by [[Pierre Plantard]] and [[Philippe de Chérisey]] under the pseudonym of "Philippe Toscan du Plantier". Unaware that the documents had been forged, Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln used them as a major source for their book.

Comparing themselves to the reporters who uncovered the [[Watergate scandal]], the authors maintain that only through speculative "synthesis can one discern the underlying continuity, the unified and coherent fabric, which lies at the core of any historical problem." To do so, one must realize that "it is not sufficient to confine oneself exclusively to facts."&lt;ref name="Miller2004"/&gt;

==Content==
In ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln posit the existence of a [[secret society]] known as the [[Priory of Sion]], which is supposed to have a long history starting in 1099 and had illustrious [[Priory of Sion#Alleged Grand Masters|Grand Masters]] including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. According to the authors' claims, the Priory of Sion is devoted to installing the [[Merovingian dynasty]], which ruled the [[Franks]] from 457 to 751, on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe. It is also said to have created the [[Knights Templar]] as its military arm and financial branch.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Damian |title=How Da Vinci Code tapped pseudo-fact hunger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575347/How-Da-Vinci-Code-tapped-pseudo-fact-hunger.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=31 July 2015 |location=London |date=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors re-interpreted the ''Dossiers Secrets'' "in the light of their own Biblical obsessions."&lt;ref name="Trial 2005"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Conspiracies On Trial: The Da Vinci Code |publisher=The Discovery Channel |date=10 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Plantard's initial [[French Israelism|Franco-Israelist]] claim that the Merovingians were only descended from the [[Tribe of Benjamin]],&lt;ref name="Pierre Jarnac 1994"&gt;{{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Jarnac |title=Les Mystères de Rennes-le-Château: Mèlange Sulfureux |publisher=CERT |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; they asserted that the Priory of Sion protects Merovingian [[dynast]]s because they are the lineal [[Jesus bloodline|descendants of the historical Jesus]] and his alleged wife, [[Mary Magdalene]], traced further back to King [[David]]. According to them, the legendary [[Holy Grail]] is simultaneously the womb of [[saint]] Mary Magdalene and the sacred [[royal descent|royal bloodline]] she gave birth to, and the Church tried to kill off all remnants of this bloodline and their supposed guardians, the [[Cathars]] and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], in order for [[popes]] to hold the [[episcopal throne]] through the [[apostolic succession]] of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] without fear of it ever being [[usurper|usurped]] by an [[antipope]] from the [[primogeniture|hereditary succession]] of Mary Magdalene.

The authors therefore concluded that the modern goals of the Priory of Sion are:
*the public revelation of the tomb and shrine of [[Sigebert IV]] as well as the [[Arch of Titus#Significance in Jewish history|lost treasure]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], which supposedly contains genealogical records that prove the Merovingian dynasty was of the [[Davidic line]], to facilitate Merovingian restoration in France; 
*the re-institutionalization of [[chivalry]] and the promotion of [[pan-European nationalism]];
*the establishment of a [[theocracy|theocratic]] "[[United States of Europe]]": a Holy European Empire politically and religiously unified through the [[imperial cult]] of a Merovingian [[Great Catholic Monarch|Great Monarch]] who occupies both the throne of Europe and the [[Holy See]]; and
*the actual governance of Europe residing with the Priory of Sion through a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[European Parliament]].

The authors also incorporated the [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] tract known as ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' into their story, concluding that it was actually based on the master plan of the Priory of Sion. They presented it as the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the Priory of Sion by arguing that the original text on which the published version of ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' was based had nothing to do with [[Judaism]] or an "[[List of conspiracy theories#Jewish world domination|international Jewish conspiracy]]", as it issued from a [[Masonic body]] practicing the [[Scottish Rite]] which incorporated the word "[[Zion]]" in its name. Per Baigent ''et al'', the text was not intended to be released publicly, but was a program for gaining control of [[Freemasonry]] as part of a strategy to infiltrate and reorganise church and state according to [[esoteric Christian]] principles. After a failed attempt to gain influence in the court of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], [[Sergei Nilus]] was supposed to have changed the original text to forge an inflammatory tract in 1903 in order to discredit the esoteric clique around [[Papus]] by implying they were [[Judaeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judaeo-Masonic conspirators]], but he ignored some esoteric Christian elements, which hence remained unchanged in the published [[antisemitic canard]].

==Influence and similarities==

===''The Da Vinci Code''===
The 2003 [[conspiracy fiction]] novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]] makes reference to this book, also liberally using most of the above claims as key plot elements;&lt;ref name="Brown 2003"/&gt; indeed, in 2005 Baigent and Leigh unsuccessfully sued Brown's publisher, [[Random House]], for [[plagiarism]], on the grounds that Brown's book makes extensive use of their research and that one of the characters is named Leigh, has a surname (Teabing) which is an [[anagram]] of Baigent, and has a physical description strongly resembling Henry Lincoln. In his novel, Brown also mentions ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' as an acclaimed international bestseller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Brown |title=[[The Da Vinci Code]] |date=2003}} Chapter 60&lt;/ref&gt; and claims it as the major contributor to his hypothesis. Perhaps as a result of this mention, the authors (minus Henry Lincoln) of ''Holy Blood'' sued Dan Brown for copyright infringement. They claimed that the central framework of their plot had been stolen for the writing of ''The Da Vinci Code.'' The claim was overturned by [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] Judge [[Peter Smith (judge)|Peter Smith]] on April 6, 2006, who ruled that "their argument was vague and shifted course during the trial and was always based on a weak foundation." It was found that the publicity of the trial had significantly boosted sales of ''Holy Blood'' (according to figures provided by [[Nielsen BookScan]] and [[The Bookseller|Bookseller magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aQVP7b.oSjXQ&amp;refer=culture |title=Da Vinci Code' Lawsuit Lifts Sales Before Judgment |website=Bloomberg News |date=6 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The court ruled that, in effect, because it was published as a work of (alleged) history, its premises legally could be freely interpreted in any subsequent fictional work without any copyright infringement.

===Other influences===
*[[Robert Anton Wilson]]’s 1985''[[The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles]]'' novel ''The Widow’s Son'' elaborates on the "holy bloodline" theory by identifying Jesus and Mary Madeline as the bridegroom and bride in ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|The Alchemical Marriage of Christian Rosycross]]'' and Merovech as the titular [[Hiram Abiff|Widow’s Son]] from [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lore and positing that the entire bloodline is descended from [[alien-human hybrid]]s&lt;ref&gt;''The Widow's Son'', Robert Anton Wilson, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1988 novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]] mentions the Jesus and Mary Magdalene hypothesis in passing (a quote from the book is one of the chapter headings). However, Eco, a [[secular humanist]], takes a negative stance on such [[conspiracy theories]]. ''Foucault's Pendulum'' was a strong debunking of themes found in ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' through the medium of satire.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*The 1996 video game ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]]'' references the book in dialogue when the player asks what a character knows of the Templars.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
*The 2008 documentary film ''[[Bloodline (2008 film)|Bloodline]]'' by [[Bruce Burgess]], a filmmaker with an interest in [[paranormal]] claims, expands on the "Jesus bloodline" hypothesis and other elements of ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''. Accepting as valid the testimony of an amateur archaeologist codenamed "Ben Hammott" relating to his discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims to have found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: several mummified corpses (one of which is allegedly [[Mary Magdalene]]) in three underground tombs created by the Knights Templar under the orders of the Priory of Sion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tomb-discovered-in-france-considered-knights-templar---when-excavated-findings-may-challenge-the-tenets-of-christianity-57449477.html |title=Tomb Discovered in France Considered Knights Templar - When Excavated, Findings May Challenge the Tenets of Christianity |work=[[PR Newswire]] |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grailseekers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/picture-of-ben-hammotts-tomb-last-night.html |title=Ben Hammott Discusses the Bloodline Tomb Hoax |first=Brian |last=Kannard  |work=Grail Seekers |date=22 March 2012 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html |title=Statement by Ben Hammott |work=benhammott.com |year=2012 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The claims made in ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' have been the source of much investigation and criticism over the years, with many independent investigators such as ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Channel 4]]'', ''[[Discovery Channel]]'', ''[[Time Magazine]]'', and the [[BBC]] concluding that many of the book's claims are not credible or verifiable.

Pierre Plantard stated on the Jacques Pradel radio interview on 'France-Inter', 18 February 1982:{{cquote|I admit that 'The Sacred Enigma' (French title for 'The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail') is a good book, but one must say that there is a part that owes more to fiction than to fact, especially in the part that deals with the lineage of Jesus. How can you prove a lineage of four centuries from Jesus to the Merovingians? I have never put myself forward as a descendant of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by {{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=de Cherisey |title=Jesus Christ, his wife and the Merovingians |journal=Nostra - Bizarre News |number=584 |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are no references to the [[Jesus bloodline]] in the "[[Priory of Sion]] documents" and the link exists only within the context of a hypothesis made by the authors of ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''. From the ''Conspiracies On Trial: The Da Vinci Code'' documentary:{{cquote|The authors of the 1980s bestseller ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' re-interpreted the Dossiers in the light of their own Biblical obsessions – the secret buried in the documents ceased to be the Merovingian bloodline and became the bloodline of Christ – the genealogies led to Christ's descendants.&lt;ref name="Trial 2005"/&gt;}}

While Pierre Plantard claimed that the Merovingians were descended from the [[Tribe of Benjamin]],&lt;ref name="Pierre Jarnac 1994"/&gt; the Jesus bloodline hypothesis found in ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' instead hypothesized that the  Merovingians were descended from the [[Davidic line]] of the [[Tribe of Judah]].

Historian [[Marina Warner]] commented on ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' when it was first published:
{{cquote|Of course there's not much harm in thinking that Jesus was married (nor are these authors the first to suggest it), or that his descendants were King Pippin and Charles Martel. But there is harm in strings of lurid falsehoods and distorted reasoning. The method bends the mind the wrong way, an insidious and real corruption.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 18 January 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prominent British historian [[Richard Barber]], wrote:
{{cquote|The Templar-Grail myth… is at the heart of the most notorious of all the Grail pseudo-histories, ''The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail'', which is a classic example of the conspiracy theory of history…  It is essentially a text which proceeds by innuendo, not by refutable scholarly debate…  Essentially, the whole argument is an ingeniously constructed series of suppositions combined with forced readings of such tangible facts as are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Barber |title=The Holy Grail, The History of a Legend |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |year=2005 |isbn=9780140267655}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2005, [[Tony Robinson]] narrated a critical evaluation of the main arguments of Dan Brown and those of Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln, ''The Real Da Vinci Code'', shown on [[Channel 4]]. The programme featured lengthy interviews with many of the protagonists. Arnaud de Sède, son of [[Gérard de Sède]], stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of a 1,000-year-old [[Priory of Sion]], and described the story as "piffle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=The Real Da Vinci Code |publisher=Channel Four Television |people=[[Tony Robinson]] (presenter) |date=3 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme concluded that, in the opinion of the presenter and researchers, the claims of ''Holy Blood'' were based on little more than a series of guesses.

The [[Priory of Sion#Myth|Priory of Sion myth]] was exhaustively [[debunking|debunked]] by journalists and scholars as one of the great [[hoax]]es of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Some writers have expressed concern that the proliferation and popularity of books, websites and films inspired by this hoax have contributed to the problem of [[List of conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]], [[pseudohistory]] and other confusions becoming more [[mainstream]].&lt;ref name="Thompson 13/01/2008"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Damian |title=How Da Vinci Code tapped pseudo-fact hunger |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/12/nrfact212.xml| accessdate=28 March 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | date=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are troubled by the [[romanticism|romantic]] [[reactionary]] ideology unwittingly promoted in these works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/3461 |title=The Da Vinci Protocols: Jews Should Worry About Dan Brown's Success |first=David |last=Klinghoffer |authorlink=David Klinghoffer |journal=[[National Review]] |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Ken Mondschein ridiculed the idea of a Jesus bloodline, writing:

{{cquote|The idea of keeping the family tree pruned to bonsai-like proportions is also completely fallacious. Infant mortality in pre-modern times was ridiculously high, and you'd only need one childhood accident or disease in 2000 years to wipe out the bloodline; if, however, even one extra sibling per generation survived to reproduce, the numbers of descendants would increase at an exponential rate; keep the children of Christ marrying each other, on the other hand, and eventually they'd be so inbred that the sons of God would have flippers for feet.}}

Quoting [[Robert McCrum]], literary editor of ''The Observer'' newspaper, about ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'':
{{cquote|There is something called historical evidence – there is something called the [[historical method]] – and if you look around the shelves of bookshops there is a lot of history being published, and people mistake this type of history for the real thing. These kinds of books do appeal to an enormous audience who believe them to be 'history', but actually they aren't history, they are a kind of parody of history. Alas, though, I think that one has to say that this is the direction that history is going today…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=The History of a Mystery |series=[[Timewatch]] |publisher=[[BBC Two]] |date=17 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1364, King [[Casimir III of Poland|Kazimierz the Great]] founded the [[Cracow Academy]], which would become one of the great universities of Europe. The Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://uatacz.up.krakow.pl/~wwwchemia/pliki/ISBN_978_83_7271_768_9_From_alchemy_to_the_present_day|title=From alchemy to the present day - the choice of biographies of Polish scientists|last=Nodzyńska|first=Małgorzata|last2=Cieśla|first2=Paweł|publisher=Pedagogical University of Kraków|year=2012|isbn=978-83-7271-768-9|location=Cracow|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of famous scientists in Poland begins in earnest with the [[polymath]], [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]] [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who formulated the heliocentric theory and made an important contribution to the scientific revolution.

In 1773 King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] established the '''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej|Commission of National Education]]''', the world's first ministry of education.

After the [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]], in 1795, no Polish state existed. The 19th and 20th centuries saw many Polish scientists working abroad. One of them was [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]], a physicist and chemist living in France. Another noteworthy one was [[Ignacy Domeyko]], a geologist and mineralogist who worked in Chile.

In the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a flourishing center of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] (with [[Stefan Banach]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Stanisław Ulam]]) and [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]] (with [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]]). The events of [[World War II]] pushed many of them into exile. Such was the case of [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], whose family left Poland when he was still a child. An alumnus of the Warsaw School of Mathematics was [[Antoni Zygmund]], one of the shapers of  20th-century [[mathematical analysis]]. According to [[NASA]], Polish scientists were among the pioneers of [[rocket]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/A_Pictorial_History_of_Rockets.html|title=A Pictorial History of Rockets|last=|first=|publisher=NASA|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Poland has over 100 institutions of post-secondary education — technical, medical, economic, as well as [[List of universities in Poland|500 universities]] — which are located in most major cities such as [[Gdańsk]], [[Kraków]], [[Lublin]], [[Łódź]], [[Poznań]], [[Rzeszów]] and [[Warsaw]].  They employ over 61,000 scientists and scholars.  Another 300 research and development institutes are home to some 10,000 researchers. There are, in addition, a number of smaller laboratories.  All together, these institutions support some 91,000 scientists and scholars.{{TOC right}}

[[File:Noahsworld map Version2.png|thumb|340px|'''Red:''' Son of Japhet, '''Yellow:''' Son of Ham. '''Blue:''' Son of Shem]]

'''Togarmah''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: תֹּגַרְמָה) is a figure in the "table of nations" in [[Genesis 10]], the list of descendants of [[Noah]] that represents the peoples known to the [[Hebrew people|ancient Hebrews]]. Togarmah is among the descendants of [[Japheth]] and is thought to represent some people located in [[Anatolia]]. Medieval traditions variously claimed Togarmah as the mythical ancestor of peoples in the [[Caucasus]] and western Asia, including the [[Georgians]], the [[Armenians]] and some [[Turkic peoples]] (i.e. [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuzes]], [[Khazars]] and [[Bulgars]]).

== Biblical attestations and historical geography ==
Togarmah is listed in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|10:3|31}} as the third son of [[Gomer]], and grandson of [[Japheth]], brother of [[Ashkenaz]] and [[Riphath]]. The name is again mentioned in the book of [[Ezekiel]] as a nation from the "far north". {{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|38:6}} mentions Togarmah together with Tubal as supplying soldiers to the army of [[Gog and Magog|Gog]]. {{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|27:14}} mentions Togarmah together with Tubal, Javan and Meshech as supplying horses to the [[Tyrians]].

Most scholars identify Togarmah with the capital city called [[Tegarama]] by the Hittites and Til-Garimmu by the Assyrians.&lt;ref name="Block1998"&gt;"Gen. 10:3 identifies Togarmah (along with Ashkenaz and Riphath) as the son of Gomer and the nephew of Javan, Meshech, and Tubal. Most scholars equate the name with the capital of Kammanu (Kummanni), known in Hittite texts as ''Tegarama'', in Akkadian as ''Til-garimmu'', and in classical sources as Gauraen (modern Gurun)." {{cite book|author=Daniel I. Block|title=The Book of Ezekiel, Chapters 25 48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYemhagtCpgC&amp;pg=PA73|date=19 June 1998|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2536-0|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; O.R. Gurney placed Tegarama in Southeast Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;map on inside cover of Gurney, The Hittites, Folio Society edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later traditions===
Several later ethnological traditions have claimed Togarmah as the mythical ancestor of various peoples located in western Asia and the Caucasus. Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (37 – c. 100 AD) and the Christian theologians [[Jerome]] (c. 347 – 420 AD) and [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560 – 636 AD) regarded Togarmah as the father of the [[Phrygians]]. Several ancient Christian authors, including Saint [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] (c. 170-c. 236 AD), [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (c. 263 – c. 339 AD), and bishop [[Theodoret]] (c. 393 – c. 457 AD), regarded him as a father of [[Armenians|Armenian]]s. Medieval Jewish traditions linked him with [[Turkic peoples]] including the [[Khazars]].

===Armenian and Georgian traditions===
[[Image:Thargamosids.JPG|thumb|350px|Thargamos and his sons.&lt;br&gt;The order of the figures from left to right is: Movakan, Bardos, [[Kartlos]], [[Hayk|Haos]], [[Lekos]], Thargamos, Caucas, Egros. An opening folio of the Georgian Chronicles ([[Vakhtang VI of Kartli|Vakhtangiseuli]] redaction), 1700s.]]

Another Togarmah, this one being the son of both [[Tiras]] and [[Gomer]], is mentioned by [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Moses of Chorene]] (c. 480) and [[Georgians|Georgian]] [[Leonti Mroveli]] who regarded Togarmah as the founder of their nations along with other [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian people]].

According to Moses of Chorene's [[The History of Armenia|''History of Armenia'']] and to Leonti Mroveli's medieval [[The Georgian Chronicles|''Georgian Chronicles'']], "Thargamos" was thought to have lived in [[Babylon]], before he received the "land between two Seas and two Mountains" (i.e. the [[Caucasus]]) in his possession. He then settled near [[Mount Ararat]] and divided his land among his sons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/gc2.htm |title=The Georgian Chronicle, History |publisher=Rbedrosian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/khorenaci/01.html |title=Мовсес Хоренаци, История Армении в трех частях. Книга Первая |publisher=Vehi.net |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Hayk|Haik]] (Հայկ) - first son of Thargamos, inherited [[Mount Ararat]] and founded the Armenian nation.
# [[Kartlos]] (ქართლოსი)  - settled in north-east from Ararat, founder of [[Kartli]] ([[Georgia (country)|Sa'kartvelo]]) who united other brothers and founded the Georgian nation.
# Bardos
# [[Movakos]] (Movkans)
# [[Lekos]] 
# [[Hereti|Heros]] (Herans) - settled in the eastern part of Ararat
# [[Caucas]] (Kovkases) - settled beyond the [[Caucasus Range]]
# [[Egrisi|Egros]] (Egers) - settled between the [[Black Sea]] and [[Likhi Range]] (Western Georgia)

=== Jewish traditions ===
Togarmah was linked to medieval Turkic peoples by Jewish-[[Khazar]] traditions. The Khazar ruler [[Joseph (Khazar)|Joseph ben Aaron]] (c. 960) writes in his [[Khazar Correspondence|letters]]:

:''"You ask us also in your epistle: "Of what people, of what family, and of what tribe are you?" Know that we are descended from Japhet, through his son Togarmah. I have found in the genealogical books of my ancestors that Togarmah had ten sons."

He then goes on to enumerate ten names that can be identified as contemporary tribes living near the Black and Caspian Seas:&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, Jon: ''The Jewish World in the Middle Ages''. Ktav Publishing, 2000, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak O.]] &amp; [[Norman Golb|Golb. N]]: ''Khazarian Hebrew Documents of the Tenth Century'', Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Ujur" ([[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]), "Tauris" ([[Tauri]]), "Avar" ([[Pannonian Avars|Avar]]), "Uguz" ([[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]]), "Bizal", "Tarna", "Chazar" ([[Khazars|Khazar]]), "Janur", "Bulgar" ([[Bulgars|Bulgar]]) and "Sawir".

The medieval Jewish [[Joseph ben Gorion]] lists the ten sons of Togarmas in his ''[[Josippon]]'' as follows: 
#  [[Kozar]] (the [[Khazars]])
#  Pacinak (the [[Pechenegs]])
#  Aliqanosz (the [[Alans]])
#  Bulgar (the [[Bulgars]])
#  Ragbiga (Ragbina, Ranbona)
#  Turqi (possibly the [[Göktürks|Kökturks]])
#  Buz (the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]])
#  Zabuk
#  Ungari (either the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] or the [[Oghur languages|Oghurs]]/[[Onogurs]])
#  Tilmac (Tilmic/Tirôsz - [[Tauri]])."

In the ''[[Chronicles of Jerahmeel]]'', they are listed as:
# Cuzar (the [[Khazars]])
# Pasinaq (the [[Pechenegs]])
# Alan (the [[Alans]])
# Bulgar (the [[Bulgars]])
# Kanbinah
# Turq (possibly the [[Göktürks|Kökturks]])
# Buz (the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]])
# Zakhukh
# Ugar (either the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] or the [[Oghur languages|Oghurs]]/[[Onogurs]])
# Tulmes (Tirôsz - [[Tauri]])

Another medieval [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic work]], the ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Book of Jasher]]'', give the names:
# Buzar (the [[Khazars]])
# Parzunac (the [[Pechenegs]])
# Elicanum (the [[Alans]])
# Balgar (the [[Bulgars]])
# Ragbib
# Tarki (the [[Göktürks|Kökturks]])
# Bid (the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]])
# Zebuc
# Ongal ([[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] or [[Oghur languages|Oghurs]]/[[Onogurs]])
# Tilmaz (Tirôsz - [[Tauri]]).

=== Other traditions ===
In an 11th-century Arabic translation of Josippon by a Yemenite Jew,&lt;ref&gt;Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschafien in Go'ttingen, Philolagisch-Historische Klasse [Neue Folge 1.4; Berlin, 1897].{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/abhandlungender51klasgoog|publisher= Akademie der Wissenschafien in Go'ttingen|title='Der arabische Josippus'|author=J. Wellenhausen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Togorma's tribes are these: 
#  Khazar (the [[Khazars]])
#  Badsanag (the [[Pechenegs]])
#  Asz-alân (the [[Alans]])
#  Bulghar (the [[Bulgars]])
#  Zabub
#  Fitrakh (Kotrakh?) (Ko-etrakh. Etrakh means Turks [possibly Gokturks])
#  Nabir
#  Andsar (Ajhar)
#  Talmisz (Tirôsz - [[Tauri]])
#  Adzîgher (Adzhigardak?).
The Arabic account however, also adds an  11th clan: Anszuh.

In the 18th century, the French [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monk]] and scholar [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Calmet]] (1672–1757) placed Togarmah in ''[[Scythia]] and [[Turkestan|Turcomania]]'' (in the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s and [[Central Asia]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge''. (1835) B. B. Edwards and J. Newton Brown. Brattleboro, Vermont, Fessenden &amp; Co., p. 1125.&lt;/ref&gt;
