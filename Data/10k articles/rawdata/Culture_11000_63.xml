'''AmericaSpeaks''' was a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[non-profit organization]] whose mission was to "engage citizens in the public decisions that impact their lives." AmericaSpeaks' work is focused on trying to create opportunities for citizens to impact decisions and to encourage public officials to make informed, lasting decisions.  AmericaSpeaks has developed and facilitated deliberative methods such as the 21st Century Town Hall Meeting, which enables facilitated discussion for 500 to 5,000 participants. [[Carolyn Lukensmeyer]] is the President and Founder of AmericaSpeaks. Its partners have included regional planning groups, local, state, and national government bodies, national and international organizations. Issues have ranged from [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] reform, the redevelopment of [[World Trade Center site|ground zero]] in [[New York City]] and rebuilding [[New Orleans]].

== History ==
America''Speaks'' was founded in 1995. Since then, it has engaged over 130,000 people in over 50 large-scale forums in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="americaspeaks.org"&gt;http://www.americaspeaks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=483&amp;parentID=471&amp;nodeID=1&lt;/ref&gt; America''Speaks'' aims to bring citizens together to deliberate about critical policy issues. The conclusions from these meetings are then brought to the attention of decision-makers in the hopes that citizen input will influence policy.

In 1994, after more than ten years of service in the public sector, America''Speaks'' president Carolyn Lukensmeyer had grown concerned that citizens were increasingly being shut out of public decision-making processes. Carolyn traveled the United States and held vision meetings to conceptualize a model for large-scale citizen engagement forums, and a vision for how these forums could be used in national dialogues on key public policy issues.

America''Speaks''’ mission is to create innovative mechanisms through which citizens can enhance their voice in local, regional, and national governance, and to renew democracy through the development of a national infrastructure for democratic deliberation and citizen engagement.

In January 2014, America''Speaks'' closed its doors.&lt;ref&gt;http://participedia.net/en/news/2014/01/14/americaspeaks-closes-down&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st Century Town Meeting ==
AmericaSpeaks’ 21st Century Town Meeting is intended to create engaging, meaningful opportunities for citizens to participate in public decision making. This process attempts to update the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]] to address the needs of today’s citizens, decision makers and democracy. Unlike most of New England's town meetings, however, it is not a formal legislative body, and therefore none of the decisions are binding.

The 21st Century Town Meeting marks a departure from traditional [[public participation]] methods, such as public hearings. The 21st Century Town Meeting focuses on discussion and deliberation among citizens rather than speeches, question-and-answer sessions or panel presentations. The purpose of the Town Hall Meeting is to gather diverse groups of citizens who will participate in round-table discussions (10-12 people per table) and deliberate in depth about key policy issues. Each table discussion is supported by a trained facilitator to keep participants on task. Participants receive discussion guides that present further information about the issues under consideration.

Technology collects the individual table discussions and the results are compiled into a set of collective recommendations. Each table submits ideas using wireless [[groupware]] computers and each participant can vote on specific proposals with [[keypad polling]]. These two pieces of technology allow for real-time reporting and voting. Results from discussions are presented to participants within minutes and polling results within seconds. The entire group votes on the final recommendations to submit to decision makers. Before the meeting ends, results from the meeting are put into a report, which is distributed to participants, decision makers and the [[news media]] as they leave.

===21st Century Summit===
The 21st Century Summit was created to help organization leaders tap into the collective wisdom of their constituents and stakeholders through large-scale meetings. During discussions, participants identify shared priorities and develop recommendations on essential policies and plans. At the meeting, AmericaSpeaks attempts to help attendees explore key issues, weigh critical trade offs, and deepen their connection and commitment to next steps. AmericaSpeaks has more than a decade of experience with engaging large numbers of members, employees or stakeholders – 50 to 5,000 at a single meeting – in a strategic, outcomes-oriented discussion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americaspeaks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=735&amp;parentID=472&amp;nodeID=1&lt;/ref&gt; The method integrates recent technology with facilitated dialogue, and provides the tools to enable groups to examine important options and identify mutual priorities.

== Notable examples ==
AmericaSpeaks meetings address local, state and national decisions.

===Americans Discuss Social Security===
"Americans Discuss Social Security" was a 1998 [[non-partisan]] effort funded by The [[Pew Charitable Trusts]], that directly engaged a diverse sample of Americans in a dialogue about [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] reform and recommended that the [[United States Congress]] support legislation that reflected citizen preferences. Over fifteen months, the project engaged nearly 45,000 Americans in every state in direct discussions on Social Security reform and reached more than twelve million through the project’s media and public education efforts.&lt;ref name="americaspeaks.org"/&gt;

===Citizen Summits in Washington, DC===
Beginning in 1999 and lasting until 2005, Mayor Anthony Williams partnered with AmericaSpeaks in an attempt to restore Washingtonians' faith in the government and gather recommendations for budgeting allocation. Over 13,500 citizens participated in seven 21st Century Town Meetings.&lt;ref name="americaspeaks.org 572"&gt;http://www.americaspeaks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=572&amp;grandparentID=473&amp;parentID=688&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Citizen Summits, millions of dollars were budgeted to areas over which citizens voiced concern, including: an additional $270 million for education; $10 million for senior services; 1,000 new drug treatment slots; an additional $25 million for a [[housing trust fund]]; $2 million for citizen involvement; and nearly $20 million for more police and juvenile-related initiatives.&lt;ref name="americaspeaks.org 572"/&gt; Also, the mayor's office created and implemented the Office of Neighborhood Action, which is responsible for ensuring that citizens have a voice in shaping the city’s priorities.

===Redeveloping Ground Zero===
''Listening to the City'' was held at the [[Javits Center]] in [[New York City]] in July 2002 to involve 4300 local [[citizen]]s, who closely reflected the demographic diversity of the region, in the planning process for [[Ground Zero]]'s future.&lt;ref name="americaspeaks.org"/&gt; Decision-makers from the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] and the Port Authority co-sponsored the meeting and incorporated it into their official public engagement process. After a day of intense deliberation, participants determined that the original plans for the redevelopment of the World Trade Center failed to meet the needs of the city. Within a week of Listening to the City, decision-makers announced that the plans would be redrawn in accordance with public priorities. A two-week [[online deliberation]] and dialogue reached another 800 New York City residents who reviewed the site options in small cyber groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americaspeaks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=626&amp;parentID=473&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 World Economic Forum===
The 2005 World Economic Forum in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]] featured a Global Town Hall Meeting by AmericaSpeaks’ international arm, Global Voices, where 700 world leaders prioritized and addressed some of the toughest issues facing the global community. Poverty and Equitable Globalization were voted the two top priorities.

===Voices &amp; Choices===
AmericaSpeaks partnered with the [http://www.futurefundneo.org Fund for Our Economic Future] to organize a series of town meetings and public forums across northeast Ohio to enable thousands of people to come together to create a strategic plan for revitalizing the region's economy. One of the largest public deliberations convened, Voices &amp; Choices combined a variety of approaches for mobilizing the region’s citizenry, including one-on-one interviews, online forums and two large-scale 21st Century Town Meetings. Over 20,000 participants identified the region’s strengths,  identified and prioritized its most important challenges and brainstormed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americaspeaks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=585&amp;grandparentID=473&amp;parentID=688&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizens' Health Care Working Group===
AmericaSpeaks worked with the [[Citizens' Health Care Working Group]] to engage thousands of Americans in a national discussion on health care reform.  21st Century Town Meetings were held in Los Angeles and Cincinnati.  Smaller forums were held in other cities throughout the nation.

===Unified New Orleans Plan===
AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to bring together nearly 4000 New Orleanians in two large-scale public meetings to develop and review elements of a citywide-plan for recovery.&lt;ref name="americaspeaks.org"/&gt; The December 2006 and January 2007 Community Congresses were multi-site meetings that connected participants over geographical distances using satellite video and webcast. In conjunction with the City-Wide meetings, citizens were engaged in district planning meetings, through a 1-800 number, and the UNOP website.

Community Congress I (October 28, 2006) was held in the Morial Convention Center. AmericaSpeaks did not assist with the outreach for this meeting. The agenda for the meeting was to brief attendees on the state of city recovery. The first Community Congress drew attendees who were 75% white, and 40% of whom had incomes above $75,000, while the pre-Katrina demographics the city were 67% African-American and only 2% of New Orleanians had incomes above $75,000. The meeting was criticized for its unrepresentative participants and for some of its conclusions, which included backing a smaller footprint, and advising that funding should be concentrated on already recovering neighborhoods [http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-6/116210217168170.xml&amp;coll=1].

Community Congress II (December 2, 2006) and Community Congress III (January 20, 2007) were both held simultaneously in [[New Orleans]] and other American cities with the large numbers of Katrina evacuees ([[New Orleans diaspora]]). AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to design, recruit participants and implement these meetings. When polled at the meetings, the participant groups closely approximated the pre-Katrina demographics of New Orleans: In pre-Katrina New Orleans, 67% were African-American and 37% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress II, 64% were African-American and 25% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress III, 55% were African-American and 24% had household income under $20,000. Renters, however, were significantly underrepresented - prior to [[Hurricane Katrina]], 54% of the population were renters, while they made up only 29% of the participants [http://www.unifiedneworleansplan.com/uploads/UNOP_Prelim_COMPLETE_LowRes-16593.pdf]. The meetings connected New Orleanians at home with friends and neighbors who have not yet made it home through the use of Internet [[webcast]] technology or [[closed circuit television]]. Unfortunately, ambiguously worded scenarios at the second Community Congress, particularly those that pertained to "areas of greatest need," caused some of the discussion results to be disregarded [http://www.nola.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news-19/116876311870470.xml?NZNPMT&amp;coll=1&amp;thispage=3].
Community Congress III presented the draft plan to citizens, incorporating many of the recommendations from Community Congress II, and 92% of participants expressed support for the Plan to go forward.

In late May 2007, $117 million in federal block grants was released for infrastructure repairs when the Louisiana Recovery Authority board accepted New Orleans' citywide recovery plan.  The money is the first  step toward financing a city recovery plan officials say will cost  $1.1 billion. When releasing the money, The Louisiana Recovery Authority board recognized that the Unified New Orleans Plan was a citizen- driven recovery vision developed with "unprecedented participation and representation from every part of the city."

===CaliforniaSpeaks===
Nearly 3,500 Californians gathered in eight cities on August 11, 2007 in an interactive forum on
health care priorities called [[California Speaks]], and 82 percent advocated major changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americaspeaks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=670&amp;grandparentID=473&amp;parentID=688&lt;/ref&gt; The project was created and led by AmericaSpeaks.

The most popular suggestions called for putting people before profit, prioritizing wellness and prevention, and making health care affordable and accessible to everyone. The statewide conversation was created to enable ordinary Californians to tell state lawmakers what they think about the current health care reform proposals.

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, Senate President pro Tem Don Perata, Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines and other Republican and Democratic legislators attended the event. Each of the lawmakers emphasized his commitment to passing health care reform in 2007.

The real-time, nonpartisan health care discussion blended small-group dialogue with cutting-edge technology. Satellite television, webcast, simultaneous television broadcast, groupware and individual voting keypads were used. Forums were held in Sacramento, San Diego, Eureka, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Oakland-San Francisco and Riverside-San Bernardino.

===Our Budget, Our Economy===
On June 26, 2010, AmericaSpeaks: Our Budget, Our Economy brought 3,500 Americans together to come up discuss how to create a sustainable fiscal future and a strong economic recovery.   The event took place in 60 different cities, including 19 primary meeting sites hosted by AmericaSpeaks and more than 40 smaller volunteer-led conversations.  All sites were linked through the use of technology, including satellite-based live webcast and individual voting keypads.  The priorities that emerged from the discussion were to be presented to Congress and President Obama, as well as the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform  and the Bi-Partisan Policy Center’s Debt Reduction Task Force.

The AmericaSpeaks: Our Budget, Our Economy was politically neutral, which they tried to accomplish by assembling a diverse [http://usabudgetdiscussion.org/about-2/our-funders/ group of funders], a diverse [http://usabudgetdiscussion.org/about-2/national-advisory-committee/ National Advisory Committee], and selecting participants that were demographically representative in terms of race, age, income, and political orientation. Despite this, the event received criticism from both the right and the left.  Dean Baker, a left-leaning blogger, wrote that Our Budget, Our Economy materials would "guarantee" large cuts to Social Security and Medicare, while [http://video.foxnews.com/v/4262098/tax-hikes-needed-to-cut-debt Fox News reported] that the event was slanted toward raising taxes. There was also support for the national discussion, including [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-newmark/americaspeaks-town-halls_b_617303.html this post from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark], as well as a [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/archon-fung/public-deliberation-the-l_b_627983.html piece from Harvard Professor Archon Fung].

The preliminary results of the June 26 discussion differed from Baker's predictions.  [http://usabudgetdiscussion.org/written-testimony-for-the-national-commission-on-fiscal-responsibility-and-reform/ In a blog post], AmericaSpeaks President Carolyn Lukensmeyer detail the results presented to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform for its public meeting on Wednesday, June 30, 2010.  Some highly supported proposals included a raise tax rates on corporate income and those earning more than $1 million, a reduction in military spending by 10 to 15 percent, and a carbon tax and a securities-transaction tax.

== Advancing the Field of Deliberative Democracy ==
AmericaSpeaks is dedicated to advancing citizen deliberation and aims to one day create an infrastructure in the United States that deeply incorporates citizens into the decision-making process. The Democracy Lab for Innovation and Research [http://www.americaspeaks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=504] is AmericaSpeaks’ think tank on deliberative democracy and citizen engagement. The Democracy Lab develops methods to advance and sustain citizen engagement in the public policy process. AmericaSpeaks formed the Democracy Lab in order to: Improve democratic processes and institutions by creating a new governance mechanism that will regularly convene diverse groups of Americans on key policy questions and incorporate citizen voices into policy making; Enhance and improve AmericaSpeaks’ approach to citizen engagement, such as developing new models for sustaining citizen participation and turning initial participation in deliberation into long-term citizen engagement and action; Evaluate the impact of AmericaSpeaks’ citizen engagement initiatives; Strengthen the deliberative democracy field by disseminating knowledge gained by AmericaSpeaks through its projects and research. AmericaSpeaks routinely brings together leading scholars and practitioners from the field of deliberative democracy to develop insights into and solutions for key questions in the field of citizen engagement.

'''The anthem without a title''' was the untitled [[national anthem]] of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. It was written in English by [[Zahira Hiliman]] from [[Sint Maarten]] and translated into the native Papiamento language by Lucille Berry-Haseth from [[Curaçao]]. The anthem was written in two of the three official languages of the Netherlands Antilles, [[English language|English]] and [[Papiamento]];  [[Dutch language|Dutch]] was the third official language. It was adopted in 2000. In addition to this anthem, many of the islands in the Netherlands Antilles had their own anthems.

On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolved]] into [[Curaçao]], [[Sint Maarten]] and the three public bodies of the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;

1. Our island in the sea, like gems they seem to be,

outstanding from a golden crown of blissful royalty.

Though their people and their culture colorful may seem,

they yet uniquely blend to be just one family.

'''Bridge'''

So we, your people raise our voice in love and unity

'''Chorus'''

Dear Netherlands Antilles, so beautiful to me.

I’m proud to be a part of you, a patriot I shall be.

Yes Netherlands Antilles, I pledge my loyalty,

To you always will be true; I say may God bless you.

2. So blessed with sunny skies and clear welcoming seas,

each island like a link that forms this chain of unity.

May differ in our language, yet meet on common ground,

When some say "Sweet Antilles", some say "Dushi Antia ta".

3. Yes, proud are we to be identified with you,

dear Netherlands Antilles, to you we will be true.

So we declare and vow, with dignity and love,

Our nation we will always serve, may God keep us as one.

Beste Nederlandse Antillen, zo mooi voor mij.

Ik ben er trots op een deel van jou, een patriot zal ik zijn.

Ja Nederlandse Antillen, beloof ik mijn loyaliteit,

Om u altijd waar zijn, ik zeg moge God u zegenen.

2. Zo gezegend met zonnige luchten en heldere gastvrije zeeën,

elk eiland als een link die deze keten van eenheid vormen.

Kunnen verschillen in onze taal, maar toch ontmoeten op gemeenschappelijke grond,

Wanneer sommigen "Zoet Antillen" zeggen, zeggen sommigen 'Dushi Antia ta ".

3. Ja, trots zijn we worden geïdentificeerd met u,

Dus we verklaren en gelofte, met waardigheid en liefde,

Onze natie zullen we altijd dienen, moge God houden ons als een.

[[File:Apicius Handschrift New York Academy of Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Apicius'' manuscript (ca. 900 AD) of the [[Fulda monastery|monastery of Fulda]] in Germany, which was acquired in 1929 by the [[New York Academy of Medicine]]]]

'''''Apicius''''' is a collection of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] cookery recipes, usually thought to have been compiled in the 1st century AD and written in a language that is in many ways closer to [[Vulgar Latin|Vulgar]] than to [[Classical Latin]]; later recipes using Vulgar Latin (such as ''ficatum'', ''bullire'') were added to earlier recipes using Classical Latin (such as ''iecur'', ''fervere''). 

The name "Apicius" had long been associated with excessively refined love of food, from the habits of an early bearer of the name, [[Marcus Gavius Apicius]], a Roman [[gourmet]] and lover of refined luxury, who lived sometime in the 1st century AD during the reign of [[Tiberius]]. He is sometimes erroneously asserted to be the author of the book that is [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphically]] attributed to him.

''Apicius'' is a text to be used in the kitchen. In the earliest printed editions, it was usually called '''''De re coquinaria''''' (''On the Subject of Cooking''), and attributed to an otherwise unknown Caelius Apicius, an invention based on the fact that one of the two manuscripts is headed with the words "API CAE"&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; or rather because there are a few recipes attributed to Apicius in the text: Patinam Apicianam sic facies (IV, 14) Ofellas Apicianas (VII, 2). It is also known as ''De re culinaria''.

== Organization ==
[[File:Apicius 1541.jpg|thumb|180px|Apicius, ''De re culinaria'' (Lyon: Sebastianus Gryphium, 1541)]]
The Latin text is organized in ten books with Greek titles, in an arrangement similar to that of a modern cookbook:&lt;ref&gt;''The Roman Cookery Book'', trans. Flower and Rosenbaum, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Epimeles'' — The Careful Housekeeper
# ''Sarcoptes'' — The Meat Mincer, Ground-beef
# ''Cepuros'' — The Gardener, Vegetables
# ''Pandecter'' — Many Ingredients
# ''Ospreon'' — Pulse, Legumes
# ''Aeropetes'' — Birds, Poultry
# ''Polyteles'' — The Gourmet
# ''Tetrapus'' — The Quadruped, Four-legged animals
# ''Thalassa'' — The Sea, Sea-food
# ''Halieus'' — The Fisherman

== Foods ==

The [[food]]s described in the book are useful for reconstructing the dietary habits of the ancient world around the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. But the recipes are geared for the wealthiest classes, and a few contain what were exotic ingredients at that time (e.g., [[flamingo]]). A sample recipe from Apicius (8.6.2–3) follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Roman Cookery Book'', trans. Flower and Rosenbaum, pp. 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ALITER HAEDINAM SIVE AGNINAM EXCALDATAM: mittes in caccabum copadia. cepam, coriandrum minutatim succides, teres piper, ligusticum, cuminum, [[liquamen]], oleum, vinum. coques, exinanies in patina, amulo obligas. [Aliter haedinam sive agninam excaldatam] &lt;agnina&gt; a crudo trituram mortario accipere debet, caprina autem cum coquitur accipit trituram.
* HOT KID OR LAMB [[Stew|STEW]]. Put the pieces of [[meat]] into a pan. Finely chop an [[onion]] and [[coriander]], pound pepper, [[lovage]], [[cumin]], [[garum]], [[cooking oil|oil]], and [[wine]]. Cook, turn out into a shallow pan, thicken with [[wheat starch]]. If you take [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] you should add the contents of the mortar while the meat is still raw, if [[goat meat|kid]], add it while it is cooking.

== Alternative editions ==
[[File:Apicius1709fr.jpg|thumb|180px|''De opsoniis et condimentis'' (Amsterdam: J. Waesbergios), 1709. Frontispiece of the second edition of [[Martin Lister]]'s privately printed version of ''Apicius'']]

In a completely different manuscript, there is also a very abbreviated [[epitome]] entitled ''Apici excerpta a Vinidario'', a "pocket Apicius" by "an illustrious man" named [[Vinidarius]], made as late as the [[Carolingian era]].&lt;ref&gt;''Apicius: A Critical Edition with an Introduction and an English Translation'', ed. Grocok and Grainger, pp. 309–325.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vinidarius of this book may have been a Goth, in which case his Gothic name may have been Vinithaharjis, but this is only conjecture. Despite being called "illustrious," nothing about him is truly known.

''Apici excerpta a Vinidario'' survives in a single 8th-century [[uncial]] manuscript. Despite the title, this booklet is not an excerpt purely from the ''Apicius'' text we have today, as it contains material that is not in the longer ''Apicius'' manuscripts. Either some text was lost between the time the excerpt was made and the time the manuscripts were written, or there never was a "standard ''Apicius''" text because the contents changed over time as it was adapted by readers.

Once manuscripts surfaced, there were two early printed editions of ''Apicius'', in [[Milan]] (1498, under the title ''In re quoquinaria'') and [[Venice]] (1500). Four more editions in the next four decades reflect the appeal of ''Apicius''.  In the long-standard edition of C.&amp;nbsp;T.&amp;nbsp;Schuch (Heidelberg, 1867), the editor added some recipes from the Vinidarius manuscript. 

Between 1498 (the date of the first printed edition) and 1936 (the date of [[Joseph Dommers Vehling]]'s translation into English and bibliography of Apicius), there were 14 editions of the Latin text (plus one possibly apocryphal edition). The work was not widely translated, however; the first translation was into [[Italian language|Italian]], in 1852, followed in the 20th century by two translations into [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. The French translation by [[Bertrand Guégan]] was awarded the 1934 [[Prix Langlois]] by the [[Académie française]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/bertrand-guegan|title=Bertrand GUÉGAN – Académie française|work=academie-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehling made the first translation of the book into [[English language|English]] under the title ''Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome''. It was published in 1936 and is still in print, having been reprinted in 1977 by [[Dover Publications]]. It is now of historical interest only, since Vehling's knowledge of Latin was not always adequate for the difficult task of translation, and several later and more reliable translations now exist.

The '''bound monster''' is an important motif in [[Norse mythology]]. The theme is that of an enemy of the [[Æsir|gods]] who is bound or restrained in some way but destined to break free during the time of [[Ragnarök]] to cause destruction.

This pattern applies particularly to [[Loki]] and his three children by the [[Jötunn|giantess]] [[Angrboda]] - the wolf [[Fenrisulfr]] (or Fenrir), [[Jörmungandr]] (the Midgard Serpent) and [[Hel (being)|Hel]], queen of the [[Niflheim|underworld]]. Loki was bound in vengeance for his role in the death of [[Baldr]], the full version of which tale is found in ''[[Gylfaginning]]''. As Loki struggles in his bonds, his wife [[Sigyn]] holds a bowl over his head to catch the venom that drips continuously from a snake. At Ragnarök he will break free and fight against the gods, battling [[Heimdall]] in a mutually fatal duel.

Fenrir, whose role in the final days was revealed through prophecy, was leashed by the gods with a magical fetter created by the [[Norse dwarves|dwarfs]]. He refused to let himself be bound until one of the gods agreed to place a hand in his mouth as a pledge of release. Only [[Tyr]] was brave enough to do this, and as the chain tightened around Fenrir, he sensed their deception and bit off the right hand of the god. At Ragnarök, the wolf is destined to break his bond and kill [[Odin]], whose death will then be avenged by the god [[Vidar]].

For similar reasons as Fenrir, Jörmungandr and Hel are also considered bound monsters, though in somewhat less apparent ways. The serpent was banished to the outer waters of [[Midgard]] where he lay encircling the earth with his tail in his mouth, which in itself is a form of binding. He will rise up from the ocean during Ragnarök when he and [[Thor]] will fight one another, resulting first in the death of Jörmungandr followed by that of Thor as he succumbs to the serpent's poison. Hel was likewise banished to [[Niflheim]], the land of the dead, as its queen. Although she is the ruler of her domain, she is bound by the confines of her realm, and her retaliatory role during Ragnarök will be represented by the [[frost giants]] and a great army of the dead marching forth under the banner of Loki.

'''Burgher arms''' are [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] borne by persons of the ''burgher'' social class of [[Europe]] (usually called ''bourgeois'' in English) since the [[Middle Ages]]. By definition, however, the term is alien to [[British heraldry]], which follows other rules.

Although the term ''burgher'' arms refers to the [[bourgeoisie]], it is often extended also to arms of (Protestant) clergy and even to arms of [[peasant]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In several European countries, the use of armorial bearings was restricted to a particular social class, e.g. the use of [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] in [[Coat of arms#United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] in [[Portuguese heraldry|Portugal]] or [[coronets]] in [[Swedish heraldry#Noble arms|Sweden]]. In other countries, every individual, family and community has been free to adopt arms and use it as they please, provided they have not wrongfully assumed the arms of another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Heraldry.html?id=XFfkAQAACAAJ Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning]'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), {{p.|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Use of coats of arms by burghers and artisans began during the 13th century and in the 14th century some peasants took to using arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of burghers bore a far wider variety of [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] than the arms of nobility like everyday objects, in particular, [[tool]]s. In burgher arms are met sometimes also [[house mark]]s which are not met in arms of nobility. Most widespread burgher heraldry was and still is in [[Switzerland]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. In the Netherlands only a small percentage of the existing arms belong to the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Although assumption of arms always remained free, the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] began to grant arms without raising people to nobiliary status. In the 15th century the authority to grant arms was delegated to “[[Hofpfalzgraf|Counts Palatine of the Imperial Court]]” ({{lang-de|[[:de:Hofpfalzgraf|Hofpfalzgrafen]]}}), who from then on also granted arms to burghers. This was regarded as luxury everyone was not able to afford.

The [[tilting helmet]] was prescribed for arms of non-nobles, while the barred helmet was restricted by the imperial chancellery to the nobility as upholders of the tradition of tourneying. This privilege was also shared by certain people who enjoyed the same standing as the nobility, e.g. those who had a doctor's title in law or theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]]: A Guide to Heraldry. Cassell, London 1981, p.161. {{ISBN|0-304-30751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Custom of the use of the barred helmet was also followed by city [[Patricianship|patricians]].&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173"&gt;[[Handbuch der Heraldik: Wappenfibel]]. (19th expanded edition). Edited by Ludwig Biewer. (Degener &amp; Co, Neustadt an der Aisch 1998), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rule of the use of the tilting helmet by burghers was not always obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries of the [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German-Nordic heraldic tradition]], e.g. in [[Swedish heraldry]].

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], arms were no longer granted to burghers except in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], where such grants continued from 1911 until 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Elsewhere burgher arms were assumed. Such family heraldry is still alive in Germany and burgher arms [[law of arms|are protected by law]].

== France ==
Burgher arms used to be common in [[France]], but they disappeared in the [[French Revolution]], which was hostile to heraldry. In the end of the 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in ''[[Armorial général (of France)|Armorial général]]'' as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force people to pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 33-36&lt;/ref&gt; In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.

== Portugal ==
Burgher arms had a complicated and suppressed history in Portugal. During the reign of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], burgher arms were restricted to the use of colours only. This restriction would become irrelevant when King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] forbade the use of arms to those who were not of the [[Portuguese nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Slater: The Complete Book of Heraldry. Lorenz Books 2002, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction against burgher arms in Portugal lasted until 1910.

== Arms of peasants ==
In some regions ([[Normandy]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]) even peasants sometimes bore arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Switzerland]] 14th century arms of farmers are known, but they are rare and did not become numerous until the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Frisia]] and [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], where farmers had personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173" /&gt; In [[Denmark]] arms of farmers are preserved on seals from about 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norway]] peasants have used arms since the Middle Ages and some of the arms have even been used as family arms.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Krag: ''Norsk heraldisk mønstring fra Frederik IV's regjeringstid 1699-1730'', Bind II Bønder, (1942 – 1955) and Allan Tønnesen (ed.): ''Magtens besegling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2613">In [[French Guiana]] (not to be confused with [[Guyana]]) and [[Suriname]], '''Bushinengues''' (meaning ''people of the forest'') are the descendants of slaves taken to Suriname to work in plantations. Their communities were the result of a growing movement amongst slaves to [[maroon (people)|escape enslavement and establish independent communities]] in the forest. Whilst a significant portion remained in Suriname, the majority ended up in Guyane.

==Demographics==
There are six major groups of Bushinengues:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Langues de Guyane'', sous la direction de Odile RENAULT-LESCURE et Laurence GOURY, Montpellier, IRD, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Aluku|Alukus (or Bonis)]],

* The [[Matawai people|Matawai]]s,
* The [[Ndyuka people|Ndyukas]],
* The [[Paramaccan people|Paramaccas]], and
* The [[Saramaka|Saramacas]]

===Languages===
The languages of the Bushinengues are all [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]].

"'''Butterballs'''" is the fifth episode of the [[South Park (season 16)|sixteenth season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[South Park]]'', and the 228th episode of the series overall. It aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on April 11, 2012.

In the episode, an anti-bullying speaker visits South Park Elementary, after which [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] raises awareness about the dangers of bullying by shooting a big dance video, while Butters falls victim to an unlikely bully.&lt;ref name=PressRelease&gt;[http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/411961/episode-1605-butterballs-press-release "Episode 1605 Butterballs Press Release"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411201139/http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/411961/episode-1605-butterballs-press-release |date=2012-04-11 }} South Park Studios. April 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The episode satirizes the director [[Jason Russell]], the 2011 film ''[[Bully (2011 film)|Bully]]'', and the anti-bullying movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kleinman, Jacob|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/327330/20120412/south-park-bully-kony-2012-russell-episode.htm|title=South Park Episode 'Butterballs' Spoofs ‘Kony 2012,' Jason Russell and 'Bully'|publisher=''[[International Business Times]]'' |date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
When [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]'s schoolmates see him with a black eye, they learn that it was the work of a bully who stole his lunch money for the third day in a row. Stan and Kyle urge Butters to talk to his family, including his grandmother, whom they mention is visiting him this week. However, his grandmother turns out to be the one who bullies him. Eventually, someone secretly contacts Bucky Bailey, an anti-bullying counselor from Bully Buckers™, to come to the school. Bailey bullies [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]] into calling for an assembly, at which he proposes that the students make an anti-bullying video. When no one volunteers to be the leader of the campaign and direct the video, he taunts the assembled students.

[[Stan Marsh|Stan]] volunteers, saying that bullying is a problem that needs to be addressed. Stan produces a [[music video]] featuring Cartman dressed in drag and Butters himself paraded in front of everyone in the nude. When Butters expresses reluctance to continue, saying that this will only make things worse, Stan fails to take his viewpoint seriously. As a result, Kyle walks off the project, saying that Stan has made himself the focus of the video and cautions him not to end up "[[Jason Russell#Personal life|naked and jacking it in San Diego]]", a reference that Stan does not understand.

Stan informs Butters that a Hollywood studio wants to buy the video. Though Stan is cheered by his schoolmates, Bailey corners Stan in the school boys' room, bullying him because Stan sold the movie without consulting him, as revenue from the video, which was Bailey's idea, could have brought national exposure to Bully Buckers™. Bailey taunts Stan, bringing him to tears. Later, Mick Jabs, the president of the studio that purchased the video, corners Bailey in the school boys' room, and presents a [[cease and desist]] order from his lawyers, bullying Bailey to tears.

Stan and Butters go on ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'' to promote the movie, but as [[Mehmet Oz|Dr. Oz]] continuously bullies Butters to get him to reveal specifics, Butters finally snaps and attacks Oz. After Jabs excoriates Stan because the film's subject will be viewed not as a sympathetic figure, but as a violent psychopath, Jabs himself is cornered in a restroom by [[List of recurring South Park characters#Jesus|Jesus]], who threatens him with [[Hell]] for his behavior.

Later that night, Butters goes to his grandmother's room as she lies in bed, telling her that he finally stood up for himself. While he admits that it felt good, it ultimately left with him a dark and empty feeling, just as he imagines she feels. He then tells her that he has realized that bullies will always exist, and while such stages in life seem as if they will last forever to children, one day he will grow into a happy adult, and as she lies dying in a hospital, he will visit her to show her that he is still alive and happy, while she will die the same empty, sad person she's always been. The next day, after being pilloried by his fellow students at school for the decision of Jabs' studio to cancel its distribution of the video, as well as for a lawsuit that Dr. Oz has filed against Stan and South Park Elementary, Stan resolves to go to [[San Diego]] where, in a musical number, he strips off his clothes in public and dances in the nude on a street corner, à la [[Jason Russell]].

==Critical reception==
Max Nicholson of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 7.5 "Good" rating, lauding the reveal of Butters's grandmother as the bully, and finding her verbal abuse of Butters to be "priceless". Though the bathroom gag was more disappointing than Nicholson thought it would be, Nicholson felt that the scenes with Butters and his grandmother tied the episode together, in particular his final "moment of clarity" speech. Nicholson also enjoyed Stan's nude dance in San Diego, not knowing it was a reference to the Jason Russell scandal. Nicholson was less impressed by the students' music video, as he did not initially know that it was a nod to an anti-bullying music video made at [[Cypress Ranch High School]], which he thought was too obscure a reference, marring the episode somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholson, Max|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/122/1222852p1.html|title=South Park: 'Butterballs' Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Cortez of Assignment X gave the episode a [[Academic grading in the United States|B+]], calling their take on school bullying "hilarious", and saying of the interaction between Butters and his grandmother, "It’s brilliant and funny and wrong, but the best ''South Park'''s always are."&lt;ref&gt;Cortez, Carl (April 12, 2012).

{{Part of History of India}}
{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}

The '''Cemetery H culture''' was a Bronze Age culture in the [[Punjab region]] of what is now Pakistan and north-western India, from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE. It was a regional form of the late phase of the [[Harappan civilisation|Harappan]] (Indus Valley) civilisation (alongside the [[Jhukar Phase|Jhukar culture]] of Sindh and [[Rangpur, India|Rangpur culture]] of Gujarat).

==Origins==
The Cemetery H culture was located in and around the [[Punjab region]] in present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. It was named after a cemetery found in "area H" at [[Harappa]]. Remains of the culture have been dated from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE.

According to Rafique Mughal, the Cemetery H culture developed out of the northern part of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 1700 BCE, being part of the Punjab Phase,&lt;ref&gt;M Rafiq Mughal Lahore Museum Bulletin, off Print, vol.III, No.2, Jul-Dec. 1990 [http://www.rafiquemughal.com/MUGHAL_1990_Decline-of-the-Indus_Lahore-Mus-Bulletin.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; one of three cultural phases that developed in the [[Localization Era]] or "Late Harappan phase" of the [[Indus Valley Tradition]].{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991a}}{{sfn|Shaffer|1992}} According to [[Jonathan Mark Kenoyer|Kenoyer]], the Cemetery H culture "may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past."{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991b|p=56}} According to Kennedy and Mallory &amp; Adams, the Cemetery H culture also "shows clear biological affinities" with the earlier population of Harappa.{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=312}} {{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=103, 310}}

Some traits of the Cemetery H culture have been associated with the [[Swat culture]], which has been regarded as evidence of the Indo-Aryan movement toward the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=103}} According to Parpola, the Cemetery H culture represents a first wave of [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryan migration]] from as early as 1900 BCE, which was followed by a migration to the Punjab c. 1700-1400 BCE.{{sfn|Parpola|1998}} According to Kochhar, the Swat IV co-founded the Harappan Cemetery H phase in Punjab (2000-1800 BCE), while the Rigvedic Indo-Aryans of Swat V later absorbed the Cemetery H people and gave rise to the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]] (to 1400 BCE).{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185-186}}

Together with the [[Gandhara grave culture]] and the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]], the Cemetery H culture is considered by some scholars as a factor in the formation of the [[Vedic civilization]].{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185-186}}

==Features==
The distinguishing features of this culture include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030161353/http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_02.html |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of [[cremation]] of human remains. The bones were stored in painted pottery burial urns. This is completely different from the Indus civilization where bodies were buried in wooden coffins. The urn burials and the "grave skeletons" were nearly contemporaneous.{{sfn|Sarkar|1964}}
* Reddish pottery, painted in black with [[antelope]]s, [[peacock]]s etc., [[sun]] or [[star]] motifs, with different surface treatments to the earlier period.
* Expansion of settlements into the east.
* [[Rice]] became a main crop.
* Apparent breakdown of the widespread trade of the Indus civilization, with materials such as marine shells no longer used.
* Continued use of mud brick for building.

Some of the designs painted on the Cemetery H funerary urns have been interpreted through the lens of [[historical Vedic religion|Vedic mythology]]: for instance, peacocks with hollow bodies and a small human form inside, which has been interpreted as the souls of the dead, and a hound that can be seen as the hound of [[Yama]], the god of death.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=102}}&lt;ref&gt;Bridget and Raymond Allchin (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan''], p.246&lt;/ref&gt; This may indicate the introduction of new religious beliefs during this period, but the archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis that the Cemetery H people were the destroyers of the Harappan cities.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=102-103}}

==Archaeology==
Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture, a practice previously described in the [[Vedas]]. The [[Rigveda]] contains a reference to the emerging practice, in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].15.14, where the forefathers "both cremated (''agnidagdhá-'') and uncremated (''ánagnidagdha-'')" are invoked.

'''Chinese fortune telling''', better known as '''''Suan ming''''' ({{zh|c=算命|l=fate calculating|p=Suànmìng}}) has utilized many varying [[divination]] techniques throughout the [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynastic periods]]. There are many methods still in practice in [[China]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] today. Over time, some of these concepts have moved into [[Korea]]n, [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]], and [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese]] culture under other names. For example, ''"Saju"'' in Korea is the same as the Chinese [[Four Pillars of Destiny|four pillar]] method.

==History==
The oldest accounts about practice of divination describe it as a measure for "solving doubts" (e.g. "Examination of doubts" 稽疑 part of the ''Great Plan'' [[:zh:洪範]]). Two well known methods of divination included ''bǔ'' 卜 (on the tortoise shells) and ''shì'' 筮 (on the stalks of [[Achillea millefolium|milfoil]] shī 蓍). Those methods were sanctioned by the royal practice since Shang and Zhou dynasties. Divination of the ''xiang'' 相 type (by appearance - of the human body parts, animals etc.), however, was sometimes criticized (the [[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]], "Against divination"). Apparently, the later type was a part of the medical and veterinary practice, as well as a part necessary in match-making and marketing choices. A number of divination techniques developed around the astronomic observations and burial practices (see [[Feng shui]], [[Guan Lu]]).

The dynastic chronicles preserve a number of reports when divination was manipulated to the end of achieving a political or personal goal.

==Methods==

* [[Physiognomy|Face reading]] (面相) - This is the interpretation of facial features of the nose, eyes, mouth and other criteria within one's face and the conversion of those criteria into predictions for the future. This usually covers one phase of the client's life, and reveals the type of luck associated with a certain age range.  A positions map also refers to different points on the face. This represents the person’s luck at different ages. The upper region of the face represents youth, the middle region of the face represents middle age, and the lower region of the face represents old age.
* [[Cheiromancy|Palm reading]] (手相) - This analyzes the positioning of palm lines for love, personality, and other traits. It somewhat resembles Western [[palmistry]] in technique.
* ''[[Kau Cim]]'' (求籤) - This requires the shaking of a [[bamboo]] cylinder, which results in at least one modified [[incense stick]] leaving the cylinder. The [[Chinese characters]] inscribed on the stick are analyzed by an interpreter. The prediction is short range, as it covers one [[Chinese calendar]] year. In the West, this method has been popularized under the trade-name "Chi-Chi sticks."
* ''[[Zi wei dou shu]]'' (紫微斗數) - This procedure, sometimes loosely called (Chinese: 批命, pik meng) or Purple Star Astrology or Emperor/Purple (Star) Astrology, involves the client seeking an advisor with a mastery of the [[Chinese calendar]]. [[Chinese Astrology|Astrology]] is used in combination with the [[Chinese constellation]]s, [[Four Pillars of Destiny|four pillars of destiny]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] methods of divination. The end result is a translation of one's destiny path, an interpretation of a predetermined fate. The result of the details vary depending on the accuracy of the original four pillars information the client provides to the fortune-teller. This method can also verify unique events that have already happened in one's life.
* ''[[Four Pillars of Destiny|Bazi]]'' (八字) - This method is undoubtedly the most popular of Chinese Fortune Telling methods, and the most accessible one. It has many variants in practice the most simple one called: "Ziping Bazi" 子平八字, invented by Master Ziping. Generally it involves taking four components of time, the hour of birth, day, month and year. Each a pillar from the Sixty Jiazi and arranging them into Four Pillars. The Four Pillars are then analyzed against the Daymaster, the Heavenly Stem for the Day pillar. It is a form of Astrology as opposed to Fortune Telling or Divination, and tells one about his or her destiny in life, current situation and area for most successful occupation. Originally Bazi was read against the Year Earthly Branch, then focus shifted to the Month Pillar, then finally Master [[Yuan Hai Zi Ping|Xu Ziping]] refined and remade the system to use the Heavenly Stem of the Day Pillar as the emphasis and focus in reading. The practice for reading against the Year Branch is the origin of the popular Chinese Horoscopes for your Year of Birth.

==Sociology==
In Chinese society, fortune telling is a respected and important part of social and business culture. Thus, fortune tellers often take on a role which is equivalent to [[management consultant]]s and [[psychotherapist]]s in Western society. As [[management consultant]]s, they advise business people on business and investment decisions. Many major business decisions involve the input of fortune tellers. Their social role allows decision risks to be placed outside of the organization and provides a mechanism of quickly randomly deciding between several equally useful options. As [[psychotherapist]]s, they help people discuss and resolve personal issues without the stigma of illness.

The above quote, relating to the "five components" of the good or ill fortune of any given individual, is culturally believed to have come from [[Su Shi]] of the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Fsrcenter"&gt;Fsrcenter. "[http://fsrcenter.blogspot.com/2007/05/su-dong-bos-misinterpreted-saying.html Fsrcenter]." ''Su Dong Po's misinterpreted saying.'' Retrieved on 2008-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a maxim, it continues to remain popular in [[Chinese culture]] today.  Actual interpretations of this quotation vary, as there is no classical text explaining what Su Shi really meant.  Some claim that it signified that a person's destiny is under his or her own control as the "five components" of fortune are mathematically one more than the classical [[four pillars of destiny]], which implies that individuals are in control of their futures on top of their natal "born" fates.&lt;ref name="Fsrcenter" /&gt; Other interpretations may suggest that the order in which the components are stated are important in determining the course of person's life: For example, education (the fifth fortune) is not useful if fate (the first fortune) does not put you in the proper place at the beginning of your life.  Other interpretations may suggest that there is no inherent order to the sequence, but that they are just a list of the five components of a person's fortune.

==An example of a regional ethnic proverb==

{{citation needed span|"Many points lead to one point" is an ancient Chinese proverb, originating from the Jianxi province. It refers to an ancient battle between the powers of good and evil, one of the founding schools of thought of the Chinese formation myth. The giants of evil used tweezers (approximate translation) to stab their opponents, whilst the dragon fairies had none and were losing. Wang won ju of the Good army then devised a cunning plan to divide the tweezers into two, wherein the giants vicariously stabbed themselves and Good triumphed.
The moral of this story is that focusing on one task rather than two always brings greater results.
Whilst not frequently used since ethnic tensions in the cultural revolution of 1966, it still has great meaning to a small minority in rural regions of Jiangxi.|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Chunbun Ancestral Rite.jpg|thumb|The Chunbun Ancestral Rite, a ritual memorial dedicated to the Go of Balhae. |alt=The Tae family members and the Kyeongsan City mayor participates in the annual tradition.]]
'''Chunbun Ancestral Rite''' refers to the [[Death anniversary|annual memorial]] ritual held during [[Chunfen]], or Chunbun in remembrance of the [[Go of Balhae]], the founder of the [[Balhae|Balhae empire]]. The ancestral rite takes place every year in Balhae Village,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksjchnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=431|title=발해황실의 시조, 대조영의 후손 - 경산자치신문|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small town located in [[Gyeongsan]], [[South Korea]]. 

== History ==
The Chunbun Ancestral Rite is a legacy of the [[Balhae|Balhae empire]], a Northeast Asian state that existed from 698 C.E. to 926 C.E. Balhae has recently begun to receive scholarly attention from the Chinese, Korea, Russian, and the Japanese academia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2470382|title=Korea finds some allies in Goguryeo history spat|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FI11Dg03.html|title=Asia Times - News and analysis from Korea; North and South|website=www.atimes.com|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200609/200609130027.html |title=Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea |date=2006-10-19 |access-date=2016-09-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019012559/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200609/200609130027.html |archivedate=2006-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ever since the Chinese government launched the [[Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|Northeast Project]], an endeavor aimed towards amalgamating history of Chinese ethnic minorities under the [[:ko:통일적 다민족국가론|unified multi-ethnic philosophy]]. The Chunbun Ancestral Rite is a significant legacy of the Balhae Empire and is also a channel of voice for Korean descendants of the [[Go of Balhae]] to contend that Balhae is a part of [[History of Korea|Korean history]]. The Chunbun Ancestral Rite is important especially in this context of disputed history.

== Time ==
[[Chunfen]], or Chunbun, refers to the 4th [[solar term]] defined by the traditional East Asian calendar, which divides a year into 24 solar terms. Though the exact date varies from year to year, the rite typically takes place on March 20. Supplies needed for the rite are prepared prior to the day of the memorial. The meal preparation for the rite begins in the morning. The memorial ritual is carried out typically at 11 AM. The ritual ends at approximately 1PM. Meals are provided for visitors for free after the memorial is fully over.

== Location ==
* The rite is held in Balhae Village,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a small town located in [[:ko:송백리|Songbaek-ri]], [[:ko:남천면|Namcheon-myeon]], [[Gyeongsan]], [[North Gyeongsang Province|Gyeongsangbuk-do]], [[South Korea]].The Balhae village was founded in 1592 before the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese invasion of Korea]]. Sun-geum Tae, the assistant secretary of the [[Joseon|Chosun dynasty]], spearheaded the establishment of the village. The Tae family has been living in the area since.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1989">The '''Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade''' ('''CAFT''') is an informal international coalition of grassroots groups that campaign against the production and use of animal fur for clothing and other items. It started in the USA in the 1990s, when [[fur farm]]s were being raided quite regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nocompromise.org/issues/04furwar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916161754/http://www.nocompromise.org/issues/04furwar.html |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CAFT-UK==
There are several CAFT branches around the world, but the one in the [[United Kingdom]] has the biggest internet presence. As at Oct 2008, they are running a campaign against the London-based department store [[Harrods]], because it sells garments containing real fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caft.org.uk/harrods/harrods.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006220619/http://www.caft.org.uk/harrods/harrods.htm |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 CAFT-UK announced the results a two-year investigation into the use of rabbit fur. They infiltrated farms, slaughterhouses, dressing companies, manufacturers and retailers, getting photographic and video evidence of the process.&lt;ref&gt;http://rabbitfur.org/expose.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Too abstract|date=March 2015}}
'''Coolhunting''' is a [[neologism]] coined in the early 1990s referring to a new kind of [[marketing]] professionals who make [[observation]]s and [[prediction]]s in changes of new or existing  [[Cool (aesthetic)|"cool"]] cultural [[fads and trends]]. Coolhunting is also referred to as "trend spotting," and is a subset of [[trend analysis]].

Coolhunters resemble the [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] fashion magazine editors of the 1960s such as [[Nancy White (editor)|Nancy White]] (''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' 1958–1971).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Coolhunters operate mostly in the world of [[street fashion]] and [[design]], but their work also blurs into that of [[Futurology|futurists]] such as [[Faith Popcorn]].

==Business model==

A  coolhunting firm  is a [[marketing agency]] whose exclusive purpose is to conduct [[research]] of the youth demographic. They then compile their data and produce reports detailing emerging and declining trends in [[youth culture]] as well as predictions for future trends. These reports are then sold to various companies whose products target the youth demographic. They also offer [[Consultant|consulting]] services. Coolhunting firms often provide services for some of the largest [[corporation]]s in the world.

Rather than [[outsourcing]] their [[market research]], some companies opt for  in-house  youth culture marketing divisions. These divisions act in much the same way as a coolhunting firm but the reports and data collected remain within the company and are used solely to promote its products. A company will often prefer this form of coolhunting as a way to gain an advantage in the valuable youth market since the research conducted by coolhunting firms is available to anyone willing to pay for it.   [[Viacom]]'s [[MTV]] television network employs  in-house coolhunting.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

==Methods and practices==
Coolhunting is  more than simple [[market research]] because of the nature of the subjects. The teen and preteen market is often referred to as a "stubborn" demographic in that they do not respond as well to blatant [[advertising]] and marketing campaigns targeted at them. Coolhunters therefore must be more stealthy in their methods of gathering information and data.

[[Focus group]]s, though quite obvious in their attempts at gathering information, are very popular among coolhunters as they provide direct insight into the [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s of their target [[demographic]].  Coolhunters will typically gather a group of randomly selected individuals from their target demographic. While one or more market researchers interact with the group, they are often being monitored and [[Document|recorded]] by a non-visible group, because not only do coolhunters want to ''hear'' what their subjects have to say, they also want to ''observe'' their simple mannerisms.

Depending on the nature of the study, the methods of the [[information gathering|information-gathering]] during a focus group interview may be extremely broad, with questions relating to lifestyle and youth culture, or more specific, like comparing certain [[brand]]s and determining which brands the group is most responsive to.

Participants in focus groups are usually rewarded for their participation, whether it be a cash amount, free products, or other rewards.

Coolhunters will often seek out individuals from within their target demographic who are regarded as [[leader]]s or trendsetters. They will then hire these individuals to be ''Cool Narcs'', who gather information secretly among their peers and report their findings back to their employers. This is a popular method of coolhunting as it provides insight into their target demographic within their natural environment.

There are a wide variety of methods for conducting market research online. Popular examples are online [[statistical survey|survey]]s where upon completion, the participant will usually receive a prize or monetary compensation. Other times coolhunters will enter [[chatroom]]s and webgroups posing as an individual within the target demographic and gather information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5670">The '''direct historical approach''' to [[archaeology]] was a methodology developed in the [[United States of America]] during the 1920s-1930s by William Duncan Strong and others, which argued that knowledge relating to historical periods is extended back into earlier times. This methodology involves taking an archaeological site that has historical accounts relating to recent periods of occupation and then excavating it to establish continuity back into prehistoric times. The historical data then becomes the basis of [[analogy]] and [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] for the study of the [[prehistoric communities]] at both the particular site and other sites in the region. The main issue with the approach is that in many parts of the world there is no direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?category=&amp;where=headword&amp;terms=direct+historical+approach&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the nineteenth century, the archaeological record of [[the Americas]] was viewed as an extension into the past of the [[ethnographical]]ly documented record. Human behaviors of the archaeological past were seen as nearly identical to those described ethnographically and thus, they could be studied with minimal training in archaeology. The result of this particular view was the development and regular use of what came to be known as the direct historical approach.

Roland B. Dixon was seen as an early proponent of this approach. In his presidential address to the [[American Anthropological Association]] he stated: “one would logically proceed to investigate a [number of sites of known ethnic affiliation], and work back from these,” because it “is only through the known that we can comprehend the unknown, only from a study of the present that we can understand the past.” Strong, who later became attributed to this particular methodology, argued that Dixon set forth the procedure of the direct historical approach. Strong would later go on to say that “once the archeological criteria of [a historically documented] culture had been determined, it [is] then possible to advance from the known and historic into the unknown and prehistoric.”&lt;ref&gt;http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Oddly, the direct historical approach rarely appears in histories of American anthropology. Similarly, very few texts point out that the direct historical approach was used for three distinct purposes. In American archaeology these were: (1) to identify the cultural association of an archaeological manifestation; (2) to construct relative chronologies of archaeological materials; and (3) to understand the human behaviors that were thought to have produced particular portions of the archaeological record.

==The Direct Historical Approach as a Cultural Identifier==
After the peak of the direct historical approach, Willey wrote about its use as a means of assigning [[ethnic identity]] to archaeological phenomena. He explained: “through a series of successive periods prehistoric cultures were linked to [[proto-historic]], historic, and modern descendants. This type of study, sometimes called the ‘direct historical approach,’ has a theoretical basis in cultural continuity. Starting with known, documented habitation sites, certain cultural assemblages were identified and associated with particular tribal groups. Earlier archaeological assemblages were then sought which were not too sharply divergent from the known historic ones, and the procedure was followed backwards in time…The establishment of prehistoric-to-historic continuity is of utmost importance as a springboard for further archaeological interpretation, and, along with general chronological and distributive studies, it is one of the primary historical problems for the American archaeologist.”&lt;ref&gt;http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most famously, Cyrus Thomas used the reasoning of the direct historical approach to demonstrate that various earthworks scattered across the eastern and midwestern portions of America (mounds) were produced by the direct genetic and cultural ancestors of historically documented ethnic groups (the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]).

==The Direct Historical Approach in Establishing Chronology==
In much the same way that the direct historical approach was used to demonstrate ancestor-descendant relationships, it was also used to measure the passage of time (also called chronology). This process involves creating time-based sequences of artifacts by starting with a list of cultural traits related to specific artifact types and then working into the past by determining which traits/artifact types were held by archaeologically represented cultures. Through this theoretical sorting, one can study more than ethnic identification by establishing time-based sequences. After ethnic identification and chronology has been established, the direct historical approach becomes the basis of analogy.&lt;ref&gt;http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues with the Direct Historical Approach==
There are large parts of the world that are without direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region. Without this connection, the direct historical approach lacks purpose and is unable to enhance archaeological study. If this is the case, archaeologists rely on other archaeological theories and methods.

'''Dom Pérignon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|m|p|ɛr|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɒ|n}}; {{IPA-fr|dɔ̃ peʁiɲɔ̃}}) is a brand of vintage [[Champagne wine|Champagne]] produced by the [[List of Champagne houses|Champagne house]] [[Moët &amp; Chandon]] and serves as that house's prestige champagne. It is named after [[Dom Pérignon (monk)|Dom Pérignon]], a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] who was an important quality pioneer for Champagne wine but who, contrary to popular myths, did not discover the [[Traditional method|champagne method]] for making [[sparkling wine]]s.&lt;ref name="Kladstrup pg 38"&gt;D. &amp; P. Kladstrup ''Champagne'', p. 38 Harper Collins Publisher, {{ISBN|0-06-073792-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dom Pérignon (1638–1715) was a [[monk]] and cellar master at the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] in [[Hautvillers]]. He pioneered a number of winemaking techniques around 1670—being the first to blend grapes in such a way as to improve the quality of wines, balance one element with another in order to make a better whole, and deal with a number of their imperfections; perfecting the art of producing clear white wines from black grapes by clever manipulation of the presses; enhancing the tendency of Champagne wines to retain their natural sugar in order to naturally induce secondary fermentation in the spring; being a master at deciding when to bottle these wines in order to capture the bubble. He also introduced corks (instead of wood), which were fastened to bottles with [[hemp]] string soaked in oil in order to keep the wines fresh and sparkling, and used thicker glass in order to strengthen the bottles (which were prone to explode at that time).&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe pp. 13-14"&gt;Sutcliffe, Serena, "A Celebration of Champagne", pp. 13–14, Mitchell Beazley 1988, {{ISBN|0-85-533697-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of sparkling wines as the main style of production in Champagne occurred progressively in the 19th century, more than a century after Dom Pérignon's death.

Dom Pérignon was the first prestige ''[[cuvée]]'' Champagne introduced, an idea proposed by Englishman Laurence Venn.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;Stevenson, Tom, ''Decanter'' (December 2007) "The Best A Man Can Get", p.65&lt;/ref&gt; The first vintage of Dom Pérignon was 1921 and was only released for sale in 1936, sailing to New York in the liner ''Normandie''.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe p. 130"&gt;Sutcliffe, Serena, "A Celebration of Champagne", p. 130, Mitchell Beazley 1988, {{ISBN|0-85-533697-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The brand, not exploited, was given by Champagne Mercier to Moët in 1927 for a wedding between the two families.

[[File:Dom Perignon 1999.jpg|thumb|alt=Dom Pérignon champagne|Bottle of Dom Pérignon]]

In 1935, 300 bottles of a 1926-vintage precursor to Dom Pérignon were sold to Simon Bros. &amp; Co., the company that imported Moët in the United Kingdom, who gave two bottles to each of their 150 best customers to commemorate their centenary. While these bottles were almost identical to the subsequent Dom Pérignon releases, they did not display the Dom Pérignon name, rather "Champagne specially shipped for Simon Brothers &amp; Co's Centenary 1835-1935." The wine got immediate attention in the marketplace and 100 boxes of the 1921 vintage were shipped to the United States shortly thereafter, this time displaying the Dom Pérignon name.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Tom, The World of Fine Wine (March 25, 2014) [http://www.worldoffinewine.com/news/dom-prignon-oenothque-19661996-4207945/ "Dom Pérignon Oenothèque 1966-1996"]&lt;/ref&gt; James Buchanan Duke, the billionaire who had founded the [[American Tobacco Company]], ordered 100 bottles for himself. The 17 bottles sold at an auction in [[Christie's]] in New York City in June 2004 were part of that order (Doris Duke, the billionaire’s daughter, had kept them in her cellar). According to current Dom Pérignon cellar master Richard Geoffroy (2012), who has been Chef de Cave for Dom Pérignon since 1990, the 1921 vintage had a "distinctive bouquet comprising [[sandalwood]], [[vanilla]] and [[praline]]".&lt;ref&gt;richardgeoffroy-domperignon.com [http://www.creatingdomperignon.com/ Blog of Dom Pérignon cellar master Richard Geoffroy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1943 vintage, Dom Pérignon was produced from regular vintage Moët &amp; Chandon Champagne that was transferred to the special 18th century-style bottles after extended cellaring. It was, thus, effectively an ''"oenothèque"'' release of Moët &amp; Chandon Vintage Champagne in a different bottle. From the 1947 vintage, Dom Pérignon has been produced separately from the start.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Juhlin]], ''Champagne Guide'', Richard Juhlin Publishing, 2008, p. 315, {{ISBN|978-91-633-3190-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the [[Shah of Iran]] ordered several bottles of the first vintage of Dom Pérignon Rosé (the 1959) for the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]]. A bottle of that champagne, from that order, was sold at auction for €24,758 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Howard G., Decanter.com (April 29, 2008). [http://www.decanter.com/wine-news/acker-merrall-sells-shahs-champagne-82568/ "Acker Merrall sells 'Shah's Champagne'"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Dom Pérignon was chosen for the wedding of [[Lady Diana Spencer]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The magnums of Dom Pérignon Vintage 1961 served on that July 29 carried a special insignia created just for the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Celeste, Rigel, Luxist.com (February 28, 2010). [http://www.luxist.com/2010/02/28/dom-perignon-wedding/ Dom Pérignon Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vintages==

Dom Pérignon is always a [[vintage]] champagne, meaning that it is not made in weak years, and all grapes used to make the wine were harvested in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domperignon.com/image/home-vintages/|title=CHAMPAGNES|first=Dom|last=Pérignon|date=17 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1921 to 2009, Dom Pérignon champagne has been produced in 42 vintages. More than two vintage years in a row used to be a rare phenomenon, which until 2004 had only occurred three times: in 1969, 1970, and 1971; in 1998, 1999, and 2000; in 2002, 2003, and 2004. 2006 marked the first time when five vintages had been produced in a row.

The 42 white Dom Pérignon vintages up to 2009 are: 1921, 1926, 1928, 1929, 1934, 1943, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2009.&lt;ref name=vintagearchives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domperignon.com/image/vintages-archives/|title=Market International English|first=Dom|last=Pérignon|website=Market International English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1959 a [[rosé]] version of Dom Pérignon is also produced. 24 Dom Pérignon Rosé vintages have been produced until 2004: 1959, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1986 (the only rosé vintage where the white version was not produced), 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004.&lt;ref name="vintagearchives" /&gt;

==Style==

Dom Pérignon is always an assemblage of Pinot noir and Chardonnay grapes, although the final composition changes every vintage: at times a blend in perfectly equal proportions (e.g. 1990 Rosé), at times up to 60% [[Chardonnay]] (1982) or 60% [[Pinot noir]] (1969), and only once going over 60% (with 65% Chardonnay in 1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatingdomperignon.com/l-assemblage/ |title=Dom Pérignon assemblage |publisher=creatingdomperignon.com/ |date= |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Geoffroy's Manifesto and blog: "Dom Pérignon expresses its first plénitude after seven years in the cellar", with a second plénitude 12 to 15 years after the vintage (first Œnothèque release, now referred to as P2) and a third plénitude after 30 to 40 years (second Œnothèque release, now referred to as P3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatingdomperignon.com/category/manifesto/?theme=8 |title=Dom Pérignon's Manifesto |publisher=creatingdomperignon.com/ |date= |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creatingdomperignon.com/plenitudes/ |title=Plénitudes/ |publisher=creatingdomperignon.com/ |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725192724/http://www.creatingdomperignon.com/plenitudes/ |archivedate=25 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2016, the producer stopped using the Œnothèque designation and started labeling new plénitude releases as P2 or P3, providing more clarity to the disgorgement date than the Œnothèque designation. The grapes entering the blend come from the best, most sunlit sites. Serena Sutcliffe comments: "With age, Dom Pérignon takes on a totally seductive fresh-toast-and-coffee bouquet, one of the most intriguing scents in Champagne."&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe p. 130"/&gt;

==Current production==
The number of bottles produced in each vintage is not precisely defined, although it is at least 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Bottles produced: [http://gje.mabulle.com/index.php/2008/08/21/153574-guides-vins-2009-guide-bettane-desseauve-et-guide-de-la-rvf  2 millions here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bottles produced: [http://www.idealwine.net/blog/2010/03/24/dom-perignon-lance-sa-cuvee-oenotheque-rose/ 4 millions there]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

As of October 2017, the current release of Dom Pérignon is from the 2009 vintage and the current release of Dom Pérignon Rosé is from the 2004 vintage.&lt;ref name="vintagearchives" /&gt;

== Auction market ==
Dom Pérignon is often traded at [[wine auction]]s, where it is frequently termed "DP". A recent wave of auction price records started in 2004, with the sale of the Doris Duke collection at Christie’s in New York City. Three bottles of Dom Pérignon 1921 sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]24,675. In 2008, two sales held by Acker Merrall &amp; Condit also left their mark on the history of Dom Pérignon, with three magnums of Dom Pérignon Œnothèque (1966, 1973 and 1976) selling for US$93,260 in Hong Kong, and a lot of two bottles of the legendary Dom Pérignon Rosé Vintage 1959 selling for US$84,700 in New York. Only 306 bottles of the 1959 Rosé Vintage were produced, and they were never sold. In 1971, it was served in Persepolis at the lavish festivities celebrating the 2500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great.&lt;ref&gt;finewine.finewinepress.com [http://finewine.finewinepress.com/archives/40 Acker Merrall &amp; Condit HK sale shatters all records] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210023613/http://finewine.finewinepress.com/archives/40 |date=December 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2010 a new record was set for a sale of wine in Britain according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. A buyer would have spent more than [[Pound sterling|£]]35,000 for [[Wine bottle|Methuselah]] (6 litre) 1996 Dom Perignon Champagne Rose (Rose Gold). This transaction took place at the Westbury Hotel at a party that followed the screening of the new film, ''Boogie Woogie''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'' (April 17, 2010). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7597288/Bottle-of-vintage-Dom-Perignon-bought-in-bar-for-35000.html Bottle of vintage Dom Perignon bought in bar for £35,000]&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical of Dom Pérignon Rosé Œnothèque, a world premiere release from the reserve cellar of Dom Pérignon, never commercially released before, was sold at a record price at a wine auction organized by Sotheby's in Hong Kong in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;sothebys.com [http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotResultsDetailList.jsp?action=J&amp;event_id=30224&amp;sale_number=HK0335&amp;lots_per_page=100&amp;page_number=4&amp;show_lot_name=Y Sotheby's auction page]&lt;/ref&gt; The 30 bottle lot of Dom Pérignon Œnothèque Rosé bottles and magnums from 1966, 1978, 1982, 1985, 1988, and 1990 achieved HK$1,331,000 (US$170,641), setting the world auction record for a single lot of champagne and is the first HK$1 million lot of wine Sotheby’s has sold in Hong Kong.

'''DoshTracker''' is a [[currency bill tracking]] website that allows [[pound sterling]] [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]] to be tracked around the [[United Kingdom]] and abroad. Originally launched in 2001, it was relaunched in 2012.

''Dosh'' is a British slang term for money.

==History==
The concept of the website is based on [[Where's George?]], which follows American currency, and in the same way allows users to enter the serial number on notes that they own and see where it has been.

This site originally operated between 2001 and 2006 but was taken down due to lack of free time on the site owner Richard Dutton's behalf, tracking its last note on 18 May 2006.

The site was relaunched on 1 January 2012.

==Controversy==
The site discourages marking the notes with any sort of identification such as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], as defacing of bank notes is technically illegal.

==Press Coverage==
Shortly after the site's launch in 2001, its reputation quickly spread and it gained a relatively large amount of media coverage and reviews from both internet, radio and written media, they included;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4622">"'''Edward the Conqueror'''" is a short story written by [[Roald Dahl]] and first published in the 31 October 1953 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Roald Dahl|title=Edward the Conqueror|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1953/10/31/edward-the-conqueror|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=22 January 2015|page=28|date=31 October 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The story is about a man (Edward) and his wife (Louisa). A long haired silver cat is nearly burnt in the bonfire that Edward set up for the autumn leaves, but his wife rescues it.  After the couple unsuccessfully attempts to send the cat back to its home, Edward decides that if the cat does not leave by the coming afternoon, he will ask the police to make sure it is returned home.  

While Louisa is admiring the cat's color, she notices that it has warts on his face.  After she is done admiring the cat, Louisa begins to play one of her daily concerts (a solitary pleasure that also seems to be one of her greatest passions).  She chooses some pieces by [[Vivaldi]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]],  [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Brahms]].  Immediately, the cat reacts strongly, and even appears to be "appreciating the work". The cat seems to be especially enthralled when Louisa plays Liszt's [[Petrarch Sonnets]] and [[Weihnachtsbaum (Liszt)|''Der Weihnachtsbaum'']], but less impressed with Schumann's ''[[Kinderszenen]]''. 

Louisa becomes convinced that the cat is the [[reincarnation]] of Liszt, and informs her husband. Edward isn't convinced, even when his wife shows him Liszt's reaction to the piano music. Edward believes the cat's reactions to simply be a trick it was trained to perform, and refuses to take part in his wife's excitement (it is implied that he is not as fond of music as Louisa). Louisa decides to go to the library to find out more about both Liszt and reincarnation.  The book she checks out on reincarnation is very assertive about how long it takes one to be reincarnated (longer if your social status is higher).  The book also says that you can't come back as a lower form of animal—a fact Louisa chooses to ignore as it would seem to contradict her cat previously having been Franz Liszt (also, for Liszt to come back so soon he would have to be classified under "unskilled labourers").  Finally, it mentions historical figures who were, it suggests, reincarnations of one another ([[Epictetus]], for instance, came back as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]).  Despite her incredulity, Louisa appears to believe what she is reading.  She greets Edward returning from his work by saying, "Listen, my dear, did you know that [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was once Caesar's wife?"

When she gets back from the library she calls for Liszt and examines him.  She notices that the cat's warts are positioned on its face in exactly the same positions as the warts on Liszt's face were.  She even notices that the cat seems to dislike one particular [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] scherzo (the only piece of Chopin's that Liszt himself didn't love).  By this time, Edward has become noticeably antagonistic to his wife's belief (perhaps spurred on by jealousy).  Her plans are to tell the world, after which she believes that all the world's musicians will want to come and meet her cat.  Edward thinks that her plans will make the two of them look like fools.

Louisa decides to cook a fancy dinner for the cat, and refuses to let her husband sway her.  When she returns from the kitchen, she sees Edward coming in from the garden with black smoke, wet trouser cuffs, and long scratches from his wrist to his knuckle—the implication being that he has thrown the cat on the fire. Louisa is horrified and falls into hysterics as Edward tries to calm her down.

==Television adaptation==

When this story was adapted for television in a 1979 episode of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (Season 1, Episode 7),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tales of the Unexpected: Edward the Conqueror|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717440|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ending was slightly changed. As Louisa deduces her husband has thrown the cat on the fire, she grabs a knife and it is implied she attacks him. However, the cat enters the house through a window, fine after all.

'''El Shaddai DWXI Prayer Partners Fellowship International''', popularly known as '''El Shaddai'''  ({{lang-he|אֵל שַׁדַּי}}, {{IPA-he|el ʃaˈdːaj|IPA}}, {{Language with name/for||Hebrew|God Almighty}}, which is one of the [[names of God in Judaism|names of God in Jewish faith]]) is the biggest [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal|Catholic charismatic movement]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Investing in Miracles: El Shaddai and the Transformation of Popular Catholicism in the Philippines|year=2007|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|author=Katharine L. Wiegele}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=155|author=Allan Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is led by Brother [[Mike Velarde]], a [[real estate development|real estate developer]] and [[preacher]]. [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]] [[auxiliary bishop]] Most Rev. Teodoro C. Bacani, Jr. serves as its spiritual adviser.

== History ==
Inspired by his recovery from a heart ailment in 1978, Mike Velarde started a weekly Bible-quoting radio show on [[DWXI-AM|DWXI]], a station he acquired in 1982 as part of a real estate deal. Listeners, he says, began reporting that his voice had cured their afflictions.&lt;ref name="Filipino Reporter"&gt;"Pacman deep into Bible study." ''Filipino Reporter'' 23 Mar. 2012: 21. ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 15 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, Velarde called his show "[[El Shaddai]]," a biblical name for God that he found in an American religious pamphlet.&lt;ref name="Filipino Reporter"/&gt;

Velarde then held monthly prayer rallies outside the vicinity of the radio station. As the number of attendees kept growing, he made the rallies weekly until the crowd could no longer be accommodated by the area. The rallies were then moved to various locations such as a [[Association football|football]] stadium and then transferring several times to the [[Quirino Grandstand]] at [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]]; the open grounds outside the [[Philippine International Convention Center]] and the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] in [[Pasay City]] near [[Manila Bay]]; and finally in Amvel Business Park, Barangay San Dionisio, [[Parañaque City]] (a site owned by the family) in order to accommodate the movement's followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090820-221130/P1-B-church-of-El-Shaddai-opens-Thursday |title=P1-B church of El Shaddai opens Thursday |work=newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=August 20, 2009 |author=Niña Catherine Calleja |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723223242/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090820-221130/P1-B-church-of-El-Shaddai-opens-Thursday |archivedate=July 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Velarde and [[Jesus Is Lord Church]] leader [[Eddie Villanueva]] engaged in a legal battle over control of the Christian television station [[DZOE-TV]] (Channel 11).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/98/0227/feat1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Villanueva has the franchise and the authority to operate the facility, but Velarde, using political connections, was able to import transmission equipment, the value of which he claims to have converted into equity in the station. [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] intervened and awarded Villanueva the right the acquire the frequency, with him paying Velarde for the stock and assets held by [[Delta Broadcasting System]] (DBS).

El Shaddai Movement has grown rapidly in the last decade and, as of 2005, had a reported 8 million members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51527.htm Philippines: International Religious Freedom Report]. U.S. Department of State (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2009, El Shaddai inaugurated a [[Philippine peso|₱]]1&amp;nbsp;billion (approx. US$21&amp;nbsp;million at the time) House of Prayer on a ten hectare site in Amvel Business Park. The cost does not include the land, which will be paid for over 20 years. The building is 10,000 square meters and seats 16,000 with standing room for another 25,000, with space on the site for an overflow of the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbcpnews.com/?q=node/10155 "El Shaddai P1-B church opens today"]. CBCP News.{{Better source|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was inaugurated by [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|fourteenth]] [[President of the Philippines]], on Velarde's 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090821-221325 "Velarde opens El Shaddai church"]. The Philippine Daily Inquirer. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is a Roman Catholic movement, its diocesan bishop is Rev Jessie Mercado of the [[Diocese of Parañaque]], while its Spiritual Director is the [[Diocese of Novaliches|Bishop ''Emeritus'' of Novaliches]] Teodoro Bacani.

==Political influence==
[[Conspiracy theorist]]s propagate the belief that El Shaddai plays a major role in [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine politics]]. They assert that former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] won the [[Philippine general election, 1992|1992 general election]] because of the movement's votes, although this has never been corroborated with an actual tally of votes correlated with El Shaddai membership rosters. Moreover, the Catholic Church, of which El Shaddai is an apostolate, refrains from interfering in temporal matters and, as such, does not dictate to its members which candidates to support or oppose.&lt;ref name=catvote&gt;Lockwood, R. P. (2008, July 11). "[http://www.catholic.com/radio/shows/catholic-urban-legends-the-catholic-vote-3597 Catholic urban legends: The Catholic vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225124614/http://www.catholic.com/radio/shows/catholic-urban-legends-the-catholic-vote-3597 |date=2016-02-25 }}". ''Catholic Answers''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akin, J. (2015, September 18). "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHwpI1_A8YA Is voting for pro-abortion politicians sinful?]" ''Catholic Answers''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, ''individual'' members of the Catholic Church are free to form [[voting bloc]]s that are independent from the Church itself, as in the case of [[CatholicVote.org|Catholic Vote]].

During the impeachment trial of President [[Joseph Estrada]] in late 2000, Velarde, in line with Catholic teaching regarding temporal matters, rejected the call of then-[[Archbishop of Manila]] [[Jaime Sin|Jaime Cardinal Sin]] to join a prayer rally urging Estrada to resign. Velarde said that El Shaddai members were free to join the rally of their own volition and reiterated that the movement was neither for nor against Estrada's resignation.&lt;ref name=catvote /&gt;

It was reported that Velarde attempted to end a [[Philippine electoral crisis, 2005|2005 Philippine electoral crisis]] by uniting the Estrada and Arroyo camps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313224720/http://news.inquirer.net/nation/index.php?index=1&amp;story_id=47753 Velarde: Arroyo open to joint rule with foes] (archived from [http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&amp;story_id=47753 the original] on 2007-03-11).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2005, Katharine L. Wiegele said that El Shaddai has spread [[prosperity theology]] outside [[Protestant]] Christianity in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wiegele | first = Katharine L. | title = Investing in Miracles: El Shaddai and the Transformation of Popular Catholicism in the Philippines | year = 2005 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | isbn = 978-0-8248-2861-5 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national flag|national]] '''flag of the Gambia''' consists of three horizontal red, blue and green bands separated by two thin white fimbriations.  Adopted in 1965 to replace the British [[Blue Ensign]] [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the arms of the [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate]], it has been the flag of the Republic of [[the Gambia]] since the country gained independence that year.  It remained unchanged throughout the Gambia's seven-year [[Senegambia Confederation|confederation with Senegal]].

==History==
[[File:Flag of The Gambia (1889-1965).svg|thumb|right|Flag of the [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate]] (1889–1965).]]
The British first arrived in what is now modern-day Gambia in 1661, when they conquered [[Kunta Kinteh Island|James Island]].  They proceeded to construct forts around the [[confluence]] of the [[Gambia River]] with the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and gradually expanded their control upstream.  This area became a [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|protectorate]] in the 1820s under the jurisdiction of [[History of Sierra Leone#Colonial era .281800 - 1961.29|Sierra Leone]], and eventually emerged as a separate [[crown colony]] of the [[United Kingdom]] within [[British Empire|its colonial empire]] in 1888.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The Gambia|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-gambia/history|date=|accessdate=May 21, 2014|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This newfound status gave the Gambia its own "distinctive" colonial flag.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Whitney|last=Smith|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Gambia, flag of The|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355244/flag-of-the-Gambia|accessdate=May 21, 2014|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}} '''{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because colonies were permitted to utilize the British [[Blue Ensign]] and [[Defacement (flag)|deface]] it with the arms of the territory under the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1860–79#1865 .2828 .26 29 Vict..29|Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865]].  The arms of the Gambia at the time consisted of a circle depicting an [[elephant]], a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]] and hills, along with the letter "G" standing for the first letter of the territory's name.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The Gambia was granted self-governance in 1963.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;  The defaced blue ensign continued to be used until full independence was granted in 1965.{{sfn|Dorling Kindersley|2008|p=77}}  The winning design for the new flag was created by Louis Thomasi, who worked as an accountant.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIpEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=flag+of+the+gambia+louis+thomasi&amp;dq=flag+of+the+gambia+louis+thomasi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mzJ9U8bpC4Sr7AbB_YDYAg&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The voice of the people: the story of the PPP, 1959–1989|publisher=Baroueli|year=1992|last=Dabo|first=Bakary|accessdate=May 22, 2014|quote=… Mr. Louis Thomasi, a private accountant, was selected as most suitable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the few [[Africa]]n flags that does not utilize the colours of the country's leading [[political party]], since its design "has no political basis".{{sfn|Dorling Kindersley|2008|p=77}}{{sfn|Dorling Kindersley|2008|p=101}}  It was first hoisted at midnight on February 18, 1965, the day the Gambia became an independent country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1965: Countdown to Gambian independence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/17/newsid_2546000/2546949.stm|work=BBC On This Day|publisher=BBC|date=|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gambia Flag Takes Place of Union Jack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Td0jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mCcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4641,3542659&amp;dq=flag+of+the+gambia&amp;hl=en|date=February 18, 1965|accessdate=May 22, 2014|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982, the Gambia formed a [[Senegambia Confederation|confederation with Senegal]], which lasted for seven years before its dissolution in 1989.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;  However, this closer union did not result in change of national symbols, and the Gambian flag continued to be flown during this time.{{sfn|Dorling Kindersley|2008|p=77}}

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings.  The blue alludes to the [[Gambia River]], which is the nation's key feature and is where the country derives its name from.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;  The red evokes the sun – given the Gambia's close proximity to the [[Equator]]&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; – as well as the [[savanna]],{{sfn|Dorling Kindersley|2008|p=77}}&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Gambia, The|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html|date=|accessdate=May 22, 2014|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the thin white stripes represent "unity and peace".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;  The green epitomizes the forest{{sfn|Dorling Kindersley|2008|p=77}} and the agricultural goods that the Gambian people are heavily dependent on, both for exports and their personal use.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Similarities===
The flag's colour scheme of red, blue, green and white is the same as the one featured on the [[coat of arms of the Gambia]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

'''Forgiveness''' is the intentional and voluntary process by which a victim undergoes a change in feelings and attitude regarding an [[Crime|offense]], lets go of negative [[emotion]]s such as [[vengefulness]], forswears recompense from or punishment of the offender, however legally or morally justified it might be, and with an increased ability to wish the offender well.&lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110626153005/http://www.apa.org/international/resources/forgiveness.pdf | archive-date=2011-06-26 | url = http://www.apa.org/international/resources/forgiveness.pdf | title = American Psychological Association.

In certain contexts, forgiveness is a [[Law|legal]] term for absolving or giving up all claims on account of [[debt]], [[loan]], obligation, or other claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=555 Debt Forgiveness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031215222/http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=555 |date=2013-10-31 }} OECD, Glossary of Statistical Terms (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service Loan Forgiveness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113023609/http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service |date=2013-11-13 }} Glossary, U.S. Department of Education&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[psychological]] concept and [[virtue]], the benefits of forgiveness have been explored in [[religion|religious]] thought, the [[social science]]s and [[medicine]]. Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the person who forgives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|page=268|ISBN=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including forgiving themself, in terms of the person forgiven or in terms of the relationship between the forgiver and the person forgiven. In most contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of [[restorative justice]], and without any response on the part of the offender (for example, one may forgive a person who is [[wikt:incommunicado|incommunicado]] or dead). In practical terms, it may be necessary for the offender to offer some form of acknowledgment, an [[wikt:apology|apology]], or even just ask for forgiveness, in order for the wronged person to believe themselves able to forgive as well.&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt;

Social and political dimensions of forgiveness involves the strictly private and religious sphere of "forgiveness". The notion of "forgiveness" is generally considered unusual in the political field. However, Hannah Arendt considers that the "faculty of forgiveness" has its place in public affairs. The philosopher believes that forgiveness can liberate resources both individually and collectively in the face of the irreparable. During an investigation in Rwanda on the discourses and practices of forgiveness after the 1994 genocide, sociologist Benoit Guillou illustrated the extreme [[polysemy]] of the word "forgiveness" but also the eminently political character of the notion. By way of conclusion of his work, the author proposes four main figures of forgiveness to better understanding, on the one hand, ambiguous uses and, on the other hand, the conditions under which forgiveness can mediate a resumption of social link.&lt;ref name="BenoitGuillou"&gt;{{cite web|year=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105223352/https://blogbenoitguillou.net/ |url=https://blogbenoitguillou.net/ |archive-date=2016-11-05 |title=''Benoît Guillou, Le pardon est-il durable ?

Most world religions include teachings on the nature of forgiveness, and many of these teachings provide an underlying basis for many varying modern day traditions and practices of forgiveness. Some religious [[doctrine]]s or [[philosophies]] place greater emphasis on the need for humans to find some sort of [[divine]] forgiveness for their own shortcomings, others place greater emphasis on the need for humans to practice forgiveness of one another, yet others make little or no distinction between human and divine forgiveness.

Although there is presently no consensus for a psychological definition of forgiveness in the research literature, agreement has emerged that forgiveness is a process and a number of models describing the process of forgiveness have been published, including one from a radical behavioral perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J., Cautilli, J., Simon, C. &amp; Axelrod-Sabtig, R (2006).

Dr. Robert Enright from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] founded the International Forgiveness Institute and is considered the initiator of forgiveness studies. He developed a 20-Step Process Model of Forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Robert Enright, ''Forgiveness is a Choice'', American Psychological Association, 2001 {{ISBN|1-55798-757-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has focused on what kind of person is more likely to be forgiving. A longitudinal study showed that people who were generally more [[neuroticism|neurotic]], [[Anger|angry]], and hostile in life were less likely to forgive another person even after a long time had passed. Specifically, these people were more likely to still avoid their transgressor and want to enact revenge upon them two and a half years after the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Maltby, J., Wood, A. M., Day, L., Kon, T. W. H., Colley, A., and Linley, P. A. (2008).

Studies show that people who forgive are [[happiness|happier]] and [[health]]ier than those who hold resentments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.forgiving.org | title = Forgiving (Campaign for Forgiveness Research) | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615102050/http://www.forgiving.org/ | archivedate = 2006-06-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first study to look at how forgiveness improves physical health discovered that when people think about forgiving an offender it leads to improved functioning in their [[Cardiovascular System|cardiovascular]] and [[nervous system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Oyen, C.

In three separate studies, including one with [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] from [[Northern Ireland]] whose family members were murdered in [[The Troubles|the political violence]], he found that people who are taught how to forgive become less angry, feel less hurt, are more [[Optimism|optimistic]], become more forgiving in a variety of situations, and become more compassionate and self-confident.

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Repentance in Judaism}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Judaism]] --&gt;

In [[Judaism]], if a person causes harm, but then sincerely and honestly apologizes to the wronged individual and tries to rectify the wrong, the wronged individual is encouraged, but not required, to grant forgiveness:

* "It is forbidden to be obdurate and not allow yourself to be appeased. On the contrary, one should be easily pacified and find it difficult to become angry. When asked by an offender for forgiveness, one should forgive with a sincere mind and a willing spirit&amp;nbsp;... forgiveness is natural to the seed of Israel." ([[Mishneh Torah]], ''[[Teshuvah]]'' 2:10)

In Judaism, one must go ''to those he has harmed'' in order to be entitled to forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Yom Kippur"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm | title = ''JewFAQ discussion of forgiveness on Yom Kippur'' | accessdate = 2006-04-26 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160823211009/http://www.jfst.se/wp-content/uploads/Luach-2015-2016.pdf | archivedate = 2016-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [One who sincerely apologizes three times for a wrong committed against another has fulfilled their obligation to seek forgiveness. ([[Shulchan Aruch]]) OC 606:1] This means that in Judaism a person cannot obtain forgiveness from [[God in Judaism|God]] for wrongs the person has done to other people. This also means that, unless the victim forgave the perpetrator before he died, [[Thou shalt not kill#Jewish doctrine|murder]] is unforgivable in Judaism, and they will answer to God for it, though the victims' family and friends can forgive the murderer for the [[grief]] they caused them. The ''[[Jewish prayer|Tefila]] Zaka'' [[Jewish meditation|meditation]], which is recited just before [[Yom Kippur]], closes with the following:

* "I know that there is no one so righteous that they have not wronged another, financially or physically, through deed or speech. This pains my heart within me, because wrongs between humans and their fellow are not atoned by Yom Kippur, until the wronged one is appeased. Because of this, my heart breaks within me, and my bones tremble; for even the day of death does not atone for such sins. Therefore I prostrate and beg before You, to have mercy on me, and grant me grace, compassion, and mercy in Your eyes and in the eyes of all people. For behold, I forgive with a final and resolved forgiveness anyone who has wronged me, whether in person or property, even if they slandered me, or spread falsehoods against me. So I release anyone who has injured me either in person or in property, or has committed any manner of sin that one may commit against another [except for legally enforceable business obligations, and except for someone who has deliberately harmed me with the thought ‘I can harm him because he will forgive me']. Except for these two, I fully and finally forgive everyone; may no one be punished because of me. And just as I forgive everyone, '''so may You grant me grace in the eyes of others, that they too forgive me absolutely'''." [emphasis added]

Thus the "reward" for forgiving others is not God's forgiveness for wrongs done to others, but rather help ''in obtaining forgiveness from the other person.''

Sir [[Jonathan Sacks]], [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[List of Chief Rabbis of the United Hebrew Congregations|United Hebrew Congregations]] of the Commonwealth, summarized: "it is not that God forgives, while human beings do not. To the contrary, we believe that just as only God can forgive sins against God, so only human beings can forgive sins against human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.chiefrabbi.org/thoughts/vayigash5766.pdf |title=''Covenant and Conversation'' |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319205218/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/thoughts/vayigash5766.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews observe a Day of Atonement Yom Kippur on the day before God makes decisions regarding what will happen during the coming year.&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt; [[Ten Days of Repentance|Just prior]] to Yom Kippur, [[Jews]] will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year (if they have not already done so).&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt; During Yom Kippur itself, Jews [[Ta'anit|fast]] and pray for God's forgiveness for the [[Jewish views on sin|transgressions]] they have made against God in the prior year.&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt; Sincere [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged.&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt;

==== Christianity ====
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Return of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Rembrandt]] – "The Return of the [[Prodigal Son]]]] 

Forgiveness is central to Christian ethics and is a frequent topic in sermons and theological works. Considering [[Mark 11]]:25, and [[Matthew 6:14–15]], that follows the [[Lord's Prayer]], "For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.," Forgiveness is not an option to a [[Christianity|Christian]], rather one must forgive to be a Christian.

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] speaks of the importance of [[Christian]]s forgiving or showing [[Mercy#Christianity|mercy]] towards others. Jesus used the [[Parable of the unforgiving servant|parable of the unmerciful servant]] ([[Matthew 18]]:21–35) to say that we should forgive without limits. [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.comparativereligion.com/prodigal.html | title = The Parable of the Prodigal Son in Christianity and Buddhism | accessdate = 2009-02-03 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090201020909/http://comparativereligion.com/prodigal.html | archivedate = 2009-02-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], Jesus repeatedly spoke of forgiveness, "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy." [[Matthew 5:7]] ([[NIV]]) "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift." [[Matthew 5:23–24]] (NIV) "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." [[Mark 11]]:25 (NIV)* "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also." [[Luke 6]]:27–29 (NIV) "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." Luke 6:36 (NIV) "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven." Luke 6:37 (NIV)

Elsewhere, it is said, "Then Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven." Matthew 18:21–22 ([[New King James Version|NKJV]])

Jesus asked for God's forgiveness of those who [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified him]]. "And Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.'" Luke 23: 34 (ESV)

[[Benedict XVI]], on a visit to [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanon]] in 2012, insisted that [[peace]] must be based on mutual forgiveness: "Only forgiveness, given and received, can lay lasting foundations for reconciliation and universal peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20120915_autorita_en.html |title=Apostolic Journey to Lebanon: Meeting with members of the government, institutions of the Republic, the diplomatic corps, religious leaders and representatives of the world of culture (May 25th Hall of the Baabda Presidential Palace, 15 September 2012) &amp;#124; BENEDICT XVI |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024090318/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20120915_autorita_en.html |archivedate=24 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islam ====
{{Allah}}
[[Islam]] teaches that [[God in Islam|Allah]] is ''[[Al-Ghaffur]]'' "The Oft-Forgiving", and is the original source of all forgiveness (''ghufran'' {{lang|ar|[[Wiktionary:غفران|غفران]]}}). Seeking forgiveness from [[Allah]] with [[Repentance in Islam|repentance]] is a [[Virtue#Islam|virtue]].&lt;ref name="nnjre"&gt;Abu-Nimer &amp; Nasser (2013), "Forgiveness in The Arab and Islamic Contexts", ''Journal of Religious Ethics'', 41(3), pp. 474–494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|5|95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| (...) Allah forgives what is past: for repetition Allah will exact from him the penalty. For Allah is Exalted, and Lord of Retribution.|[[Al-Ma'ida|Quran 5]]:95||}}

Islam [[Mustahabb|recommends]] forgiveness, because Allah values forgiveness. There are numerous verses in [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]]s recommending forgiveness. However, Islam also allows [[Qisas|revenge]] to the extent harm done, but forgiveness is encouraged, with a promise of [[Thawab|reward]] from Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Hassan Khalil (2012), ''Islam and the Fate of Others: The Salvation Question'', Oxford University Press, pp. 65–94, {{ISBN|978-0199796663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|42|40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Afw'' ([[Wiktionary:عفو|عفو]] is another term for forgiveness in Islam; it occurs 35 times in Quran, and in some [[Schools of Islamic theology|Islamic theological studies]], it is used interchangeably with ''ghufran''.&lt;ref name="nnjre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="olq"&gt;Oliver Leaman (2005), The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415326391}}, pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shah, S. S. (1996), "Mercy Killing in Islam: Moral and Legal Issues", ''Arab Law Quarterly'', 11(2), pp. 105–115.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Afw'' means to pardon, to excuse for a fault or an offense. According to Muhammad Amanullah,&lt;ref name="maislam"&gt;Amanullah, M. (2004), "Just Retribution (Qisas) Versus Forgiveness (‘Afw)", in ''Islam: Past, Present AND Future'', pp. 871–883; International Seminar on Islamic Thoughts Proceedings, December 2004, Department of Theology and Philosophy, Faculty of Islamic Studies Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt; forgiveness ('Afw) in Islam is derived from three wisdoms. First and the most important wisdom of forgiveness is that it is [[Mercy#Islam|merciful]] when the victim or [[Wali|guardian]] of the victim accepts money instead of revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Gottesman, E. (1991), "Reemergence of Qisas and Diyat in Pakistan, ''Columbia Human Rights Law Review'', 23, pp. 433–439&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, J. A., McCullough, M. E., &amp; Hoyt, W. T. (2005). "Psychometric and Rationalization Accounts of the Religion-Forgiveness Discrepancy", ''Journal of Social Issues'', 61(4), pp. 785–805.&lt;/ref&gt; The second wisdom of forgiveness is that it increases honor and prestige of the one who forgives.&lt;ref name="maislam" /&gt; Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness, humiliation or dishonor.&lt;ref name="olq" /&gt; Forgiveness is honor, raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah, and enables a forgiver to enter [[Jannah|paradise]].&lt;ref name="maislam" /&gt; The third wisdom of forgiveness is that according to some scholars, such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi, forgiveness expiates (''[[Fidyah and Kaffara|kaffarah]]'') the forgiver from the sins they may have committed at other occasions in life.&lt;ref name="olq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khalil Athamina (1992), "Al-Qisas: its emergence, religious origin and its socio-political impact on early Muslim society", ''Studia Islamica'', pp. 53–74&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is a form of charity (''[[Sadaqah|sadaqat]]''). Forgiveness comes from [[taqwa]] (piety), a quality of [[Fear of God|God-fearing]] people.&lt;ref name="maislam" /&gt;

==== Bahá'í Faith ====
In the [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í Writings]], this explanation is given of how to be forgiving towards others:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Love the creatures for the sake of God and not for themselves. You will never become angry or impatient if you love them for the sake of God. Humanity is not perfect. There are imperfections in every human being, and you will always become unhappy if you look toward the people themselves. But if you look toward God, you will love them and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy. Therefore, do not look at the shortcomings of anybody; see with the sight of forgiveness."
&lt;br&gt; — [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace'', p. 92
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
In [[Buddhism]], forgiveness is seen as a practice to prevent harmful thoughts from causing havoc on one's mental well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.psychjourney.com/Buddhism%20Series.htm | title = Psychjourney – Introduction to Buddhism Series | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414062806/http://www.psychjourney.com/Buddhism%20Series.htm | archivedate = 2006-04-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism recognizes that [[Vedanā|feelings]] of [[Dvesha (Buddhism)|hatred]] and [[Vyāpāda|ill-will]] leave a lasting effect on our mind [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]. Instead, Buddhism encourages the cultivation of thoughts that leave a wholesome effect. "In contemplating the law of karma, we realize that it is not a matter of seeking revenge but of practicing [[mettā]] and forgiveness, for the victimizer is, truly, the most unfortunate of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/universal_loving_kindness/#top | title = Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery - Universal Loving Kindness | accessdate = 2009-02-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082606/http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/universal_loving_kindness/#top | archivedate = 2008-12-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When resentments have already arisen, the Buddhist view is to calmly proceed to release them by going back to their roots. Buddhism centers on release from delusion and suffering through [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and receiving insight into the nature of [[Reality in Buddhism|reality]].
Buddhism questions the reality of the [[Raga (Buddhism)|passions]] that make forgiveness necessary as well as the reality of the objects of those passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://josephsoleary.typepad.com/my_weblog/buddhism/index.html | title = Spirit of Vatican II: Buddhism – Buddhism and Forgiveness | accessdate = 2009-02-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208080949/http://josephsoleary.typepad.com/my_weblog/buddhism/index.html | archivedate = 2008-12-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "If we haven’t forgiven, we keep creating an identity around our pain, and that is what is reborn. That is what suffers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/preparing_for_death/#top | title = Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery - Preparing for Death | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060118231818/http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/preparing_for_death/#top | archivedate = 2006-01-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism places much emphasis on the concepts of ''Mettā'' (loving kindness), ''[[Karuṇā|karuna]]'' (compassion), ''[[mudita]]'' (sympathetic joy), and ''[[upekkhā]]'' (equanimity), as a means to avoiding resentments in the first place. These reflections are used to understand the context of suffering in the world, both our own and the suffering of others.

In [[Vedic period#Literature|Vedic literature]] and [[Indian epic poetry|epics]] of [[Hinduism]], ''Ksama'' or ''Kshyama'' ([[Sanskrit]]: [[Wiktionary:क्षमा|क्षमा]])&lt;ref&gt;See entry for [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=forgiveness+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Forgiveness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102133347/http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=forgiveness+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU |date=2013-11-02 }}, English-Sanskrit Dictionary, Spoken Sanskrit, Germany (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and fusion words based on it, describe the concept of forgiveness. The word ''ksama'' is often combined with ''kripa'' (tenderness), ''daya'' (kindness) and ''karuna'' ([[Wiktionary:करुणा|करुणा]], compassion) in [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit texts]].&lt;ref name="mpt"&gt;Michael E. McCullough, Kenneth I. Pargament, Carl E. Thoresen (2001), ''Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice'', The Guildford Press, {{ISBN|978-1572307117}}, pp. 21–39&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rg Veda]], forgiveness is discussed in verses dedicated to deity Varuna, both the context of the one who has done wrong and one who is wronged.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffith (Transl.), ''The Hymns of Rg Veda'', Motilal Banarsidas (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Alan (2007), "Forgiveness: Hindu and Western Perspectives", ''[[Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies]]'', 20(1), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is considered one of the six cardinal [[Virtue#Hinduism|virtues]] in Hindu Dharma.

The [[Theology|theological]] basis for forgiveness in Hindu Dharma is that a person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, of [[Anger#Hinduism|anger]] and unresolved emotions that affect their present as well as future. In Hindu Dharma, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else.&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of [[Dāna#Hinduism|charity]], [[Ritual purification#Hinduism|purification]], [[Vrata#Hinduism|fasting]], [[Hinduism#Rituals|rituals]] and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditative]] introspection.

The concept of forgiveness is further refined in Hindu Dharma by rhetorically contrasting it in feminine and masculine form. In feminine form, one form of forgiveness is explained through [[Lakshmi]] (called [[Hindu deities|Goddess]] Sri in some parts of India); the other form is explained in the masculine form through her husband [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; Feminine Lakshmi forgives even when the one who does wrong does not repent. Masculine Vishnu, on the other hand, forgives only when the wrongdoer repents. In Hindu Dharma, the feminine forgiveness granted without repentance by Lakshmi is higher and more noble than the masculine forgiveness granted only after there is repentance. In the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], [[Sita]] – the wife of King [[Rama]] – is symbolically eulogized for forgiving a crow even as it harms her. Later in the epic Ramayana, she is eulogized again for forgiving those who harass her while she has been kidnapped in [[Lanka]].&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; Many other Hindu stories discuss forgiveness with or without repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Ransley, Cynthia (2004), ''Forgiveness: Themes and issues. Forgiveness and the healing process: A central therapeutic concern'', {{ISBN|1-58391-182-0}}, Brunner-Routledge, pp. 10–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of forgiveness is treated in extensive debates of Hindu literature. In some [[Hindu texts]],&lt;ref&gt;See Manusamhita, 11.55, Mahabharata Vol II, 1022:8&lt;/ref&gt; certain [[Sin#Hinduism|sins]] and intentional acts are debated as naturally unforgivable; for example, murder and rape; these ancient scholars argue whether blanket forgiveness is [[Hindu ethics|morally]] justifiable in every circumstance, and whether forgiveness encourages crime, disrespect, social disorder and people not taking you seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Prafulla Mohapatra (2008), ''Ethics and Society'', Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695230}}, pp. 22–25&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient Hindu texts highlight that forgiveness is not same as reconciliation.

Forgiveness in Hindu Dharma does not necessarily require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being [[Compassion#Hinduism|compassionate]], tender, kind and letting go of the harm or hurt caused by someone or something else.&lt;ref&gt;Temoshok and Chandra, ''Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice'', The Guildford Press, {{ISBN|978-1572307117}}, see Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (''dharmic'' life).&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes the essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from [[Arishadvargas|anger]] (''akrodhi'').&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan (1995), ''Religion and Society'', Indus, Harper Collins India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha (1985), ''Indian psychology'', Vol 2, ''Emotion and Will'', Motilal Banarsidas, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

Other epics and ancient literature of Hindu Dharma discuss forgiveness. For example:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Forgiveness is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is the Vedas; forgiveness is the Shruti.
Forgiveness protecteth the ascetic merit of the future; forgiveness is asceticism; forgiveness is holiness; and by forgiveness is it that the universe is held together.&lt;/poem&gt;|[[Mahabharata]], Book 3, Vana Parva, Section XXIX|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15474/15474-h/15474-h.htm#link2H_4_0322 Vana Parva] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327231954/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15474/15474-h/15474-h.htm |date=2013-03-27 }}, see Section XXIX; Gutenberg Archives Mahabharata Vol I (Kisari Mohan Ganguli 1896); Produced by John B.

====Jainism====
{{See also|Micchami Dukkadam|Kshamavani}}
In [[Jainism]], forgiveness is one of the main virtues that needs to be cultivated by the Jains. ''Kṣamāpanā'' or supreme forgiveness forms part of one of the ten characteristics of ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Varni, Jinendra; Ed. Prof. Sagarmal Jain, ''Translated Justice'' T.K. Tukol and Dr. K.K. Dixit (1993). Samaṇ Suttaṁ. New Delhi: Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti. verse 84&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jain prayer, (''[[pratikramana]]'') Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from ''ekindriyas'' or single sensed [[Jain terms and concepts#Classes of beings|beings]] like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ.'' ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is a [[Prakrit language]] phrase literally meaning "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless."&lt;ref&gt;Chapple. C.K. (2006) ''Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life'' Delhi:Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2045-6}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt; During ''[[samvatsari]]''—the last day of Jain festival ''[[paryusana]]''—Jains utter the phrase ''Micchami Dukkadam'' after ''[[pratikraman]]''. As a matter of [[Jain rituals|ritual]], they personally greet their friends and relatives ''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute may be carried beyond samvatsari, and letters and telephone calls are made to the outstation friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James (2003), ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'' Part 10, Kessinger Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7661-3682-3}} p.876&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Pratikraman]]'' also contains the following prayer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p.18 and 224&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Khāmemi savva-jīve savvë jive khamantu me / ''

''metti me savva-bhūesu, veraṃ mejjha na keṇavi //''

(I ask pardon of all creatures, may all creatures pardon me.

May I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their daily prayers and [[samayika]], Jains recite ''Iryavahi sutra'' seeking forgiveness from all creatures while involved in routine activities:&lt;ref&gt;Translated from Prakrit by Nagin J. shah and Madhu Sen (1993) ''Concept of Pratikramana'' Ahmedabad: Gujarat Vidyapith pp.25–26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May you, O Revered One! Voluntarily permit me. I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jain texts quote [[Mahavira|Māhavīra]] on forgiveness:&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.) [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] | title =The Uttarādhyayana Sūtra | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1895 | location =Oxford | language =English | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe45/index.htm | series =[[Sacred Books of the East|Sacred Books of the East vol.45, Part 2]] | isbn =0-7007-1538-X | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090704214930/http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe45/index.htm | archivedate =2009-07-04 | df = }} ''Note: ISBN refers to the UK:Routledge (2001) reprint. URL is the scan version of the original 1895 reprint.''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By practicing ''prāyaṣcitta'' (repentance), a soul gets rid of sins, and commits no transgressions; he who correctly practises ''prāyaṣcitta'' gains the road and the reward of the road, he wins the reward of good conduct. By begging forgiveness he obtains happiness of mind; thereby he acquires a kind disposition towards all kinds of living beings; by this kind disposition he obtains purity of character and freedom from fear.

— Māhavīra in ''Uttarādhyayana Sūtra'' 29:17–18
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even the code of conduct amongst the [[Jain monasticism|monks]] requires the monks to ask forgiveness for all transgressions:&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.) [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] | title =The Kalpa Sūtra | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1884 | location =Oxford | language =English | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/sbe2200.htm | series =[[Sacred Books of the East|Sacred Books of the East vol.22, Part 1]] | isbn =0-7007-1538-X | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070929151006/http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/sbe2200.htm | archivedate =2007-09-29 | df = }} ''Note: ISBN refers to the UK:Routledge (2001) reprint. URL is the scan version of the original 1884'' reprint.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If among monks or nuns occurs a quarrel or dispute or dissension, the young monk should ask forgiveness of the superior, and the superior of the young monk. They should forgive and ask forgiveness, appease and be appeased, and converse without restraint. For him who is appeased, there will be success (in control); for him who is not appeased, there will be no success; therefore one should appease one's self. 'Why has this been said, Sir? Peace is the essence of monasticism'.

— ''Kalpa Sūtra'' 8:59
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Hoʻoponopono ====
[[Hoʻoponopono]] is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with prayer. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]] and [[New Zealand]]. Traditionally Hoʻoponopono is practiced by healing priests or ''[[kahuna]] lapaʻau'' among family members of a person who is physically ill. Modern versions are performed within the family by a family elder, or by the individual alone.

== Popular recognition ==
The need to forgive is widely recognized by the public, but they are often at a loss for ways to accomplish it. For example, in a large representative sampling of American people on various religious topics in 1988, [[the Gallup Organization]] found that 94% said it was important to forgive, but 85% said they needed some outside help to be able to forgive. However, not even regular prayer was found to be effective.

Akin to forgiveness is [[mercy]], so even if a person is not able to complete the forgiveness process they can still show mercy, especially when so many wrongs are done out of weakness rather than malice. The [[Gallup poll]] revealed that the only thing that was effective was "[[meditation|meditative prayer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gorsuch | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Hao | first2 = J.

Forgiveness as a tool has been extensively used in [[restorative justice]] programs, after the abolition of [[apartheid]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]], run for victims and perpetrators of [[Rwandan genocide]], the violence in [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and [[Northern Ireland conflict]], which has also been documented in film, ''[[Beyond Right and Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The key to forgiveness is the refusal to seek revenge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belief/2013/feb/08/key-forgiveness-refusal-seek-revenge |publisher=The Guardian |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=Feb 21, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324002701/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/belief/2013/feb/08/key-forgiveness-refusal-seek-revenge |archivedate=24 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Right &amp; Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness|url=http://theforgivenessproject.com/beyond-right-wrong-stories-of-justice-and-forgiveness/|date=February 1, 2013|publisher=Forgiveness Project|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302112321/http://theforgivenessproject.com/beyond-right-wrong-stories-of-justice-and-forgiveness/|archivedate=March 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forgiveness In Relationships ==
'''Forgiveness''' in [[marriage]] is an important aspect in a marriage. When two individuals are able to forgive each other it results in a long [[Happiness|happy]] marriage. Forgiveness can help prevent problems from accruing in the married couple's future.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006"&gt;Fincham, F., Hall, J., &amp; Beach, S. (2006). Forgiveness In Marriage: Current Status And Future Directions. Family Relations, 415–427.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 study, researchers were interested in figuring out whether forgiveness is important in a marriage. When does forgiveness usually accrue? Does it accrue before an argument or after an argument? Does forgiveness take a role when a person breaks a promise? etc&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; Researcher found six components that were related to forgiveness in marriage and explains how each one relates to forgiveness. The six components are: [[Contentment|Satisfaction]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Conflict (process)|Conflict]], Attributions, [[Empathy]] and [[wikt:commitment|Commitment]].&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

Researchers provided an overview of forgiveness in marriage and how individuals in a  [[Intimate relationship|relationship]] believe that if forgiveness accrues then you must [[Forgetting|forget]] what had happened.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;  Moreover, based on the interventions and recommendations the researcher started to see how important forgiveness is in a relationship and how it can lead to a happy and healthy relationship.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

In a 2005 study, researchers mentioned that when couples forgive their spouses they sometimes need help from professionals to overcome their pain that might be left behind.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; Researchers also described the difference between how each individual perceives the situation based on who is in pain and who caused the pain. Also how the couple react to the situation based on their feelings and how they personally respond to the situation.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

'''The model of forgiveness:'''

"Enright's model of forgiveness has received empirical support and sees forgiveness as a journey through four phases" which are:&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

# '''Uncovering phase''':  Emphases on exploring the pain that the individual has experienced.
# '''Decision phase''': The nature of forgiveness is discussed. Also the individual commits that they will try to forgive the spouse
# '''Work phase''': shifts the focus to the transgressor in an effort to gain insight and understanding.
# '''Deepening phase''': the victim moves toward resolution, becoming aware that they are not alone, has themself been the recipient of others' forgiveness, and finds meaning and purpose in the forgiveness process.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

Furthermore, when married couples argue they tend to focus on who is right and who is wrong. Also couples tend to focus on who proves the other wrong which can cause more problems and can make the problem worse because it will make it harder to forgive one another.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

'''Recommendation and [[interventions]]:'''

The researchers also came up with recommendation for practitioners and intervention to help individuals that are married on how to communicate with each other, how to resolve problems and how to make it easier to forgive each other.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;
Some of the interventions of forgiveness in marriage has been a great success. It encouraged forgiveness and made couples happier together.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;
 
Some of the recommendations that was given to practitioners was that the individuals had to explore and understand what forgiveness means before starting any intervention because the preconceived idea of forgiveness can cause problems with couples being open to forgive.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; For example, an individual not forgiving their spouse out of fear that the spouse might think that they are weak which can cause a conflict.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; It was stated that the couple must know the following:
* Forgiveness takes
* The different forms of forgiveness
* The danger in communicating in forgiveness
* That Perpetrators and victims have different perceptive context is important&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

Furthermore, the researchers thought of ways to further help married couples in the future and suggested that they should explore the following:
* The importance of seeking forgiveness
* [[Self-forgiveness]]
* The role of the sacred in marital forgiveness&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

''[[Interpersonal relationship|Relationships]]'' are at the sentiment aspect of our lives; with our families at home and friends outside. Relationships interact in schools and universities, with work mates and, with colleagues at the workplace and in our diverse communities. In the article it states, the quality of these relationships determines our individual well-being, how well we learn, develop and function, our sense of connectedness with others and the health so society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fincham.info/papers/2006-fr.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031300/http://www.fincham.info/papers/2006-fr.pdf |archivedate=2015-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, two innovators of ''[[Positive Psychology]]'', Ed Diener and Martin Seligman, conducted a study at the University of Illinois on the 10% of students with the highest scores recorded on a survey of personal happiness. What they came up with was most salient characteristics shared by students who were very content and showed positive life styles were the ones who "their strong ties to friends and family and commitment to spending time with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ed Diener1 |author2=Martin E.P.

A study done in 2000,  identified as a key study that taken part and examined two natures of relationships (friends and family) and at what age does the support switch importance from one to the other.  What the study showed that people whom had good family relationship, they were able to carry out more positive outside relationships with friends. Through the ''[[family]]''  relationship and friendships  the character of the individual was built to forgive and learn from the experience in the family. It just goes to show that to have a good base at the start of a young age, will train the person to have good better well-being with outside interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yi Xie |author2=Siqing Peng |title=How to repair customer trust after negative publicity: The roles of competence, integrity, benevolence, and forgiveness |date=July 2009 |journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=572–589 |doi=10.1002/mar.20289 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.20289/abstract |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001,  Charlotte vanOyen Witvliet  asked people to think about someone who had hurt, wronged, or offended them. As they thought to answer, she observed their reaction. She observed their blood pressure, heart rate, facial muscle tension, and sweat gland activity. To deliberate on an old misdemeanor is to practice unforgiveness. The outcome to the recall of the grudge the candidates’ blood pressure and heart rate increased, and they sweated more. Pondering about their resents was stressful, and subjects found the rumination unpleasant. When they adept forgiveness, their physical stimulation glided downward. They showed no more of an anxiety reaction than normal wakefulness produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/2/117.short |title=Granting Forgiveness or Harboring Grudges: Implications for Emotion, Physiology, and Health |publisher=Pss.sagepub.com |date=2001-03-01 |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208132229/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/2/117.short |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, study on self-forgiveness with spouse forgiveness has a better outcome to a healthier life by Pelucchi, Paleari, Regalia and Fincham. This study investigates  ''[[self-forgiveness]]''  for real hurts committed against the partner in a romantic relationship (168 couples). For both males and females, the mistaken partners were more content with their romantic relationship to the extent that they had more positive and less negative sentiment and thoughts toward themselves. In the study when looking at the victimized partners were more gratified with the relationship when the offending partner had less negative sentiment and thoughts towards themselves. It concludes that self-forgiveness when in a relationship has positive impact on both the offending and victimized partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/fam/27/6/861/|title=PsycNET|author=|date=|website=psycnet.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forgiveness Interventions ==
Both negative and positive affect play a role in forgiveness interventions. It is the general consensus across researchers in the field of [[psychology]], that the overarching purpose of forgiveness interventions is to decrease overall negative affect associated with the stimulus and increase the individual's positive affect.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding concerns about interventions to promote forgiveness: A review of the literature.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-3204.45.1.88|journal = Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|date = 2008-01-01|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0033-3204.45.1.88|first = Nathaniel G.|last = Wade|first2 = Chad V.|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Julia E.|last3 = Meyer|pages=88–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Nathaniel G.|last2=Bailey|first2=Donna C.|last3=Shaffer|first3=Philip|title=Helping Clients Heal: Does Forgiveness Make a Difference?|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=2005|volume=36|issue=6|pages=634–641|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.36.6.634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease model has been mainly used in regards to [[therapy]], however the incorporation of forgiveness into therapy has been lacking,&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; and has been slowly gaining popularity in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; More recent research has shown how the growth of forgiveness in psychology has given rise to the study of forgiveness interventions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

=== Different Types ===
There are various forms of forgiveness interventions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; One common adaptation used by researchers is where patients are forced to confront the entity preventing them from forgiving by using [[introspection|introspective]] techniques and expressing this to the therapist. &lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005" /&gt; Another popular forgiveness intervention is getting individual to try and see things from the offender's point of view. The end goal for this adaptation is getting the individual to perhaps understand the reasoning behind the offender's actions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005" /&gt; If they are able to do this then they might be able to forgive the offender more easily.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005" /&gt;

There is, however, conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

=== Contrary Evidence ===
Although research has taken into account the positive aspects of forgiveness interventions, there are also negative aspects that have been explored as well. Some researchers have taken a critical approach and have been less accepting of the forgiveness intervention approach to therapy.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

Critics have argued that forgiveness interventions may actually cause an increase in negative affect because it is trying to inhibit the individual's own personal feelings towards the offender. This can result in the individual feeling negatively towards themself.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; This approach is categorizing the individual's feelings by implying that the negative emotions the individual is feeling are unacceptable and feelings of forgiveness is the correct and acceptable way to feel. It might inadvertently promote feelings of [[shame]] and [[contrition]] within the individual.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

Some researchers also worry that forgiveness interventions will promote unhealthy relationships.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stover 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stover|first1=C. S.|title=Domestic Violence Research: What Have We Learned and Where Do We Go From Here?|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=1 April 2005|volume=20|issue=4|pages=448–454|doi=10.1177/0886260504267755}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worry that individuals with toxic relationships will continue to forgive those who continuously commit wrong acts towards them when in fact they should be distancing themselves from these sorts of people.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stover 2005" /&gt;

A number of studies showcase high effectiveness rates of forgiveness interventions when done continuously over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; Some researchers have found that these interventions have been proven ineffective when done over short spans of time.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

=== Forgiveness Interventions: Children ===
There has been some research within the last decade outlining some studies that have looked at the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions on young children. There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; One study that explored this relationship, was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau. In this study, Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; The findings of this study showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

== Forgiveness and Health ==
Survey data from 2000 showed that 61% of participants that were part of a small religious group reported that the group helped them be more forgiving.&lt;ref name="How Religious Groups Promote Forgiving"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Religious Groups Promote Forgiving: A National Study|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/0021-8294.00011|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date = 2000-01-01|volume = 39|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/0021-8294.00011|first = Robert|last = Wuthnow|pages=125–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals reported that their religion groups which promote forgiveness was related to self-reports of success in overcoming [[addictions]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and perceiving encouragement when feeling discouraged.&lt;ref name="How Religious Groups Promote Forgiving" /&gt;

It is suggested that [[mindfulness]] plays a role in forgiveness and health.&lt;ref name="Forgiveness, Mindfulness, and Health"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Forgiveness, Mindfulness, and Health|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-012-0119-0|journal = Mindfulness|date = 2012-06-22|issn = 1868–8527|pages = 235–245|volume = 4|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s12671-012-0119-0|first = Jon R.|last = Webb|first2 = T. Dustin|last2 = Phillips|first3 = David|last3 = Bumgarner|first4 = Elizabeth|last4 = Conway-Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forgiveness of others has a positive effect on physical health when it is combined with mindfulness but evidence shows that forgiveness only effects health as a function of mindfulness.&lt;ref name="Forgiveness, Mindfulness, and Health" /&gt;

A study from 2005 states that self-forgiveness is an important part of self-acceptance and [[mental health]] in later life.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-Forgiveness A Component of Mental Health in Later Life|url = http://roa.sagepub.com/content/27/3/267|journal = Research on Aging|date = 2005-05-01|issn = 0164-0275|pages = 267–289|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0164027504274122|first = Berit|last = Ingersoll-Dayton|first2 = Neal|last2 = Krause|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130728082538/http://roa.sagepub.com/content/27/3/267|archivedate = 2013-07-28|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability to self-forgive can compromise mental health.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component" /&gt; For some elderly people, self-forgiveness requires reflecting on a transgression to avoid repeating wrongdoings, individuals seek to learn from these transgressions in order to improve their real self-schemas.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component" /&gt; When individuals are successful at learning from these transgressions, they may experience improved mental health.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component" /&gt;

A study in 2015 looks at how self-forgiveness can reduce feelings of guilt and shame associated with [[hypersexual]] behaviour.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness and Hypersexual Behavior"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-Forgiveness and Hypersexual Behavior|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10720162.2014.1001542|journal = Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity|date = 2015-01-02|issn = 1072-0162|pages = 59–70|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/10720162.2014.1001542|first = Joshua N.|last = Hook|first2 = Jennifer E.|last2 = Farrell|first3 = Don E.|last3 = Davis|first4 = Daryl R.

Kim|last7 = Penberthy|first8 = Jamie D.|last8 = Bedics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypersexual behaviour can have negative effects on individuals by causing [[Suffering|distress]] and life problems.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness and Hypersexual Behavior" /&gt; Self-forgiveness  may be a component that can help individuals reduce hypersexual negative behaviours that cause problems.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness and Hypersexual Behavior" /&gt;

Evidence shows that self-forgiveness and [[procrastination]] may be associated; self-forgiveness allows the individual to overcome the negatives associated with an earlier behaviour and engage in approach-oriented behaviours on a similar task.&lt;ref name="I forgive myself"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = I forgive myself, now I can study: How self-forgiveness for procrastinating can reduce future procrastination|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0191886910000474|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2010-01-01|volume = 48|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.01.029|first = Michael J.

==Forgiveness and Physical Health==
The correlation between forgiveness and [[physical health]] is a concept that has recently gained traction in research. Some studies claim that there is no correlation, either positive or negative between forgiveness and physical health, and others show a positive correlation.&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael 2002"&gt;McCullough, Michael, and Charlotte Vanoyen. "The Psychology of Forgiveness." Handbook of Positive Psychology, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence Supporting a Correlation===
Individuals with forgiveness as a [[personality trait]] have been shown to have overall better physical health. In a study on [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s, regardless if someone was in a negative or [[positive relationship]], their physical health seemed to be influenced at least partially by their level of forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berry | first1 = Jack W. | last2 = Everett | first2 = L. Jr. Worthington | year = 2001 | title = Forgivingness, Relationship Quality, Stress While Imagining Relationship Events, and Physical and Mental Health | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 447–55 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.48.4.447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who make a decision to genuinely forgive someone are also shown to have better physical health. This is due to the relationship between forgiveness and stress reduction. Forgiveness is seen as preventing poor physical health and managing poor physical health.&lt;ref name="Worthington, Everett L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = Everett L. | last2 = Scherer | first2 = Michael | year = 2004 | title = Forgiveness Is an Emotion-focused Coping Strategy That Can Reduce Health Risks and Promote Health Resilience: Theory, Review, and Hypotheses | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Health | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 385–405 | doi = 10.1080/0887044042000196674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically individuals who choose to forgive another after a transgression have lower [[blood pressure]] and lower [[cortisol]] levels than those who do not. This is theorized to be due to various direct and indirect influences of forgiveness, which point to forgiveness as an evolutionary trait. See [[Broaden-and-build|Broaden and Build Theory]].&lt;ref name="Worthington, Everett L. 2004" /&gt;

Direct influences include: Reducing [[hostility]] (which is inversely correlated with physical health), and the concept that unforgiveness may reduce the [[immune system]] because it puts stress on the individual. Indirect influences are more related to forgiveness as a personality trait and include: forgiving people may have more [[social support]] and less stressful marriages, and forgiveness may be related to personality traits that are correlated with physical health.&lt;ref name="Worthington, Everett L. 2004" /&gt;

Forgiveness may also be correlated with physical health because hostility is associated with poor coronary performance. Unforgiveness is as an act of hostility, and forgiveness as an act of letting go of hostility. Heart patients who are treated with therapy that includes forgiveness to reduce hostility have improved cardiac health compared to those who are treated with medicine alone.&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael 2002" /&gt;
	
Forgiveness may also lead to better [[perceived]] physical health. This correlation applies to both self-forgiveness and other-forgiveness but is especially true of self-forgiveness. Individuals who are more capable of forgiving themselves have better perceived physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = T. | last2 = Milosevic | first2 = A. | last3 = Carroll | first3 = M. | last4 = Hart | first4 = K. | last5 = Hibbard | first5 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Physical Health Status in Relation to Self-Forgiveness and Other-Forgiveness in Healthy College Students | url = | journal = Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 798–803 | doi = 10.1177/1359105308093863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
Forgiveness studies have been refuted by critics who claim that there is no direct correlation between forgiveness and physical health. Forgiveness, due to the reduction of directed anger, contributes to mental health and mental health contributes to physical health, but there is no evidence that forgiveness directly improves physical health. Most of the studies on forgiveness cannot isolate it as an [[independent variable]] in an individual's well-being, so it is difficult to prove [[causation (sociology)|causation]].&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael E. 2000"&gt;McCullough, Michael E., Kenneth I. Pargament, and Carl E. Thoresen. Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice. New York: Guilford Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, research into the correlation between physical health and forgiveness has been criticized for being too focused on unforgiveness. Research shows more about what hostility and unforgiveness contribute to poor health than it shows what forgiveness contributes to physical health.&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael E. 2000" /&gt;

== Self-Forgiveness ==
Self-forgiveness happens in situations where an individual has done something that they perceive to be morally wrong and they consider themselves to be responsible for the wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness"&gt;{{cite web|title = Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness|url = https://www.academia.edu/8498542/Ethical_aspects_of_self-forgiveness|accessdate = 2015-08-11|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151002033424/http://www.academia.edu/8498542/Ethical_aspects_of_self-forgiveness|archivedate = 2015-10-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the wrongdoer associates with the wrongful action.&lt;ref name="Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness" /&gt; Negative emotions associated with wrongful action can include [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[regret]], [[remorse]], [[blame]], [[shame]], [[self-hatred]] and/or [[self-contempt]].&lt;ref name="Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness" /&gt;

Major life events that include [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] can cause individuals to experience feelings of guilt or self-hatred.&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-forgiveness and forgiveness|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-2265.2010.00611.x|journal = The Heythrop Journal|date = 2011-01-01|volume = 53|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2265.2010.00611.x|first = ZENON|last = Szablowinski|pages=678–689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have the ability to reflect on their behaviours to determine if their actions are [[moral]].&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness" /&gt; In situations of trauma, humans can choose to self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life.&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness" /&gt; Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where they hurt others.&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness" /&gt;

=== Therapeutic Model  ===
Individuals can unintentionally cause harm or offence to one another in everyday life. It is important for individuals to be able to recognize when this happens, and in the process of making amends, have the ability to self-forgive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Exline | first2 = J. J. | year = 2010 | title = Moving toward self-forgiveness: Removing barriers  related to shame, guilt, and regret | url = | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 4 | issue = 8| pages = 548–558 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific research suggests that the ability to genuinely forgive one's self can be significantly beneficial to an individual's emotional as well as mental well-being.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cornish | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Wade | first2 = N. G. | year = 2015 | title = A therapeutic model of self-forgiveness with  intervention strategies for counselors | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 96–104 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00185.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research indicates that the ability to forgive one's self for past offences can lead to decreased feelings of negative emotions such as [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and can increase the use of more positive practices such as self-kindness and [[self-compassion]].&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; However, it has been indicated that it is possible for the process of self-forgiveness to be misinterpreted and therefore not accurately completed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could potentially lead to increased feelings of [[regret]] or [[self-blame]].&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; In an attempt to avoid this, and increase the positive benefits associated with genuine self-forgiveness, a specific therapeutic model of self-forgiveness has been recommended, which can be used to encourage genuine self-forgiveness in offenders. The model that has been proposed has four key elements. These elements include '''responsibility''', '''remorse''', '''restoration''' and '''renewal'''.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; 
# The therapeutic model suggests '''responsibility''' as the first necessary step towards genuine self-forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; Research advises that in order to avoid the negative affect associated with emotions such as overwhelming guilt or regret, offenders must first recognize that they have hurt another individual, and accept the responsibility necessary for their actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; 
# Once the individual has accepted responsibility for their offences, it is natural for them to experience feelings of '''remorse''' or guilt. However, these feelings can be genuinely processed and expressed preceding the need for restoration.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; 
# The act of '''restoration''' allows the offending individual to make the necessary amends to the individual(s) they have hurt.  
# The final component in the model of self-forgiveness is '''renewal'''. The offending individual is able to genuinely forgive themself for their past transgressions and can engage in more positive and meaningful behaviors such as self-compassion and self-kindness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt;  
Despite the suggested model, research advises that the process of self-forgiveness is not always applicable for every individual.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; For example, individuals who have not actually caused others any harm or wrongdoing, but instead are suffering from negative emotions such as [[self-hatred]] or [[self-pity]], such as victims of assault, might attempt self-forgiveness for their perceived offences. However, this would not be the process necessary for them to make their amends.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; Additionally, offenders who continue to offend others while attempting to forgive themselves for past offences demonstrate a reluctance to genuinely complete the four stages necessary for self-forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; Research suggests that it is important to first gather exterior information about the individual's perceived offences as well as their needs and motivation for self-forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt;

The life and works of the French filmmaker [[Georges Méliès]] (1861–1938), including his famous short film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'', have been referenced many times in creative works, including the following examples.

==General==
* ''[[Le Grand Méliès]]'' (1952): The life of Georges Méliès is told in this biodrama, directed by [[Georges Franju]]. André Méliès plays the part of his own father.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">A '''Great Rebuilding''' is a period in which a heightened level of construction work, [[architecture|architectural]] change, or rebuilding occurred.

More specifically, [[William George Hoskins|W. G. Hoskins]] defined the term "The Great Rebuilding" in England as the period from the mid-16th century until 1640. Hoskins' initial theory held that during this period, improved economic conditions in England led to the expansion, rebuilding or architectural improvement of a large number of rural buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Past and Present Vol.4, no.1 (Nov., 1953), pp. 44-59|url = http://past.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/44|access-date = 2016-01-22|doi = 10.1093/past/4.1.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise time period, extent and impact of "The Great Rebuilding" is contested. [[Ronald Brunskill]] accepts that in much of England it spanned the period 1570–1640 but that the period varied both by region and by social class. It was earliest in [[South East England]], later in [[South West England]] and [[Cornwall]], about 1670–1720 in [[Northern England]] and later still in [[Wales]].{{sfn|Brunskill|1971|p=27}} In each region it affected higher-income social classes first and then progressed to lower-income classes.{{sfn|Brunskill|1971|p=27}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4284">The [[Halifax Explosion]] has frequently been the subject of works of popular culture.

The canonical novel ''[[Barometer Rising]]'' (1941) by the Canadian writer [[Hugh MacLennan]] is set in Halifax at the time of the explosion and includes a carefully researched description of its impact on the city. Following in MacLennan's footsteps, journalist [[Robert MacNeil]] penned ''[[Burden of Desire]]'' (1992) and used the explosion as a metaphor for the societal and cultural changes of the day. MacLennan and MacNeil exploit the romance genre to fictionalize the explosion, similar to the first attempt by [[Lieutenant-Colonel Frank McKelvey Bell]], a medical officer who penned a short novella on the Halifax explosion shortly after the catastrophic event.  His romance was ''[[A Romance of the Halifax Disaster]]'' (1918), a melodramatic piece that follows the love affair of a young woman and an injured soldier. There is also a young adult fictional story in the ''[[Dear Canada]]'' series, named ''[[No Safe Harbour]]'', whose narrator tries to find the other members of her family after the blast.

More recently, the novel ''Black Snow'' (2009) by Halifax journalist [[Jon Tattrie]] followed an explosion victim's search for his wife in the ruined city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pottersfieldpress.com/authors/tattriej.html |title=Jon Tattrie |publisher=Pottersfield Press |date= |accessdate=2009-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715110637/http://www.pottersfieldpress.com/authors/tattriej.html# |archive-date=2011-07-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;'' and [[A Wedding in December]]'' (2005) by [[Anita Shreve]] has a story-within-the-story set in Halifax at the time of the explosion. The explosion is also referred to in some detail in [[John Irving]]'s novel ''[[Until I Find You]]'' (2005) as well as [[Ami McKay]]'s ''[[The Birth House]]'' (2006) in which protagonist Dora Rare travels to Halifax to offer her midwifery skills to mothers who go into labour after the explosion.  In the 2009 novel, ''[[Inherent Vice]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]], the shadowy [[schooner]] ''Golden Fang'' is revealed as a reoutfitted ''Preserved'', a vessel said to have survived the explosion. In 2011, Halifax writer Jennie Marsland published her historical romance ''Shattered'', which is set before the explosion and in its aftermath. An award-winning play entitled "Shatter"&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Trina, Shatter, Playwrights Canada Press&lt;/ref&gt; by Trina Davies is set in the explosion and explores the racial profiling of German-speaking citizens after the event.

Keith Ross Leckie scripted a miniseries entitled ''[[Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion]]'' (2003), which took the title but has no relationship to [[Janet Kitz]]'s acclaimed non-fiction book ''[[Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery]]'' (1989).  The miniseries follows soldier Charlie Collins through a romantic affair and his recovery from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].  The movie exploited computer technology in order to achieve impressive special effects on a budget. However, the film was panned by critics and criticized by historians for distortions and inaccuracies. Aspects criticized were the representation of German spies in the city and countless other distortions of historical fact. Jim Lotz's ''The Sixth of December'' (1981) also toys with the fictional idea that Halifax was home to a network of enemy spies during the war.

The ''[[Heritage Minutes|Heritage Minute]]'' episode on the Halifax Explosion tied for the most popular in a 2012 Ipsos Reid poll.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.historicacanada.ca/sites/default/files/PDF/press-coverage/cbc_news_oct_16.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|title=New heritage minutes boosted by old favorites|date=2012-06-10|accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was also featured in an episode of ''[[Ghostly Encounters]]''.

In the movie ''[[Super Troopers 2]]'', ''[[Rob Lowe]]'' plays a former minor league hockey player nicknamed the Halifax Explosion. Later clarified to be the second Halifax Explosion after the maritime disaster.

==Plot==
In ancient China during the [[Warring States period]], Nameless, a [[Qin (state)|Qin]] prefect, arrives at the Qin [[Xianyang|capital city]] to meet the king of Qin, who had survived an attempt on his life by the assassins Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. As a result, the king has implemented extreme security measures: no visitors allowed to approach the king within 100 paces. Nameless claims that he has slain the three assassins and he displays their weapons before the king, who allows the former to approach within ten paces and tell him his story.

Nameless recounts first killing Long Sky, before traveling to meet Flying Snow and Broken Sword, who had taken refuge at a calligraphy school in the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]]. He tells Sword that he is there to commission a calligraphy scroll with the character for "Sword" (劍), secretly seeking to learn Sword's skill through his calligraphy.  Nameless also learns that Snow and Sword, who are lovers, had gradually grown distant. Once the scroll is complete, Nameless reveals his identity and challenges Snow to a duel the next day, to avenge her secret lover Long Sky. Sword, in anger at Snow's betrayal to him, makes love to his pupil Moon, and is seen by Snow. In revenge, Snow kills Sword, followed by Moon when she attempted to seek revenge for her master. The next day, Nameless kills the emotionally unstable Snow before the Qin army, and claims her sword.

As the tale concludes, the king expresses disbelief and accuses Nameless of staging the duels with the assassins, as in the previous assassination attempt he had perceived Sword as an honourable man who would not stoop so low as to cheat on Snow. The king then suggests that what really happened was that the assassins volunteered their lives so that Nameless could gain the king's trust, which would allow Nameless to get close enough to the king to kill him. He then narrates his guess at what really happened.
 
In the king's hypothetical version of the story, Nameless had sought out Snow and Sword after staging the battle with Sky, telling them that he had acquired a special technique that would allow him to kill any target that is within ten paces. Nameless explains that he can use this technique to kill the king, but to get close enough he must present Snow's and Sword's weapons to the king. He further explains that he only needs to kill one of them in public to "prove" that he has killed both of them. Snow and Sword argue over who should be the one to die, which results in a short fight in which Snow is quicker and manages to injure Sword. Snow then proceeds to meet Nameless before the Qin army while Sword, still recovering from his wound, watches helplessly as Snow is defeated. Moon then gives Nameless her master's sword, telling him that the swords of Snow and Sword should remain together in death as they had in life.

Nameless admits that he does indeed possess the special technique the king alluded to. However, he states that the King had underestimated Sword, and tells the true story. Nameless says that the special technique, while deadly, can also be used to deal a seemingly-fatal blow that nonetheless misses all the victim's vital organs. He had used this technique on Sky, and now asked Snow and Sword to cooperate by faking a duel with him as well. He demonstrates the technique by showing that it is highly accurate as well as deadly. Snow agrees to the plan, but Sword refuses. Snow angrily accuses Sword of ruining the opportunity they had three years ago, when they had broken into the Qin palace yet Sword had refused to kill the king. She then attacks Sword, and manages to wound him with Nameless's help. The next day, Nameless "kills" Snow in front of the Qin army. Sword sends Nameless off to the Qin capital, writing the words [[Tianxia]] in the sand before leaving. Sword had not killed the king 3 years ago because he desired a unified, peaceful state, and only the king of Qin could achieve that vision.

The king, touched by the tale and by Sword's understanding of his dream to unify China, ceases to fear Nameless. He tosses his sword to Nameless and examines the scroll drawn by Sword. The king understands that it describes the ideal warrior, who, paradoxically, should have no desire to kill. When Nameless realizes the wisdom of these words, he abandons his mission and spares the king.

When Snow learns that Sword had convinced Nameless to forgo the assassination, she furiously attacks Sword and unintentionally kills him when he chooses not to defend himself so that she would understand his feelings for her. Overwhelmed with sorrow, Snow commits suicide. Urged by his court, the king reluctantly orders Nameless to be executed at the Qin palace for his assassination attempt. He understands that in order to unify the nation, he must enforce the law and use Nameless as an example. As the film ends, Nameless receives a hero's funeral and a closing text identifies the king as [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China.

==Cast==
*[[Jet Li]] as Nameless ({{zh|t=無名|s=无名|p=Wúmíng}}) &lt;br&gt; An unknown [[prefect]] of a small province, orphaned at an early age. Forged into a master swordsman over years of training, Nameless possesses the singular technique "Death at Ten Paces" allowing him to strike precisely within that distance. He is the primary conspirator to assassinate the king, but ultimately decides that China's unification and peace are more important than vengeance. ''Hero'' also saw Jet Li's first appearance in a film produced by mainland China, after his debut in ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]''.
*[[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]] as Broken Sword ({{zh|t=殘劍|s=残剑|p=Cánjiàn}}) &lt;br&gt; Broken Sword and Flying Snow are the only assassins to ever infiltrate the king's palace, killing hundreds of his personal guard and very nearly the king himself before halting at the last moment. Of all the assassins, Broken Sword is the only one whom Nameless considers his equal in swordsmanship.
*[[Maggie Cheung]] as Flying Snow ({{zh|t=飛雪|s=飞雪|p=Fēixuě}}) &lt;br&gt; A skilled assassin, Flying Snow is Broken Sword's lover and his equal as a swordsman. She has vowed revenge upon the King for killing her father in battle. When Broken Sword convinces Nameless to abandon the assassination attempt on the king, Flying Snow kills him and later herself.
*[[Chen Daoming]] as [[Qin Shihuang|the King of Qin]] ({{zh|c=秦王|p=Qín Wáng}}) &lt;br&gt; An ambitious leader who desires to become the first Emperor of China. Following an assassination attempt, he withdraws into his palace, which he empties of all but his most trusted advisors, and always wears his battle armor.
*[[Donnie Yen]] as Long Sky ({{zh|t=長空|s=长空|p=Chángkōng}}) &lt;br&gt; An accomplished spearman, Sky is the first to be "defeated" by Nameless, who takes Sky's broken spear as proof of his defeat to the king. He is the least-seen assassin in the film.
*[[Zhang Ziyi]] as Moon ({{zh|c=如月|p=Rúyuè}}) &lt;br&gt; Broken Sword's loyal apprentice, skilled in using twin swords.

==Box office==

When ''Hero'' opened in Hong Kong in December 2002, it grossed a massive [[Hong Kong dollar|HK]] $15,471,348 in its first week. Its final gross of HK $26,648,345 made it one of the top films in Hong Kong that year. On 27 August 2004, after a long delay, ''Hero'' opened in 2,031 North American screens uncut and subtitled. It debuted at #1, grossing US $18,004,319 ($8,864 per screen) in its opening weekend. The total was the second highest opening weekend ever for a foreign language film; only ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' has opened better.&lt;ref name='TheNumbers.com' /&gt; Its US $53,710,019 North American box office gross makes it among the highest-grossing foreign language films and martial arts films in North American box office history.&lt;ref name='BoxOfficeMojo.com martialarts' /&gt; The total worldwide box office gross was US $177,394,432.

==Critical response==
The film received extremely favorable reviews, scoring 95% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt; and 85 at [[Metacritic]], indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] called it "beautiful and beguiling, a martial arts extravaganza defining the styles and lives of its fighters within Chinese tradition."&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; Richard Corliss of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described it as "the masterpiece", adding that "it employs unparalleled visual splendor to show why men must make war to secure the peace and how warriors may find their true destiny as lovers."&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it "swooningly beautiful, furious and thrilling" and "an action movie for the ages."&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune" /&gt; Charles Taylor of [[Salon.com]] took an especially positive stance, deeming it "one of the most ravishing spectacles the movies have given us".&lt;ref name="salon.com" /&gt; Nevertheless, there were several film critics{{who|date=November 2014}} who felt the film had advocated autocracy and reacted with discomfort. ''[[The Village Voice]]'''s reviewer deemed it to have a "cartoon ideology" and justification for ruthless leadership comparable to ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''.&lt;ref name="Village Voice" /&gt;

In 2014, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/best-action-movies|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=The 100 best action movies|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hero'' was listed at 77th place on this list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-100-best-action-movies-80-71|work=Time Out|accessdate=November 7, 2014|title=The 100 best action movies: 80-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also has been interpreted as a nuanced investigation into the relationship between culture on one hand, and political or military power on the other. In this approach, the film comments not only on China and its position in the world, but also on the ongoing erasures of languages and cultures under globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zhang Yimou: Globalization and the Subject of Culture|last=Larson|first=Wendy|publisher=Cambria Press|year=2017|isbn=9781604979756|location=Amherst, New York|pages=271-304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation of "Tianxia"==
There has been some criticism of the film for its American-release translation of one of the central ideas in the film: ''[[Tianxia|Tiānxià]]'' ({{linktext|天|下}}) which literally means "Under heaven", and is a phrase to mean "the World". In fact, for its release in [[Belgium]], some two years before the U.S. release, the subtitled translation was indeed "all under heaven".  However, the version shown in American cinemas was localized as the two-word phrase "our land" instead, which seems to denote just the nation of [[China]] rather than the whole world. Whether Zhang Yimou intended the film to also have meaning with regard to the world and world unity was at that time difficult to say. Zhang Yimou was asked about the change at a screening in [[Massachusetts]] and said it was a problem of translation: "If you ask me if 'Our land' is a good translation, I can't tell you. All translations are handicapped. Every word has different meanings in different cultures."&lt;ref name="eye.net" /&gt;  However, in ''Cause: The Birth of Hero'' – a documentary on the making of ''Hero'' – Zhang mentions that he hopes the film will have some contemporary relevance, and that, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] (which took place just before the movie was filmed) the themes of universal brotherhood and "peace under heaven" may indeed be interpreted more globally, and taken to refer to peace in "the world."&lt;ref name="Cause" /&gt; The phrase was later changed in television-release versions of the film.

==Miramax release==
[[Miramax]], the film studio, owned the American-market distribution rights, but delayed the release of the film, a total of six times. Import DVDs of the film were sold online and Miramax demanded that the sites cease selling the DVD.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; 

The movie was finally released in American theaters on 27 August 2004 after intervention by [[Disney]] executives, [[Government of China]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]], who helped secure an English-subtitled release.&lt;ref&gt;Holson, Laura M. (10 August 2004).  [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/business/disney-in-talks-on-independence-for-a-weinstein.html "Disney in Talks On Independence For a Weinstein."]  ''[[The New York Times]]''.  Retrieved from NYTimes.com, 26 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fangoria1 /&gt; Tarantino also offered to lend his name to promotional material for the film in order to attract box office attention to it; his name was attached to the credits as "Quentin Tarantino Presents".&lt;ref name="tarantino" /&gt; In addition, a sword held by Jet Li's character in the original promotional poster was replaced by weapon resembling a [[katana]], a [[Kenjutsu|Japanese weapon]], in the North American promotional poster, which was both anachronistic and culturally misplaced. The United States version of the DVD, with Mandarin, English, and French soundtracks, was released on 30 November 2004.

==Music==
The film was scored by [[Tan Dun]], who also conducted the [[China Philharmonic Orchestra|China Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus]] for the recording. A majority of the tracks feature Japanese [[taiko]] drum ensemble [[Kodō (taiko group)|Kodō]]. [[Itzhak Perlman]] performs most of the violin solos, with additional solos by Tan Dun himself. The theme song, ''Hero'' (英雄), composed by Zhang Yadong and [[Lin Xi]], was sung by [[Faye Wong]]. It is unavailable in the American versions of the film DVD and soundtrack album.&lt;ref name="YesAsia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmTracks.com" /&gt; ''Wind &amp; Sand'' (風沙) is a song inspired by the film and was sung by [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]]. The musical instrument seen and played during the fight in the [[Go (game)|weiqi]] courtyard scene is a [[guqin]]. The guqin music for that scene was performed by Liu Li.

'''''Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine''''' was a magazine published between 1856 and 1861, in San Francisco, which played an important role in popularizing California in general, and to a large extent [[Yosemite National Park]] in particular.

Publisher and promoter [[James Hutchings]] was born in [[Towcester |Towcester, England]], and in 1848 came to the United States along with a vast wave of Europeans that were escaping a maelstrom of economic, political and religious oppression in the late 1840s. Shortly after he arrived gold was found in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and Hutchings decided to seek his fortune. His was a common story insofar as he did not make a good living mining gold, but what little he did make he invested. In addition to attracting settlers to the west coast, the gold rush also brought technology, in particular printing presses, and Hutchings learned to make a moderately lucrative living publishing and selling letter sheets, which were printed broad sheets purposely left blank on the back so they could be used to write letters, something akin to large-format postcards. They became very popular among miners, who used them when they wrote home to friends and relatives in the east. Aside from making a living selling the letter sheets, as Hutchings traveled around California he gained a sense of what was important in the popular mind and came up with the idea of an illustrated magazine.

The news of the [[Mariposa Battalion]]'s incursion into a valley (that the battalion members named Yosemite) for the purpose of tracking down alleged renegade Indians was fairly widely published, but the news focused on the confrontation. Hutchings was one of the few people to note the mention of a 1000 foot waterfall, and in 1854 when he was first formulating the idea of his illustrated magazine, he decided that a trip into that valley might make for interesting stories in the inaugural issue of the magazine. In the late spring of 1855 he hired artists to join him, and when the party arrived in the foothills he hired two [[Mi-Wuk]] men as guides. As the party came around [[Inspiration Point]], they stopped long enough for [[Thomas Ayres (artist)|Thomas Ayres]] to get a detailed sketch, which was published as a lithographic poster that fall, the first published image of Yosemite Valley. In June 1856, the entire account was published in Volume I of the magazine, and included five of Ayres' drawings.

The magazine was published monthly from July 1856 to June 1861, five volumes total. Although Yosemite was prominent, it was a magazine of general interest that focused on California's nascent tourist attractions. Each issue contained travel narratives, ranging from simple day trips out of San Francisco to arduous trans-Sierra treks. Longer articles were interspersed with shorter and lighter pieces, such as poetry and tables of interesting facts. The magazine popularized a number of well-known legendary stories of the West including the [[Pony Express]], [[Grizzly Adams]] and [[Snowshoe Thompson]]. The story of the naming of Yosemite was first published in the magazine in an article by [[Lafayette Bunnell]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1227">'''The Kinematoscope''' (a.k.a. '''Motoscope''') was patented in 1861 (United States [[Patent]] 31357), a protean development in the [[history of cinema]]. The invention aimed to present the illusion of [[Motion (physics)|motion]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/1860.htm | work=| title=The History of The Discovery of Cinematography - 1860 - 1869 | first= | last= | date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The patent was filed by [[Coleman Sellers II|Coleman Sellers]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] as an "improvement in exhibiting [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] pictures". Coleman applied stereoscopy to the existing principle of toy [[phantasmascope]]s using rotating discs.

A series of still stereographic [[chronophotography|images with chronologically successive stages of action]] were mounted on blades of a spinning paddle and viewed through slits. The slits passed under a stereoscopic viewer. The pictures were visible within a cabinet, and were not projected onto a screen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9934">The '''Laura Spence Affair''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] political controversy in 2000, ignited after the failure of high-flying [[state school]] pupil Laura Spence to secure a place at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Background==
Laura Spence was a pupil at [[Monkseaton High School|Monkseaton Community High School]], a state school in [[Whitley Bay]], [[North Tyneside]].  In 1999, she applied for a place to [[Medical education in the United Kingdom|read medicine]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (there were one hundred students in her school year, but she was the only one to apply for a university place at "[[Oxbridge]]").  Spence had taken ten [[GCSE]]s, obtaining the top A* grade in each, and had been predicted (and later achieved) top [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] grades in Chemistry, Biology, English and Geography.&lt;ref name="war"&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/oxbridge/article/0,,326388,00.html The war of Laura's rejection], ''[[The Observer]]'', 28 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/883358.stm Laura's moment of truth], [[BBC News]], 17 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Spence was interviewed by [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] but she was not offered a place because &amp;mdash; according to the college &amp;mdash; other candidates, of whom there were 22 for 5 positions, had equally good qualifications and had performed better at interview. The reason given for Spence's [[Oxbridge reject|rejection]] was, as one BBC report put it, that she "did not show potential".&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/759114.stm Oxford 'reject' wins Harvard scholarship], [[BBC News]], 22 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The same report said that Spence was one of ten British students to be awarded a $65,000 [[scholarship]] by [[Harvard University]], where she later on studied [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; However, Harvard does not award scholarships to attract individual students; it admits students on a [[need-blind]] basis and then, separately, awards financial aid based solely on familial need.&lt;ref name="financial aid"&gt;[https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/applying-aid/prospective-students Financial Aid for Prospective Students], Harvard University website, accessed 15 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political row==
A political row broke out after [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] (who later became [[Prime Minister]]) commented on the decision at a [[Trades Union Congress]] reception. Brown accused Oxford of [[elitism]], saying that Spence's rejection was an 'absolute scandal' and that he believed she had been discriminated against by 'an old establishment interview system'.  Spence's headteacher, Dr Paul Kelley, also said he believed Oxford was 'missing out' and that he thought that Spence had been rejected because of her being from the north east of England. The University of Oxford rebutted all allegations of discrimination. The BBC reported that [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] had offered only five places to study medicine but had received twenty-two applicants, and that Oxford received a similar number of applications from state schools and private schools in the north east of England, and accepted a similar proportion from each.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; The admissions tutor at Magdalen, Andrew Hobson, also denied the claims, pointing out that he was from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name = "telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml;jsessionid=05J53B0LJY4AXQFIQMFCFFWAVCBQYIV0?html=/archive/2000/05/23/nharv23.html State school applicants to Oxford drop to 54pc], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Lucas|Dr Colin Lucas]], [[Vice-Chancellor]] of Oxford, said that Brown's remarks were "disappointing", and an unnamed Conservative spokesman reportedly told the BBC: "This is ignorant prejudice. Why doesn't Gordon Brown get on with delivering at least some of the things Labour were elected on, rather than telling universities which candidates they should pick for which courses, when he can't possibly know the full facts."&lt;ref name="attack"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/764141.stm Chancellor attacks Oxford admissions], [[BBC News]], 26 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing debate, those who disagreed with the Chancellor advanced a range of arguments: some believed there was no discrimination; some felt Brown did not have his facts straight and therefore should not have offered a public opinion; and some believed that Oxford was correct in not offering Laura Spence a place.  When the issue was raised at an Oxford edition of the [[BBC|BBC's]] political discussion show ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in October 2000, Professor [[Robert Winston]] said that Spence did not deserve a place, because "you have to be committed to the course, and Laura Spence clearly wasn't committed because she didn't even end up studying medicine."&lt;ref name="winston"&gt;[http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2000wk3/News/oxford_in_question Oxford In Question] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023002/http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2000wk3/News/oxford_in_question |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[The Oxford Student]], 26 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; (Harvard, along with most other universities in the USA, does not [[Medical school in the United States|offer medicine]] as an [[Undergraduate education#American system|undergraduate degree]]: Spence later went on to study Medicine at Cambridge as a [[postgraduate]]&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/she-could-get-a-place-to-study-at-oxford-or-cambridge-so-why-is-dominique-off-to-harvard-instead-506412.html She could get a place to study at Oxford or Cambridge. So why is Dominique off to Harvard instead?], ''[[The Independent]]'', 11 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Spence herself did not get involved in the arguments, subsequently saying that she tried to ignore the row by focusing on revision and not watching television for a week.&lt;ref name="right"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1443063.stm Oxford was right, says Laura], [[BBC News]], 17 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[House of Lords]] debate on [[Universities in the United Kingdom|Higher Education]] on 15 June 2000, [[Roy Jenkins|Lord Jenkins of Hillhead]], a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[peerage|peer]] and then [[Chancellor]] of Oxford University, criticised Brown for his comments on student admissions, saying that "nearly every fact he used was false", and that Brown's speech on Spence had been a "little Blitzkrieg in being an act of sudden unprovoked aggression", but "The target was singularly ill-chosen."  [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] peer [[Janet Young, Baroness Young|Baroness Young]] stated that it was "an ultimate disgrace to use a young girl, a sixth former, in this way".&lt;ref name="peers"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/792021.stm Peers condemn Oxford attack], [[BBC News]], 15 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the row==
The Laura Spence Affair recurred in the headlines in the UK throughout the summer of 2000 (both before &lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/story/0,,255380,00.html Oxford blues], [[The Guardian]], May 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and after Brown's speech), and is arguably one of the major events that pushed [[widening participation|"widening participation" in Higher Education]] into the political spotlight in the United Kingdom. It also caused a party political row over a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report on [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1159267.stm Row over university report], [[BBC News]], 8 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence completed her studies at Harvard in 2004, and planned to return to the UK to pursue a medical career.  She also encouraged more British students to study in the US, citing the "broader, more balanced curriculum" of a [[liberal arts]] education and the availability of scholarships and need-based financial aid to assist with fees that may seem "astronomically prohibitive".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3537724.stm Laura Spence urges students to US], [[BBC News]], 5 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later reported that she was studying medicine at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

In 2007 ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' revisited the affair, comprehensively reviewing the political statements at the time set against the facts of the case, and subsequent political and educational fall-out. It was highly critical of Gordon Brown's "spectacular own goal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article2060831.ece "University Challenge"], Godfrey Smith, [[The Sunday Times]] (London), July 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 25 October 2008, Spence graduated from [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]], with a degree in Medicine. Cambridge said she graduated from her medicine course with distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080686/Former-comprehensive-girl-centre-Oxford-elitism-row-graduates-Cambridge.html |title=Former comprehensive girl at centre of Oxford elitism row graduates from Cambridge &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2008-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of national liquors'''. A national liquor is a [[Liquor|distilled alcoholic beverage]] considered standard and respected in a given country. While the status of many such drinks may be informal, there is usually a consensus in a given country that a specific drink has national status or is the "most popular liquor" in a given nation. This list is distinct from [[National dish#Drink|national drinks]], which include non-alcoholic beverages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10907">'''Luba art''' refers to the [[visual culture|visual]] and [[material culture]] of the [[Luba people]]. Most objects were created by people living along the [[Lualaba River]] and around the lakes of the [[Upemba Depression]], or among related peoples to the east in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

The exact date of the founding of the [[Luba Kingdom]] is uncertain. According to oral tradition, the cultural hero [[Kalala Ilunga]] conquered the lands of adjacent chiefs along the Lualaba River. He and his successors were venerated as living divinities capable of great power. During the eighteenth century the Luba empire expanded eastward and southward until it reached the basins of the [[Sankuru River|Sankuru]] and [[Lomami River|Lomami]] rivers. Luba art consequently varies regionally and has also influenced the art of neighboring peoples including the [[Hemba]] and the [[Boyo (department)|Boyo]]. Most of the Luba art in Western collections was originally produced in association with royal or chiefly courts and was meant to validate the power of leaders. Luba art forms tend to be "delicately modeled and curvilinear, expressing serenity and introspection." &lt;ref name=Siegmann /&gt;

In December 2010, prestigious auctioning house [[Sotheby's]] announced that a Luba sculpture made by the legendary ''[[Master of Buli]]'' was sold for 7,100,000,00 USD in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOUrfiA7bHk&lt;/ref&gt; The sale made that Luba caryatid stool the second most expensive piece of African art in History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanartclub.com/african-art/master-of-buli-stool/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217035617/http://africanartclub.com/african-art/master-of-buli-stool/ |archivedate=2010-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulfrasercollectibles.com/News/Art-%26-Photography/'Finest'-religious-stool-by-African-Buli-Master-sets-$7.5m-World-Record-price/5357.page&lt;/ref&gt;


==Luba aesthetics==
According to Luba spokespersons, the outward form and iconography of Luba objects are directly connected to their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Mary Nooter Roberts &amp; Allen F.|title=Luba|year=2007|publisher=5 continents|location=Milan|isbn=8874392974}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Luba, how an object looks dictates how well it works.&lt;ref name="Loughran 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loughran|first=Kristyne|title=Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World|year=2006|publisher=University of Washington Press for the Canton Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University, and the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History|location=Seattle|pages=194–201|authorlink=Does It Have to Be Beautiful to Empower?|editor=T. Seligman and K. Loughran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez 1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernandez|first=James|title=The Traditional Artist in African Societies|year=1975|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|pages=194–220|authorlink=The Exposition and Imposition of Order: Artistic Expression in Fang Culture|editor=W. d'Azevedo}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be considered effective, an object must work to protect, promote, and heal individuals and communities.

==Emphasis on women in Luba arts==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1108a-b Water Pipe.jpg|thumbnail|Luba water pipe, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Almost all Luba art includes the female form either surmounting or supporting objects such as headrests, staffs, spears, axes or bowls. The female figure holding her breasts is the most common motif in Luba art.&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture has multiple levels of meaning, symbolizing respect, nurturing, and the role of women as mothers. The representation is also significant since the Luba trace descent through the female line. This gesture also references the fact that in Luba culture, only women are deemed strong enough to guard the profound secrets of royalty, and it is within their breasts that they protect the royal prohibitions upon which sacred kingship depends.&lt;ref name="Nooter 1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mary|first=Nooter|title=Luba Art and Policy: Creating Power in a Central African Kingdom|year=1991|publisher=PhD Dissertation, Columbia University|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women also often bear signs of Luba identity such as pervasive marks of beauty in the form of scarification.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

Luba explain that only women, who have the potential to become pregnant and produce new life, are strong enough to hold powerful spirits and the secret knowledge associated with them.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996" /&gt;

Because of the emphasis on women, Luba objects were usually the property of men of noble status. The artists who made them were also men, trained in blacksmithing and woodcarving.

=="Mapping Memory"==
The concept of memory is central to an understanding of Luba art. Luba map memory through the iconography of stools, staffs, and other visual devices.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Memory : Luba art and the making of history : [... in conjunction with an exhibition ... presented by the Museum for African Art, New York (2 february - 8 september 1996)]|year=1996|publisher=Museum for African Art|location=New York|isbn=379131677X|editor=Mary Nooter Roberts and Allen F. Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since precolonial times, the  recounting of history has been a specific and highly valued form of intellectual activity among Luba. Visual representations (Luba art) has been a primary vehicle for the making of Luba histories of kingship and political relations.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996" /&gt;

==Lukasa memory boards==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 76.20.4 Lukasa Memory Board.jpg|thumbnail|Lukasa memory board, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
{{Main|Lukasa (Luba)}}

Central to Luba artistry is the ''[[Lukasa (Luba)|lukasa]]'', a seemingly simple but extraordinarily sophisticated device that aids memory and the making of histories. Stools, staffs, figures, and complex choreographies complement the ''lukasa'' as Luba culture is remembered, produced, and transformed.

''Lukasa'' memory boards are hourglass-shaped wooden tablets that are covered with multicolored beads, shells and bits of metal, or are incised or embossed with carved symbols.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reefe|first=Thomas|title=Lukasa: A Luba Memory Device|journal=African Arts|year=1978|volume=10|issue=4|pages=48–50, 88|doi=10.2307/3335144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors and configurations of beads or ideograms serve to stimulate the recollection of important people, places, things, relationships and events as court historians narrate the origins of Luba authority. A ''lukasa'' serves as an archive for the topographical and chronological mapping of political histories and other data sets.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

==Staffs==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.193 Ceremonial Staff Kibango.jpg|thumbnail|Ceremonial staff (Kibango), from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Staffs of office are among the most plentiful of Luba royal insignia. They are also the most diverse in iconography because their ownership was considerably more democratic than that of stools: caryatid stools were restricted to highest-ranking political offices, whereas staffs could belong to diviners, Mbudye members, title-holders and territorial chiefs. No two Luba staffs are alike because each encodes the histories, genealogies and migrations of a particular family, lineage or chiefdom. The details of a particular staff act as mnemonic cues, which assist narrators in "politically motivated recollection of the past."&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

==Caryatid stools==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 56.6.92 Stool.jpg|thumbnail|:Luba caryatid stool, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
While many objects of Luba art appear to be functional, their utilitarian purposes have been replaced or augmented by symbolic purposes. Sculpted caryatid stools serve symbolically as seats of power and sites of memory for deceased kings and chiefs rather than serve as places to sit. Therefore, they are metaphorical, not literal, seats of kingship. The design of Luba seats of leadership may either be abstract or figurative. Those incorporating female caryatids give expression to the Luba conception of the female body as a spiritual receptacle that supports divine kingship. The aesthetic refinement of the female body through elaborate skin ornamentation serves as a metaphor for the civilization and refinement that Luba rulers disseminate within society.

Like ''lukasas'', Luba stools and staffs are "mnemonic mapping devices." They reflect and simulate "place memory" because they refer to sacred sites and prompt the narration of political histories through their forms.&lt;ref name="Casey 1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Edward|title=Remembering: A Phenomenological Study|year=1987|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luba caryatid stools embodied important rulers of the past. When a Luba king died, his royal residence (or ''kitenta'') became the site where his spirit was incarnated by a female medium called Mwadi. This woman was possessed by the spirit of the king and inherited his insignia, dignitaries and wives. The succeeding king established a new residence, and throughout his reign he offered tribute to the ''mwadi'' of his predecessor. A caryatid stool is therefor a concrete manifestation of this metaphysical "seat."&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

==Bow stands==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1345 Bow Stand Nsakakabemba.jpg|thumbnail|Bow stand, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Wooden or iron bow stands may have begun as practical objects, but they are also potent reminders of Mbidi Kiluwe, the culture hero who was a masterful hunter and blacksmith.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt; Like other Luba regalia, bow stands were deployed in secret rituals and rarely publicly displayed. They were guarded in a special building by female dignitaries who provided prayers and sacrifices to them. Otherwise they were kept beside the bed of the ruler to inform his dreams and protect him from mystical and human adversaries. Iron bow stands make anthropomorphic references through hourglass-shaped torsos reminiscent of ''lukasa'' memory boards. Wooden bow stands are often adorned with full female figures referring to founders of royal lineages or Bevidye.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt; Finally the metal shaft of bow stands convey the king's strength, and when planted in the ground, they testify to his origins and power.

[[File:Melusinediscovered.jpg|thumbnail|Melusine's secret discovered, from ''Le Roman de Mélusine'' by Jean d'Arras, ca 1450–1500. Bibliothèque nationale de France.]]
 
'''Melusine''' ({{IPA-fr|melyzin|lang}}) or '''Melusina''' is a figure of [[Europe]]an [[folklore]] and [[Mythology|mythology]] (mostly [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]), a female [[spirit#Metaphysical and metaphorical uses|spirit]] of [[fresh water]] in a [[sacred spring]] or [[river]]. She is usually depicted as a woman who is a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or [[fish]] from the waist down (much like a [[mermaid]]). She is also sometimes illustrated with wings, two tails, or both. Her legends are especially connected with the northern and western areas of [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Low Countries]]. The [[House of Luxembourg]] (which ruled the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from AD 1308 to AD 1437 as well as [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]]), the Counts of Anjou and their descendants the [[House of Plantagenet]] (kings of England) and the French [[House of Lusignan]] (kings of [[Cyprus]] from AD 1205–1472, and for shorter periods over [[Armenia]] and [[Jerusalem]]) are said in folk tales and medieval literature to be descended from Melusine. 

One tale says Melusine herself was the daughter of the [[fairy]] Pressyne and king Elinas of [[Scotland|Albany]] (now known as Scotland). Melusine's mother leaves her husband, taking her daughters to the isle of [[Avalon]] after he breaks an oath never to look in at her and her daughter in their bath. The same pattern appears in stories where Melusine marries a nobleman only after he makes an oath to give her privacy in her bath; each time, she leaves the nobleman after he breaks that oath. [[Shapeshifting]] and flight on wings away from oath-breaking husbands also figure in stories about Melusine. According to [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] in ''Curious Tales of the Middle Ages'', the pattern of the tale is similar to the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend which inspired the character "[[Lohengrin]]" in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. &lt;ref name="S.Baring-Gould"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Curious Myths of the Middle Ages |last=Baring-Gould |first=Sabine |publisher=Roberts Brothers |year=1882 |location=Boston : |pages=343–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary versions==
[[File:Bookofmelusine.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Raymond walks in on his wife, Melusine, in her bath and discovers she has the lower body of a serpent. Illustration from the [[Jean d'Arras]] work, ''Le livre de Mélusine'' (The Book of Melusine), 1478.]]
The most famous literary version of Melusine tales, that of [[Jean d'Arras]], compiled about 1382–1394, was worked into a collection of "spinning yarns" as told by ladies at their spinning coudrette ([[wikisource:fr:Couldrette|coulrette (in French)]]). He wrote ''The Romans of Partenay or of Lusignen: Otherwise known as the Tale of Melusine,'' giving source and historical notes, dates and background of the story. He goes into detail and depth about the relationship of Melusine and Raymondin, their initial meeting and the complete story.

The tale was translated into [[German language|German]] in 1456 by Thüring von Ringoltingen, which version became popular as a [[chapbook]]. It was later translated into [[English language|English]] c. 1500, and often printed in both the 15th century and the 16th century. A prose version is entitled the ''Chronique de la princesse'' (''Chronicle of the Princess'').

It tells how in the time of the Crusades, Elynas, the King of [[Alba]]ny (an old name for [[Scotland]] or [[Alba]]), went hunting one day and came across a beautiful lady in the forest. She was Pressyne, mother of Melusine. He persuaded her to marry him but she agreed, only on the promise—for there is often a hard and fatal condition attached to any pairing of [[fairy|fay]] and mortal—that he must not enter her chamber when she birthed or bathed her children. She gave birth to triplets. When he violated this taboo, Pressyne left the kingdom, together with her three daughters, and traveled to the lost Isle of [[Avalon]].

The three girls—Melusine, Melior, and Palatyne—grew up in Avalon. On their fifteenth birthday, Melusine, the eldest, asked why they had been taken to Avalon. Upon hearing of their father's broken promise, Melusine sought revenge. She and her sisters captured Elynas and locked him, with his riches, in a mountain. Pressyne became enraged when she learned what the girls had done, and punished them for their disrespect to their father. Melusine was condemned to take the form of a serpent from the waist down every Saturday. In other stories, she takes on the form of a mermaid.

Raymond of [[Poitou]] came across Melusine in a forest of Coulombiers in [[Poitou]] in [[France]], and proposed marriage. Just as her mother had done, she laid a condition: that he must never enter her chamber on a Saturday. He broke the promise and saw her in the form of a part-woman, part-serpent, but she forgave him. When, during a disagreement, he called her a "serpent" in front of his court, she assumed the form of a [[dragon]], provided him with two [[magic ring]]s, and flew off, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boria Sax]], ''The Serpent and the Swan: Animal Brides in Literature and Folklore''. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press/ McDonald &amp; Woodward, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Wandering Unicorn]]'' by [[Manuel Mujica Láinez]], Melusine tells her tale of several centuries of existence, from her original curse to the time of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/search?q=Wandering+Unicorn++Lainez&amp;qt=results_page Láinez, Manuel Mujica (1983) ''The Wandering Unicorn'' Chatto &amp; Windus, London] {{ISBN|0-7011-2686-8}};&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
Melusine legends are especially connected with the northern areas of [[France]], [[Poitou]] and the [[Low Countries]], as well as [[Cyprus]], where the French [[Lusignan]] royal house that ruled the island from 1192 to 1489 claimed to be descended from Melusine. Oblique reference to this was made by Sir [[Walter Scott]] who told a Melusine tale in ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' (1802–1803) stating that
{{cquote|the reader will find the fairy of [[Normandy]], or [[Brittany|Bretagne]], adorned with all the splendour of Eastern description. The fairy Melusina, also, who married [[Guy de Lusignan]], Count of [[Poitou]], under condition that he should never attempt to intrude upon her privacy, was of this latter class. She bore the count many children, and erected for him a magnificent castle by her magical art. Their harmony was uninterrupted until the prying husband broke the conditions of their union, by concealing himself to behold his wife make use of her enchanted bath. Hardly had Melusina discovered the indiscreet intruder, than, transforming herself into a dragon, she departed with a loud yell of lamentation, and was never again visible to mortal eyes; although, even in the days of [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme|Brantome]], she was supposed to be the protectress of her descendants, and was heard wailing as she sailed upon the blast round the turrets of the [[Château de Lusignan|castle of Lusignan]] the night before it was demolished.}}

[[File:Melusine-Ludwig Michael von Schwanthaler-1845.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Melusine by [[Ludwig Michael von Schwanthaler]] (1845)]]
The [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg family]] also claimed descent from Melusine through their ancestor [[Siegfried of Luxembourg|Siegfried]].&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Philippa Gregory]] |author2=[[David Baldwin (historian)|David Baldwin]] |author3=[[Michael Jones (historian)|Michael Jones]] |title=[[The Women of the Cousins' War]]  |year=2011 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When in 963 A.D. Count Siegfried of the [[Ardennes]] (''Sigefroi'' in French; ''Sigfrid'' in Luxembourgish) bought the feudal rights to the territory on which he founded his capital city of [[Luxembourg]], his name became connected with the local version of Melusine. This Melusina had essentially the same magic gifts as the ancestress of the Lusignans, magically making the Castle of Luxembourg on the [[Bock (Luxembourg)|Bock]] rock (the historical center point of Luxembourg City) appear the morning after their wedding. On her terms of marriage, she too required one day of absolute privacy each week. Alas, Sigfrid, as the Luxem-bourgish call him, "could not resist temptation, and on one of the forbidden days he spied on her in her bath and discovered her to be a mermaid. When he let out a surprised cry, Melusina caught sight of him, and her bath immediately sank into the solid rock, carrying her with it. Melusina surfaces briefly every seven years as a beautiful woman or as a serpent, holding a small golden key in her mouth. Whoever takes the key from her will set her free and may claim her as his bride." In 1997 Luxembourg issued a postage stamp commemorating her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxcentral.com/stamps/LuxStamps1997.html#Europa.1997 Luxembourg Stamps: 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] knew and believed in the story of another version of Melusine, ''die Melusina zu Lucelberg'' (Lucelberg in [[Silesia]]), whom he referred to several times as a [[succubus]] (''Works,'' Erlangen edition, volume 60, pp 37–42).  [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote the tale of ''Die Neue Melusine'' in 1807 and published it as part of ''Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre.'' The playwright [[Franz Grillparzer]] brought Goethe's tale to the stage and [[Felix Mendelssohn]] provided a concert overture "The Fair Melusina," his Opus 32.

Melusine is one of the pre-Christian water-faeries {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} who were sometimes responsible for [[changeling]]s. The "[[Lady of the Lake]]", who spirited away the infant [[Lancelot]] and raised the child, was such a water nymph. Other European water sprites include [[Lorelei]] and the [[Neck (water spirit)|nixie]].

"Melusina" would seem to be an uneasy name for a girl-child in these areas of Europe, but [[Ehrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal and Munster]], mistress of [[George I of Great Britain]], was christened Melusine in 1667.

The chronicler [[Gerald of Wales]] reported that [[Richard I of England]] was fond of telling a tale according to which he was a descendant of a countess of Anjou who was in fact the fairy Melusine, concluding that his whole family "came from the devil and would return to the devil".&lt;ref&gt;[[Flori, Jean]] (1999), Richard Coeur de Lion: le roi-chevalier, Paris: Biographie Payot, {{ISBN|978-2-228-89272-8}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angevin legend told of an early Count of Anjou who met a beautiful woman when in a far land, where he married her. He had not troubled to find out about her origins. However, after bearing him four sons, the behaviour of his wife began to trouble the count. She attended church infrequently, and always left before the Mass proper. One day he had four of his men forcibly restrain his wife as she rose to leave the church. Melusine evaded the men and clasped the two youngest of her sons and in full view of the congregation carried them up into the air and out of the church through its highest window. Melusine and her two sons were never seen again. One of the remaining sons was the ancestor, it was claimed, of the later Counts of Anjou and the Kings of England.&lt;ref&gt;Huscroft, R.

''[[The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'' recounts a legend about [[Hippocrates]]' daughter. She was transformed into a hundred-foot long [[dragon]] by the goddess [[Artemis|Diane]], and is the "lady of the manor" of an old castle. She emerges three times a year, and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands. Various knights try, but flee when they see the hideous dragon; they die soon thereafter. This appears to be an early version of the legend of Melusine.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Deluz, ''Le livre de Jehan de Mandeville'', Leuven 1998, p. 215, as reported by Anthony Bale, trans., ''The Book of Marvels and Travels'', Oxford 2012, {{ISBN|0199600600}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KqonpxzxlFoC&amp;pg=PA15 p. 15] and footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural interpretation==
[[Jacques Le Goff]] considered that Melusina represented a fertility figure: "she brings prosperity in a rural area...Melusina is the fairy of medieval economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;J. Le Goff, ''Time, Work and Culture in the Middle Ages'' (London 1982) p. 218-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Otkrivane paraklis Svetlen 2.jpg|thumb|right|Orthodox mitres are richly decorated in Christian iconography, often displaying intricate crosses and images of Christ and Mary.]]
The '''mitre''' ([[British English]]) ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|t|ər}}; Greek: μίτρα, "headband" or "turban") or '''miter''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|see spelling differences]]), is a type of [[headgear]] now known as the traditional, ceremonial head-dress of [[bishop]]s and certain [[abbot]]s in traditional Christianity. Mitres are worn in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], as well as in the [[Anglican Communion]], some  [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, and also bishops and certain other clergy in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]]. The Metropolitan of the [[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]] also wears a mitre during important ceremonies such as the [[Consecration|Episcopal Consecration]].

==Origin==
===Etymology===
μίτρα, ''mítra'' ([[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] μίτρη, ''mítrē'') is [[Greek language|Greek]], and means a piece of armour, usually a metal guard worn around the waist and under a [[cuirass]], as mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]]; in later Poets, a headband used by women for their hair; and a sort of formal [[Babylon]]ian head dress, as mentioned by [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 1.195 and 7.90). It also refers to a kind of hairband, such as: the victor's chapter at the games; a headband and a badge of rank at the Ptolemaic court; an oriental headdress, perhaps a kind of turban, etc. as a mark of effeminacy, a diadem; headdress of the priest of [[Heracles]]; headdress of the Jewish high priest al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmi%2Ftra first appears]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine empire===
The ''camelaucum'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: [[Kamilavka|καμιλαύκιον]], ''kamilaukion''), the headdress, that both the mitre and the [[Papal tiara]] stem from, was originally a cap used by officials of the Imperial [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court. "The tiara [from which the mitre originates] probably developed from the Phrygian cap, or frigium, a conical cap worn in the Graeco-Roman world. In the 10th century the tiara was pictured on papal coins."&lt;ref&gt;[[Britannica]] 2004, ''tiara''&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim the tiara developed the other way around, from the mitre. In the late Empire it developed into the closed type of Imperial [[crown (headgear)|crown]] used by [[Byzantine Emperors]] (see illustration of [[Michael III]], 842-867).

Worn by a bishop, the mitre is depicted for the first time in two miniatures of the beginning of the eleventh century. The first written mention of it is found in a [[Papal bull|Bull]] of [[Pope Leo IX]] in the year 1049. By 1150 the use had spread to bishops throughout the West; by the 14th century the tiara was decorated with three crowns.

==Christian clergy==
[[File:Mitre evolution.gif|thumb|right|The evolution of the mitre, from the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1913)]]

===Western Christianity===
In its modern form in [[Western Christianity]], the mitre is a tall folding [[cap]], consisting of two similar parts (the front and back) rising to a peak and sewn together at the sides. Two short [[lappet]]s always hang down from the back.

In the [[Catholic Church]], the right to wear the mitre is confined by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] to [[bishop]]s and to [[abbot]]s, as it appears in the ceremony of [[consecration]] of a bishop and blessing of an abbot. [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] are now normally supposed to be bishops (since the time of [[Pope John XXIII]]), but even cardinals who are not bishops and who have been given special permission by the pope to decline consecration as bishops may wear the mitre. Other [[prelate]]s have been granted the use of the mitre by special [[Privilege (canon law)|privilege]], but this is no longer done, except in the case of an Ordinary of a Personal Ordinariate (even if he is a priest only). Former distinctions between "mitred abbots" and "non-mitred abbots" have been abolished.

[[File:Mitra simplex Gamarelli 2008-28-07.jpg|thumb|Mitre ''simplex'' traditional style: White [[damask]] with its white lappets ending in red fringes.]]
Three types of mitres are worn by Roman Catholic clergy for different occasions:
* The ''simplex'' ('simple', referring to the materials used) is made of undecorated white linen or silk and its white lappets traditionally end in red fringes. It is worn most notably at funerals, Lenten time, on [[Good Friday]] and by concelebrant bishops at a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Cardinals in the presence of the Pope wear a mitre of white linen damask.
* The ''auriphrygiata'' is of plain gold cloth or white silk with gold, silver or coloured embroidered bands; when seen today it is usually worn by bishops when they preside at the celebration of the sacraments.
* The ''pretiosa'' ('precious') is decorated with precious stones and gold and worn on the principal Mass on the most solemn Sundays (except in Lent) and feast days. This type of mitre is rarely decorated with precious stones today, and the designs have become more varied, simple and original, often merely being in the liturgical colour of the day.

The proper colour of a mitre is always white, although in liturgical usage white also includes vestments made from gold and silver fabrics.  The embroidered bands and other ornaments which adorn a mitre and the lappets may be of other colours and often are.  Although coloured mitres are sometimes sold and worn at present, this is probably due to the maker’s or wearer’s lack of awareness of liturgical tradition.{{dubious|date=June 2017}}

On all occasions, an [[altar server]] may wear a shawl-like [[veil]], called a [[vimpa]], around the shoulders when holding the bishop's mitre. The vimpa is used to hold the mitre so as to avoid the possibility of it being soiled by the natural oils in a person's hand as well as symbolically showing that the person does not own the mitre, but merely holds it for the prelate. The person wearing a vimpa is also occasionally referred to as a vimpa. When a vimpa holds the crosier, he holds the crook facing inward, as another sign that the person does not hold the authority of the crosier.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Benedictus XVI.svg|thumb|left|[[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|Papal Arms]] of Pope Benedict XVI. The [[papal tiara]] was replaced with a bishop's mitre.]]

With his [[Papal inauguration|inauguration as pope]], [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] broke with tradition and replaced the [[papal tiara]] even on [[coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his papal coat of arms]] with a papal mitre (containing still the three levels of 'crowns' representing the powers of the [[Papacy]] in a simplified form) and [[pallium]]. Prior to Benedict XVI, each pope's coat of arms always contained the image of the papal tiara and St. Peter's crossed keys, even though the tiara had fallen into disuse, especially under popes [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. Pope [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] was the last pope to date to begin his papal reign with a formal coronation in June 1963. However, as a sign of the perceived need for greater simplification of the papal rites, as well as the changing nature of the papacy itself, he abandoned the use of his tiara in a dramatic ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica during the second session of [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in November 1963. However his 1975 [[Apostolic Constitution]] made it clear the tiara had not been abolished: in the constitution he made provision for his successor to receive a coronation. Pope John Paul I, however, declined to follow Paul VI's constitution and opted for a simpler [[papal inauguration]], a precedent followed by his three successors. Pope John Paul II's 1996 Apostolic Constitution left open several options by not specifying what sort of ceremony was to be used, other than that some ceremony would be held to inaugurate a new pontificate.

Pope Paul VI donated his tiara (a gift from his former archdiocese of Milan) to the efforts at relieving poverty in the world. Later, [[Francis Spellman|Francis Cardinal Spellman]] of New York received the tiara and took it on tour of the United States to raise funds for the poor. It is on permanent view in the Crypt Church in the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In the [[Church of England]], the mitre fell out of use after the Reformation, but was restored in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a result of the [[Oxford Movement]], and is now worn by most bishops of the [[Anglican Communion]] on at least some occasions.  The mitre is also worn by bishops in a number of Lutheran churches, for example the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]] and the [[Church of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/386220/mitre&lt;/ref&gt;

In  [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], a mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were entitled to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the  [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] of military arms, but also appeared as a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry.&lt;ref name="heraldry_CathEnc"&gt;{{CathEncy | wstitle=Ecclesiastical Heraldry | short=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops instead of the  [[ecclesiastical hat]]. In the Roman Catholic Church, the use of the mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm "Instruction"], 1969, n.28.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat,&lt;ref&gt;Lartigue, ''Dictionnaire''.&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''Heraldry of the World'', p.171, shows the arms of Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] with mitre in 1967, just two years before the 1969 [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm ''Instruction''.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In heraldry the mitre is always shown in [[Or (heraldry)|gold]], and the lappets (infulae) are of the same colour. It has been asserted that before the reformation, a distinction was used to be drawn between the mitre of a bishop and an abbot by the omission of the infulae in the abbot's arms. 
In England and France it was usual to place the mitre of an abbot slightly in profile.&lt;ref name="heraldry_CathEnc"/&gt;

===Eastern Christianity===
[[File:Mitre of Saint Chrysostomos Metropolitan of Smyrna.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mitre of Orthodox [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Chrysostomos of Smyrna]], killed when the Turks captured the city in 1922.]]
[[File:Mitre-benaki.jpg|right|thumb|Elaborately embroidered Eastern Orthodox mitre, 1715.]]

The most typical mitre in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Byzantine Catholic]] churches is based on the closed Imperial crown of the late [[Byzantine Empire]]. Therefore, it too is ultimately based on the older καμιλαύκιον although it diverged from the secular headdress at a much later date, after it had already undergone further development. The crown form was not used by bishops until after the [[fall of Constantinople]] (1453).

The Eastern mitre is made in the shape of a bulbous crown, completely enclosed, and the material is of [[brocade]], [[damask]] or [[cloth of gold]]. It may also be [[embroidery|embroidered]], and is often richly decorated with jewels. There are normally four [[icons]] attached to the mitre (often of Christ, the [[Theotokos]], [[John the Baptist]] and the [[Christian Cross|Cross]]), which the bishop may kiss before he puts it on. Eastern mitres are usually gold, but other [[liturgical colours]] may be used.

The mitre is topped by a cross, either made out of metal and standing upright, or embroidered in cloth and lying flat on the top. In [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek practice]], the mitres of all bishops are topped with a standing cross. The same is true in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian tradition]].  Mitres awarded to priests will have the cross lying flat. Sometimes, instead of the flat cross, the mitre may have an [[icon]] on the top.

[[File:Al Quds Patriarch.jpg|thumb|Bishops of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] in [[Jerusalem]] wearing mitres.]]

As an item of Imperial [[Wiktionary:regalia|regalia]], along with other such items as the [[sakkos]] (Imperial [[dalmatic]]) and [[epigonation]], the mitre came to signify the temporal authority of bishops (especially that of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]) within the administration of the ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Rum millet]]'' (i.e., the Christian community) of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The mitre is removed at certain solemn moments during the [[Divine Liturgy]] and other services, usually being removed and replaced by the [[protodeacon]].

The use of the mitre is a prerogative of bishops, but it may be awarded to [[archpriest]]s, [[protopresbyter]]s and [[archimandrite]]s. The priestly mitre is not surmounted by a cross, and is awarded at the discretion of a [[synod]] of bishops.

==Military uniform==
[[File:Shapka grenaderskaya (1740-60s).jpg|thumb|left|A Russian grenadier mitre.]]
During the 18th century (and in a few cases the 19th), soldiers designated as [[grenadier]]s in various northern European armies wore a mitre (usually called a "mitre cap") similar in outline to those worn by western bishops. As first adopted in the 1680s this cap had been worn instead of the usual broad-brimmed hat to avoid the headdress being knocked off when the soldier threw a [[grenade]].&lt;ref name="W.Y. Carman page 68"&gt;W.Y. Carman, page 68 "A Dictionary of Military Uniform," {{ISBN|0-684-15130-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand-grenade in its primitive form had become obsolete by the mid-18th century&lt;ref name="W.Y. Carman page 68"/&gt; but grenadiers continued as elite troops in most European armies, usually retaining the mitre cap as a distinction.

Militarily, this headdress came in different styles. The Prussian style had a cone-shaped brass or white-metal front with a cloth rear having lace braiding;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Haythornthwaite, page 13 "Frederick the Great's Army, vol. 2 Infantry ", {{ISBN|1855321602}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian style initially consisted of a tall brass plate atop of a leather cap with a peak at the rear, although the German model was subsequently adopted. The British style—usually simply called a "grenadier cap" instead of a mitre—had a tall cloth front with elaborate regimental embroidery forward of a sloping red back, lined in white.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Reid, page 24 "King George's Army 1740-93, vol. 1 Infantry," {{ISBN|1 85532 515 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some German and Russian [[fusilier]] regiments also wore a mitre with a smaller brass front-plate.

By the end of the 18th century, due to changes in military fashion, the mitre had generally given way to the [[bearskin]] or had been replaced by the standard infantry [[tricorn]] or [[bicorne|bicorn]]. The British Army made this change in 1765 and the Prussian Army in 1790. All Russian grenadiers continued however to wear mitre caps until 1805, even when on active service.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Haythornthwaite, page 18 "The Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars (1): Infantry, 1799-1814" {{ISBN|0-85045-737-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mitre in its classic metal-fronted 18th century form survived as an item of ceremonial parade dress in the Prussian ''Leib-Grenadier No 1'' and ''1st Garde-Regiment zu Fuss'' regiments, plus the Russian [[Pavlovskii Regiment]], until World War&amp;nbsp;I.

The [[Austrian Imperial Crown]] was originally the personal crown of Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and has the form proper to that of a Holy Roman Emperor. At the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor#The Roman ritual|Roman rite]] of their [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Coronation]], the Pope placed a mitre on their heads before placing the crown over it. Their [[List of Holy Roman Empresses|empress consorts]] also received both a mitre and crown on their heads from a cardinal bishop at the same ceremony. The form of the [[Russian Imperial Crown]] dates back to the time of [[Peter the Great]]’s early attempts to [[Westernisation|westernise]] Russia and was probably inspired by the crowns worn by Habsburg emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and possibly also the Orthodox mitre.

[[Abbess]]es of certain very ancient abbeys in the West also wore mitres, but of a very different form than that worn by male prelates.

The [[mitral valve]] of the human heart, which is located between the [[left atrium]] and the [[left ventricle]], is named so because of its similarity in shape to the mitre. [[Andreas Vesalius]], the father of anatomy, noted the striking similarity between the two while performing anatomic dissections in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Davis O'Malley, "Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514-1564," (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resolution IV.4.422-4224''', commonly referred to as the '''Montevideo Resolution''', is a resolution passed in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] on December 10, 1954 by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]]. The resolution officially supports the [[constructed language]] [[Esperanto]] as an [[international auxiliary language]] and recommends that the [[Director-general|Director-General of UNESCO]] follow current developments in the use of the language. The Montevideo Resolution was the result of a long campaign by [[Ivo Lapenna]].

In 1977, the Director-General visited the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], and in 1985, UNESCO passed a further resolution recommending that member countries encourage the teaching of Esperanto.

'''''Mother 3''''' (also unofficially referred to as '''''EarthBound 2''''') is a 2006 [[role-playing video game]] in the [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'' series]], [[Development of Mother 3|developed]] by [[Brownie Brown]] and [[HAL Laboratory]], and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The game, which is the final entry in the series, was directed by [[Nobuyuki Inoue]], written by series creator [[Shigesato Itoi]], and scored by composer Shogo Sakai. The story follows Lucas, a young boy with psychic abilities, and a party of characters as they attempt to prevent a mysterious invading army from corrupting and destroying the world.

[[Development of Mother 3|The game's development]] spanned twelve years and four consoles, beginning in 1994 for the [[Super Famicom]] console and then transitioning to the [[Nintendo 64]] and its [[64DD]] add-on before being cancelled in 2000. ''Mother 3'' restarted development in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance and was finally released in Japan on April 20, 2006.

''Mother 3'' was a critical and commercial success upon release. Critics generally praised the game's graphics, music, and story, but believed that the gameplay offered few innovations to the role-playing genre. The game was never released outside Japan, though an [[Mother 3 fan translation|unofficial English fan translation]] was released by the [[Starmen.net]] internet community in October 2008. On December 17, 2015,  the game was released for the Japanese [[Virtual Console]] on the [[Wii U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Andrew|title=Mother 3 Coming to Wii U Virtual Console in Japan|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/13/mother-3-coming-to-wii-u-virtual-console-in-japan|publisher=IGN|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the game has achieved a recognition comparable to ''Earthbound'', becoming a cult classic.

== Gameplay ==
''Mother 3'' is a single-player [[role playing video game]] similar to previous games in the [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'' series]]. The player controls a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] of [[player character|playable characters]] who explore the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], primarily shown from a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]]. While navigating the [[overworld]], the player may converse with [[non-player character]]s, obtain [[Item (gaming)|items]], or encounter enemies. Winning battles against enemies awards [[experience point]]s to the party, which is required for [[Experience point#Level-based progression|leveling up]]. Leveling up a character permanently enhances its individual [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]] such as maximum [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] (HP), [[magic point|power points]] (PP), offense, and defense. Weapons, armor, or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes. The player can restore their characters' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting [[hot spring]]s which are abundant in the game world, and the player can [[Saved game|save]] the game by talking to [[frog]]s.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt; Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points (DP), earned by winning battles and used to purchase items. The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs.&lt;ref name="Game quote: DP"/&gt;

[[File:Mother 3 battle.PNG|right|thumb|252px|In a battle sequence, the player can perform [[Combo (video gaming)|combo attacks]] by repeatedly striking to the [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the background music]]

''Mother 3'' retains the [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] [[role-playing video game#Combat|battle system]] featured in ''EarthBound.'' When the player comes into contact with an enemy in the overworld, the game transitions to a battle screen. Battles are viewed from a first-person perspective, showing the enemies against a distorted, animated background. The player can assign each character in their party to perform an action, such as attacking an enemy or using items to restore HP or PP. Some characters can utilize [[psychic]]-based abilities referred to as PSI, which includes stronger attacks and healing abilities, and require PP to execute. Like ''EarthBound'', combat uses a "rolling health" system: when one of the player's characters is injured, its HP will gradually "roll" down, similar to an [[odometer]], rather than immediately decremented. This allows a mortally wounded character to perform actions like attacking or healing themselves, as long as the player acts quickly enough. If a character loses all HP, it will become unconscious and cannot participate unless revived by another character. The player loses a battle if all characters become unconscious; the player will then be given the option to continue play from the nearest save point, but with half the DP on their person.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt;

Combat in ''Mother 3'' includes a unique musical [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]] system not seen in previous ''Mother'' games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button in time with the [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the [[background music]], with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt; When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt;

== Plot ==

Taking place an unknown length of time after the events of ''Mother 2'', ''Mother 3''{{'s}} story is told in eight chapters, including a prologue.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=1}} The game begins with twins Lucas and Claus, and their mother Hinawa visiting her father, who lives up in the mountains. The kids spend their time playing with friendly dinosaur creatures called Dragos. Their home village, Tazmily, is a quiet small town that does not utilize any form of currency. Shortly after Flint, Hinawa's husband, receives a letter from Hinawa, the Pig Mask Army starts a [[forest fire]] and invades Tazmily Village,&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt; a small town in the Nowhere Islands.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=4}}  Flint quickly arrives to help others deal with the fire, but later realizes his family has not yet returned from visiting Hinawa's father.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt; When Hinawa is found dead due to a Drago fang in her chest, Flint lashes out in anger and is imprisoned. Claus sneaks Flint a tool to escape before running off to find the Drago responsible for Hinawa's death.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=27–29}} Flint sets out to find Claus.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=29–42}} In chapter two, neophyte thief Duster breaks into a castle to find an egg that keeps the world's secrets.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=44, 69}} He meets the princess Kumatora, but they are separated when a flood washes them out of the castle.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=65–69}} In chapter three, Pig Mask leader Fassad orders the monkey player-character, Salsa, through the desert.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=72–73}} Salsa escapes to the forest and futilely fights the Pig Mask Army with Kumatora until Lucas saves them by summoning friendly Dragos. Lucas and Flint protect the town while Kumatora and Salsa look for Duster.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=90–91}} In chapter four, three years have passed, Tazmily has been modernized,{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=94}} and Lucas becomes the game's main protagonist.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt; Lucas learns psychic powers from a [[Superpower (ability)|superpowered]], benevolent, cross-dressing creature known as a Magypsy{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=105}} and recovers the amnesic Duster from life as a bandmate.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=121}}

In chapter five, Lucas, Duster and Kumatora recover the egg, and meet a Masked Man.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=124, 141, 147}} In chapter six Lucas meets the ghost of his dead mother Hinawa in a sunflower field. Lucas tries to jump out to her but falls into a stack of hay in Tazmily. In chapter seven, separated from Duster and Kumatora,{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=154}} Lucas and his dog, Boney, learn about the seven Needles kept by seven Magypsies that quell a sleeping dragon underneath the earth. A prophecy foretold that a "chosen one" would come to pull the Needles and wake the dragon and determine the fate of the world.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=158}} Racing the Masked Man in search of these Needles, Lucas battles through a laboratory of chimeras, reunites with Kumatora{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=168}} and Duster, and meets [[Mr. Saturn]].{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=178}} In chapter eight, Pig King Master [[EarthBound (series)#Porky Minch|Porky]], who returned from ''Mother 2'', invites Lucas and his cohorts to New Pork City, where Tazmily residents have relocated. Lucas learns that the islands are protected by the dragon, that the egg contains the destructive mindsets of the outside world, that Porky is after the needles and its subsequent power, and that both Porky's Masked Man and Lucas have each pulled three of the seven Needles.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=208–213}} Lucas and his cohorts fight Porky, and are able to defeat him. However, to protect himself, Porky seals himself within his absolutely safe capsule, which Lucas and his friends can not harm. However, Porky himself can not harm them, and is revealed to be unable to ever leave the capsule. Later, Lucas reunites with Flint.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=229}} As they prepare to pull the final Needle, Lucas's party is hurt by the Masked Man, who is revealed to be a brainwashed Claus, and immediately engages them in battle. Hinawa's spirit attempts to talk to Claus, while Flint badly injures himself to protect Lucas. The fight continues until Claus, now having regained his sense of self, tragically commits suicide by deliberately reflecting one of his attacks off Lucas' Franklin Badge.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|pp=232–233}} Lucas pulls the final Needle, awakening the Dragon and destroying the Nowhere Islands. In an epilogue set in darkness, the game's cast reveals that they have survived (although Porky is still trapped inside the Absolutely Safe Capsule); the world has been rebuilt without Porky's influence.{{sfn|Fangamer|2009|p=234}} In the final frame, the ''Mother 3'' logo is shown without its metal, as restored to nature.&lt;ref name=DREAM-08/&gt;

== Development ==

[[File:64DD-Attached.jpg|thumb|left|The game was designed for the [[64DD]] add-on, shown here as docked beneath the [[Nintendo 64]]]]
{{main article|Development of Mother 3}}

''Mother 3'' began development in 1994 as a game for the [[Super Famicom]] with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Satoru Iwata]] as producers. The team mostly consisted of members involved in the development of ''[[EarthBound]].'' Inspired by the [[Nintendo 64]] launch title ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', the development team transitioned from the Super Famicom to the newer console believing that they could also creatively flourish by making a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world without technical restrictions. However, their early specifications exceeded the capabilities and memory limits of the console; halfway through development the team scaled back its large scope and changed the platform to the [[64DD]], a Nintendo 64  expansion peripheral that was later released only in Japan in 1999.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; ''Mother 3'' was expected to be a launch title for the peripheral, but development shifted back to the Nintendo 64 after the 64DD was considered a commercial failure.&lt;ref name="IGN: 64DD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: SW99"/&gt; A demo of ''Mother 3'' was showcased at the 1999 [[Nintendo Space World]] [[trade show]]. The game was expected to be released in North America under the title ''EarthBound 64'', and the game was also stated to be released on a 256-[[megabit]] cartridge, similar to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''. [[IGN]] reacted favorably to the demo and compared the multi-character narrative to the Japan-only Super Famicom RPG ''[[Live A Live]]'',&lt;ref name="IGN: SW99"/&gt; and ''[[Famitsu]]'' readers ranked the game as one of their top ten most anticipated towards the end of 1999.&lt;ref name="IGN: Zelda"/&gt;

[[Shigesato Itoi]] announced in late August 2000 that ''Mother 3'' was cancelled following a number of delays.&lt;ref name="IGN: cancelled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: M3 PUSHED"/&gt; Iwata and Miyamoto clarified in an interview that resources had been moved to the development of the [[GameCube]], the next Nintendo console. Itoi stated that an additional two years would have been required to finish the game, which was 30% complete at the time of cancellation. Iwata stated retrospectively that the focus on 3D graphics made the project overly complex. Miyamoto also stated that the ''Mother'' franchise was not abandoned and that he was still interested in bringing the game to fruition.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt;

''Mother 3'' was later announced in 2003 to have restarted development for the [[Game Boy Advance]] [[Handheld game console|handheld console]] in a Japanese commercial for ''[[Mother 1+2]]''.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: commercial"/&gt; Itoi had earlier assumed that restarting the project was impossible but later decided to continue following encouragement from the ''Mother'' fanbase.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: 1+2"/&gt; Nintendo subsidiary [[Brownie Brown]] developed the game, with input from Itoi. While the graphics were changed from 3D to [[2D computer graphics|2D]], the game's original story was not altered. ''Mother 3'' was about 60% complete by July 2004, and was released on April 20, 2006, in Japan.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku: hype"/&gt;

=== Design ===

[[File:EarthBound 64 Mother 3 comparison.PNG|thumb|350px|Flint in an inn setting, as compared between the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance versions]]
Itoi thought of the concept behind ''Mother 3'' towards the end of ''Mother 2''{{'s}} production, a "detective story where the city was the main character".&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; He thought of a [[hack writer|hack]], small-time, [[womanizing]] [[private investigator]] who would become engrossed in a big murder case, and the story would unfold from a young female clerk at a flower shop who would slowly recall parts of a story consequential to the plot. Thus, the city would appear to grow. This idea of a "single place changing over time" was central to ''Mother 3''.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; Unlike previous RPGs, which he saw as "[[road movies]]" with little reason to revisit, he wanted the player to see the town gossip grow dynamically.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; It was enough of a departure from the series that the development team questioned whether fans would consider it part of the series.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; Itoi intended the game to have 12 chapters with various game mechanics and rotating player-characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starmen.net/eb64/interviews/5.php |title=Interview: Mycom Inc. |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=starmen.net |publisher= |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This revolving player-character mechanic was first attempted in ''Mother 2''.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt;}} He conceptualized the development as moving 3D puppets before realizing the degree of programming required. As development wore on, Itoi reduced the scope of the chapters until seven or nine were left. The "uncomfortable beauty" of [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]]—multiple creatures fused into one—was central to the game and the idea behind the metallic and wooden ''Mother 3'' logo.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt;{{efn|The ''Mother 3'' logo was made from a fusion of metal and trees, which Itoi interpreted as the discomfort of two materials that were impossible to fuse.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; The chimeras theme informed the game's original subtitle: "Forest of the Chimeras",&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; which eventually became "The End of the Pig King" before the game was cancelled.&lt;ref name="IGN: SW99"/&gt; The final release had no subtitle because Itoi did not want to lead the player's interpretation.&lt;ref name=DREAM-09/&gt;}} Itoi served less of a manager role and more as a team member and scriptwriter than in previous ''Mother'' development cycles. He saw himself as simultaneously making the game he wanted to play and setting traps for the player, and as making a game Nintendo could not.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt;

Itoi chose to use the pixelated style of ''Mother 2'' for the Game Boy Advance ''Mother 3'' because he was uninterested in computer graphics trends.&lt;ref name=DREAM-01/&gt; The series' games were written in the [[hiragana]] alphabet instead of in [[kanji]] (Chinese characters) so as to remain accessible to young children.&lt;ref name=DREAM-07/&gt; Itoi described the game world as governed by a "[[might makes right|might equals right]] ... [[macho]]" power struggle.&lt;ref name=DREAM-03/&gt; The antagonist, Porky, was designed as a "symbol of humankind", complementing Itoi's view of evil on a fungible morality spectrum with "pranks" and "crimes" at its extremes.&lt;ref name=DREAM-09/&gt; Itoi compared the way in which the characters realize their psychic powers with [[menstruation]], and added that [[human physiology]] was "one of his themes".&lt;ref name=DREAM-04/&gt; Players sweat when learning an ability based on Itoi's belief of how physical struggle facilitates growth. He also included characters like the Magypsies and Duster (who has a bad leg) to show the value of having friends with different qualities.&lt;ref name=DREAM-04/&gt; 
{{clear}}
Another of his themes was the duality of the seriousness and lightheartedness of games, which is why he added a serious death scene to the first chapter.&lt;ref name=DREAM-06/&gt; Itoi's Nintendo 64 version of the ending was darker, "dirtier", and more upsetting, though the final version changed little in concept.&lt;ref name=DREAM-07/&gt; Itoi attributed the change in tone to his own growth and the character composition of the new development team. Itoi later reflected on the ending's lesson on the virtue of helping bad people.&lt;ref name=DREAM-07/&gt; Itoi felt that the ending's renewal theme reflected his worldview of appreciating our time on Earth in light of the planet's inevitable end.&lt;ref name=DREAM-08/&gt; Much of the rest of the script was written after-hours at a local hotel where they would continue their work.&lt;ref name=DREAM-07/&gt;

=== Music ===
{{See also|Music of the EarthBound series#Mother 3}}

Shogo Sakai, a [[video game composer]] at HAL Laboratory whose previous works include music for ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', composed ''Mother 3''{{'s}} [[video game music|soundtrack]]. Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was chosen for the role given his deep understanding of the game's story and the ''EarthBound'' series in general, in addition to the fact that ''EarthBound'' composers [[Keiichi Suzuki (composer)|Keiichi Suzuki]] and [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] were both unavailable. Sakai worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.&lt;ref name=DREAM-02/&gt; The ''Mother 3'' soundtrack was released on [[compact disc]] on November 2, 2006. Kyle Miller of ''RPGFan'' wrote that the game retained the quirkiness of the previous soundtracks in the series despite the change in composers. He found the second half of the album, which included reinterpreted "classics" from the series, to be its strongest.&lt;ref name="RPGFan: soundtrack"/&gt;

|description  =A 10 second sample of the game's theme, highlighting the song's simplicity.
}}

"Love Theme", the main theme of ''Mother 3'', was composed late in the game's development; earlier in development Itoi intended to use the "Pigmask Army" theme as the main theme of the game. During creation of an important scene in the game, however, Sakai was asked to create a song that would have a greater impact than the Pigmask theme; upon its creation it was chosen to be used as the main theme instead of the "Pigmask Army" song. Itoi claims that, given how quickly Sakai composed the song, that he had been "waiting for the order" to make a song like "Love Theme". Itoi requested that "Love Theme" be playable on a piano with only one finger, as the "Eight Melodies" theme from ''Mother'' had gained popularity and been played in elementary schools due to its simplicity.&lt;ref name="nintendodream"/&gt; The "OK desu ka?" that plays after the player chooses the character's name was recorded without Itoi's knowledge by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] more than a decade before the release of ''Mother 3''.&lt;ref name="nintendodream"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview (Part 1)|url=http://mother3.fobby.net/interview/ |publisher=Nintendo Dream |accessdate=2009-01-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215151038/http://mother3.fobby.net/interview/ |archivedate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==

[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Purple-FL.jpg|thumb|''Mother 3''{{'s}} development spanned four consoles. The game was eventually released for the handheld Game Boy Advance.]]

''Mother 3'' was released in Japan on April 20, 2006, where it became a bestseller.&lt;ref name="1UP: Vapor"/&gt; Prior to its release, the game was in the "top five most wanted games" of ''Famitsu''&lt;ref name="Edge: Famitsu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge: Rogers"/&gt; and at the top of the Japanese [[pre-order|preordered]] game charts.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt; At one point leading up to its release, the game's "Love Theme" would play as [[music on hold]] for the [[Japan Post]].&lt;ref name="Edge: Rogers"/&gt; A [[limited edition]] Deluxe Box Set was produced with a special edition [[Game Boy Micro]] and Franklin Badge pin.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: deluxe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: deluxe"/&gt; The game was marketed in Japan with a television commercial that has Japanese actress [[Kō Shibasaki]] on the verge of tears as she explains her feelings about ''Mother 3''. Itoi has said that her performance was unscripted.&lt;ref name=DREAM-07/&gt;

=== Fan translation ===

{{main article|Mother 3 fan translation}}

''Mother 3'' did not receive an official release outside Japan. On October 17, 2008, [[Starmen.net]] released a [[fan translation of video games|fan translation]] [[Patch (computing)|patch]] that, when applied on a copy of the ''Mother 3'' [[ROM image]], translates all the game's text into [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku: completed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: finished"/&gt; Reid Young, co-founder of Starmen.net, stated that when they realized Nintendo was not going to localize ''Mother 3'', they decided to undertake the task, for themselves and for fans of the game.&lt;ref name="UGO: interview"/&gt; The translation team consisted of around a dozen individuals, including project lead Clyde "Tomato" Mandelin, a professional Japanese-to-English translator. The project took two years and thousands of [[man-hour|work-hours]] to complete; it was estimated that the theoretical freelance cost of the translation was $30,000.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: epic"/&gt;

The project included translating, writing, and revising about 1,000 pages of the game script in addition to extensive [[ROM hacking]] and testing to ensure that the game properly and correctly displays the translated text. The translation included minor deviations from the original, such as localization of place-names and puns. Few dramatic changes were made, but some characters and locations were renamed. For example, the character "Yokuba", loosely derived from {{nihongo||欲望|yokubō|extra="greed"}}, was renamed "Fassad", loosely derived from the French word ''[[facade|façade]]'' and, incidentally, the Arabic word ''fasād'' (فساد, "corruption"). The ROM hacking entailed [[Assembly language|assembly]]-level changes to the game code to support features such as [[Typeface#Proportion|variable width font]]s.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: epic"/&gt;

The team reported that "the highest levels" of Nintendo of America knew about their project, though they did not intervene.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: epic"/&gt; The localization team planned to end the project if Nintendo were to make an announcement about the future of the game.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: epic"/&gt; They acknowledged that the legality of the localization was unclear&lt;ref name="UGO: interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamasutra: Tomato p2"/&gt; since the final translation required use of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku: completed"/&gt; The localization patch was downloaded over 100,000 times in the first week following its release.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra: Tomato p1"/&gt; Along with the translation, the team announced the ''Mother 3 Handbook'', an English player's guide for the game that had been in development since June 2008.&lt;ref name="UGO: interview"/&gt; ''Wired'' reported the full-color, 200-page player's guide to be akin to a professional strategy guide, with quality "on par with ... [[Prima Games]] and [[BradyGames]]".&lt;ref name="Wired: gorgeous"/&gt; ''[[The Verge]]'' cited the two-year fan translation of ''Mother 3'' as proof of the fan base's dedication,&lt;ref name="The Verge: today"/&gt; and Jenni Lada of ''TechnologyTell'' called it "undoubtably one of the best known fan translations in existence", with active retranslations into other languages.&lt;ref name="TT translation"/&gt;

''Mother 3'' sold around 200,000 copies in its first week of sales in Japan.&lt;ref name="IGN: no more"/&gt; It was one of Japan's top 20 bestselling games for the first half of 2006,&lt;ref name="1UP: Vapor"/&gt; and received a "Platinum Hall of Fame" score of 35/40 from Japanese reviewer ''[[Weekly Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref name=Famitsu/&gt; It ended the year with over 368,000 copies sold, the 36th highest of the year in Japan.&lt;ref name="EBsales"/&gt; Jenni Lada of ''TechnologyTell'' called it the "perfect" Game Boy Advance role-playing game.&lt;ref name="TT review"/&gt; Reviewers praised its story (even though the game was only available in Japanese&lt;ref name="NGC review"/&gt;) and graphics, and lamented its 1990s role-playing game mechanics.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Famitsu/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGC review"/&gt; Critics also complimented its music.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpy preview p2"/&gt;

''Famitsu''{{'s}} reviewers noted the level of detail from the game's direction, accessibility and wit of the story, unconventional art style, and conventional game mechanics. They considered the timed battles to be both useful and difficult.&lt;ref name=Famitsu/&gt; ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} Simon Parkin detailed the 12-year development, the series' legacy as both "one of Japan's most beloved" and the video game cognoscenti's "[[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]]", and the endurance of its [[EarthBound fandom|fan community]].&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt; He was impressed by the quality of the fan translation, and described Itoi as a "storyteller" who chose the Japanese role-playing game medium to tell his story.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt; Parkin noted how the "excellent" script unfurled from a "straightforward tale" into "breadth and depth of quality that few titles many times its budget achieve" with "affecting scenes" and "unexpected impact".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt; He compared the chapter approach with the method of ''[[Dragon Quest IV]]''.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt; Parkin wrote that the script allowed for the somewhat "heavy-handed" juxtaposition of "nature and technology, [[feudalism]] and [[capitalism]], individuals and community",&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt; and that what he first considers a name customization "trick" becomes useful later in the game.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt; ''[[NGC Magazine]]''{{'s}} Mark Green wrote that the game felt like ''Mother 2.5'' in its look and feel, which he did not consider negative, albeit somewhat antiquated.&lt;ref name="NGC review"/&gt; Lada of ''TechnologyTell'' said ''Mother 3'' was surprisingly "darker" than its forebears.&lt;ref name="TT review"/&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=Few pregnancies have been as painful and protracted as ''Mother 3''{{'s}}. |source=Simon Parkin of ''Eurogamer'', ''Mother 3'' review, 2008&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt; |width=30em |quoted=1}}

''Eurogamer''{{'s}} Parkin wrote that the "childlike" and "unusually Western" graphics were similar to ''EarthBound''{{'s}} in "flat pastel textures devoid of shading" as juxtaposed with background art that "fizzes with life and character".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p1"/&gt; He described the cutscenes' animations as "[[bespoke]]", rare for [[16-bit]] role-playing games, and of greater dramatic impact.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt; ''RPGamer''{{'s}} Jordan Jackson wrote that the visuals are typical of the series and fit the game's mood,&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt; and the website's Mike Moehnke criticized the inventory limits carried over from the previous game.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt; Green of ''NGC'' said the game mechanics were "depressingly basic" against more advanced role-playing games.&lt;ref name="NGC review"/&gt; ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} Parkin felt that the role-playing game elements were less interesting and added that ''Mother 3'' had few standout selling points other than its attention to detail and "only systemic innovation": the rhythm-based battle system.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt; ''Kotaku''{{'s}} Richard Eisenbeis praised the system,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: hype"/&gt; and ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'s}} Greg Kasavin compared it with that of the [[Mario &amp; Luigi (series)|''Mario &amp; Luigi'' series]].&lt;ref name="GameSpot: import"/&gt; Jackson wrote that the music was "just as catchy as previous games" despite being "almost completely new".&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt; Moehnke agreed, calling it "nothing less than stunning".&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt; He noted overtones of [[Wagner]] and [[Chuck Berry]].&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt; Jackson said that the game was somewhat easier than the rest of the series and somewhat shorter, at about 30 hours in length.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt; Both ''RPGamer'' reviewers noted that ''Mother 3'' has few penalties for death.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt; Jackson reflected that while the game is humorous and grows in enjoyment, it has some somber moments as well.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Jackson review"/&gt; Eisenbeis of ''Kotaku'' cited "the importance of mothers" as a key theme about which the game revolves, which he preferred to the mid-game "slapstick insanity" and final [[plot twist]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku: hype"/&gt; Parkin wrote that the game was filled with "memorable moments", including a character who criticizes the player "for not giggling at puns", frogs with progressively silly costumes that [[gamesave|save the game]], a "reconstructed [[mecha]] [[caribou]]" battle, a bad haiku, and the "[[campfire]] scene", and that while the game's simpleness could have lent towards "raw stupidity", instead it was "elegant in its simplicity".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: M3 review p2"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Multiple critics wrote that ''Mother 3'' was one of the best role-playing games for the Game Boy Advance.&lt;ref name="RPGamer: Moehnke review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TT review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamePro: Why"/&gt; ''GamePro''{{'s}} Jeremy Signor listed it among his "best unreleased Japanese role-playing games" for its script and attention to detail.&lt;ref name="GamePro: unreleased"/&gt; [[Tim Rogers (journalist)|Tim Rogers]] posited that ''Mother 3'' was "the closest games have yet come to literature."&lt;ref name="Action Button"/&gt;

Nintendo is often criticized for ''Mother 3''{{'s}} lack of an international release. [[IGN]] referred to the ''Mother'' series as "neglected" in regards to ''EarthBound'' being the only game to be released outside Japan&lt;ref name="IGN: Retro Remix"/&gt; across the decades until 2015. Bob Mackey of ''[[1UP.com]]'' wrote of ''Mother 3'' that "no other game in the history of time garnered such a rabid demand for translation,"&lt;ref name="1UP: noble art p1"/&gt; and Chris Plante of ''[[UGO Networks]]'' wrote that the lack of an official ''Mother 3'' English localization was one of 2008's "worst heartbreaks".&lt;ref name="UGO: heartbreaks"/&gt; Frank Caron of ''Ars Technica'' said that the fan translation's "massive undertaking ... stands as a massive success" and that "one cannot even begin to fathom why Nintendo wouldn't see fit to release the game in the West."&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: finished"/&gt;

Although acclaimed, ''Mother'' series writer Shigesato Itoi has stated that he does not have any plans to create a fourth installment in the series.&lt;ref name="IGN: no more"/&gt;

The [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]] features the characters Ness and Lucas as playable fighters, as well as minor characters as collectibles, items, or stage hazards.&lt;ref name="NWR: Lucas added"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: Brawl FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Lucas DLC"/&gt;

'''''Owlboy''''' is a [[platform-adventure]]&lt;ref name="outyet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5977536/damn-it-owlboy-why-arent-you-out-yet|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|title=Damn It, ''Owlboy'', Why Aren't You Out Yet|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; video game created by the Norwegian independent developer; D-Pad Studio. The game is notable for its long development cycle, which began in 2007, and was released in November 2016.

== Gameplay ==
The player controls Otus, who is capable of flying and carrying objects during flight. These objects vary in use as ranged weapons, thrown weapons, and puzzle-solving tools. As the game progresses, Otus gains allies that accompany him during his journey, each having their own weapon with exclusive properties.

==Plot==
''Owlboy'' is set in the land of the sky; the islands of the world below have been separated by a catastrophic event. The player controls a boy named Otus, who is a member of an [[owl]]–humanoid race called the Owls. When Otus' village is attacked by a band of pirates, he sets out on a journey to save it from them, and uncovers the lost truth of the Owls.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://owlboygame.com/|publisher=OwlboyGame.com|accessdate=October 20, 2014|title=Welcome to a world in the sky!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The inspiration for ''Owlboy'' came from several sources, most involving Andersen's penchant for [[Nintendo]] games. The basic mechanics were inspired by the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' Tanooki Suit, although with reverse mechanics.&lt;ref name="Owlboyvice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klepek|first1=Patrick|title=The Exhausting Ten-Year Journey to Release 'Owlboy'|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/inside-the-exhausting-10-year-journey-to-release-owlboy|website=Vice|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Andersen also became interested in rumors of a new game in the [[Kid Icarus (series)|''Kid Icarus'' series]] wondering how the flying mechanics of those games would translate to 3D, made Andersen realize that he felt a 2D design for his game would work better.&lt;ref name="Owlboyvice"/&gt; Finally, Andersen was inspired by the then-upcoming [[Wii]] and felt that it provided a great opportunity to create an old-school game.&lt;ref name="Owlboyvice"/&gt;

Beginning development in 2007,&lt;ref name="Begin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donnelly|first1=Joe|title=Owlboy release date set after nine years in development|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/owlboy-release-date-set-after-nine-years-in-development/|accessdate=September 1, 2016|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the game spent the better part of a decade in development. The team worried about the expectation of fans and thus started over several times. Andersen also had to deal with suffering from [[Clinical Depression|depression]], which he had since childhood.&lt;ref name="Owlboyvice"/&gt; ''Owlboy'' was released primarily for [[Microsoft Windows]]-based personal computers, but D-Pad also considered a release for home [[video game console|consoles]].&lt;ref name="vg247 2013"/&gt; A Nintendo Switch version was released in February 2018, with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions being delayed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2017/11/01/owlboy-coming-to-switch-xbox-one-ps4-next-year|title=Owlboy Coming to Switch, Xbox One, PS4 Next Year|work=IGN|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was shown off at [[PAX (event)|PAX 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/07/30/pax-prime-indie-showcase-titles-include-towerfall-owlboy/|publisher=VG247|title=PAX Prime indie showcase titles include Towerfall, Owlboy|date=July 30, 2013|last=Hillier|first=Brenna|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[PAX (event)|PAX 2016]], it was announced that the game would be released on November 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donnelly|first1=Joe|title=Owlboy release date finally confirmed after nine years in development|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/owlboy-release-date-finally-confirmed-after-nine-years-in-development/|accessdate=September 8, 2016|work=PC Gamer|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/24/12633750/owlboy-release-date-new-trailer-steam|title=After eight years, beautiful platformer Owlboy looks like it’s finally coming out|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 24, 2016|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-release ===
''Owlboy'' received positive commentary from gaming publications. [[Kotaku]]'s Luke Plunkett stated in 2013 that it would be "worth the wait" of its extensive development time. Regarding the art style, he mentioned, "..and the game's charming art style, which for want of something more descriptive reminds me of a [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] version of ''[[Wind Waker]]''.".&lt;ref name="outyet"/&gt; Dave Cook of [[VG247]] described the game as "a rather neat-looking 2D pixel art platformer".&lt;ref name="vg247 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Dave|title=Owlboy: PC version releasing in 2013, console port being considered|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/01/09/owlboy-pc-version-releasing-in-2013-console-port-being-considered/|accessdate=October 20, 2014|work=[[VG247]]|date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Grayson of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] ''lamented the fact that by 2013 the game still did not yet have a release date as "''the'' bad news – the news by which all upsetting and otherwise unfortunate events are judged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|title=ELEVATEWAR: Owlboy Dev’s Elevator Brawler Savant|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/07/10/elevatewar-owlboy-devs-elevator-brawler-savant/#more-159783|accessdate=October 20, 2014|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website [[Kill Screen]] would go on to compare the game's long development cycle to that of [[Fez (video game)|Fez]], another indie game with a similarly long gestation period, writing describing both games as "retro-sentimental platformers by independent studios that promised a lot, but seemed fated to never come out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Priestman|first=Chris|title=NEARLY 10 YEARS IN THE MAKING, THERE’S STILL PLENTY OF REASON TO CARE ABOUT OWLBOY|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/owlboy/|accessdate=November 2, 2016|website=Kill Screen|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-release ===
On release, ''Owlboy'' was met with widespread critical acclaim and an aggregate score of 88/100 on [[Metacritic]] as of January 18, 2017.&lt;ref name=Metacritic/&gt; IGN's Chloi Rad gave the game 9.3/10 and writes that the game "shines thanks to surprisingly varied, Metroidvania-style gameplay and a charming cast of unlikely heroes".&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; The game has sold 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Madsen|first=Jo-Remi|title=Indies On Tour - How we escaped the office, and discovered the world|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JoRemiMadsen/20170407/295591/Indies_On_Tour__How_we_escaped_the_office_and_discovered_the_world.php|accessdate=April 10, 2017|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]|date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peasant movement''' is a [[social movement]] involved with the [[agricultural policy]].

Peasants movement have a long history that can be traced to the numerous [[peasant uprising]]s that occurred in various regions of the world throughout human history. Early peasant movements were usually the result of stresses in the [[feudal]] and semi feudal societies, and resulted in violent uprisings. More recent movements, fitting the definitions of social movements, are usually much less violent, and their demands are centered on better prices for agricultural produce, better wages and working conditions for the agricultural laborers, and increasing the agricultural production.

The economic policies of British adversely affected the Indian peasants the British Govt. used to protect the landlords and money lenders.they exploited the peasants.The peasants rose in revolt against this injustice on many occasions .The peasants in Bengal formed their union and revolted
against the compulsion of cultivating indigo.

Anthony Pereira, a political scientist, has defined a peasant movement as a "social movement made up of peasants (small landholders or farm workers on large farms), usually inspired by the goal of improving the situation of peasants in a nation or territory".&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, Anthony W 1997. ''The End of the Peasantry.'' Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant movements by country or region==

===India===
Peasant movement in India arose during the [[British Empire|British colonial period]], when economic policies characterized  in the ruin of traditional handicrafts leading, change of ownership and overcrowding of land, and massive debt and impoverishment of peasantry. This led to peasant uprisings during the colonial period, and development of peasant movements in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref name=socioguide&gt;[http://www.sociologyguide.com/social-change/social-movements-type.php Social movements types] at Sociology Guide&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kisan Sabha movement started in [[Bihar]] under the leadership of [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] who had formed in 1929 the [[Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha]] (BPKS) in order to mobilise peasant grievances against the zamindari attacks on their occupancy rights.&lt;ref&gt;
   In 1938,the crops in Eastern Khandesh were destroyed due to heavy rains.The peasants were ruined.In order to get the land revenue waived,Sane Guruji organized meetings and processions in many places and took out marches to the Collector's office.The peasants joined the revolutionary movement of 1942 in great numbers.

All these radical developments on the peasant front culminated in the formation of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] (AIKS) at the [[Lucknow]] session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in April 1936 with [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] elected as its first President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">'''[[Philosophy]] of music''' is the study of "...fundamental questions about the nature of [[music]] and our experience of it".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Andrew Kania, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/music/ The Philosophy of Music]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edition, edited by Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]]. 
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What is the relationship between music and language?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions? (in the 19th century there was a debate over whether instrumental music could convey emotion)
* What is meaning in relation to music?

==Philosophical issues==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}

===Definition of music===
{{main article|Definition of music}}
"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound. They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There are many different ways of denoting the fundamental [[Aspect of music|aspects of music]] which are more specific than "sound": popular aspects include [[melody]] ([[pitch (music)|pitches]] that occur consecutively), [[harmony]] (pitches regarded as groups—not necessarily sounding at the same time—to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s), [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[timbre]] (also known as a sound's "color"). However, [[noise music]] may consist mainly of noise. [[Musique concrète]] often consists only of sound samples of non-musical nature, sometimes in random juxtaposition. [[Ambient music]] may consist of recordings of wildlife or nature. The arrival of these avant-garde forms of music in the 20th century have been a major challenge to traditional views of music as being based around melodies and rhythms, leading to broader characterizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Absolute music vs program music===
{{main article|Absolute music|Program music}}
There was intense debate over absolute music versus program music during the late Romantic Era. Advocates of the "[[absolute music]]" perspective argued that instrumental music does not convey emotions or images to the listener. They claimed that music is not explicitly "about" anything and that it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the "[[program music]]" perspective believed that music could convey emotions and images. One example of program music is [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone." Nietzsche wrote many commentaries applauding the music of Wagner and was in fact an amateur composer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |title=Nietzsche and Music |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140220/http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Romantic philosophers and proponents of absolute music, such as [[Johann von Goethe]] saw music not only as a subjective human "language" but as an absolute transcendent means of peering into a higher realm of order and beauty. Some expressed a spiritual connection with music. In Part IV of his chief work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] said that "music is the answer to the mystery of life. The most profound of all the arts, it expresses the deepest thoughts of life." In "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic", a chapter of ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] examines the profundity of music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and the sensual nature of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

===Meaning and purpose===
In his 1997 book ''How the Mind Works'', [[Steven Pinker]] dubbed music "auditory cheesecake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How The Mind Works|date=1997|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, London|isbn=0393045358|page=524|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&amp;lpg=PA534|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that in the years since has served as a challenge to the musicologists and psychologists who believe otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/survival_of_the_harmonious/?page=1|publisher=The Boston Globe|title=Survival of the harmonious|accessdate=2008-03-15|last= Bennett |first=Drake|  date=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those to note this stir was [[Philip Ball]] in his book ''The Music Instinct'' &lt;ref name="The Music Instinct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=The Music Instinct|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199896429|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Music-Instinct-Works-Without/dp/0199896429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where he noted that music seems to reach to the very core of what it means to be human:  "There are cultures in the world where to say 'I'm not musical' would be meaningless," Ball writes, "akin to saying 'I'm not alive'." In a filmed debate, Ball suggests that music might get its emotive power through its ability to mimic people and perhaps its ability to entice us lies in music's ability to set up an expectation and then violate it.&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery"&gt;{{cite web|last=How The Light Gets In|first=2013|title=Music's Mystery|url=http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery|publisher=The Institute of Art and Ideas|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics of music===
{{main article|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[symphony orchestra]] is not only the main large ensemble used in [[classical music]]; one work for orchestra, [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] has been called the supreme masterpiece of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook, Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press (24 June 1993). {{ISBN|9780521399241}}. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;!-- This is a remarkably sweeping claim, presented without citation. --&gt; Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also, many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a [[musical tuning|system of tuning]] called [[just intonation]].

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

It is often thought &lt;!-- By whom? --&gt;that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in the ''Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

'''Signalong''' is an alternative and augmentative key-word signing communication method used by those individuals with a speech, language and communication need. The Signalong methodology has been effectively used with individuals who have [[Cognitive deficit|cognitive impairments]], [[autism]],  [[Down syndrome|Down’s Syndrome]], [[specific language impairment]], [[Deafblindness|multisensory impairment]] and acquired [[neurological disorders]] that have negatively affected the ability to communicate, including stroke patients and English as an additional language.

The name "Signalong" is derived from the understanding that wherever possible the sign is accompanied with speech, hence you "sign along with speech". The programme was devised in 1991 by Gill Kennard, a language teacher, Linda Hall, a science teacher who produced the illustrations and Thelma Grove,  a speech and language therapist from the Royal College of Speech &amp; Language Therapists.

Signalong is a registered trade mark of The Signalong Group, a charity established in 1994. The original trademark application for Signalong was filed in the UK on 30 April 2001, with registration approved as from that date under UK trademark registration no. 2268715.

== Programme ==
Signalong uses a total communication approach to teach [[language]] and [[literacy]] skills, through a combination of speech, [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and descriptions at the appropriate level for the child or adult’s needs. Because of its unique methodology of handshape, orientation, placement and movement, idiosyncratic signs can be de-coded and translated to a format that is consistent and transferrable.

Signalong consists of a Core Vocabulary of approximately 1726 concepts but is not taught in a specific order. Vocabulary should be introduced when required and where possible, with real objects and in real situations to help re-enforce the link between the sign and spoken word.

Although Signalong is a key word signing system, once initial communication has been established, the learner can develop their language to 2, 3 or 4 word level as appropriate. In addition to the Core Vocabulary, there is an additional 7,000 concepts.

== Development ==
In 1983 Kent County Council was adopting the Derbyshire Language Scheme (DLS), a flexible framework following typical language development that is used to help children develop their language skills. The DLS vocabulary is based on research into the type of objects and activities experienced by children as they develop. In 1991 due to the lack of vocabulary available from existing signing systems, Gill and Thelma developed vocabulary on the single-word level of the DLS and on the vocabulary that had been requested by parents and carers at Abbey Court School.

It has remained one of Signalong’s most dearly held principles that the vocabulary should be led by the needs of the user of the resource and not dictated by others.

The first “pilot” copies of Phase 1 were published in April 1992 and as word of Signalong’s existence spread the team came under heavy pressure to produce signs for sex education. Although they were already working on Phase 2, this was set aside and, in June 1993, “Personal and Social Education” was the next manual to be published. This brought Signalong to the attention of a much wider user group, the vocabulary being seen as particularly relevant to older learners and adults and in 1994 achieved charitable status. Signalong have over 70 different publications to date.

Signalong resources are designed to be self-explanatory and accessible, however by popular demand, the first Signalong training in sign-supported communication was made available in May 1992 and subsequent Tutor training in 1995.

== Use ==
Signalong is based on [[British Sign Language]] adapted for the needs and abilities of children and adults with verbal communication difficulties. It uses one sign per concept, one concept per sign. Signalong is a sign–supporting system used in spoken word order and uses a total communication approach to reference links between sign and word. It also uses key-words i.e. the essential word in any sentence, and uses signs at partner’s level and moderate language to ensure that the message is understood. It is best to start with real objects and real experiences, generalise concepts before moving on to more abstract representations. Vocabulary is needs led and feedback from users helps Signalong to decide on vocabulary research.

When the sign has been selected, a description is worked out. This follows a consistent method of four elements; handshape - how the hands are formed; orientation - how the hands are held; placement - where the hands are held and movement - any changes in the first three elements.

Signalong is used extensively throughout the UK, but has also been adapted for use in countries including France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Germany and Romania.

== Training and Resources ==
* Delivers training to over 7,000 parents, carers and professionals per year
* Develops and produces a wide range of resources (books, DVDs and online resources)
* Provides a free family advisory service for information, advice and support for parents, family members and professionals working with children
* Provides a free sign lookup service: Text SIGN and the word to look up to +447446462146 (only works from UK mobiles).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">A '''simple non-inferential passage''' is a type of [[nonargument]] characterized by the lack of a claim that anything is being proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 10th ed. | publisher=Thompson Wadsworth | author=Hurley, Patrick J. | year=2008 | pages=16 | isbn=0-495-50383-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple non-inferential passages include warnings, pieces of advice, statements of belief or opinion, [[loosely associated statements]], and reports.  Simple non-inferential passages are nonarguments because while the statements involved may be premises, conclusions or both, the statements do not serve to infer a conclusion or support one another.  This is distinct from a [[Informal fallacy|logical fallacy]], which indicates an error in reasoning.  

== Types ==

=== Warnings ===
A warning is a type of simple non-inferential passage that serves to alert a person to any sort of potential danger.  This can be as simple as a road sign indicating falling rock or a janitorial sign indicating a wet, slippery floor.

=== Piece of advice ===
A piece of advice is a type of simple non-inferential passage that recommends some future action or course of conduct.  A mechanic recommending regular oil changes or a doctor recommending that a patient refrain from smoking are examples of pieces of advice.

=== Statements of belief or opinion ===
{{main|Opinion}}

A statement of belief or opinion is a type of simple non-inferential passage containing an expression of belief or opinion lacking an inferential claim.  In ''A concise introduction to logic'', Hurley uses the following example to illustrate:
 
{{quote|We believe that our company must develop and produce outstanding products that will perform a great service or fulfill a need for our customers.  We believe that our business must be run at an adequate profit and that the services and products we offer must be better than those offered by competitors|A concise introduction to logic, 10th edition}}

=== Loosely associated statements ===
{{main|Loosely associated statements}}

A loosely associated statement is a type of simple non-inferential passage wherein statements about a general subject are juxtaposed but make no inferential claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 10th ed. | publisher=Thompson Wadsworth | author=Hurley, Patrick J. | year=2008 | pages=17 | isbn=0-495-50383-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[rhetorical device]], loosely associated statements may be intended by the speaker to infer a claim or conclusion, but because they lack a coherent logical structure any such interpretation is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] as loosely associated statements prove nothing and attempt no obvious conclusion.&lt;ref name="Logicofarguments"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.julianhermida.com/algoma/law1studyarguments.htm | title=The logic of arguments | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Loosely associated statements can be said to serve no obvious purpose, such as illustration or explanation.&lt;ref name="NONargument"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/polen/LC9_Help/1/12loosely.htm | title=NONargument - Loosely associated statements | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reports ===
A report is a type of simple non-inferential passage wherein the statements serve to convey knowledge.  
{{quote|Even though more of the world is immunized than ever before, many old diseases have proven quote resilient in the face of changing population and environmental conditions, especially in the developing world.  New diseases, such as AIDS, have taken their toll in both the North and the South|Steven L. Spiedel| World politics in a new era}}
The above is considered a report because it informs the reader without making any sort of claim, ethical or otherwise.  However, the statements being made could be seen as a set of premises, and with the addition of a conclusion it would be considered an argument.

'''Stephen H. Webb''' (March 13, 1961 – March 5, 2016)&lt;ref name=death1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/indystar/obituary.aspx?n=stephen-howe-webb&amp;pid=177969609 |title=Stephen Howe Webb |date=March 9, 2016 |publisher=The Indianapolis Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=death2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wabash.edu/news/displaystory.cfm?news_ID=10773 |title=Wabash Mourns Stephen Webb ’83 |publisher=Wabash College |date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[theologian]] and [[philosopher of religion]].

Webb graduated from [[Wabash College]] in 1983, earned his Ph.D. at the [[University of Chicago]], and taught at [[Wabash College]] as Professor of Religion and Philosophy from 1988 to 2012. (He was on leave from Wabash College during 2012-13, and retired early to pursue writing opportunities full-time.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Kellner, "Scholar Delves Into Mormon Lessons for Christians," ''The Washington Times'', Sept. 12, 2013; http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/12/kellner-scholar-delves-into-mormon-lessons-for-chr/?page=all&lt;/ref&gt;) Born in 1961 and reared in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], he grew up at Englewood Christian Church, an evangelical church in the [[Restoration Movement]]. He recounts his experiences there in ''Taking Religion to School'' (Brazos Press, 2000) and in an essay, "Recalling: A Theologian Remembers His Church," in ''Falling Toward Grace: Images of Religion and Culture from the Heartland'', ed. Kent Calder and Susan Neville (Indiana University Press, 1998). He joined the [[Disciples of Christ]] during graduate school but soon became disenchanted with their theological direction. He was briefly a [[Lutheran]], and on Easter Sunday, 2007, he officially came into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Webb, "Silence, Noise, and the Voice of Jesus Christ," in Aaron Perry, ed., ''Developing Ears to Hear: Listening in Pastoral Ministry'' (Lexington, KY: Emeth Press, 2011), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on vegetarianism and animal rights==

He was known for his scholarship and journalism on animals, vegetarianism, and diet.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Bekoff, ''Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare'' (Greenwood, 2010), pp. 449-454.&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded the [[Christian Vegetarian Association]], but was removed from his position as co-chairman in 2006 after writing several articles in which he admitted to eating meat occasionally, while promoting vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;In "Revenge of the Ebionites," a book review of ''Holy Cow!: Does God Care About What We Eat?'' by [[Hope Egan]], Webb confesses his recent "semi-vegetarianism" (as a result, he was asked to step down as co-chairman at the request of the [[Christian Vegetarian Association]]. See http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2005/006/13.14.html Christianity Today/Books and Culture article, accessed Jan 31, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  He defended the value of animals by reaffirming traditional notions of human uniqueness and human responsibility for nature. Many animal rights arguments are influenced by a leveling of the differences between humans and animals as well as a leveling of the differences between God and the world.  This vision of a non-dogmatic and non-legalistic vegetarianism linked to traditional biblical principles rather than the [[pantheism]] of the New Age movement or the abdication of human uniqueness entailed in animal rights legislation has been controversial in both theological and philosophical circles.&lt;ref&gt;For an interview with about his criticisms of the liberal version of animal rights, see Mark Oppenheimer, "Churches Take Steps to Show Their Love for Animals," New York Times Oct. 14, 2011, available at https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/us/pet-ministries-are-growing-in-churches.html, access Jan. 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of his work, see his essays, "Theology from the Pet Side Up: A Christian Agenda for NOT Saving the World" and "Against the Gourmands: In Praise of Fast Food as a Form of Fasting," both published in the online journal ''The Other Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;http://theotherjournal.com/2011/08/02/against-the-gourmands-in-praise-of-fast-food-as-a-form-of-fasting/, accessed Jan. 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb's critique of what he calls the "animal eliminationist" wing of the animal rights movement was presented at the 2008 American Academy of Religion conference in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2008/11/02/a-compassionate-carnivore-takes-a-bite-out-of-the-animal-rights-movement/ A compassionate carnivore takes a bite out of the animal rights movement | Ottawa Citizen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] This was published as “The Chicken and the Bath Water: Exploring a Basic Limit to the Vegetarian Ideal,” in The Expository Times 123.12 (Sept. 2012), pp. 573-580.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books have extensively analyzed and criticized his position, including Laura Hobgood-Oster, ''Holy Dogs and Asses'' (University of Illinois Press, 2008) and Stephen M. Vantassel, ''Dominion over Wildlife?'' (Resource Publications, 2009). ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'', ed. John Bowden (Oxford University Press, 2005) lists him as one of the leaders of the animal theology movement (p.&amp;nbsp;52).

==Political views==

Later in his career, Webb turned his attention to politics, culture, popular culture, and liberal advocacy.  Within this field, Webb generated positive and negative reviews with his book ''American Providence'' (Continuum, 2004) in which he defended the idea that the doctrine of [[Divine Providence|providence]] has been a crucial ingredient in American history and American identity. Providential interpretations of American national aspirations went into decline after the [[Vietnam War]], but with [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]'s openness regarding the role of faith in his presidency, providence has returned to the public square. Webb argued that even [[anti-Americanism]] is dependent upon providential logic, because conspiracy theories about how evil America is grant America a special role in world history. He also argued that the future belongs to the triad of [[capitalism]], [[democracy]], and various forms of [[evangelical Christianity]], not limited to explicitly evangelical churches. One of his controversial essays on politics is “On the True Globalism and the False, or Why Christians Should Not Worry So Much about American Imperialism,” in ''Anxious About Empire: Theological Essays on the New Global Realities'', ed. Wes Avram (Grand Rapids: Brazos Press, 2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;119–128. William T. Cavanaugh has criticized Webb's connection of providence and politics.&lt;ref&gt;''University of St. Thomas Law Journal'' (Fall 2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;261–280, [http://www.jesusradicals.com/wp-content/uploads/messianic-nation.pdf  "Messianic Nation,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601002901/http://www.jesusradicals.com/wp-content/uploads/messianic-nation.pdf |date=2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books on theology and sound==

Webb is also known for his work in what he called theo-acoustics, or a theology of sound. He wrote a comprehensive history of Christianity and sound in ''The Divine Voice: Christian Proclamation and the Theology of Sound'' (Brazos Press, 2004). This book, which was named the Religious Communication Association's Book of the Year for 2005 and a Christianity Today Top Ten Book of 2004, is divided into three parts. The first part surveys the biblical tradition on the importance of the human voice as a medium of revelation in the Bible. The second part focuses on the Protestant Reformation as the revival of that tradition. The third part discusses the transformations of that tradition in contemporary culture, which is increasingly oriented toward the visual over the auditory. He also discusses the role of deafness in Christian history and various theological debates over the question of how God created the world through sound. In this discussion he reveals his battle with hearing loss and how that has affected his theological work. He ends that book talking about wordless music and the decline of authentic vocalization in rock and roll, so it was a natural progression to turn to Bob Dylan in his next book, ''Dylan Redeemed: From Highway 61 to Saved'' (Continuum, 2006). This book, which has been written about in many Dylan blogs, is a reassessment of [[Bob Dylan]]'s musical career that focuses on Dylan's mid-life conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Webb advances these views about Dylan and sound in the essay, "Twenty Musings on Bob Dylan and the Future of Sound," in Nick Smart and Nina Goss, eds., ''Dylan at Play'' (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011),&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books on literature==

Webb wrote about C. S. Lewis in ''The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy'' (ed. by Jerry Walls, Open Court Publishing, 2005), Indiana small town basketball in ''Basketball and Philosophy'' (University of Kentucky Press, 2007), and eschatology and politics in ''The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology'' (Oxford University Press, 2008). He also wrote the commendation for John Updike for the Presentation of the Christianity and Literature Lifetime Achievement Award at the Modern Languages Association Meeting in December, 2006. His remarks, and Updike's generous response, appear in ''Christianity and Literature'', vol. 56, No. 3 (Spring 2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;481–485, and Updike's response was subsequently published as the last essay in Updike's ''Higher Gossip'' (Knopf, 2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;479–481. Webb was also a frequent blogger and contributor to ''First Things'' and ''Books &amp; Culture''.

==Lectures==

He delivered invited lectures at Aberdeen University, Calvin College, Wheaton College, Bangor Seminary, Maine, Virginia Theological Seminary, Arizona State University, Pepperdine University, Butler University, Brigham Young University, Hartford Seminary, Creighton University, Wilfrid Laurier University, Hope College, Kalamazoo College, Purdue University, Elmhurst College, and Loyola University in Baltimore. He gave the Truman Madsen Lecture at Brigham Young University in 2012, the first Inaugural "Animals and the Kingdom" lecture at Calvin College in 2008, the Kretzmann Lecture at Valparaiso University in 2008, and the Womack Lecture at Methodist University in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wabash.edu/academics/profiles/home.cfm?site_folder=religion&amp;facname=webbs, accessed Jan. 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other books==

He also wrote many essays on the intersection of rhetoric and religion, including "Reviving the Rhetorical Heritage of Protestant Theology," in ''A Companion to Rhetoric and Rhetorical Criticism'', ed. Walter Jost and Wendy Olmsted (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2004): 409-24, and "Theological Reflections on the Hyperbolic Imagination," in ''Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry'', ed. Walter Jost and Wendy Olmstead (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000). ''The SAGE Handbook of Rhetorical Studies'', ed. Andrea Lunsford (2008) lists him as a leader in the field of religious rhetoric (see p.&amp;nbsp;555).

Webb wrote a book critical of Darwinism, ''The Dome of Eden: A New Solution to the Problem of Creation and Evolution'' (Cascades, 2010). His book ''Jesus Christ, Eternal God: Heavenly Flesh and the Metaphysics of Matter'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), engages with Mormon theology in order to develop a revisionist account of Chalcedonian christology that seeks to redeem and appropriate monophysitism for modern theology.&lt;ref&gt;For a review by B. Hodges, see http://bycommonconsent.com/2012/01/23/review-stephen-h-webb-jesus-christ-eternal-god/, accessed Jan 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His essay in defense of Mormonism as a legitimate form of Christianity, "Mormonism Obsessed with Christ," appeared in ''First Things'' (Feb. 2012) and was the topic of much discussion,&lt;ref&gt;The article can be found in the online edition of ''First Things'' at {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2012/01/mormonism-obsessed-with-christ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121070241/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2012/01/mormonism-obsessed-with-christ |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}, accessed Jan. 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; including an opinion piece published in the ''Salt Lake Tribune'' co-authored by Mormon philosopher [[David L.

'''Synthetic biology''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[biology]] and engineering.

The subject combines disciplines from within these domains, such as [[biotechnology]], [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular engineering]], [[systems biology]], [[Model lipid bilayer|membrane science,]] [[biophysics]], [[biological engineering|chemical and biological engineering]], [[electrical engineering|electrical and computer engineering]], [[control engineering]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Synthetic biology applies these disciplines to build artificial biological systems for research, engineering and medical applications.

== Definition ==
Synthetic biology is seen differently by biologists and engineers. Originally seen as part of biology, in recent years the role of electrical and chemical engineering has become more important. For example, one description designates synthetic biology as "an emerging discipline that uses engineering principles to design and assemble biological components".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/defdeny.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D4472901&amp;denyReason=-134&amp;arnumber=4472901&amp;productsMatched=null&amp;userType=mem IEEE Xplore Abstract - Intellectual Property and the Commons in Synthetic Biology: Strategies to Facilitate an Emerging Tec...]&lt;/ref&gt; Another portrayed it as "a new emerging scientific field where ICT, biotechnology and nanotechnology meet and strengthen each other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Rathenau%20Constructing%20Life%202006.pdf W97 binnenwerk-8 - Rathenau Constructing Life 2006.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of synthetic biology is also debated in the [[human sciences]], [[arts]] and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.marsilius-kolleg.uni-heidelberg.de/marsilius-academy/index.html|title = Synthetic biology: promises and perils of modern biotechnology|access-date = 2014-09-11|website = Marsilius Academy Heidelberg – Summer school|publisher = Heidelberg University}}&lt;/ref&gt; One popular definition:&lt;ref name="NakanoEckford2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nakano|first1=Tadashi|last2=Eckford|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Haraguchi|first3=Tokuko|title=Molecular Communication|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uVhsAAAAQBAJ}}|date=12 September 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02308-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional aspects of this definition are rooted in molecular biology and biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayden EC | title = Synthetic-biology firms shift focus | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7485 | pages = 598 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24476868 | doi = 10.1038/505598a | bibcode = 2014Natur.505..598C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
As usage of the term has expanded, synthetic biology was recently defined as the artificial design and engineering of biological systems and living organisms for purposes of improving applications for industry or biological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osbourn AE, O'Maille PE, Rosser SJ, Lindsey K | title = Synthetic biology. 4th New Phytologist Workshop, Bristol, UK, June 2012 | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 196 | issue = 3 | pages = 671–7 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23043589 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04374.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard visual symbols.png|thumb|300x300px| [[Synthetic Biology Open Language]] (SBOL) standard visual symbols for use with [[BioBrick|BioBricks Standard]]]]
In general its purpose can be described as the design and construction of novel artificial biological pathways, organisms or devices, or the redesign of existing natural biological systems.

Synthetic biology has traditionally been divided into two different approaches. Top down synthetic biology involves using metabolic and genetic engineering techniques to impart new functions to living cells. Bottom up synthetic biology involves creating new biological systems ''in vitro'' by bringing together 'non-living' biomolecular components,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwille P | title = Bottom-up synthetic biology: engineering in a tinkerer's world | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6047 | pages = 1252–4 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21885774 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211701 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1252S }}&lt;/ref&gt; often with the aim of constructing an [[artificial cell]]. Biological systems are thus assembled module-by-module. [[Cell-free protein synthesis|Cell-free protein expression systems]] are often employed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noireaux V, Libchaber A | title = A vesicle bioreactor as a step toward an artificial cell assembly | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 51 | pages = 17669–74 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15591347 | pmc = 539773 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0408236101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10117669N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgman CE, Jewett MC | title = Cell-free synthetic biology: thinking outside the cell | journal = Metabolic Engineering | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–9 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21946161 | pmc = 3322310 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymben.2011.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elani Y, Law RV, Ces O | title = Protein synthesis in artificial cells: using compartmentalisation for spatial organisation in vesicle bioreactors | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 24 | pages = 15534–7 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25932977 | doi = 10.1039/C4CP05933F | bibcode = 2015PCCP...1715534E }}&lt;/ref&gt; as are membrane-based molecular machinery.  There are increasing efforts to bridge the divide between these approaches by forming hybrid living/synthetic cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elani Y, Trantidou T, Wylie D, Dekker L, Polizzi K, Law RV, Ces O | title = Constructing vesicle-based artificial cells with embedded living cells as organelle-like modules | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 4564 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29540757 | pmc = 5852042 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-22263-3 | bibcode = 2018NatSR...8.4564E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and engineering communication between living and synthetic cell populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lentini R, Martín NY, Forlin M, Belmonte L, Fontana J, Cornella M, Martini L, Tamburini S, Bentley WE, Jousson O, Mansy SS | title = Two-Way Chemical Communication between Artificial and Natural Cells | language = EN | journal = ACS Central Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–123 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28280778 | pmc = 5324081 | doi = 10.1021/acscentsci.6b00330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first identifiable use of the term "synthetic biology" was in [[Stéphane Leduc]]’s publication of ''Théorie physico-chimique de la vie et générations spontanées'' (1910)&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23348076M/Théorie_physico-chimique_de_la_vie_et_générations_spontanées Théorie physico-chimique de la vie et générations spontanées, S. Leduc, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''La Biologie Synthétique'' (1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.peiresc.org/bstitre.htm |title=La biologie synthétique, étude de biophysique |last=Leduc |first=Stéphane |date=1912 | veditors = Poinat A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary interpretation of synthetic biology was given by Polish geneticist [[Wacław Szybalski]] in a panel discussion during Eighteenth Annual "OHOLO" Biological Conference on Strategies for the Control of Gene Expression'' in 1973 [[Zichron Yaakov]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Dirk Stemerding, Virgil Rerimassie | title= Discourses on Synthetic Biology in Europe | publisher= Rathenau Instituut  | place= The Hague | date = 2013 | pages= 4|url=https://www.rathenau.nl/en/file/59/download?token=W_76_A_V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= Proceedings of the Eighteenth Annual "OHOLO" Biological Conference  on Strategies for the Control of Gene Expression held March 27·30, 1973, at Zichron Yaakov, Israel | pages= 405 | isbn = 978-1-4684-3248-0 |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GC3vBwAAQBAJ}}| volume= Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, v. 44 | chapter= Panel  discussion | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4684-3246-6| series= Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | year= 1974 | citeseerx= 10.1.1.612.3122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Werner Arber|Arber]], [[Daniel Nathans|Nathans]] and [[Hamilton O. Smith|Smith]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, leading Szybalski to offer an editorial comment in the journal ''[[Gene (journal)|Gene]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work on restriction nucleases not only permits us easily to construct recombinant DNA molecules and to analyze individual genes, but also has led us into the new era of synthetic biology where not only existing genes are described and analyzed but also new gene arrangements can be constructed and evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szybalski W, Skalka A | title = Nobel prizes and restriction enzymes | journal = Gene | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–2 | date = November 1978 | pmid = 744485 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(78)90016-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A notable advance in synthetic biology occurred in 2000, when two articles in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] discussed the creation of [[synthetic biological circuit]] devices of a genetic toggle switch and a biological clock by combining genes within [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] cells.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elowitz MB, Leibler S | title = A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6767 | pages = 335–8 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10659856 | doi = 10.1038/35002125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner TS, Cantor CR, Collins JJ | title = Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6767 | pages = 339–42 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10659857 | doi = 10.1038/35002131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perspectives ==
Engineers view biology as a ''technology'' – a given system's ''[[biotechnology]]'' or its ''[[biological engineering]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 6 | last = Zeng | first = Jie (Bangzhe) | title = On the concept of systems bio-engineering | journal = Coomunication on Transgenic Animals, June 1994, CAS, PRC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health (see [[Biomedical Engineering]]) and our environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 6 | last = Chopra | first = Paras | author2 = Akhil Kamma | title = Engineering life through Synthetic Biology | journal = In Silico Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in synthetic biology can be subdivided into broad classifications according to the approach they take to the problem at hand:
standardization of biological parts, biomolecular engineering, genome engineering. Biomolecular engineering includes approaches that aim to create a toolkit of functional units that can be introduced to present new technological functions in living cells. [[Genetic engineering]] includes approaches to construct synthetic chromosomes for whole or minimal organisms. Biomolecular design refers to the general idea of de novo design and additive combination of biomolecular components. Each of these approaches share a similar task: to develop a more synthetic entity at a higher level of complexity by inventively manipulating a simpler part at the preceding level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Channon K, Bromley EH, Woolfson DN | title = Synthetic biology through biomolecular design and engineering | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–8 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644449 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2008.06.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, "re-writers" are synthetic biologists interested in testing the irreducibility of biological systems. Due to the complexity of natural biological systems, it would be simpler to rebuild the natural systems of interest from the ground up; In order to provide engineered surrogates that are easier to comprehend, control and manipulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = M | last = Stone | title = Life Redesigned to Suit the Engineering Crowd | journal = Microbe | volume = 1 | issue = 12 | pages = 566–570 | date = 2006 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d45/e0f37a0fb6c1a3c659c71ee9c52619b18364.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-writers draw inspiration from [[refactoring]], a process sometimes used to improve computer software.

== Enabling technologies ==
Several novel enabling technologies were critical to the success of synthetic biology. Concepts include [[standardization]] of biological parts and hierarchical abstraction to permit using those parts in synthetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker D, Church G, Collins J, Endy D, Jacobson J, Keasling J, Modrich P, Smolke C, Weiss R | title = Engineering life: building a fab for biology | journal = Scientific American | volume = 294 | issue = 6 | pages = 44–51 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16711359 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0606-44 | bibcode = 2006SciAm.294f..44B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic technologies include reading and writing DNA (sequencing and fabrication). Measurements under multiple conditions are needed for accurate modeling and computer-aided-design (CAD).

=== DNA and gene synthesis ===
{{Main|Artificial gene synthesis|Synthetic genomics}}Driven by dramatic decreases in costs of [[oligonucleotides|oligonucleotide]] ("oligos") synthesis, the sizes of DNA constructions from oligos have increased to the genomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kosuri S, Church GM|date=May 2014|title=Large-scale de novo DNA synthesis: technologies and applications|journal=Nature Methods|volume=11|issue=5|pages=499–507|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2918|pmid=24781323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, researchers reported synthesis of the 9.6 kbp (kilo bp) [[Hepatitis C]] virus genome from chemically synthesized 60 to 80-mers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blight KJ, Kolykhalov AA, Rice CM|date=December 2000|title=Efficient initiation of HCV RNA replication in cell culture|journal=Science|volume=290|issue=5498|pages=1972–4|bibcode=2000Sci...290.1972B|doi=10.1126/science.290.5498.1972|pmid=11110665}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 researchers at [[SUNY Stony Brook]] succeeded in synthesizing the 7741 bp [[poliovirus]] genome from its published sequence, producing the second synthetic genome, spanning two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Couzin J|date=July 2002|title=Virology.

In 2007 it was reported that several companies were offering [[gene synthesis|synthesis of genetic sequences]] up to 2000 base pairs (bp) long, for a price of about $1 per bp and a turnaround time of less than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Pollack| first = Andrew| title = How Do You Like Your Genes?

Additionally, the [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas]] system has emerged as a promising technique for gene editing. It was described as "the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years".&lt;ref name="washpost_crispr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Basulto|first1=Dominic|title=Everything you need to know about why CRISPR is such a hot technology|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/11/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-why-crispr-is-such-a-hot-technology/|access-date=5 December 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other methods take months or years to edit gene sequences, CRISPR speeds that time up to weeks.&lt;ref name="washpost_crispr" /&gt; Due to its ease of use and accessibility, however, it has raised ethical concerns, especially surrounding its use in [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kahn|first1=Jennifer|title=The Crispr Quandary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/magazine/the-crispr-quandary.html?_r=0|access-date=5 December 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ledford|first1=Heidi|title=CRISPR, the disruptor|url=http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673|access-date=5 December 2015|agency=Nature News|publisher=Nature|date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higginbotham|first1=Stacey|title=Top VC Says Gene Editing Is Riskier Than Artificial Intelligence|url=http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/khosla-crispr-ai/|access-date=5 December 2015|publisher=Fortune|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sequencing ===
[[DNA sequencing]] determines the order of [[nucleotide]] bases in a DNA molecule. Synthetic biologists use DNA sequencing in their work in several ways. First, large-scale genome sequencing efforts continue to provide information on naturally occurring organisms. This information provides a rich substrate from which synthetic biologists can construct parts and devices. Second, sequencing can verify that the fabricated system is as intended. Third, fast, cheap, and reliable sequencing can facilitate rapid detection and identification of synthetic systems and organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rollie| date = 2012 |title = Designing biological systems: Systems Engineering meets Synthetic Biology| journal = Chemical Engineering Science| volume = 69 | pages = 1–29| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250911007925| doi=10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.068| issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While DNA is most important for information storage, a large fraction of the cell's activities are carried out by proteins. Tools can send proteins to specific regions of the cell and to link different proteins together. The interaction strength between protein partners should be tunable between a lifetime of seconds (desirable for dynamic signaling events) up to an irreversible interaction (desirable for device stability or resilient to harsh conditions). Interactions such as [[coiled coil]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woolfson DN, Bartlett GJ, Bruning M, Thomson AR | title = New currency for old rope: from coiled-coil assemblies to α-helical barrels | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–41 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22445228 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SH3 domain]]-peptide binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dueber JE, Wu GC, Malmirchegini GR, Moon TS, Petzold CJ, Ullal AV, Prather KL, Keasling JD | title = Synthetic protein scaffolds provide modular control over metabolic flux | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 753–9 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19648908 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or SpyTag/SpyCatcher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddington SC, Howarth M | title = Secrets of a covalent interaction for biomaterials and biotechnology: SpyTag and SpyCatcher | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 29 | pages = 94–9 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26517567 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offer such control. In addition it is necessary to regulate protein-protein interactions in cells, such as with light (using [[light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain]]s) or cell-permeable small molecules by [[chemically induced dimerization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayle JH, Grimley JS, Stankunas K, Gestwicki JE, Wandless TJ, Crabtree GR | title = Rapamycin analogs with differential binding specificity permit orthogonal control of protein activity | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–107 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16426976 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2005.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a living cell, molecular motifs are embedded in a bigger network with upstream and downstream components. These components may alter the signalling capability of the modeling module. In the case of ultrasensitive modules, the sensitivity contribution of a module can differ from the sensitivity that the module sustains in isolation.&lt;ref name="altszylerUltrasens2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Altszyler E, Ventura A, Colman-Lerner A, Chernomoretz A|date=October 2014|title=Impact of upstream and downstream constraints on a signaling module's ultrasensitivity|journal=Physical Biology|volume=11|issue=6|pages=066003|bibcode=2014PhBio..11f6003A|doi=10.1088/1478-3975/11/6/066003|pmc=4233326|pmid=25313165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="altszylerUltrasens2017"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Altszyler E, Ventura AC, Colman-Lerner A, Chernomoretz A|year=2017|title=Ultrasensitivity in signaling cascades revisited: Linking local and global ultrasensitivity estimations|journal=PLOS One|volume=12|issue=6|pages=e0180083|arxiv=1608.08007|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1280083A|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180083|pmid=28662096|pmc=5491127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modeling ===
Models inform the design of engineered biological systems by better predicting system behavior prior to fabrication. Synthetic biology benefits from better models of how biological molecules bind substrates and catalyze reactions, how DNA encodes the information needed to specify the cell and how multi-component integrated systems behave. Multiscale models of gene regulatory networks focus on synthetic biology applications. Simulations can model all biomolecular interactions in [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], regulation and induction of gene regulatory networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaznessis YN | title = Models for synthetic biology | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 47 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17986347 | pmc = 2194732 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-1-47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthetic transcription factors ===
Studies have considered the components of the [[Transcription (biology)|DNA transcription]] mechanism. One desire of scientists creating [[synthetic biological circuit]]s is to be able to control the transcription of synthetic DNA in [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s. One study tested the adjustability of synthetic [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]] (sTFs) in areas of transcription output and cooperative ability among multiple transcription factor complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalil AS, Lu TK, Bashor CJ, Ramirez CL, Pyenson NC, Joung JK, Collins JJ | title = A synthetic biology framework for programming eukaryotic transcription functions | journal = Cell | volume = 150 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–58 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22863014 | pmc = 3653585 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers were able to mutate [[zinc finger]]s, the DNA specific component of sTFs, to decrease their affinity for specific operator DNA sequence sites, and thus decrease the associated site-specific activity of the sTF (usually transcriptional regulation). They further used the zinc fingers as components of complex-forming sTFs, which are the [[eukaryotic translation]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalil AS, Lu TK, Bashor CJ, Ramirez CL, Pyenson NC, Joung JK, Collins JJ | title = A synthetic biology framework for programming eukaryotic transcription functions | journal = Cell | volume = 150 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–58 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22863014 | pmc = 3653585 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.045 | url = http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867412007805/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Biological computers ===
A [[biological computer]] refers to an engineered biological system that can perform computer-like operations, which is a dominant paradigm in synthetic biology. Researchers built and characterized a variety of [[logic gate]]s in a number of organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh V | title = Recent advances and opportunities in synthetic logic gates engineering in living cells | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–82 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 26396651 | pmc = 4571725 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-014-9154-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrated both analog and digital computation in living cells.

=== Biosensors ===
A [[biosensor]] refers to an engineered organism, usually a bacterium,that  is capable of reporting some ambient phenomenon such as the presence of heavy metals or toxins. One such system is the [[Luciferase|Lux operon]] of ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Almeida PE, van Rappard JR, Wu JC | title = In vivo bioluminescence for tracking cell fate and function | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

Modified organisms can sense environmental signals and send output signals that can be detected and serve diagnostic purposes. Microbe cohorts have been used.&lt;ref&gt;Danino, T. et al. Programmable probiotics for detection of cancer in urine. Science Transl. Med. 7, 289ra84 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cell transformation ===
{{Main|Transformation (genetics)}}Cells use interacting genes and proteins, which are called gene circuits, to implement diverse function, such as responding to environmental signals, decision making and communication. Three key components are involved: DNA, RNA and Synthetic biologist designed gene circuits that can control gene expression from several levels including transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels.

Traditional metabolic engineering has been bolstered by the introduction of combinations of foreign genes and optimization by directed evolution. This includes engineering ''E. coli'' and [[yeast]] for commercial production of a precursor of the [[Antimalarial medication|antimalarial drug]], [[Artemisinin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Westfall PJ, Pitera DJ, Lenihan JR, Eng D, Woolard FX, Regentin R, Horning T, Tsuruta H, Melis DJ, Owens A, Fickes S, Diola D, Benjamin KR, Keasling JD, Leavell MD, McPhee DJ, Renninger NS, Newman JD, Paddon CJ|date=January 2012|title=Production of amorphadiene in yeast, and its conversion to dihydroartemisinic acid, precursor to the antimalarial agent artemisinin|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=3|pages=E111–8|bibcode=2012PNAS..109E.111W|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110740109|pmc=3271868|pmid=22247290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entire organisms have yet to be created from scratch, although living cells can be [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with new DNA. Several ways allow constructing synthetic DNA components and even entire [[Artificial gene synthesis|synthetic genomes]], but once the desired genetic code is obtained, it is integrated into a living cell that is expected to manifest the desired new capabilities or [[phenotype]]s while growing and thriving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/eureka-scientists-unveil-giant-leap-towards-synthetic-life-9219644.html|title=Eureka!

By integrating synthetic biology with [[materials science]], it would be possible to use cells as microscopic molecular foundries to produce materials with properties whose properties were genetically encoded. Re-engineering has produced Curli fibers, the [[amyloid]] component of extracellular material of [[biofilms]], as a platform for programmable [[nanomaterial]]. These nanofibers were genetically constructed for specific functions, including adhesion to substrates, nanoparticle templating and protein immobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nguyen PQ, Botyanszki Z, Tay PK, Joshi NS|date=September 2014|title=Programmable biofilm-based materials from engineered curli nanofibres|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=4945|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4945N|doi=10.1038/ncomms5945|pmid=25229329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designed proteins ===

[[File:Top7.png|thumb|The [[Top7]] protein was one of the first proteins designed for a fold that had never been seen before in nature&lt;ref name="kuhlman03"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhlman B, Dantas G, Ireton GC, Varani G, Stoddard BL, Baker D | title = Design of a novel globular protein fold with atomic-level accuracy | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5649 | pages = 1364–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14631033 | doi = 10.1126/science.1089427 | bibcode = 2003Sci...302.1364K }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Natural proteins can be engineered, e.g., by [[directed evolution]], novel protein structures that match or improve on the functionality of existing proteins can be produced. One group generated a [[helix bundle]] that was capable of binding [[oxygen]] with similar properties as [[hemoglobin]], yet did not bind [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koder RL, Anderson JL, Solomon LA, Reddy KS, Moser CC, Dutton PL | title = Design and engineering of an O(2) transport protein | journal = Nature | volume = 458 | issue = 7236 | pages = 305–9 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19295603 | pmc = 3539743 | doi = 10.1038/nature07841 | bibcode = 2009Natur.458..305K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar protein structure was generated to support a variety of [[oxidoreductase]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farid TA, Kodali G, Solomon LA, Lichtenstein BR, Sheehan MM, Fry BA, Bialas C, Ennist NM, Siedlecki JA, Zhao Z, Stetz MA, Valentine KG, Anderson JL, Wand AJ, Discher BM, Moser CC, Dutton PL | title = Elementary tetrahelical protein design for diverse oxidoreductase functions | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 826–833 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24121554 | pmc = 4034760 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1362 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group generated a family of G-protein coupled receptors that could be activated by the inert small molecule clozapine-N-oxide but insensitive to the native [[ligand]], [[acetylcholine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armbruster BN, Li X, Pausch MH, Herlitze S, Roth BL | title = Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 5163–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17360345 | pmc = 1829280 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700293104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.5163A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common investigation is [[Expanded genetic code|expansion]] of the natural set of 20 [[amino acid]]s. Excluding [[stop codon]]s, 61 [[codons]] have been identified, but only 20 amino acids are coded generally in all organisms. Certain codons are engineered to code for alternative amino acids including: nonstandard amino acids such as O-methyl [[tyrosine]]; or exogenous amino acids such as 4-fluorophenylalanine. Typically, these projects make use of re-coded [[nonsense suppressor]] [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]]-[[Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]] pairs from other organisms, though in most cases substantial engineering is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang Q, Parrish AR, Wang L|date=March 2009|title=Expanding the genetic code for biological studies|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|volume=16|issue=3|pages=323–36|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2009.03.001|pmc=2696486|pmid=19318213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers investigated protein structure and function by reducing the normal set of 20 [[amino acid]]s. Limited protein sequence libraries are made by generating proteins where groups of amino acids may be replaced by a single amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, AR|author2=Lumb, KJ|author3=Sauer, RT|date=1995|title=Cooperatively folded proteins in random sequence libraries|journal=Nature Structural Biology|volume=2|issue=10|pages=856–864|doi=10.1038/nsb1095-856}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, several [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] amino acids within a protein can all be replaced with a single non-polar amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kamtekar S, Schiffer JM, Xiong H, Babik JM, Hecht MH|date=December 1993|title=Protein design by binary patterning of polar and nonpolar amino acids|journal=Science|volume=262|issue=5140|pages=1680–5|bibcode=1993Sci...262.1680K|doi=10.1126/science.8259512|pmid=8259512}}&lt;/ref&gt; One project demonstrated that an engineered version of [[Chorismate mutase]] still had catalytic activity when only 9 amino acids were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Walter KU, Vamvaca K, Hilvert D|date=November 2005|title=An active enzyme constructed from a 9-amino acid alphabet|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=280|issue=45|pages=37742–6|doi=10.1074/jbc.M507210200|pmid=16144843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and companies practice synthetic biology to synthesize [[industrial enzymes]] with high activity, optimal yields and effectiveness. These synthesized enzymes aim to improve products such as detergents and lactose-free dairy products, as well as make them more cost effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/synthetic-biology/synthetic-biology-applications.html|title=Synthetic Biology Applications|website=www.thermofisher.com|access-date=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The improvements of metabolic engineering by synthetic biology is an example of a biotechnological technique utilized in industry to discover pharmaceuticals and fermentive chemicals. Synthetic biology may investigate modular pathway systems in biochemical production and increase yields of metabolic production. Artificial enzymatic activity and subsequent effects on metabolic reaction rates and yields may develop "efficient new strategies for improving cellular properties ... for industrially important biochemical production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Shin HD, Li J, Liu L | title = Toward metabolic engineering in the context of system biology and synthetic biology: advances and prospects | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 1109–18 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25547833 | doi = 10.1007/s00253-014-6298-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designed nucleic acid systems ===
Scientists can encode digital information onto a single strand of [[synthetic DNA]]. In 2012, [[George M. Church]] encoded one of his books about synthetic biology in DNA.

Many technologies have been developed for incorporating [[Nucleic acid analogue|unnatural nucleotides]] and amino acids into nucleic acids and proteins, both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''. For example, in May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial [[nucleotides]] into bacterial DNA.

One important topic in synthetic biology is ''synthetic life'', that is concerned with hypothetical organisms created ''[[in vitro]]'' from [[biomolecule]]s and their component materials. Synthetic life experiments attempt to either probe the [[origins of life]], study some of the properties of life, or more ambitiously to recreate life from non-living ([[abiotic components|abiotic]]) components. Synthetic life biology attempts to create living organisms capable of carrying out important functions, from manufacturing pharmaceuticals to detoxifying polluted land and water.&lt;ref name="enzymes2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Connor |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/major-synthetic-life-breakthrough-as-scientists-make-the-first-artificial-enzymes-9896333.html |title=Major synthetic life breakthrough as scientists make the first artificial enzymes |work=The Independent |location=London |date=1 December 2014 |access-date=2015-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, it offers prospects of using designer biological parts as a starting point for new classes of therapies and diagnostic tools.&lt;ref name="enzymes2014" /&gt;

A living "artificial cell" has been defined as a completely synthetic cell that can capture [[energy]], maintain [[electrochemical gradient|ion gradients]], contain [[macromolecules]] as well as store information and have the ability to [[mutate]].&lt;ref name='Deamer'&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deamer D | title = A giant step towards artificial life? | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 336–8 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15935500 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2005.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody has been able to create such a cell.&lt;ref name='Deamer'/&gt;

A completely synthetic bacterial chromosome was produced in 2010 by [[Craig Venter]], and his team introduced it to genomically emptied bacterial host cells.&lt;ref name="gibson52"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibson DG, Glass JI, Lartigue C, Noskov VN, Chuang RY, Algire MA, Benders GA, Montague MG, Ma L, Moodie MM, Merryman C, Vashee S, Krishnakumar R, Assad-Garcia N, Andrews-Pfannkoch C, Denisova EA, Young L, Qi ZQ, Segall-Shapiro TH, Calvey CH, Parmar PP, Hutchison CA, Smith HO, Venter JC | title = Creation of a bacterial cell controlled by a chemically synthesized genome | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5987 | pages = 52–6 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20488990 | doi = 10.1126/science.1190719 | bibcode = 2010Sci...329...52G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The host cells were able to grow and replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=127010591| title=Scientists Reach Milestone On Way To Artificial Life| access-date=2010-06-09|date=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Venter|first1=JC|title=From Designing Life to Prolonging Healthy Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwu_djYMm3w&amp;t=30s|website=YouTube|publisher=University of California Television (UCTV)|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first living organism with 'artificial' expanded DNA code was presented in 2014; the team used ''E. coli'' that had its genome extracted and replaced with a chromosome with an expanded genetic code. The [[nucleoside]]s added are [[d5SICS]] and [[dNaM]].&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"/&gt;

=== Drug delivery platforms ===
==== Engineered bacteria-based platform ====
Bacteria have long been used in cancer treatment. ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' selectively colonize tumors and reduce their size.&lt;ref name="Zu_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zu C, Wang J|date=August 2014|title=Tumor-colonizing bacteria: a potential tumor targeting therapy|url=|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=225–35|doi=10.3109/1040841X.2013.776511|pmid=23964706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently synthetic biologists reprogrammed bacteria to sense and respond to a particular cancer state. Most often bacteria are used to deliver a therapeutic molecule directly to the tumor to minimize off-target effects. To target the tumor cells, [[peptide]]s that can specifically recognize a tumor were expressed on the surfaces of bacteria. Peptides used include an [[Affibody molecule|affibody]] molecule that specifically targets human [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|epidermal growth factor receptor 2]]&lt;ref name="Gujrati_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gujrati V, Kim S, Kim SH, Min JJ, Choy HE, Kim SC, Jon S|date=February 2014|title=Bioengineered bacterial outer membrane vesicles as cell-specific drug-delivery vehicles for cancer therapy|url=|journal=ACS Nano|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1525–37|doi=10.1021/nn405724x|pmid=24410085}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a synthetic [[Adhesin molecule (immunoglobulin -like)|adhsin]].&lt;ref name="Piñero-Lambea_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Piñero-Lambea C, Bodelón G, Fernández-Periáñez R, Cuesta AM, Álvarez-Vallina L, Fernández LÁ|date=April 2015|title=Programming controlled adhesion of E. coli to target surfaces, cells, and tumors with synthetic adhesins|journal=ACS Synthetic Biology|volume=4|issue=4|pages=463–73|doi=10.1021/sb500252a|pmc=4410913|pmid=25045780}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other way is to allow bacteria to sense the [[tumor microenvironment]], for example hypoxia, by building an AND logic gate into bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;I.V. Deyneko, N. Kasnitz, S. Leschner, S. WeissComposing a tumor specific bacterial promoter PLOS One, 11 (5) (2016), p. e0155338, 10.1371/journal.pone.0155338&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria then only release target therapeutic molecules to the tumor through either [[lysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Rice KC, Bayles KW (2008) Molecular control of bacterial death and lysis. Microbiol Mol Biol Rev 72: 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[bacterial secretion system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganai, S., Arenas, R. B. &amp; Forbes, N. S. Tumour-targeted delivery of TRAIL using Salmonella typhimurium enhances breast cancer survival in mice. Br. J. Cancer 101, 1683–1691 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Lysis has the advantage that it can stimulate the immune system and control growth. Multiple types of secretion systems can be used and other strategies as well. The system is inducible by external signals. Inducers include chemicals, electromagnetic or light waves.

Multiple species and strains are applied in these therapeutics. Most commonly used bacteria are ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'', [[Escherichia coli|''Escherichia Coli'']], ''Bifidobacteria'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''. Each of these species have their own property and are unique to cancer therapy in terms of tissue colonization, interaction with immune system and ease of application.

==== Cell-based platform ====
The immune system plays an important role in cancer and can be harnessed to attack cancer cells. Cell-based therapies focus on [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapies]], mostly by engineering [[T cell]]s.

T cell receptors were engineered and ‘trained’ to detect cancer [[epitope]]s. [[Chimeric antigen receptor]]s (CARs) are composed of a fragment of an [[antibody]] fused to intracellular T cell signaling domains that can activate and trigger proliferation of the cell. A second generation CAR-based therapy was approved by FDA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Gene switches were designed to enhance safety of the treatment. Kill switches were developed to terminate the therapy should the patient show severe side effects.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, B.S., Lamb, L.S., Goldman, F. &amp; Di Stasi, A. Improving the safety of cell therapy products by suicide gene transfer. Front. Pharmacol. 5, 254 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanisms can more finely control the system and stop and reactivate it.&lt;ref&gt;Wei  P, Wong  WW, Park  JS, Corcoran  EE, Peisajovich  SG, Onuffer  JJ, Weiss  A, LiWA. 2012. Bacterial virulence proteins as tools to rewire kinase pathways in yeast and immune cells. Nature 488: 384–388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danino, T., Mondragon-Palomino, O., Tsimring, L. &amp; Hasty, J. A synchronized quorum of genetic clocks. Nature 463, 326–330 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the number of T-cells are important for therapy persistence and severity, growth of T-cells is also controlled to dial the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Y. Chen, M. C. Jensen, C. D. Smolke, Genetic control of mammalian T-cell proliferation with synthetic RNA regulatory systems. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 8531 (2010). doi:10.1073/pnas.1001721107 {{PMID|20421500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several mechanisms can improve safety and control, limitations include the difficulty of inducing large DNA circuits into the cells and risks associated with introducing foreign components, especially proteins, into cells.

== Bioethics and security ==

Synthetic biology raises ethical issues and biosecurity issues. With the exception of regulating DNA synthesis companies,&lt;ref name="Bügl, H. et al. 2007 627–629"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bügl H, Danner JP, Molinari RJ, Mulligan JT, Park HO, Reichert B, Roth DA, Wagner R, Budowle B, Scripp RM, Smith JA, Steele SJ, Church G, Endy D | title = DNA synthesis and biological security | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 627–9 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17557094 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0607-627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.synbioproject.org/site/assets/files/1335/hastings.pdf|title = Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology: An Overview of the Debates|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the issues are not seen as new because they were raised during the earlier [[recombinant DNA]] and [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO) debates and extensive regulations of [[genetic engineering]] and pathogen research were in place in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="bioethics.gov"&gt;Presidential Commission for the study of Bioethical Issues, December 2010 [http://bioethics.gov/synthetic-biology-report NEW DIRECTIONS The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies] Retrieved 2012-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical questions include: Who will have control and access to the products of synthetic biology, and who will gain from these innovations? Does the patent system allow patents on living organisms? Can embryos be engineered?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Savulescu J, Pugh J, Douglas T, Gyngell C|date=July 2015|title=The moral imperative to continue gene editing research on human embryos|journal=Protein &amp; Cell|volume=6|issue=7|pages=476–9|doi=10.1007/s13238-015-0184-y|pmc=4491050|pmid=26113289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===

The [[European Union]]-funded project SYNBIOSAFE&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synbiosafe.eu/ SYNBIOSAFE official site]&lt;/ref&gt; has issued reports on how to manage synthetic biology. A 2007 paper identified key issues in safety, security, ethics and the science-society interface, which the project defined as public education and ongoing dialogue among scientists, businesses, government and ethicists.&lt;ref name=Priorities&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt M, Ganguli-Mitra A, Torgersen H, Kelle A, Deplazes A, Biller-Andorno N | title = A priority paper for the societal and ethical aspects of synthetic biology | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 3–7 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816794 | pmc = 2759426 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9034-7 | url = http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Schmidt_etal-2009-SSBJ.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt M.

The Technoscience and its Societal Consequences".] Springer Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The key security issues that SYNBIOSAFE identified involved engaging companies that sell synthetic DNA and the [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]] community of amateur biologists. Key ethical issues concerned the creation of new life forms.

A subsequent report focused on biosecurity, especially the so-called [[dual use technology|dual-use]] challenge. For example, while synthetic biology may lead to more efficient production of medical treatments, it may also lead to synthesis or modification of harmful pathogens (e.g., [[smallpox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelle A | title = Ensuring the security of synthetic biology-towards a 5P governance strategy | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 85–90 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816803 | pmc = 2759433 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9041-8  | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biohacking community remains a source of special concern, as the distributed and diffuse nature of open-source biotechnology makes it difficult to track, regulate or mitigate potential concerns over biosafety and biosecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt M | title = Diffusion of synthetic biology: a challenge to biosafety | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–6 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 19003431 | pmc = 2671588 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-008-9018-z | url = http://www.markusschmidt.eu/pdf/Diffusion_of_synthetic_biology.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

COSY, another European initiative, focuses on public perception and communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synbio.at/ COSY: Communicating Synthetic Biology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kronberger N, Holtz P, Kerbe W, Strasser E, Wagner W | title = Communicating Synthetic Biology: from the lab via the media to the broader public | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 19–26 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816796 | pmc = 2759424 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9031-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cserer A, Seiringer A | title = Pictures of Synthetic Biology : A reflective discussion of the representation of Synthetic Biology (SB) in the German-language media and by SB experts | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 27–35 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816797 | pmc = 2759430 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9038-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To better communicate synthetic biology and its societal ramifications to a broader public, COSY and SYNBIOSAFE published ''SYNBIOSAFE'', a 38-minute documentary film, in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synbiosafe.eu/DVD COSY/SYNBIOSAFE Documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Association Synthetic Biology has proposed self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Report of IASB [http://www.ia-sb.eu/tasks/sites/synthetic-biology/assets/File/pdf/iasb_report_biosecurity_syntheticbiology.pdf "Technical solutions for biosecurity in synthetic biology"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719031805/http://www.ia-sb.eu/tasks/sites/synthetic-biology/assets/File/pdf/iasb_report_biosecurity_syntheticbiology.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}, Munich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This proposes specific measures that the synthetic biology industry, especially DNA synthesis companies, should implement. In 2007, a group led by scientists from leading DNA-synthesis companies published a "practical plan for developing an effective oversight framework for the DNA-synthesis industry".&lt;ref name="Bügl, H. et al. 2007 627–629" /&gt;

=== United States ===

In January 2009, the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] funded the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]], the [[Hastings Center]], and the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] to examine the public perception, ethics and policy implications of synthetic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Parens E., Johnston J., Moses J. [http://www.thehastingscenter.org/who-we-are/our-research/selected-past-projects/ethical-issues-in-synthetic-biology-2/ Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology.] 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9–10, 2009, the National Academies' Committee of Science, Technology &amp; Law convened a symposium on "Opportunities and Challenges in the Emerging Field of Synthetic Biology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/stl/PGA_050738 NAS Symposium official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of the [[Mycoplasma laboratorium|first synthetic genome]] and the accompanying media coverage about "life" being created, President [[Barack Obama]] established the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]] to study synthetic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Commission for the study of Bioethical Issues, December 2010 [http://bioethics.gov/node/353 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The commission convened a series of meetings, and issued a report in December 2010 titled "New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies." The commission stated that "while Venter’s achievement marked a significant technical advance in demonstrating that a relatively large genome could be accurately synthesized and substituted for another, it did not amount to the “creation of life”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioethics.gov/node/353 Synthetic Biology F.A.Q.'s | Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]&lt;/ref&gt; It noted that synthetic biology is an emerging field, which creates potential risks and rewards. The commission did not recommend policy or oversight changes and called for continued funding of the research and new funding for monitoring, study of emerging ethical issues and public education.&lt;ref name="bioethics.gov" /&gt;

Synthetic biology, as a major tool for biological advances, results in the "potential for developing biological weapons, possible unforeseen negative impacts on human health ... and any potential environmental impact".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erickson B, Singh R, Winters P | title = Synthetic biology: regulating industry uses of new biotechnologies | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6047 | pages = 1254–6 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21885775 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211066 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1254E }}&lt;/ref&gt; These security issues may be avoided by regulating industry uses of biotechnology through policy legislation. Federal guidelines on genetic manipulation are being proposed by "the President's Bioethics Commission ... in response to the announced creation of a self-replicating cell from a chemically synthesized genome, put forward 18 recommendations not only for regulating the science ... for educating the public".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Opposition ===
On March 13, 2012, over 100 environmental and civil society groups, including [[Friends of the Earth]], the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]] and the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued the manifesto ''The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology''. This manifesto calls for a worldwide moratorium on the release and commercial use of synthetic organisms until more robust regulations and rigorous biosafety measures are established. The groups specifically call for an outright ban on the use of synthetic biology on the [[human genome]] or [[human microbiome]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Xue for Harvard Magazine. September–October 2014 [http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/09/synthetic-biologys-new-menagerie Synthetic Biology’s New Menagerie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yojana Sharma for Scidev.net  March 15, 2012. [http://www.scidev.net/global/genomics/news/ngos-call-for-international-regulation-of-synthetic-biology.html NGOs call for international regulation of synthetic biology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lewontin]] wrote that some of the safety tenets for oversight discussed in ''The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology'' are reasonable, but that the main problem with the recommendations in the manifesto is that "the public at large lacks the ability to enforce any meaningful realization of those recommendations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/may/08/new-synthetic-biology-who-gains/?insrc=rel#fnr-1 The New Synthetic Biology: Who Gains?] (2014-05-08), [[Richard C. Lewontin]], ''[[New York Review of Books]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and safety ==
As research procedures scale up to industrial processes, the number and variety of workers exposed to commercial synthetic biology risk is expected to increase.  Exposure to [[Lentiviral vector|lentiviral vectors]] is one important health hazard.  Hazard controls include increased [[workplace health surveillance]] and proactive risk assessment and management, as well as biocontainment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=John|last2=Murashov|first2=Vladimir|last3=Schulte|first3=Paul|date=2016-10-18|title=Synthetic biology and occupational risk|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=224–236|doi=10.1080/15459624.2016.1237031|pmid=27754800|issn=1545-9624}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk assessment may be more difficult for organisms constructed from individual synthetic genetic components since they do not occur in nature.  Because synthetic biology engages a wide range of disciplines outside of biology who may be less familiar with microbiological risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrhtm/rr944.htm|title=Synthetic biology: A review of the technology, and current and future needs from the regulatory framework in Great Britain|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Health and Safety Executive|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Technology and Culture''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal]] founded in 1959. It is an official publication of the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT), whose members routinely refer to it as "T&amp;C." Besides scholarly articles and critical essays, the journal publishes reviews of books and museum exhibitions. Occasionally, the journal publishes thematic issues; topics have included patents, gender and technology, and ecology. ''Technology and Culture'' has had three past [[editors-in-chief]]: [[Melvin Kranzberg]] (1959–1981), Robert C. Post (1982–1995), and John M. Staudenmaier (1996–2010). Since 2011 the journal has been edited at the [[University of Oklahoma]] by Prof. Suzanne Moon. Managing editors have included Joan Mentzer, Joseph M. Schultz, David M. Lucsko, and Peter Soppelsa.

In its inaugural issue, editor Melvin Kranzberg set out a threefold educational mission for the journal: "to promote the scholarly study of the history of technology, to show the relations between technology and other elements of culture, and to make these elements of knowledge available and comprehensible to the educated citizen." No journal then in existence had as its primary focus the history of technology and its relations with society and culture. To adequately address these topics in all their complexity, a truly interdisciplinary approach was needed. And this was to be the unique contribution of ''Technology and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kranzberg|first=Melvin|title=At the Start|journal=Technology and Culture|date=Winter 1959|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9 https://www.jstor.org/stable/3100782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Textile recycling''' is the method of reusing or reprocessing used clothing, fibrous material, and clothing scraps from the manufacturing process. Textiles in [[municipal solid waste]] are found mainly in discarded clothing, although other sources include furniture, carpets, tires, footwear, and non-durable goods such as sheets and towels.

For consumers the most common way of recycling textiles is reuse through reselling or donating to charity ([[Goodwill Industries]], [[Salvation Army]], etc.). However, certain communities in the United States have been accepting textiles in curbside pickup since 1990. The textiles must be clean and dry in order to be accepted for recycling. For instance, in 2018 the city of Sommerville, MA began a curbside textile recycling program with the city's contractor, Simple Recycling. Each resident receives two pink recycling bags for free for their clothes and other household textiles. The bags are picked up by the contractor and replaced with the same number of bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/globelocal/2018/07/31/somerville-launches-curbside-textile-recycling-program/nnxYCgXLZvNVEUc8BZ8x8J/story.html|title=Somerville launches curbside textile recycling program - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in Niles, IL claimed residents diverted over two tons of waste from the landfill with the voluntary textile recycling program in August 2018. The say that the program will help reduce landfill costs as well as add additional revenue from the textiles that will "trickle down to the taxpayer."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/news/ct-nhs-textile-recycling-tl-0809-story.html|title=Clothing, textile recycling program in Niles bringing cash to village as items bypass landfill|last=Bookwalter|first=Genevieve|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Simple Recycling also operates the program in Niles, IL. They pick up the bags, weigh the donations, and pay Niles $20 per ton. The donations are then sorted and sent to thrift stores, overseas markets, or shredded for insulaiton and other industrial purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Some companies, such as [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]], an outdoor clothing and gear company, accept their product back for recycling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patagonia.com Patagonia Common Threads Garment Recycling]&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies, like [[USAgain]], are for-profit textile recycling companies using collection bins at a variety of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Kathy|title=People, planet, profit focus of Stone Mountain textile recyclers|url=http://thechampionnewspaper.com/people-planet-profit-focus-of-stone-mountain-textile-recyclers/|publisher=The Champion Newspaper|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Textile recycling equipment plays an important part in the textile recycling industry - Standard and high-efficiency textile recycling equipment is quite important for supporting the textile industry. So far,the most popular and widely accepted clothing recycling bin use a high safety chutes that are easily opened and closed.

Some textiles can be remade into other pieces of clothing, while damaged textiles are sorted out to make industrial wiping cloths and other items.

===Resale===
After collection of the textiles, workers sort and separate collected textiles by color, size and quality, it is then packed, baled and sold as good reusable clothing. Shoes are reused by being resold as well. This process not only creates local jobs, it helps stimulate local economy.

===Obstacles===
If textile re-processors receive wet or soiled clothes, however, these may still end up being disposed of in landfill, as washing and drying facilities are not present at sorting units. This then affects the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsrecycle.com/materials/textiles/news.jsp?story=6294 Councils "need to understand" importance of textile quality], [[letsrecycle.com|www.letsrecycle.com]], Retrieved 24.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process===
Clothing fabric generally consists of composites of cotton (biodegradable material) and synthetic plastics. The textile's composition will affect its durability and method of recycling.

Fiber reclamation mills grade incoming material into type and color. The color sorting means no re-dying has to take place, saving energy and pollutants. The textiles are shredded into "shoddy" fibers and blended with other selected fibers, depending on the intended end use of the recycled yarn. The blended mixture is [[carding|carded]] to clean and mix the fibers and spun ready for weaving or knitting. The fibers can also be compressed for mattress production. Textiles sent to the flocking industry are shredded to make filling material for car insulation, roofing felts, loudspeaker cones, panel linings and furniture padding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/Textiles.htm|title=textiles recycling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For specialized polyester-based materials the recycling process is significantly different. The first step is to remove the buttons and zippers; then the garments are cut into small pieces. The shredded fabric is then granulated and formed into small pellets. The pellets are broken down polymerized and turned into polyester chips. The chips are melted and spun into new filament fiber used to make new polyester fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patagonia.com Common Threads Garment Recycling]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies are creating new pieces of clothing from scraps of old clothes. By combining and making new additions, the eclectic garments are marketed as a type of style.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present''''' is a book compiling the greatest songs from 1977 to 2006, published in 2008 by [[Pitchfork Media]]. The book focuses on specific genres including [[indie rock]], [[hip-hop]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[pop music|pop]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], and experimental underground. The book is broken down into 9 chronological periods, each period beginning with a description of the music scene before the featured artists, and how those artists changed the music scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepitchfork500.com/about/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227055704/http://thepitchfork500.com/about/ |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the book as having "42 critics to cover 30 years of music, from 1977 punk to 2006 crunk, and all the starry-eyed, acoustic acts in between."&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;Claire Suddath, [http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1862151,00.html#ixzz1l6F6fPRu "The Skimmer: ''The Pitchfork 500''"], ''[[TIME]]'', November 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The book received attention and criticism from [[mainstream media|mainstream]] and [[alternative media]].  ''[[TIME]]'' commented that the book's record reviews "have been pleasantly stripped of their supercilious phrases" and that "its tributes to popular songs are exquisite" but concluded, "the project comes off like a personal message that [[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'s Rob Gordon might obsessively attach to a mix-tape."&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt;  The ''[[Washington City Paper]]'' called it ''Pitchfork'''s "boomer-like shot at print-based respectability, a coffee-table book..."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Siblo, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/38235/pitchforks-list-to-end-all-lists-should-in-fact-end "Rank Bullshit: Pitchfork's list to end all lists should, in fact, end all lists."]  ''[[Washington City Paper]]'', December 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'' gave the book a 7/10 rating, noting that Pitchfork "has emerged as arguably the preeminent music criticism source of its time while fashioning itself into a multimedia powerhouse".&lt;ref&gt;Evan Rytlewski, [http://www.undertheradarmag.com/reviews/the_pitchfork_500_our_guide_to_the_greatest_songs_from_punk_to_present/ "Reviews"], ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'', November 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the ''[[Houston Press]]'' criticized the book for what it saw as its unwarranted disregard for Latin, country, funk, soul, and classic rock, opining that ''Pitchfork'''s "school of criticism has always relied more on trendy perceptions than actual musical merit and song structure."&lt;ref&gt;John Nova Lomax, [http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2008/11/get_lit_the_pitchfork_500.php "Get Lit: The Pitchfork 500"], ''[[Houston Press]]'', November 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  And ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] Chicago'' called the book "a slow, meandering walk through the arbitrary tastes of the site’s editors and authors" and "a wasted opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Messinger, [http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/books/60329/the-pitchfork-500 "Books: ''The Pitchfork 500''"], ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] Chicago'', November 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
