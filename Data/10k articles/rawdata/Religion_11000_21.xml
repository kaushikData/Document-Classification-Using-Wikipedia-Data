&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:abakua2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Reenactment of an Abakuá ritual performed by members of the [http://www.folkcuba.cult.cu/indexeng.html Conjunto Folklórico Nacional de Cuba], showing symbols and dress typical of Abakuá ceremonies]] --&gt;
'''Abakuá''' is an [[Afro-Cuban]] men's initiatory [[fraternity]], or [[secret society]], which originated from fraternal associations in the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] region of southeastern [[Nigeria]] and southwestern [[Cameroon]]. Known generally as [[Ekpe]], [[Egbo]], [[Ngbe]], or [[Ugbe]] among the multi-lingual groups in the region. It was believed that ''Ñáñigos'', as the members are known, could be transformed into leopards to stalk their enemies. In contemporary Haiti, where secret societies have remained strong, an elite branch of the army that was set up to instill fear in the restless masses was named The Leopards. Among the less mystical ''Ñáñigo'' revenges was the ability to turn people over to slavers. In Africa they were notorious operators who had made regular deals for profit with slavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Los  Ñáñigos|last = Sosa|first = Enrique|publisher = Ediciones Casa de las Américas|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Havana|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abakuá has been described as "an Afro-Cuban version of [[Freemasonry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion in Cuba: Chango unchained|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21648695-religion-brought-over-slaves-africa-becoming-more-popular-chango-unchained|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The creolized Cuban term ''Abakuá'' is thought to refer to the [[Abakpa]] area in southeast Nigeria, where the society was active. The first such societies were established by Africans in the town of [[Regla]], [[Havana]], in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Ivor. “A Secret Society Goes Public: The Relationship Between ''Abakua'' and Cuban Popular Culture.” ''African Studies Review ''43.1 (2000): 161.&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the main area of Abakuá implantation, especially the district of [[Guanabacoa]] in eastern Havana, and in [[Matanzas]] where Afro-Cuban culture is vibrant.

Abakuá members derive their belief systems and traditional practices from the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Efik people|Efik]], [[Efut]], and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] spirits that lived in the forest. Ekpe and synonymous terms were names of both a forest spirit and a leopard related secret society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.batadrums.com/background/abakua.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Members of this society came to be known as ''ñañigos'', a word used to designate the street dancers of the society. The ''ñañigos'', who were also called ''diablitos'', were well known by the general population in [[Cuba]] through their participation in the Carnival on the [[Day of the Three Kings]], when they danced through the streets wearing their ceremonial outfit, a multicolored checkerboard dress with a conical headpiece topped with tassels.&lt;ref&gt;Velez, Teresa Maria. ''Drumming for the Gods: The Life and Times of Felipe Garcia Villamil, Santero, Palero, and Abakua.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2000: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oaths of loyalty to the Abakuá society’s sacred objects, members, and secret knowledge taken by initiates are a lifelong pact which creates a sacred kinship among the members. The duties of an Abakuá member to his ritual brothers at times surpass even the responsibilities of friendship, and the phrase "Friendship is one thing, and the Abakuá another" is often heard.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Ivor. “A Secret Society Goes Public: The Relationship Between ''Abakua'' and Cuban Popular Culture.” ''African Studies Review ''43.1 (2000): 164.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oaths made during initiation is that one will not reveal the secrets of the Abakuá to non-members, which is why the Abakuá have remained hermetic for over 160 years.&lt;ref&gt;Velez, Teresa Maria. ''Drumming for the Gods: The Life and Times of Felipe Garcia Villamil, Santero, Palero, and Abakua.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2000: 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and practices==
Besides acting as a [[Benefit society|mutual aid society]], the Abakuá performs rituals and ceremonies, called ''plantes'', full of theatricality and drama which consists of drumming, dancing, and chanting in the secret Abakuá language. Knowledge of the chants is restricted to Abakuá members, but Cuban scholars have long thought that the ceremonies express Abakuá cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Ivor. “Cuban ''Abakuá'' Chants: Examining New Linguistic and Historical Evidence for the African Diaspora.” ''African Studies Review ''48.1 (2005): 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ceremonies such as initiations and funerals, are secret and occur in the sacred room of the Abakuá temple, called the ''famba''.&lt;ref&gt;Velez, Teresa Maria. ''Drumming for the Gods: The Life and Times of Felipe Garcia Villamil, Santero, Palero, and Abakua.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2000: 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The rhythmic dance music of the Abakuá combined with [[Bantu mythology|Bantu traditions]] of the [[Congo basin|Congo]] contributed to the musical tradition of the [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]].

Although hermetic and little known even within Cuba, an analysis of Cuban popular music recorded from the 1920s until the present reveals Abakuá influence in nearly every genre of Cuban popular music. Cuban musicians who are members of the Abakuá have continually documented key aspects of their society’s history in commercial recordings, usually in their secret Abakuá language. The Abakuá have commercially recorded actual chants of the society, believing that outsiders cannot interpret them. Because Abakuá represented a rebellious, even anti-colonial, aspect of Cuban culture, these secret recordings have been very popular.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Ivor. “A Secret Society Goes Public: The Relationship Between Abakua and Cuban Popular Culture.” African Studies Review 43.1 (2000): 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practices===
[[File:Collectie Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen AM-681-5 Abakuß kostuum Cuba.jpg|thumb|Ireme costume ([[National Museum of World Cultures]])]]

'''''Ireme''''' is the Cuban term for the masked Abakuá dancer known as ''Idem'' or ''Ndem'' in the Cross River region. The masquerade dancer is carefully covered in a tight-fitting suit and hood, and dances with a broom and a staff. The broom serves to cleanse faithful members, while the staff chastises enemies and Abakuá traitors. During initiation ceremonies, the staff is called the ''Erí nBan nDó'', while during mournings and wakes it is called [[AlanManguín Besuá]].

===Language===
Due to the secrecy of the society, little is known of the Abakuá language.  It is assumed to be a creolized version of [[Efik language|Efik]] or [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], both closely related languages or dialects from the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] region of [[Nigeria]], because this is the cultural region and ethnic groups where the society originated.

If it is indeed a creolized version of either Efik or Ibibio, it could be compared in purpose and in its formation and origins to other African languages, or specialized vocabularies derived from African languages, used in other [[Afro-American religions]], such as:
*[[Lucumí language|Lucumí]]: a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] dialect used in the Cuban [[Santería]] religion
*Iorubá/Nagô: another [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] dialect used in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Candomblé Ketu]] tradition
*[[Habla Congo]]: code-switching between [[Kikongo]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words, used in the [[Palo religion]] of Cuba and other Caribbean countries, 
*[[Jamaican Maroon spirit-possession language|"Kromanti"/Jamaican Maroon spirit-possession language]]: creolized form of the [[Asante dialect]] of the [[Akan language]] from the [[Ashanti Region]] of [[Ghana]], used in [[Jamaican Maroon]] religious ceremonies involving possession by ancestors, which grant the possessee the ability to speak the language
*[[Haitian Vodou Culture Language]]: specialized vocabulary derived from African languages used in [[Haitian Vodou]]

==Disambiguation==
''Abacuá'' also describes a group of [[Afro-Cuban]] people of the [[carabalí]] as well as their style of music and their [[percussion instrument]]s.

The Abakuá Afro-Latin Dance Company, a dance company based in [[New York City]], draws its [[namesake]] from this origin. The purpose for selecting this name was to recognize the company's link to the origins of the type of music the company performs to. The company does not claim to be an authentic representation of the specific style native to Abakuá but rather, an amalgamation of movements native to Afro-Cuban/Caribbean culture and the development of the company's own unique style entitled Afro-Latin Funk. The selection of the name "Afro-Latin" was done in order to identify the company's presence within Latin and Hispanic culture as a whole.

[[File:Tel Aviv Ben Gurion - Emil Zola 2011.jpg|thumb|Classical Bauhaus architecture, part of the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]] UNESCO World Heritage Site]]
The '''architecture of Israel''' has been influenced by the different styles of architecture brought in by those who have occupied the country over time, sometimes modified to suit the local climate and landscape. Fortified [[Crusades|Crusader]] castles, [[Islamic]] madrassas, [[Byzantine]] churches, [[Templers (religious believers)|Templer]] houses,  [[Arab]] arches and minarets, Russian Orthodox onion domes, [[Bauhaus]]-style modernist buildings, sculptural concrete [[Brutalist architecture]], and soaring glass-sided skyscrapers all are part of the architecture of Israel.

==Architectural styles==
The Arabs built small stone houses on the hillsides with flat or dome roofs. The Crusaders built fortresses on strategic hilltops. The Christians built churches to mark sites where Jesus walked. The Templers built homes with tiled roofs like those in the German countryside. The British Mandatory authorities passed a law requiring all construction in Jerusalem to be of [[Jerusalem stone]] and introduced the idea of garden suburbs. In the early years of statehood, Israel built rows of [[Plattenbau|concrete tenements]] to accommodate the masses of new immigrants to replace the huts, tents and packing crates of the [[maabarot]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', edited by Raphael Patai, Herzl Press, McGraw, New York, 1971 "Architecture and Town Planning in Israel," Vol. 1, pp. 71-76&lt;/ref&gt;
First named the "White City" in 1984, the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]] has been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site. As property values have risen, [[Skyscrapers in Israel|skyscrapers]] are going up around the country. The [[Azrieli Sarona Tower]] in [[Tel Aviv]] is the tallest building in Israel to date.

==Leading architects==
Sensing the political changes taking place in central Europe around the time of the First World War, as well as the stirrings of Zionist ideals about the re-establishment of a homeland for Jews, numerous Jewish architects from around Europe emigrated to Palestine during the first three decades of the 20th century. While much innovative planning occurred during the time of [[Mandatory Palestine|the British Mandatory authorities]], 1920-1948, in particular the town plan for Tel Aviv in 1925 by [[Patrick Geddes]], it would be architecture designed in the modernist "Bauhaus" style that would fill the plots of that plan; among the architects who emigrated to Palestine at that time, and who went on to establish formidable careers were: [[Yehuda Magidovitch]], Shmuel Miestechkin, Lucian Korngold, Jacov Ornstein, Salomon Gepstein, Josef Neufeld and Genia Gideoni.

[[Dov Karmi]], [[Zeev Rechter]] and [[Arieh Sharon]] were among the leading architects of the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="haaretz.co.il"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=1029311&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;title='A%20concrete%20life%20'&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 A Concrete Life, Noam Dvir, [[Haaretz]] Magazine, October 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf (Reuven) Trostler played an important role in designing the country's early industrial buildings.&lt;ref name="haaretz.co.il" /&gt; [[Dora Gad]] designed the interiors of the [[Knesset]], the [[Israel Museum]], the country's first large hotels, the [[Jewish National and University Library]], [[El Al]] planes and [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services|Zim]] passenger ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1037242.html Dora Gad's private sanctuary]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Amnon Niv]] designed [[Moshe Aviv Tower]], Israel's tallest building.

[[Image:Madpis.jpg|thumb|[[Bauhaus]] building in [[Jerusalem]]]]

==Historical developments==
=== Traditional rural house ===
[[Image:Ruins of a church in Shivta in the Negev.jpg|thumb|Ancient basilica in the [[Negev]]]]
[[File:Latrun Monastery.jpg|thumb|[[Latrun|Latrun Monastery]]]]
Until the end of the 19th century, the traditional Arab rural house in the villages of what was then [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] consisted of a single room without partitions, divided into levels in accordance with various functions carried out in the house:
* ''Rawiyeh'' – a bottom level at the elevation of the courtyard considered the “dirty” part of the house, used for storage and sheltering livestock.
* ''Mastabeh'' – A higher residential level used for sleeping, eating, hospitality and storage.
* ''Sida'' (gallery) – Another living area above the mastaba,  used primarily for sleeping.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"&gt;[http://www.iaa-conservation.org.il/Projects_Item_eng.asp?subject_id=6&amp;site_id=3&amp;id=114  Heritage Conservation in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 19th century, a residential story characterized by a cross-vault was added above the traditional house, creating a space between the floor with the livestock in the bottom room and the residential story. A separate entrance was installed in each story.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Fortified house ===
[[Fortified house]]s were built outside the village core and had two stories: a raised ground floor with  tiny windows used for raising livestock and storage, and a separate residential floor with large windows and balconies. In the courtyard was a small structure used for storage. Sometimes a tabun baking oven would be located inside it.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Farmhouses ===
The first modern building technology was evident in the farmhouses. Iron beams were used and the roofs were made of concrete and roof tiles. These structures had balconies with a view and wide doorways.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Modern housing (British Mandate) ===
[[Image:Maskit 3.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jerusalem stone]] and metal grillwork]]
Modern housing built during the British Mandate was urban in character, with flat roofs, rectangular doorways and painted floor tiles.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Biomorphism, blob architecture ===
[[File:Rothschild Boulevard - WLM 2013 - ovedc - 11.JPG|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|[[Meier on Rothschild]] tower, Tel Aviv's highest residential building]]
The [[Pavie House]] in [[Neve Daniel]] is a rare case of non geometric biomorphic architecture (blobitecture) in Israel. Yonatan Kanti of the Israeli daily ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Ma'ariv]]'' compared Pavie architectural style to the [[futurism]] of [[Eero Saarinen]]'s [[TWA Flight Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanti|first=Yonatan|script-title=he:השראה למכירה: המקרה המוזר של הבית בגוש עציון|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/55/ART2/352/423.html?hp=55&amp;cat=302&amp;loc=7|accessdate=7 April 2012|newspaper=[[Nrg Maariv]]|date=2 April 2012|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Inspiration for sale: The curious case of the house in Gush Etzion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie theaters ===
The architecture of Tel Aviv's movie theaters can be seen as a reflection of Israeli architectural history: The first cinema, the Eden, opened in 1914, was an example of the [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style that was in vogue at the time, combining European and Arab traditions. The Mugrabi cinema, designed in 1930, was built in [[art deco]] style. In the late 1930s, the Esther, Chen and Allenby theaters were prime examples of the [[Bauhaus]] style. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[brutalist]] style architecture was exemplified by the Tamar cinema built inside the historic [[Solel Boneh]] building on [[Allenby Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/before-the-curtain-fell-1.315177 Architectural milestones]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Politics of Architecture ==
The persistent existential threat posed by rival ideologies impacts how architecture is used as a powerful means of determining who gets to control and use land in Israel. [[Eyal Weizman]] advances a detailed argument concerning how the power relations expressed through architecture explain built form. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weizman|first1=Eyal|title=Hollow Land: Israel's architecture of occupation|date=2007|publisher=Verso|location=New York|edition=First|accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== State of Israel ==
From 1948, architecture in Israel was dominated by the need to house masses of new immigrants. The [[Brutalist]] concrete style suited Israel's harsh climate and paucity of natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC&amp;pg=PA1460&amp;lpg=PA1460&amp;dq=design+bank+of+israel+arieh+sharon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_EuPdMVLgf&amp;sig=Sy2nQOzYPNnM2mwCCj1dcNxfjtY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M7M1TKDLPNCnOPiN2NsE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal laws in [[Jerusalem]] require that all buildings be faced with local [[Jerusalem stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PAUL GOLDBERGERPublished: September 10, 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/10/magazine/passion-set-in-stone.html?pagewanted=7 |title=Passion Set in Stone, New York Times, Sept. 10, 1995 |publisher=New York Times |date=1995-09-10 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ordinance dates back to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] and the governorship of [[Sir Ronald Storrs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Architecture/Jeruarchitecture1948.html |title=Jerusalem Architecture Since 1948 |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of a master plan for the city drawn up in 1918 by Sir [[William McLean (disambiguation)|William McLean]], then city engineer of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_12.html The British Mandate] from "Jerusalem: Life Throughout the Ages in a Holy City".

'''Bala Prajapathi Adikalar''' (also spelt '''Adigalar''' or '''Adigal''') is considered as the present religious leader of [[Ayyavazhi]]. Ayyavazhi is not an organised religious system and so it does not fall directly under his control officially. But still religiously he was considered so. He has a considerable role in the [[History of Ayyavazhi]], especially during the 1970s and 1980s. He was also awarded the [[Kottai Ameer award]] for communal harmony by the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] in 2003.

'''''Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary''''' is a comic-book story by American cartoonist [[Justin Green (cartoonist)|Justin Green]], published in 1972.  Green takes the persona of Binky Brown to tell of the "[[Scrupulosity|compulsive neurosis]]" with which he struggled in his youth and which he blamed on his strict [[Roman Catholic]] upbringing.  Green was later diagnosed with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) and came to see his problems in that light.

In the story, sinful [[intrusive thought|thoughts that he cannot control]] torment Binky Brown; to his alarm, phallic objects become literal penises and project what he calls "pecker rays" at religious objects such as churches and statues of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].  He develops an internal set of rules to obey and punishments for breaking them.  The torment does not subside, and he comes to reject the Catholic Church in defiance as the source of it.  The work combines a wide variety of visual and narrative techniques in a style that echoes the torment of its protagonist.

''Binky Brown'' had an immediate influence on contemporaries in {{not a typo|[[underground comix]]}}: such cartoonists as [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb|Aline Kominsky]], [[Robert Crumb]], and [[Art Spiegelman]] soon turned to producing similarly confessional works.  ''Binky Brown'' has gained a reputation as the first major work of autobiography in English-language comics, and many aspects of its approach have become widespread in underground and [[alternative comics]].

==Background==

[[Justin Green (cartoonist)|Justin Green]] (b.&amp;nbsp;1945) was born to a Jewish father and Catholic mother and raised Catholic.{{sfn|Green|2010|p=56}}  As a child he at first attended a Catholic [[parochial school]], and later transferred to a school where most students were Jews.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=135}}  He rejected the Catholic faith in 1958 as he believed it caused him "[[Scrupulosity|compulsive neurosis]]"{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}} that decades later was diagnosed as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD).{{sfn|Green|2010|p=58}}

Green was studying painting at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] when in 1967 he discovered the work of [[Robert Crumb]] and turned to cartooning, attracted to what he called Crumb's "harsh drawing stuffed into crookedly-drawn panels".{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=17}}  He experimented with his artwork to find what he called an "inherent and automatic style as a conduit for the chimerical forms in {{interp|his|original=my}} own psyche".{{sfn|Manning|2010}}  He dropped out of an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] program at [[Syracuse University]]{{sfn|Levin|1998|p=101}} when in 1968 he felt a "call to arms"{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=17}} to move to San Francisco, where the nascent {{not a typo|[[underground comix]]}} scene was blossoming amid [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]] there.{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=17}}  That year Green introduced a religion-obsessed character in the strip "Confessions of a Mad School Boy", published in a periodical in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1968.  He named the character Binky Brown in "Binky Brown Makes up His Own Puberty Rites", published in the 17th issue of the underground comic book ''[[Yellow Dog (comics)|Yellow Dog]]'' in 1969.  "The Agony of Binky Brown" followed in the first issue of ''Laugh in the Dark'', published by Last Gasp in 1971.{{sfn|Bosky|2012|p=89}}

At the time, comic books had a reputation in the US as low-brow children's entertainment, and the public often associated them with juvenile delinquency.  Comics had little cultural capital and few American cartoonists had challenged the perception that the medium was inherently incapable of mature artistic expression.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=12}}

==Synopsis==

Green takes the persona of Binky Brown,{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=480}} who opens the story writing a confession of the neurosis that has tortured him since puberty.  In his childhood, he knocks over a statue of the Virgin Mary and feels intense guilt over this affront to his mother and to God.  Binky is raised a Catholic and undergoes the religious indoctrination of nuns{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=481}} at a strict Catholic parochial school that commonly employs corporal punishment.{{sfn|Green|2010|p=57}}  He forms an image of a vengeful God, which fills him with feelings of fear and guilt.{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=481}}

Binky's [[intrusive thought]]s bring him to believe his body is trying to lead him to sin and [[eternal punishment]].  He develops an internal system of rules to cope with these thoughts and punishes himself for violations.  He wards off thoughts and fantasies he cannot control and that give him guilt by silently repeating the word "noyatin" to himself, a contraction of the repentant "not a sin".{{sfn|Green|2010|p=57}}

As he approaches adolescence and becomes aware of his sexuality, he begins to see common objects as phalluses—phalluses that project unholy rays.  These objects include his fingers, his toes, and his own penis, and he obsessively tries to deflect their "pecker rays" from reaching holy items such as churches or statues of Mary.  Binky finds his anguish all-consuming as he imagines the destruction he cannot avoid, and spends hours praying to God for forgiveness.  As an adult, Binky confronts his faith and by smashing a set of statues of the Virgin Mary declares himself free of the Church and its influence on him.{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=481}}

==Composition and publication==

[[File:Ron Turner (San Francisco 2007).jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a seated man with a long white beard|Green received financial support from [[Last Gasp]] publisher Ron Turner ''(photo from 2007)'']]

Green spent about a year working on the 44-page ''Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary''.  He took a few months making cards of what he called "factual incidents or neurotic habits"{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}} to incorporate.  During the seven months he drew the work Green received a monthly stipend of $150 from Ron Turner, the founder of underground {{not a typo|comix}} publisher [[Last Gasp|Last Gasp Eco-Funnies]].{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}}  Last Gasp published the story as a one-shot comic book in 1972{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=480}}—Green's first solo title.{{sfn|Levin|1998|p=102}}  It went through two print runs of 55,000 copies each{{sfn|Green|2010|p=58}} with a "Youngsters Prohibited" label on the cover.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}}

In 1990, Green had an essay published entitled "The Binky Brown Matter" in ''[[The Sun (magazine)|The Sun]]''.{{sfn|Levin|1998|p=103}} In the essay, he describes the OCD with which he was diagnosed years after completing ''Binky Brown''.{{sfn|Green|2010|p=58}}  Last Gasp reprinted the story in 1995 in ''The Binky Brown Sampler'', a softcover anthology of Binky Brown strips with an introduction by [[Art Spiegelman]]{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=481}} and an expanded version of "The Binky Brown Matter".{{sfn|Levin|1998|p=103}}

Green sold the original artwork to the strip in the 1970s; [[McSweeney's]] staff contacted the owner of the artwork, Christine Valenza, to make fresh scans for a standalone reprinting in 2009,{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=481}} overseen by McSweeney's editor Eli Horowitz.  It had a print run of 5,000 copies and reprints the artwork at the full size of the originals; the page reproductions mimic the actual pages, including marks, smudges, and corrections.{{sfn|Reid|2009}}  In 2011, the publisher Stara published a French translation by Harry Morgan titled ''Binky Brown rencontre la Vierge Marie'',{{sfnm|1a1=Bi|1y=2011|2a1=Norot|2y=2011}} and La Cúpula published a Spanish translation by Francisco Pérez Navarro titled ''Binky Brown conoce a la virgen María''.{{sfnm|1a1=Jiménez|1y=2011|2a1=Queipo|2y=2011}}

==Style and analysis==

[[File:Justin Green (1972) Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary splash page.jpg|thumb|alt=A comic-book panel of a naked man hanging over a sickle bound head to foot, drawing with a pen in his mouth|''Binky Brown'' makes visual its author's internal anguish.]]

The story takes the form of a guilt-ridden confession.{{sfn|Spiegelman|1995|pp=4–5}}  In the opening, the adult Binky hangs over a sickle, bound from head to toe and listening to ''[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]'' as he draws with a pen in his mouth.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=8}}  He declares his intention: "to purge myself of the compulsive neurosis which I have served since I officially left Catholicism on Halloween, 1958."{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}}  He justifies the work to communicate with the "many others {{interp|who}} are slaves to their neuroses" and who, despite believing themselves isolated, number so many that they "would entwine the globe many times over in a vast chain of common suffering".{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=8}}

Though Green built ''Binky Brown'' on an autobiographical base he fabricated many scenes—such as one in which Binky is bullied by two third-graders—"to suggest or convey a whole generalized idea about some subjective feeling, such as order or fear or guilt".{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}}  To critic Charles Hatfield ''Binky Brown'' displays a "radical subjectivity"{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=138}} that calls into question the notion of objectivity in autobiography.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=138}}  The presentation is insistently subjective and non-literal in its visuals.{{sfn|Witek|2011|p=229}}

Despite the heavy tone, humor is prominent.{{sfnm|1a1=Spiegelman|1y=1995|1pp=4–5|2a1=Rosenkrantz|2y=2011|2p=1}}  The work is [[Metafiction|conscious of its own creation]]—Green's drawing of it frames the narrative proper and there are constant reminders of it throughout.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}}  Green patterned the opening after those featuring the Crypt-Keeper in [[EC Comics]]' ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' series from the 1950s.  Green used the adult Binky as the narrator of the captions and as a way to tie together the past and present timeframes.{{sfn|Manning|2010}} There is a disconnect in that the narrator refers to his younger self as "he".{{sfn|Witek|2011|p=229}}  Other references to comics include a ''Sinstopper's Guidebook'', which alludes to [[Dick Tracy]]'s ''Crimestopper's Textbook''{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=138}} and a cartoon by Robert Crumb in the background.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}}

[[File:Treasure Chest 184 cover.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A comic book cover depicting two characters with halos behind their heads, title ''Treasure Chest''|Comics and Catholic images are scattered throughout ''Binky Brown'', such as the [[Parochialism|parochial]] ''[[Treasure Chest (comics)|Treasure Chest]]'' comic book.]]

Green employs numerous Catholic symbols, such as a word balloon adorned with symbols of Christ's martyrdom to represent the depth of Binky's desperation.  Catholic works such as a [[catechism]] and ''[[Treasure Chest (comics)|Treasure Chest]]'' [[Parochialism|parochial]] comics appear throughout the work.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}}

Despite strict censorship in other media in the US, explicit sexuality was common in underground {{not a typo|comix}}.  ''Binky Brown'' was the first work of autobiographical comics to depict explicit sexuality: penises appear throughout, and Binky masturbates in one scene.{{sfn|Chute|2010|pp=18–19}}  The central symbol of the penis recurs sometimes subtly as in the images of pencils used to craft the work,{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}} and more often explicitly, as every phallic-like object Green sees because a literal "pecker ray"-projecting penis in Binky's mind.{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}}

[[Art Spiegelman]] described the artwork as "quirky and ungainly".{{sfn|Spiegelman|1995|p=5}}  Though it appears awkward, Green put considerable effort into elements such as [[Perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]], and draws attention to his craft by depicting himself drawing and by placing the drawing manuals ''Perspective'' and ''Fun With a Pencil'' in the backgrounds. In contrast to the mundane tales of [[Harvey Pekar]], another prominent early practitioner of autobiographical comics, Green makes wide use of visual metaphors.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}}  In ''Binky Brown'' symbols become literal, as when Binky imagines himself becoming a snowball hurtling into Hell or as a fish chased by a police officer who wears a crucifix.{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=135}}  The work displays a wide array of visual techniques: diagrammatic arrows; mock-scholarly documentation; a great variety in panel size, composition, and layout; and a range of contrasting mechanical and organic rendering techniques, such as [[screentone]] alongside dense hand-drawn [[hatching]].{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=138}}  The symbolic and technical collide where the Virgin Mary becomes the [[vanishing point]] of Binky's converging "pecker rays".{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=134}}

[[File:Dream of the Rarebit Fiend 1905-02-25 panels 4 and 5 atacked.jpg|thumb|alt=Two panels of a comic strip of a man being buried alive|Precursors in comics to ''Binky Brown''{{'}}s unrestricted psyche include [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'' (February 25, 1905).]]

Critic Joseph Witek sees the shifting between different modes of traditional comics representation at times presents a literalist view through "windowlike panels",{{sfn|Witek|2011|p=229}} and at others "representational, symbolic, allegorical, associative, and allusive", an approach analogous to "Binky Brown's massively and chaotically overdetermined subjectivity".{{sfn|Witek|2011|p=229}}  Witek finds roots for the fractured psychological landscape of ''Binky Brown'' in the comics of earlier eras: the unrestrained psyches in the dreams of [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'', the irrational, shifting landscapes of [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and [[Superman]]'s obsessively contrarian nemesis [[Bizarro]].{{sfn|Witek|2011|pp=229–230}}

In ''Binky Brown'' Green blames the Catholic Church for his psychological troubles; years later, he was diagnosed with OCD, and came to see these episodes in that light rather than as the fault of the Church.{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=481}}  He nevertheless continued to blame the Church for contributing to his anxieties and maintained that religion has a magnifying influence on the condition.  He said the abandoning of both religion and recreational drugs made it easier to cope with his condition.{{sfn|Manning|2010}}  In 1990 a Catholic priest raised concerns that ''Binky Brown'' may be harmful to minors; Green countered that he believed it was the Church that was harming minors.{{sfn|Green|2010|p=57}}  Green has likened his OCD to a "split vision" which made him "both the slave to the compulsion and the detached observer".{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=12}}

Literary scholar [[Hillary Chute]] sees the work as addressing feminist concerns of "embodiment and representation"{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=19}} as it "delves into and forcefully pictures non-normative sexuality".{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=19}}  Chute affirms that despite its brevity ''Binky Brown'' merits the label "[[graphic novel]]" as "the quality of work, its approach, parameters, and sensibility"{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=17}} mark a "seriousness of purpose".{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=17}}

==Reception and legacy==
Green recounted "a strong energy" that ''Binky Brown'' drew from his readership, the first significant response he got from his work.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=13}}  The story has had a wide influence on underground and [[alternative comics]],{{sfn|Booker|2014|p=480}} where its self-mocking{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=138}} and confessional approach has inspired numerous cartoonists to expose intimate and embarrassing details of their lives.{{sfnm|1a1=Hatfield|1y=2005|1p=138|2a1=Spiegelman|2y=1995|2p=4}}  Under the influence of ''Binky Brown'', in 1972 [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb|Aline Kominsky]] published her first strip, the autobiographical "Goldie: A Neurotic Woman"{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=34}} in ''[[Wimmen's Comix]]'' {{No.|1}}.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=13}}  Other contemporary underground cartoonists were soon to incorporate confessional autobiography into their work.{{sfn|Witek|2011|p=227}}  Robert Crumb followed the same year with "The Confessions of R. Crumb" and continued with numerous other such strips.{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}}  Art Spiegelman, who had seen ''Binky Brown'' in mid-creation in 1971,{{sfn|Gardner|2008|p=17}} went as far as to state that "without ''Binky Brown'' there would be no ''[[Maus]]''"—Spiegelman's most prominent work.{{sfn|Spiegelman|1995|p=4}}  The same year as ''Binky Brown''{{`}}s publication, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip to the first issue of ''Funny &lt;!-- This spelling is correct!!! --&gt;{{Not a typo|Aminals}}&lt;!-- Please do not "correct" it!!! --&gt;'', which Green edited and was published by [[Apex Novelties]]. Spiegelman delivered the three-page "Maus" in which Nazi cats persecute Jewish mice, inspired by his father's experiences in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]; years later he revisited the theme in the graphic novel of the same name.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=103}}  Comics critic Jared Gardner asserts that, while underground {{not a typo|comix}} was associated with countercultural iconoclasm, the movement's most enduring legacy was to be autobiography.{{sfn|Gardner|2008|pp=6–7}}

''Binky Brown'' went out of print for two decades after selling its initial print runs, during which time enthusiasts traded copies or photocopies.{{sfn|Spiegelman|1995|p=5}} Green made his living painting signs, and contributed occasional cartoon strips to various publications.{{sfn|Spiegelman|1995|p=5}} Green used the Binky Brown persona over the years in short strips and prose pieces that appeared in underground periodicals such as ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'' and ''[[Weirdo (comics)|Weirdo]]''.{{sfn|Levin|2005|p=88}}  "Sweet Void of Youth" in 1976 follows Binky from high school to age thirty-one, torn between cartooning and more respected forms of art.{{sfn|Levin|1998|p=102}} Aside from occasional one-off strips, his more regular cartooning appeared in the ongoing strips ''The Sign Game'', in ''[[Signs of the Times (magazine)|Signs of the Times]]'' magazine, and ''Musical Legends in America'', in ''[[Pulse! (magazine)|Pulse!]]''{{sfn|Levin|1998|p=104}}  Such later work has attracted far less attention than ''Binky Brown''.{{sfn|Levin|1998|p=107}}

[[File:Philip Roth - 1973.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photo of a middle-aged man|Green had read [[Philip Roth]] ''(pictured)'' and other writers who bared their personal lives in their work.]]
Though autobiographical elements had appeared earlier in the work of underground cartoonists such as Crumb, [[Spain Rodriguez|Spain]], and [[Kim Deitch]],{{sfn|Gardner|2008|pp=7–8}} ''Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary'' has gained credit as the first important work of [[autobiographical comics]] in English.{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=2011|1p=227|2a1=Dycus|2y=2011|2p=111}}  To Charles Hatfield ''Binky Brown'' is "the ur-example of confessional literature in comics";{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=131}} for [[Paul Gravett]] Green was "the first neurotic visionary to unburden his uncensored psychological troubles";{{sfn|Gravett|2005|p=22}} [[Douglas Wolk]] declared Green and his work "ahead of the memoirist curve";{{sfn|Wolk|2008|p=203}} Art Spiegelman declared: "What the [[Brontë family|Brontë sisters]] did for Gothic romance, what [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] did for sword-and-sorcery, Justin Green did for confessionary, autobiographical {{not a typo|comix}} {{sic}}";{{sfn|Gravett|2005|p=23}} and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the work the "[[Rosetta Stone]] of autobiographical comics".{{sfn|Publishers Weekly staff|2011}}  

''Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary'' has appealed mostly to comics fans and cartoonists, and has gained little recognition from mainstream audiences and arts critics.  Spiegelman has speculated this neglect comes from the nature of the comics medium; in contrast to explicit works such as [[Philip Roth]]'s ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'', the penises in Green's work are visual.{{sfn|Spiegelman|1995|p=5}}

According to underground {{not a typo|comix}} historian Patrick Rosenkranz, Green represents a break with past convention by being "the first to openly render his personal demons and emotional conflicts within the confines of a comic".{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}}  Green denied credit, calling confessional autobiography "a ''fait accompli'', a low fruit ripe for the plucking",{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}} examples of which abounded in literary works he had read by [[James Joyce]], [[James&amp;nbsp;T. Farrell]], and Philip Roth.  He has accepted credit for "anticipat{{interp|ing|original=ed}} the groundswell in literature about obsessive compulsive disorder by almost two decades",{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}} for which he knew of no precedent.{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=1}} Chute sees major themes of isolation and coping with OCD recurring in autobiographical works such as [[Howard Cruse]]'s ''[[Stuck Rubber Baby]]'' (1995) and [[Alison Bechdel]]'s ''[[Fun Home]]'' (2006).{{sfn|Green|2010|p=58}}  Hatfield sees echoes of Green's unrestrained approach to dealing with a mental condition in [[Madison Clell]]'s ''Cuckoo'' (2002)—about Clell's [[dissociative identity disorder]]—and in [[David Beauchard|David&amp;nbsp;B.]]'s ''[[Epileptic (comics)|Epileptic]]'' (2003).{{sfn|Hatfield|2005|p=138}}

To cartoonist [[Jim Woodring]], Green's autobiographical work "has never been surpassed".{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=3}}  Woodring's own autobiographical work in ''[[Jim (comics)|Jim]]'' draws from his dreams rather than his waking life.{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=3}}  British-American cartoonist [[Gabrielle Bell]] sympathized with Brown's approach, which she described as "talking about his feelings or his emotional state when he was illustrating it with striking images that were sort of absurd or a weird juxtaposition".{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=5}}  Green's influence extended overseas to cartoonists such as the Dutch [[Peter Pontiac]], who drew inspiration from ''Binky Brown'' and ''Maus'' to produce ''Kraut'' (2000), about his father who [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated with the Nazis]] during World War&amp;nbsp;II.{{sfn|Rosenkrantz|2011|p=3}} 

The story ranked No.&amp;nbsp;9 on ''[[The Comics Journal]]''{{'}}s list of the best hundred English-language comics of the 20th century,{{sfn|Spurgeon|1999}} and featured as the cover artwork for the autobiographical comics issue  of the journal ''[[Biography (journal)|Biography]]'' (Vol.&amp;nbsp;31, No.&amp;nbsp;1).{{sfn|Witek|2011|p=227}}  Artwork to ''Binky Brown'' appeared in an exhibition of Green's work at Shake It Records in Cincinnati in 2009.{{sfn|Green|2010|p=58}}

{{Hinduism}}
{{Buddhism}}
[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] have common origins in the [[Ganges]] culture of northern India during the so-called [[History of India#"Second urbanisation" (c. 600 – c. 200 BCE)|"second urbanisation"]] around 500 BC.{{sfn|Samuels|2010}} They have shared parallel beliefs that have existed side by side, but also pronounced differences.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}} Page 18. "There is no evidence to show that Jainism and Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste. They are parallel or native religions of India and have contributed much to the growth of even classical Hinduism of the present times."&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism attained prominence in the Indian subcontinent as it was supported by royal courts, but started to decline after the [[Gupta period|Gupta era]] and [[Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent|virtually disappeared from India]] in the 11th century CE except in some pockets of India. It has continued to exist outside India and is the major religion in several Asian countries.

==Upanishads==

Certain Buddhist teachings appear to have been formulated in response to ideas presented in the early [[Upanishads]]&amp;nbsp;– in some cases concurring with them, and in other cases criticizing or re-interpreting them.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;Helmuth von Glasenapp, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130204142029/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/vonglasenapp/wheel002.html "Vedanta and Buddhism, A Comparative Study"] (1950)  ''1950 Proceedings of the Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"We may distinguish among Upanishads in terms of relative age. First are early, pre-Buddhist Upanishads (Chandogya, Brahadanyaka, Aitreya, Taittiriya, Kauitaki, and somewhat later Kena and Isa)." Fahlbusch et al. (2008) ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'': Volume 5: Si-Z p. 645,  Translated by Geoffrey William Bromiley,  Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing {{ISBN|0-8028-2417-X}}, 978-0-8028-2417-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Upanishads, the earliest philosophical texts of Hindus on Buddhism has been a subject of debate among scholars. While [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]], [[Hermann Oldenberg|Oldenberg]] and [[Karl Eugen Neumann|Neumann]] were convinced of Upanishadic influence on the Buddhist canon, [[Charles Eliot (diplomat)|Eliot]] and [[Edward J. Thomas|Thomas]] highlighted the points where Buddhism was opposed to Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pratt|first=James Bissett|title=The Pilgrimage of Buddhism and a Buddhist Pilgrimage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLXwU9e6D4sC&amp;pg=PA90|year=1996|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1196-2|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism may have been influenced by some Upanishadic ideas, it however discarded their orthodox tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Upadhyaya|first=Kashi Nath|title=Early Buddhism and the Bhagavadgītā|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBbznHuPrTYC&amp;pg=PA103|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0880-5|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist texts he is presented as rejecting avenues of salvation as "pernicious views".&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura (1990) ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy'': Part One. p.139, Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later schools of Indian religious thought were influenced by this interpretation and novel ideas of the Buddhist tradition of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew27039.htm K. N. Upadhaya (1968) "The Impact of Early Buddhism on Hindu Thought (with Special Reference to the Bhagavadgiitaa)"], ''Philosophy East and West''
 Vol.18 pp.163-173, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal support==

In later years, there is significant evidence that both Buddhism and Hinduism were supported by Indian rulers, regardless of the rulers' own religious identities. Buddhist kings continued to revere Hindu deities and teachers and many Buddhist temples were built under the patronage of Hindu rulers.&lt;ref&gt;January 2008, VOL. 213, #1&lt;/ref&gt; This was because Buddhism has never been considered an alien religion to that of Hinduism in India but as only one of the many strains of Hinduism. [[Kalidas|Kalidas']] work shows the ascension of Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Christopher. ''South Asia: An Environmental History''. ABC-CLIO 2008, page 35. "Through Kalidas' work we begin to see the ascension of Hinduism, taking the place of Buddhism as the dominant religion."&lt;/ref&gt; By the eighth century, [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] had replaced [[Buddha]] in [[pujas]] of royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Grace. 2005. ''Indian Sculpture.'' Roli Books. pg. 28. "By the end of the Gupta period Buddhism was no longer dominant, even in the north, where it had prevailed for so long."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inden, Ronald. "Ritual, Authority, And Cycle Time in Hindu Kingship." In JF Richards, ed., ''Kingship and Authority in South Asia''. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998, p.67, 55"before the eighth century, the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies through which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa....This pattern changed in the eighth century. The Buddha was replaced as the supreme, imperial deity by one of the Hindu gods (except under the Palas of eastern India, the Buddha's homeland)...Previously the Buddha had been accorded imperial-style worship (puja). Now as one of the Hindu gods replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system, the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''The Buddhist Visnu''. Columbia University Press, 2004, p.12,15 "The replacement of the Buddha as the "cosmic person" within the mythic ideology of Indian kingship, as we shall see shortly, occurred at about the same time the Buddha was incorporated and subordinated within the Brahmanical cult of Visnu."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==

===Basic vocabulary===
The Buddha approved many of the terms already used in philosophical discussions of his era; however, many of these terms carry a different meaning in the Buddhist tradition. For example, in the [[Samaññaphala Sutta]], the Buddha is depicted presenting a notion of the [http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=530 "three knowledges" (''tevijja'')]&amp;nbsp;– a term also used in the Vedic tradition to describe knowledge of the [[Veda]]s&amp;nbsp;– as being not texts, but things that he had experienced (these are not noble truths{{clarify|date=July 2014}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The true "three knowledges" are said to be constituted by the process of achieving enlightenment, which is what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of the night of his enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;"The brahmin by caste alone, the teacher of the ''Veda'', is (jokingly) etymologized as the 'non-meditator' (''ajhāyaka''). Brahmins who memorize the three ''Vedas'' (''tevijja'') really know nothing: it is the process of achieving Enlightenment—what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of that night—that constitutes the true 'three knowledges.' " R.F. Gombrich in Paul Williams, ed., "Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious studies." Taylor and Francis 2006, page 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karma====
[[Karma]] ([[Sanskrit]]: कर्म from the root kṛ, "to do") is a word meaning ''action'' or ''activity'' and often implies its subsequent '''results''' (also called karma-phala, "the fruits of action"). It is commonly understood as a term to denote the entire cycle of [[Causality|cause and effect]] as described in the philosophies of a number of cosmologies, including those of Buddhism and Hinduism.

Karma is a central part of Buddhist teachings. In Buddha's teaching, karma is a direct intentional&lt;ref&gt;Kamma A Study Guide by Thanissaro Bhikkhu http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/kamma.html&lt;/ref&gt; result of a person's word, thought and/or action in life. In pre-Buddhist Vedic culture, karma has to do with whether or not the ritualistic actions are correctly performed. Little emphasis is placed on moral conduct in the early Vedic conception.{{POV statement|date=July 2014}} In Buddhism, by contrast, a person's words, thoughts and/or actions form the basis for good and bad karma: [[Śīla|sila]] (moral conduct) goes hand in hand with the development of meditation and wisdom. Buddhist teachings carry a markedly different meaning from pre-Buddhist conceptions of karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gombrich|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dharma====
[[Dharma]] ([[Sanskrit]], [[Devanagari]]: धर्म or [[Pāli]] '''Dhamma''', Devanagari: धम्म) means '''Natural Law''', '''Reality''' or '''Duty''', and with respect to its significance for [[spirituality]] and [[religion]] might be considered '''the Way of the Higher Truths'''. A Hindu appellation for [[Hinduism]] itself is ''[[Sanātana Dharma]]'', which translates as "the eternal dharma." Similarly, [[Buddhadharma]] is an appellation for [[Buddhism]]. The general concept of dharma forms a basis for philosophies, beliefs and practices originating in [[India]]. The four main ones are [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] (Jaina Dharma), and [[Sikhism]] (Sikha Dharma), all of whom retain the centrality of dharma in their teachings. In these traditions, beings that live in harmony with dharma proceed more quickly toward, according to the tradition, [[Dharma Yukam]], [[Moksha]], or [[Nirvana]] (personal liberation). Dharma can refer generally to religious [[duty]], and also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue.

====Buddha====
The term "Buddha" too has appeared in Hindu scriptures before the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. In the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'', [[Daksha|sage Daksha]] calls Lord Shiva as Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;"''namah suddhaya buddhaya''"; P. 67 ''Cultural History From The Vayu Purana'' By Devendrakumar Rajaram Patil, Rajaram D. K. Patil&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar symbolism===
* '''[[Mudra]]''': This is a symbolic hand-gesture expressing an emotion. Images of the Buddha almost always depict him performing some [[mudra]].
* '''[[Dharma Chakra]]''': The [[Dharmacakra|Dharma Chakra]], which appears on the national flag of India and the flag of the Thai royal family, is a Buddhist symbol that is used by members of both religions.
* '''[[Rudraksha]]''': These are [[prayer beads|beads]] that devotees, usually monks, use for praying.
* '''[[Tilak]]''': Many Hindu devotees mark their heads with a [[tilak]], which is interpreted as a [[third eye]]. A similar mark is one of the characteristic [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].
* '''[[Swastika]]''' and '''[[Sauwastika]]''': both are sacred symbols. It can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise and both are seen in Hinduism and Buddhism. The Buddha is sometimes depicted with a sauwastika on his chest or the palms of his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg Buddha image] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321133243/http://img.search.com/0/0f/300px-Buddha_image_-_stone_-_with_disciple.jpg |date=March 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar practices===

====Mantra====
[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of [[Buddhist devotion|devotion]].]]
A '''[[mantra]]''' (मन्त्र) is a [[religion|religious]] [[syllable]] or [[poem]], typically from the [[Sanskrit]] language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as [[spiritual conduit]]s, words or vibrations that instill one-pointed [[Attention|concentration]] in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras existed in the [[historical Vedic religion]], [[Zoroastrianism]]&lt;ref&gt;http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/IsthereanysenseinchantingAvestaprayers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the Shramanic traditions, and thus they remain important in Buddhism and [[Jainism]] as well as other faiths of Indian origin such as [[Sikhism]].

====Yoga====
The practice of [[Yoga]] is intimately connected to the religious beliefs and practices of both Hinduism and Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;The Yoga Tradition: its literature, philosophy and practice By Georg Feuerstein. {{ISBN|81-208-1923-3}}. p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are distinct variations in the usage of yoga terminology in the two religions.

In Hinduism, the term "Yoga" commonly refers to the eight limbs of yoga as defined in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], written some time after 100 BCE, and means "yoke", with the idea that one's individual [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], or soul, would yoke or bind with the monistic entity that underlies everything ([[brahman]]). Yoga in Hinduism also known as being 'complex', based on yoking (integrating). Yoga defines a specific process: it has an emphasis on knowledge and practice, as well as being known to be 'mature' and difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|pages=1–20|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic meaning of this Sanskrit term is with technique. The technique of the different forms of yoga is what makes the practice meaningful. Yoga is not an easy or simple practice, viyoga is what is described as simple. Yoga is difficult in the fact of displaying the faith and meaning of Hinduism. Many Hindus tend to pick and choose between the five forms of yoga because of the way they live their life and how they want to practice it in the form they are most connected to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stratton Hawley|first=John|title=Yoga and Viyoga: Simple Religion in Hinduism|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=January 1981|volume=74|series=no. 1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1017/s0017816000028492}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 22, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism of Tibet, however, the  term "Yoga" is simply used to refer to any type of spiritual practice; from the various types of tantra (like [[Kriyayoga]] or [[Charyayoga]]) to '[[Deity yoga]]' and '[[guru yoga]]'. In the early translation phase of the [[Sutrayana]] and [[Tantrayana]] from India, China and other regions to Tibet, along with the practice lineages of [[sadhana]], codified in the [[Nyingmapa]] canon, the most subtle 'conveyance' (Sanskrit: [[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]) is [[Dzogchen|Adi Yoga]] (Sanskrit). A contemporary scholar with a focus on [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Robert Thurman]] writes that Patanjali was influenced by the success of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Thurman, "The Central Philosophy of Tibet.'' Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meditation====
There is a range of common terminology and common descriptions of the meditative states that are seen as the foundation of meditation practice in both Hindu Yoga and Buddhism. Many scholars have noted that the concepts of [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] and [[samādhi]] - technical terms describing stages of meditative absorption&amp;nbsp;– are common to meditative practices in both Hinduism and Buddhism. Most notable in this context is the relationship between the system of four Buddhist ''dhyana'' states ([[Pali]]: [[Jhana in Theravada|''jhana'']]) and the ''samprajnata samadhi'' states of Classical Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Samadhi: The Numinous and Cessative in Indo-Tibetan Yoga By Stuart Ray Sarbacker. {{ISBN|0-7914-6553-5}}. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many (Tibetan) Vajrayana practices of the [[generation stage]] and [[completion stage]] work with the [[chakras]], inner energy channels ([[nadi (yoga)|nadis]]) and [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], called [[tummo]] in Tibetan.

==Differences==
Despite the similarities in terminology there exist differences between the two religions. There is no evidence to show that Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}} Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major differences are mentioned below.
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}

===God===
[[Gautama Buddha]] was very ambiguous about the existence of a Creator Deity [[Brahman]] and Eternal Self [[Ātman (Buddhism)|Atman]] and rejected them both. Various sources from the Pali Cannon and others suggest that the Buddha taught that belief in a Creator deity was not essential to attaining liberation from suffering, and perhaps chose to ignore theological questions because they were "fascinating to discuss," and frequently brought about more conflict and anger than peace.  The Buddha did not deny the existence of the  popular gods of the Vedic pantheon, but rather argued that these [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s, who may be in a more exalted state than humans, are still nevertheless trapped in the same samsaric cycle of suffering as other beings and are not necessarily worthy of veneration and worship. The focus of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], while inheriting many practices and ideologies from the previous Hindu yogic tradition, deviates from the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and earlier works of the [[Dharmic Religions]] in that liberation ([[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]]) is not attained via unity with Brahman (the Godhead), Self-realization or worship. Rather, the Buddha's teaching centers around what [[Eknath Easwaran]] described as a "psychology of desire," that is attaining liberation from suffering by extermination of self-will, selfish desire and passions. This is not to say that such teachings are absent from the previous Hindu tradition, rather they are singled out and separated from Vedic Theology.

According to [[Buddhology|Buddhologist]] [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard Hayes]], the early Buddhist [[Nikaya]] literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god "primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view". In these texts the [[Buddha]] is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 5-6, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the ''Devadaha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, "while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God."&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha (as portrayed in the Pali scriptures, the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|agamas]]) set an important trend in [[Nontheistic#Nontheism in Buddhism|nontheism in Buddhism]] by establishing a somewhat non-theistic view on the notion of an omnipotent God, generally ignoring the issue as being irrelevant to his teachings.&lt;ref name="gunasekara"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |work=Statement made to a Multi-religious Seminar |author=Dr V. A. Gunasekara |url=http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |accessdate=2007-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408180218/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |archivedate=2007-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in many passages in the [[Tripitaka]] gods ([[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] in Sanskrit) are mentioned and specific examples are given of individuals who were reborn as a god, or gods who were reborn as humans. [[Buddhist cosmology]] recognizes various levels and types of gods, but none of these gods is considered the creator of the world or of the human race.&lt;ref name="gunasekara"/&gt;

# Buddha preaches that attachment with people was the cause of sorrow when 'death' happens and therefore proposes detachment from people. Hinduism though proposes detachment from fruits of action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/3/verse/19|title=Chapter 3, Verse 19 – Bhagavad Gita, The Song of God – Swami Mukundananda|last=Mukundananda|first=Swami|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stresses on performance of duty or ''dharma'', it is not solely focused on it. In Hinduism, Lord Shiva explains 'death' to be journey of the immortal soul in pursuit of 'Moksha' and therefore a fact of life.
# While Buddhism says retirement into forest was open to everyone regardless of caste, and although according to the vinaya (the code of conduct for the Sangha) it is not possible to take ordination as a Buddhist mendicant (a Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni) under the age of 20 or adulthood, this is still viewed as escapism by Hinduism. Pre-Buddhist, non-brahman forest mendicants are criticised in the earliest group of Upanishads. Hinduism allows for this to happen only after performing all ''dharmas'' or duties of one's life, starting from studying scriptures, working to support children and family and taking care of aged parents and lastly after all the dharma done retire to the forest and slowly meditate, fast and perform rituals and austerities (tapas), until physical disintegration &amp; to reach the ultimate truth or ''Brahman''. Buddhism by contrast emphasises realisation by the middle way (avoiding extremes of luxury or austerities), seeing limited value in the rituals and tapas and the danger of their mis-application.
# Buddhism explained that attachment is the cause of sorrow in society. Therefore, Buddhism's cure for sorrow was detachment and non-involvement (non-action or negative action). Hinduism on the other hand explained that both sorrow or happiness is due to 'Karma' or past actions and bad karma can be overcome and good karma can be obtained by following dharma or righteous duty (pro-action or positive action) which will ultimately provide 'Moksha' i.e. overcoming the cycle of life and joining ''Brahman''.

Buddhist canonical views about God and the priests are:

{{quote|13. Well then, Vasettha, those ancient sages versed in ancient scriptures, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose, ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the priests of today chant over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited-to wit, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu [11]&amp;nbsp;– did even they speak thus, saying: "We know it, we have seen it", where the creator is whence the creator is?}}

Scholar-monk [[Walpola Rahula]] writes that man depends on God "for his own protection, safety, and security, just as a child depends on his parent." He describes this as a product of "ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire," and writes that this "deeply and fanatically held belief" for man's consolation is "false and empty" from the perspective of Buddhism. He writes that man does not wish to hear or understand teachings against this belief, and that the Buddha described his teachings as "against the current" for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that for self-protection man created God and for self-preservation man created "soul".&lt;ref&gt;''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later Mahayana literature, however, the idea of an eternal, all-pervading, all-knowing, immaculate, uncreated and deathless Ground of Being (the dharmadhatu, inherently linked to the sattvadhatu, the realm of beings), which is the Awakened Mind (bodhicitta) or Dharmakaya ("body of Truth") of the Buddha himself, is attributed to the Buddha in a number of Mahayana sutras, and is found in various tantras as well. In some Mahayana texts, such a principle is occasionally presented as manifesting in a more personalised form as a primordial buddha, such as Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vairochana, Amitabha and Adi-Buddha, among others.

===Rites and rituals===
In later tradition such as Mahayana Buddhism in Japan, the [[Shingon]] Fire Ritual (Homa /Yagna) and Urabon (Sanskrit: Ullambana) derives from Hindu traditions.&lt;ref&gt;R.K. Payne: The Tantric Ritual of Japan. Feeding the Gods: the Shingon Fire Ritual., and Koenraad Elst: Who is a Hindu? 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rituals are common in Tibetan Buddhism. Both Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism share common rites, such as the purification rite of Homa (Havan, Yagna in Sanskrit), prayers for the ancestors and deceased (Ullambana in Sanskrit, Urabon in Japanese).

===Caste===
The Buddha repudiated the caste distinctions of the Brahmanical religion,&lt;ref name="ccbs.ntu.edu.tw"&gt;K.N. Upadhaya, ''The Impact of Early Buddhism on Hindu Thought.'' Philosophy East and West Vol.18(1968) pp.163-173, accessed at http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew27039.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; by offering ordination to all regardless of caste.&lt;ref&gt;Mrozik, Susanne. "Upali" in McMillian Encyclopedia of Buddhism, pg. 870. "All account emphasize that caste has no bearing on a person's status in the monastic community."&lt;/ref&gt;

While the caste system constitutes an assumed background to the stories told in Buddhist scriptures, the sutras do not attempt to justify or explain the system.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Richard S. "India" in McMillian Encyclopedia of Buddhism, p. 358. "Though Buddhist texts take the existence of "caste" for granted, they attempt neither to justify the social system, nor to disseminate it."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Aggañña Sutta]], Buddha elaborates that if any of the caste does the following deeds: killing, taking anything which is not given, take part in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking rough words or nonsense, greedy, cruel, and practice wrong beliefs; people would still see that they do negative deeds and therefore are not worthy or deserving respect. They will even get into trouble from their own deeds, whatever their caste (Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa, and Sudda) might be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Long Discourses of the Buddha|first = Maurice|last = Walshe|page = 216|publisher = Wisdom Publications Inc|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology and worldview===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
{{Main article|Buddhist Cosmology}}
In [[Buddhist cosmology]], there are 31 planes of existence within samsara.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.in"&gt;Page 14, The Emergence of Buddhism: Classical Traditions in Contemporary Perspective, By Jacob N. Kinnard, Published by Fortress [https://books.google.com/books?id=xIzyZ7Nvs7cC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=buddhist+cosmology+31+realms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gDMJUIvZCfGviQe84unrCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20cosmology%2031%20realms&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Beings in these realms are subject to rebirth after some period of time, except for realms of the Non-Returners. Therefore, most of these places are not the goal of the holy life in the Buddha's dispensation. Buddhas are beyond all these 31 planes of existence after parinibbana. Hindu texts mostly mentions the devas in Kamma Loka. Only the Hindu god Brahma can be found in the Rupa loka. There are many realms above Brahma realm that are accessible through meditation. Those in Brahma realm are also subject to rebirth according to the Buddha.

===Practices===

To have an idea of the differences between Buddhism and pre-existing beliefs and practices during this time, we can look into the [[Samaññaphala Sutta]] in the [[Digha Nikaya]] of the [[Pali Canon]]. In this sutra, a king of Magadha listed the teachings from many prominent and famous spiritual teachers around during that time. He also asked the [[Buddha]] about his teaching when visiting him. The Buddha told the king about the practices of his spiritual path.  The list of various practices he taught disciples as well as practices he doesn't encourage are listed. The text, rather than stating what the new faith was, emphasized what the new faith was not.  Contemporaneous religious traditions were caricatured and then negated. Though critical of prevailing religious practices and social institutions on philosophical grounds, early Buddhist texts exhibit a reactionary anxiety at having to compete in religiously plural societies. Below are a few examples found in the sutra:

{{quote|Whereas some priests and contemplatives... are addicted to high and luxurious furnishings such as these&amp;nbsp;— over-sized couches, couches adorned with carved animals, long-haired coverlets, multi-colored patchwork coverlets, white woolen coverlets, woolen coverlets embroidered with flowers or animal figures, stuffed quilts, coverlets with fringe, silk coverlets embroidered with gems; large woolen carpets; elephant, horse, and chariot rugs, antelope-hide rugs, deer-hide rugs; couches with awnings, couches with red cushions for the head and feet&amp;nbsp;— he  (a bhikkhu disciple of the Buddha)  abstains from using high and luxurious furnishings such as these.

===Meditation===
{{Main article|Dhyana in Buddhism}}
{{See also|Jhāna#Historical development}}

According to the [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.036.than.html Maha-Saccaka Sutta], the Buddha recalled a meditative state he entered by chance as a child and abandoned the  ascetic practices he has been doing:

{{quote|I thought, "I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, then&amp;nbsp;— quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities&amp;nbsp;— I entered &amp; remained in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. Could that be the path to Awakening?" Then following on that memory came the realization: "That is the path to Awakening."|&lt;ref name="Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995"/&gt;}}

According to the Upakkilesa Sutta, after figuring out the cause of the various obstacles and overcoming them, the Buddha was able to penetrate the sign and enters 1st- 4th Jhana.

{{quote|I also saw both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, "What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?”

Then consider the following: "The question arose in me and because of doubt my concentration fell, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I act so that the question does not arise in me again.”

I remained diligent, ardent, perceived both the light and the vision of forms. Shortly after the vision of light and shapes disappear. I thought, "What is the cause and condition in which light and vision of the forms disappear?”

Then consider the following: “Inattention arose in me because of inattention and my concentration has decreased, when my concentration fell, the light disappeared and the vision of forms. I must act in such a way that neither doubt nor disregard arise in me again.”}}

In the same way as above, the Buddha encountered many more obstacles that caused the light to disappear  and found his way out of them. These include sloth and torpor, fear, elation, inertia, excessive energy, energy deficient, desire, perception of diversity, and excessive meditation on the ways. Finally, he was able to penetrate the light and entered jhana.

The following descriptions in the Upakkilesa Sutta further show how he find his way into the first four Jhanas, which he later considered [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|''samma samadhi'']].

{{quote|When Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind. When I realized that inattention ... sloth and torpor ... fear ... elation ... inertia ... excessive energy ... deficient energy ... desire ... perception of diversity ... excessive meditation on the ways, I abandoned excessive meditation on the ways, an imperfection of the mind.

When Anuruddha, I realized that doubt is an imperfection of the mind, I dropped out of doubt, an imperfection of the mind. When I realized that inattention ... sloth and torpor ... fear ... elation ... inertia ... excessive energy ... deficient energy... desire ... perception of diversity ... excessive meditation on the ways, I abandoned excessive meditation on the ways, an imperfection of the mind, so I thought, ‘I abandoned these imperfections of the mind. ‘ Now the concentration will develop in three ways. ..And so, Anuruddha, develop concentration with directed thought and sustained thought; developed concentration without directed thought, but only with the sustained thought; developed concentration without directed thought and without thought sustained, developed with the concentration ecstasy; developed concentration without ecstasy; develop concentration accompanied by happiness, developing concentration accompanied by equanimity...When Anuruddha, I developed concentration with directed thought and sustained thought to the development ... when the concentration accompanied by fairness, knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My release is unshakable, this is my last birth, now there are no more likely to be any condition.|&lt;ref name="Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995"/&gt;}}

According to the early scriptures, the Buddha learned the two formless attainments from two teachers, Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta respectively, prior to his enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135"&gt;Steven Sutcliffe, ''Religion: Empirical Studies.'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; It is most likely that they belonged to the Brahmanical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, page xi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he realized that neither "Dimension of Nothingness" nor "Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception" lead to Nirvana and left. The Buddha said in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta:

{{quote|But the thought occurred to me, "This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception." So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.|&lt;ref name="Nanamoli, Bhikkhu 1995"&gt;Nanamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.) (1995, ed. Bhikkhu Bodhi). The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-072-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cessation of feelings and perceptions

The Buddha himself discovered an attainment beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the "cessation of feelings and perceptions". This is sometimes called the "ninth ''jhāna''" in commentarial and scholarly literature.&lt;ref name="Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandima Wijebandara, ''Early Buddhism, Its Religious and Intellectual Milieu.'' Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Kelaniya, 1993, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the "Dimension of Nothingness" and the "Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Noble Path number eight is "Samma Samadhi" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered "Right Concentration". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the "Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions" rather than stopping short at the "Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception".

In the Magga-vibhanga Sutta, the Buddha defines Right Concentration that belongs to the concentration (samadhi)  division of the path as the first four Jhanas:

{{quote|And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk&amp;nbsp;— quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities&amp;nbsp;— enters &amp; remains in the first Jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the Second Jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation&amp;nbsp;— internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the Third Jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain&amp;nbsp;— as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress&amp;nbsp;— he enters &amp; remains in the Fourth Jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration.|&lt;ref name="Bodhi, Bhikkhu 2000"&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Buddha did not reject the formless attainments in and of themselves, but instead the doctrines of his teachers as a whole, as they did not lead to ''[[nibbana]]''. He then underwent harsh ascetic practices that he eventually also became disillusioned with. He subsequently remembered entering ''jhāna'' as a child, and realized that, "That indeed is the path to enlightenment."

In the ''suttas'', the immaterial attainments are never referred to as ''jhānas''. The immaterial attainments have more to do with expanding, while the Jhanas (1-4) focus on  concentration. A common translation for the term "samadhi" is concentration. Rhys Davids and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term ” samadhi” is not found in any pre-buddhist text. Hindu texts later used that term to indicate the state of enlightenment. This is not  in conformity with Buddhist usage. In ''The Long Discourse of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya'' (pg. 1700) Maurice Walshe wrote,

{{quote|Rhys Davids also states that the term samadhi is not found in any pre-Buddhist text. To his remarks on the subject should be added that its subsequent use in Hindu texts to denote the state of enlightenment is not in conformity with Buddhist usage, where the basic meaning of concentration is expanded to cover "meditation" in general.|&lt;ref name="Walshe, Maurice 1995"/&gt;}}

[[Meditation]] was an aspect of the practice of the [[yogi]]s in the centuries preceding the Buddha. The Buddha built upon the yogis' concern with introspection and developed their meditative techniques, but rejected their theories of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha.'' Taken from ''Founders of Faith'', published by Oxford University Press, 1986, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, [[mindfulness (Buddhism)|sati]] and [[sampajanna]] are to be developed at all times, in pre-Buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction. A yogi in the Brahmanical tradition is not to practice while defecating, for example, while a Buddhist monastic should do so.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The origin of Buddhist meditation.'' Routledge, 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another new teaching of the Buddha was that [[jhana|meditative absorption]] must be combined with a liberating cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The origin of Buddhist meditation.'' Routledge, 2007, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious knowledge or "vision" was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside the Buddhist fold. According to the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'' this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of 'meditation' (Sanskrit: [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]) coupled with the perfection of 'ethics' (Sanskrit: [[śīla]]). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of "religious insight" (Sanskrit: [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]) was original.&lt;ref name="westernbuddhistreview.com"&gt;Dharmacarini Manishini, ''Western Buddhist Review.'' Accessed at {{cite web|url=http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/kamma_in_context.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808043640/http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/kamma_in_context.html |archivedate=2013-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist texts are probably the earliest describing meditation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; They describe meditative practices and states that existed before the Buddha, as well as those first developed within Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Bronkhorst]], ''The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India.'' Franz Steiner Verlag Weisbaden GmbH, pages 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Upanishads written after the rise of Buddhism do contain full-fledged descriptions of [[yoga]] as a means to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA199,M1 page 199].&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no convincing evidence for meditation in pre-Buddhist early Brahminic texts, Wynne argues that formless meditation originated in the Brahminic or Shramanic tradition, based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in the early Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="Alexander Wynne 2007, page 51"&gt;Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions less likely possibilities as well.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Having argued that the cosmological statements in the Upanishads also reflect a contemplative tradition, he argues that the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] contains evidence for a contemplative tradition, even as early as the late Rg Vedic period.&lt;ref name="Alexander Wynne 2007, page 51"/&gt;

===Vedas===
[[Buddhism]] does not deny that the [[Vedas]] in their true original were sacred although it maintains that the Vedas have been amended repeatedly by certain Brahmins to secure their positions in society. The Buddha declared that the Veda in its true form was declared by [[Kashyapa]] to certain rishis, who by severe penances had acquired the power to see by divine eyes.&lt;ref&gt;P. 177 ''The sacred books of the Buddhists compared with history and modern science'' By Robert Spence Hardy&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddhist [[Vinaya Pitaka]] of the ''Mahavagga'' (I.245)&lt;ref&gt;P. 494 ''The Pali-English dictionary'' By Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede&lt;/ref&gt; section the Buddha names these rishis. The names of the Vedic rishis were "Atthako, Vâmako, Vâmadevo, [[Vishvamitra|Vessâmitto]], [[Jamadagni|Yamataggi]], [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]]o, [[Bharadvaja|Bhâradvâjo]], [[Vasistha|Vâsettho]], [[Kashyapa|Kassapo]], and [[Bhrigu|Bhagu]]"&lt;ref&gt;P. 245 ''The Vinaya piṭakaṃ: one of the principle Buddhist holy scriptures ..., Volume 1'' edited by Hermann Oldenberg&lt;/ref&gt; but that it was altered by a few Brahmins who introduced animal sacrifices. The Vinaya Pitaka's section ''Anguttara Nikaya: Panchaka Nipata'' says that it was on this alteration of the true Veda that the Buddha refused to pay respect to the Vedas of his time.&lt;ref&gt;P. 44 ''The legends and theories of the Buddhists, compared with history and science'' By Robert Spence Hardy&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist text [[Mahamayuri|Mahamayuri Tantra]], written during 1-3rd century CE,   mentions deities thrughout [[Jambudvipa]] (modern [[India]], [[Pakistan]], Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and invokes them for the protection of the Buddhadharma. It also mentions a large number of Vedic rishis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mahamayurividyarajni.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/mahamayuri/ Translated into English by Cheng Yew Chung based on Amoghavajra’s Chinese Translation (Taisho Volume 19, Number 982) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

The Buddha is recorded in the Canki Sutta ([[Majjhima Nikaya]] 95) as saying to a group of Brahmins:
{{quote|O Vasettha, those priests who know the scriptures are just like a line of blind men tied together where the first sees nothing, the middle man nothing, and the last sees nothing.}}
In the same discourse, he says:
{{quote|It is not proper for a wise man who maintains truth to come to the conclusion: This alone is Truth, and everything else is false.}}
He is also recorded as saying:
{{quote|To be attached to one thing (to a certain view) and to look down upon other things (views) as inferior&amp;nbsp;– this the wise men call a fetter.}}

[[Walpola Rahula]] writes, "It is always a question of knowing and seeing, and not that of believing. The teaching of the Buddha is qualified as ''ehi-passika,'' inviting you to 'come and see,' but not to come and believe... It is always seeing through knowledge or wisdom, and not believing through [[faith|faith in Buddhism]]."&lt;ref&gt;This whole section is largely verbatim quotes from Rahula's ''What the Buddha Taught,'' pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hinduism, philosophies are classified either as [[Astika]] or [[Nastika]], that is, philosophies that either affirm or reject the authorities of the Vedas. According to this tradition, Buddhism is a [[Nastika]] school since it rejects the authority of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Broughton, Jeffrey L. | title=The Bodhidharma Anthology: The Earliest Records of Zen |  location=Berkeley | publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-520-21972-4}} p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhists on the whole called those who did not believe in Buddhism the "outer path-farers" (''tiirthika'').&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura, ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: Part One.'' Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion===
Since the Hindu scriptures are essentially silent on the issue of [[religious conversion]], the issue of whether Hindus [[evangelization|evangelize]] is open to interpretations.&lt;ref name="conversion"&gt;[http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/hbh/hbh_ch-5.html "Does Hinduism Accept Newcomers?"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who view [[Hinduism]] as an [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] more than as a religion tend to believe that to be a Hindu, one must be born a Hindu.  However, those who see Hinduism primarily as a philosophy, a set of beliefs, or a way of life generally believe that one can convert to Hinduism by incorporating Hindu beliefs into one's life and by considering oneself a Hindu.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; The Supreme Court of India has taken the latter view, holding that the question of whether a person is a Hindu should be determined by the person's belief system, not by their ethnic or racial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;''Brahmachari Siddheshwar Shai v. State of West Bengal'' (Supreme Court of India), ''available at'' [http://www.hinduismtoday.com/in-depth_issues/RKMission.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030015441/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/in-depth_issues/RKMission.html |date=October 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism spread throughout Asia via evangelism and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Dutt, Nalinaksha. Early History Of The Spread Of Buddhism And The Buddhist Schools. Cosmo Publications, 2005. P. 72-78. {{ISBN|81-307-0092-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist scriptures depict such conversions in the form of lay followers declaring their support for the Buddha and his teachings, or via ordination as a Buddhist monk. Buddhist identity has been broadly defined as one who "takes [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]]" in the Buddha, Dharma, and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], echoing a formula seen in Buddhist texts. In some communities, formal conversion rituals are observed. No specific ethnicity has typically been associated with Buddhism, and as it spread beyond its origin in India immigrant monastics were replaced with newly ordained members of the local ethnic or tribal group.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, W. W. The Indian Empire: Its People, History, and Products. Routledge, 2000. P. 149. {{ISBN|0-415-24495-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soteriology===
Upanishadic soteriology is focused on the static Self, while the Buddha's is focused on dynamic agency. In the former paradigm, change and movement are an illusion; to realize the Self as the only reality is to realize something that has always been the case. In the Buddha's system by contrast, one has to make things happen.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire metaphor used in the [[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]] (which is also used elsewhere) is a radical way of making the point that the liberated sage is beyond phenomenal experience. It also makes the additional point that this indefinable, transcendent state is the sage's state even during life. This idea goes against the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the permanent realization at death of a [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|nondual meditative state]] anticipated in life. In fact, old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept ("becoming cool", "going out") were given a new meaning by the Buddha; their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life.&lt;ref name="Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109"&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha taught that these meditative states alone do not offer a decisive and permanent end to suffering either during life or after death.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, page 36. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that achieving a formless attainment with no further practice would only lead to temporary rebirth in a formless realm after death.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he gave a pragmatic refutation of early Brahminical theories according to which the meditator, the meditative state, and the proposed uncaused, unborn, unanalyzable Self, are identical.&lt;ref name="Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41–42"&gt;Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha,'' 1983, pp. 41–42. Found in ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; These theories are undergirded by the Upanishadic correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, from which perspective it is not surprising that meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha, in contrast, argued that states of consciousness come about caused and conditioned by the yogi's training and techniques, and therefore no state of consciousness could be this eternal Self.&lt;ref name="Michael Carrithers 1983, pp. 41–42"/&gt;

====Nonduality====
Both the Buddha's conception of the liberated person and the goal of early Brahminic yoga can be characterized as nondual, but in different ways. The nondual goal in early [[Brahminism]] was conceived in [[ontology|ontological]] terms; the goal was that into which one merges after death. According to Wynne, liberation for the Buddha "... is nondual in another, more radical, sense. This is made clear in the dialogue with Upasiva, where the liberated sage is defined as someone who has passed beyond conceptual dualities. Concepts that might have some meaning in ordinary discourse, such as consciousness or the lack of it, existence and non-existence, etc., do not apply to the sage. For the Buddha, propositions are not applicable to the liberated person, because language and concepts ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1076: ''vaadapathaa'', ''dhammaa''), as well as any sort of intellectual reckoning (''sankhaa'') do not apply to the liberated sage.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne 2007, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nirvana====
''[[Nirvana]]'' (or Nibbana in Pali language) means literally 'blowing out' or 'quenching'. The term is  pre-Buddhist, but its etymology is not essentially conclusive for finding out its exact meaning as the highest goal of early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HP9O6OM4iOgC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=its+etymology+is+not+necessarily+conclusive+for+determining+its+exact+meaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieiuO9yMrWAhWBLI8KHV4PAM8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=its%20etymology%20is%20not%20necessarily%20conclusive%20for%20determining%20its%20exact%20meaning&amp;f=false Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy], Edward Craig, 1. Origins and etymology of the word Nirvana, p. 9, Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, {{ISBN|0-415-07310-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-07310-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be kept in mind that nirvana is one of many terms for salvation that occur in the orthodox Buddhist scriptures. Other terms that appear are 'Vimokha', or 'Vimutti', implying 'salvation' and 'deliverance' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Buddhism: The early Buddhist schools and doctrinal history ; Theravāda doctrine.'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Some more words synonymously used for [[nirvana]]  in Buddhist scriptures are 'mokkha/[[moksha]]', meaning 'liberation' and 'kevala/kaivalya', meaning 'wholeness'; these words were given a new Buddhist meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mxpFwcAplaAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=A+common+error+in+examining+the+concept+such+as+nirvana] ''" A common error in examining the concept such as nirvana is to focus too much on the exact denotation of the term at the expense of its wider associations and context, not taking into the account number of synonyms frequently used to describe it. A specific example might be that nirvana is 'amrta', or the deathlessness, but it is important that this refers to the nectar that confers immortality upon gods. In the Buddhist context it refers to a condition in which there is no death, though it is clearly intended to have the positive associations of Indian myth."'' Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edward Craig, 6. Synonyms for Nirvana ,p. 11, Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, {{ISBN|0-415-07310-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-07310-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Nirvana]] has been also found among other religions such as Hinduism, [[Jainism]],&lt;ref&gt;On World Religions: Diversity, Not Dissension, p. 78, Anindita N. Balslev, SAGE Publications&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikhism And Indian Civilization  By R.K.

==Early Buddhism and early Vedanta==
[[Pali Canon|Early Buddhist scriptures]] do not mention schools of learning directly connected with the Upanishads. Though the earliest Upanishads had been completed by the Buddha's time, they are not cited in the early Buddhist texts as Upanishads or Vedanta. For the early Buddhists they were likely not thought of as having any outstanding significance in and of themselves, and as simply one section of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hajime Nakamura]], ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: Part One.'' Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990, pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist texts do describe wandering, mendicant Brahmins who appear to have valued the early Upanishads' promotion of this lifestyle as opposed to living the life of the householder and accruing wealth from nobles in exchange for performing Vedic sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura, ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: Part One.'' Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990, pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the early Buddhist texts mention ideas similar to those expounded in the early Upanishads, before controverting them.&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura, ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: Part One.'' Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1990, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahman===
The old Upanishads largely consider [[Brahman]] (masculine gender, Brahmā in the nominative case, henceforth "Brahmā") to be a personal god, and [[Brahman]] (neuter gender, [[Brahma]] in the nominative case, henceforth "Brahman") to be the impersonal world principle.&lt;ref name="Hajime Nakamura 1990, page 136"&gt;[[Hajime Nakamura]] (1989), ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: Part One'', [[Delhi]]: [[Motilal Banarsidass]], 1990 (Reprint), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; They do not strictly distinguish between the two, however.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]] (1975), ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', The University Press of Hawaii, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The old Upanishads ascribe these characteristics to Brahmā: first, he has light and luster as his marks; second, he is invisible; third, he is unknowable, and it is impossible to know his nature; fourth, he is omniscient. The old Upanishads ascribe these characteristics to Brahman as well.&lt;ref name="Hajime Nakamura 1990, page 136"/&gt;

[[File:Mahakala in the Form of a Brahman - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''[[Mahākāla]] in the Form of a Brahmān'', [[17th century]], [[Tibetan art|Tibetan painting on cloth]], [[Rubin Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]
In the Buddhist texts, there are many [[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahmās]]. There they form a class of superhuman beings, and rebirth into the realm of Brahmās is possible by pursuing Buddhist practices.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html]. See note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli scriptures]], the neuter Brahman does not appear (though the word ''brahma'' is standardly used in compound words to mean "best", or "supreme"&lt;ref&gt;Steven Collins (2000), ''Aggañña sutta'', Sahitya Akademi, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey (1995), ''The Selfless Mind'', Curzon Press, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;), however ideas are mentioned as held by various Brahmins in connection with Brahmā that match exactly with the concept of Brahman in the Upanishads. Brahmins who appear in the Tevijja-suttanta of the [[Digha Nikaya]] regard "union with Brahmā" as liberation, and earnestly seek it. In that text, Brahmins of the time are reported to assert: "Truly every Brahmin versed in the three Vedas has said thus: 'We shall expound the path for the sake of union with that which we do not know and do not see. This is the correct path. This path is the truth, and leads to liberation. If one practices it, he shall be able to enter into association with Brahmā." The early Upanishads frequently expound "association with Brahmā", and "that which we do not know and do not see" matches exactly with the early Upanishadic Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura, ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: Part One.'' Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass, 1990, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Upanishad, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], which came to be referred to as Brahman, is referred to as "the imperishable".&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1994), ''The Yogi and the Mystic: Studies in Indian and Comparative Mysticism'', Routledge, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pāli scriptures present a "pernicious view" that is set up as an absolute principle corresponding to Brahman: "O Bhikkhus! At that time Baka, the Brahmā, produced the following pernicious view: 'It is permanent. It is eternal. It is always existent. It is independent existence. It has the dharma of non-perishing. Truly it is not born, does not become old, does not die, does not disappear, and is not born again. Furthermore, no liberation superior to it exists elsewhere." The principle expounded here corresponds to the concept of Brahman laid out in the Upanishads. According to this text the Buddha criticized this notion: "Truly the Baka Brahmā is covered with unwisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura, ''A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: Part One'', Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass, 1990, pp. 137–138. "It has the dharma of non-perishing" is Nakamura's translation of "acavanadhammam".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gautama Buddha]] confined himself to what is empirically given.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]] (1975), ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism'', The University Press of Hawaii, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins (2000), ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change'', [[Harvard University Press]], p. 202. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA202,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.K. Warder]] (1998), ''A Course in Indian Philosophy'', Second edition published by Motilal Banarsidass, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This empiricism is based broadly on both ordinary sense experience and extrasensory perception enabled by high degrees of mental [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|concentration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]] (1977), ''Buddhist philosophy: A Historical Analysis'', Published by University of Hawaii Press, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ātman===
[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means 'self'. A major departure from Hindu and Jain philosophy is the Buddhist rejection of a permanent, self-existent soul (Ātman) in favour of [[anicca]] or impermanence.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], especially in the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hinduism]], Ātman is the [[first principle]],&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A. S. The Philosophy of the Upanishads. Cosimo Classics (June 1, 2010). P. 86. {{ISBN|1616402407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''true'' self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. [[Yajnavalkya]] (c. 9th century BCE), in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], uses the word to indicate that in which everything exists, which is of the highest value, which permeates everything, which is the essence of all, bliss and beyond description.&lt;ref&gt;Raju, Poolla Tirupati. Structural Depths of Indian Thought. SUNY Series in Philosophy. P. 26. {{ISBN|0-88706-139-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While, older Upanishads such as the Brihadaranyaka, mention several times that the Self is described as ''[[Neti neti]] or not this&amp;nbsp;– not this'',&lt;ref&gt;Swami Prabhavananda, The Upanishads: Breath of the Eternal, {{cite web|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/up_brihadaranyaka_upanishad_text.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402225915/http://www.atmajyoti.org/up_brihadaranyaka_upanishad_text.asp |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upanishads post [[Buddhism]], like the [[Maitri Upanishad]], define Ātman as only the defiled individual self, rather than the universal self.&lt;ref name="page34"&gt;Peter Harvey, The Selfless Mind. Curzon Press, 1995, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] defines Ātman or the [[Self]] as consisting of five [[kosha|sheaths]] (kosha): the bodily self consisting of the essence of food (annamaya kosha), the vital breath (pranamaya kosha), the mind or will (manomaya kosha), the intellect or capacity to know (vijnanamaya kosha) and bliss ([[anandamaya kosha]]).&lt;ref&gt;DasGupta, Surendranath. A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1.  Cambridge University Press. P. 46. {{ISBN|9780521116299}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge or realization of the Ātman is seen as essential to attain salvation ([[Moksha|liberation]]):
{{Quote|If atman is brahman in a pot (the body), then one need merely break the pot to fully realize the primordial unity of the individual soul with the plenitude of Being that was the Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=David Gordon White|year=1998|title=The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=18|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Alchemical-Body-Traditions-Medieval/dp/0226894991|isbn=978-0226894997|accessdate=June 15, 2015}} NOTE: Similar identification also made in the Hathayogapradipika (4.50)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schools of [[Indian philosophy]], such as [[Advaita]] (non-dualism) see Ātman within each living entity as being fully identical with [[Brahman]]&amp;nbsp;– the Principle, whereas other schools such as [[Dvaita]] (dualism) differentiate between the individual atma in living beings, and the Supreme atma ([[Paramatma]]) as being at least partially separate beings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavata Purana]]   [http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en 3.28.41] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=February 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Advaita]], [[Samkhya]] holds blissfullness of Ātman as merely figurative. However, both Samkhya and Advaita consider the ego (asmita, [[ahamkara]]) rather than the Ātman to be the cause of pleasure and pain.&lt;ref&gt;Paranjpe, A. C. Self and Identity in Modern Psychology and Indian Thought. Springer; 1 edition (September 30, 1998). P. 263-264. {{ISBN|978-0-306-45844-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Advaitic text [[Vidyaranya#Pañcadaśī|Pañcadaśī]] classifies the degrees of Ātman under three headings: Gauna or secondary (anything other than the personality that an individual identifies with), Mithya or false (bodily personality) and Mukhya or primary (the real Self).&lt;ref&gt;Krishnananda, (Swami). The Philosophy of the Panchadasi. The Divine Life Society. Rishikesh. P. 166-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Ātman was rejected by the Buddha. Terms like [[anatta|anatman]] (not-self) and [[shunyata]] (voidness) are at the core of all Buddhist traditions. The permanent transcendence of the belief in the separate existence of the self is integral to the enlightenment of an [[Arhat]]. The Buddha criticized conceiving theories even of a unitary soul or identity immanent in all things as unskillful.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''The Not-Self Strategy.'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/notself.html]. For the sutta see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the Buddha's statement in Khandha Samyutta 47, all thoughts about self are necessarily, whether the thinker is aware of it or not, thoughts about the five [[skandhas|aggregates]] or one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nanavira Thera]], ''Nibbana and Anatta.'' [http://www.nanavira.org/]. Early Writings -&gt; Nibbana and Anatta -&gt; Nibbana, Atta, and Anatta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the rejection of Ātman by Buddhists there were similarities between certain concepts in Buddhism and Ātman. The Upanishadic "Self" shares certain characteristics with [[nibbana]]; both are permanent, beyond suffering, and unconditioned.&lt;ref name="page34"/&gt; Buddhist mysticism is also of a different sort from that found in systems revolving around the concept of a "God" or "Self":
{{quote|If one would characterize the forms of mysticism found in the Pali discourses, it is none of the nature-, God-, or soul-mysticism of F.C. Happold. Though nearest to the latter, it goes beyond any ideas of 'soul' in the sense of immortal 'self' and is better styled 'consciousness-mysticism'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Buddha shunned any attempt to see the spiritual goal in terms of "Self" because in his framework, the craving for a permanent self is the very thing that keeps a person in the round of uncontrollable rebirth, preventing him or her from attaining nibbana.&lt;ref name="page34"/&gt; At the time of the Buddha some philosophers and meditators posited a ''root'': an abstract principle all things emanated from and that was immanent in all things. When asked about this, instead of following this pattern of thinking, the Buddha attacks it at its very root: the notion of a principle in the abstract, superimposed on experience. In contrast, a person in training should look for a different kind of "root"&amp;nbsp;— the root of [[dukkha]] experienced in the present. According to one Buddhist scholar, theories of this sort have most often originated among meditators who label a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal, and identify with it in a subtle way.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu's commentary to the Mula Pariyaya Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankara]] in his [[Adi Shankara bibliography|works]] refuted the Buddhist arguments against Ātman. He suggested that a self-evident conscious agent would avoid infinite regress, since there would be no necessity to posit another agent who would know this. He further argued that a cognizer beyond cognition could be easily demonstrated from the diversity in self existence of the witness and the notion.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, Gregory Joseph. An Evaluation of the Vedāntic Critique of Buddhism. Motilal Banarasidass Publishers. Delhi, 1987. P. 315-316. {{ISBN|978-81-208-0363-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Shankara thought that no doubts could be raised about the Self, for the act of doubting implies at the very least the existence of the doubter. [[Vidyaranya]], another Advaita Vedantic philosopher, expresses this argument as:
{{Quote|No one can doubt the fact of his own existence. Were one to do so, who would the doubter be?&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Eliot. [https://books.google.com/books?id=63gdKwhHeV0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Advaita Vedānta: A Philosophical Reconstruction]. East-West Center Press, 1969. P. 50. {{ISBN|0-8248-0271-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Cosmic Self declared non-existent===
The Buddha denies the existence of the cosmic Self, as conceived in the Upanishadic tradition, in the [https://notesfrommylibrary.com/2011/04/15/denial-of-the-atman-%E2%80%93-the-alagaddupama-sutta/ Alagaddupama Sutta] ([[Majjhima Nikaya|M]] I 135-136). Possibly the most famous Upanishadic dictum is ''[[tat tvam asi]]'', "thou art that." Transposed into first person, the [[Pali]] version is ''eso ‘ham asmi'', "I am this." This is said in several suttas to be false. The full statement declared to be incorrect is "This is mine, I am this, this is my self/essence." This is often rejected as a wrong view.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alagaduppama Sutta rejects this and other obvious echoes of surviving Upanishadic statements as well (these are not mentioned as such in the commentaries, and seem not to have been noticed until modern times). Moreover, the passage denies that one’s self is the same as the world and that one will become the world self at death.&lt;ref name="Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39"&gt;Richard Francis Gombrich, How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha tells the monks that people worry about something that is non-existent externally ([https://notesfrommylibrary.com/2011/04/15/denial-of-the-atman-%E2%80%93-the-alagaddupama-sutta/ ''bahiddhaa asati'')] and non-existent internally (''ajjhattam asati''); he is referring respectively to the soul/essence of the world and of the individual.&lt;ref name="Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39"/&gt; A similar rejection of "internal" Self and "external" Self occurs at AN II 212. Both are referring to the Upanishads.&lt;ref name="Richard Francis Gombrich 1996, page 39"/&gt; The most basic presupposition of early Brahminic cosmology is the identification of man and the cosmos (instances of this occur at [[Taittiriya Upanishad|TU]] II.1 and [[Mahabharata|Mbh]] XII.195), and liberation for the yogin was thought to only occur at death, with the adept's union with brahman (as at Mbh XII.192.22).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, pp. 50, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha's rejection of these theories is therefore one instance of the Buddha's attack on the whole enterprise of Upanishadic ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis Gombrich, ''How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation.'' Routledge 2007, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahmin===
The Buddha redefined the word "brahmin" so as to become a synonym for arahant, replacing a distinction based on birth with one based on spiritual attainment.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Handful of Leaves'' Vol 1, 2nd edition, page 391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dhp XXVI, ''Brahmanavagga'', or [[Majjhima Nikaya]] 3.24, or especially MN 98 for three of many examples.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Buddhist scriptures furthermore defined purity as determined by one's state of mind, and refer to anyone who behaves unethically, of whatever caste, as "rotting within", or "a rubbish heap of impurity".&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism: A New Approach: The I of the Beholder.'' Routledge 2000, pp. 47, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha explains his use of the word ''brahmin'' in many places. At [[Sutta Nipata]] 1.7 ''Vasala Sutta'', verse 12, he states: "Not by birth is one an outcast; not by birth is one a brahmin. By deed one becomes an outcast, by deed one becomes a brahmin."&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Piyadassi Thera: [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.07.piya.html].&lt;/ref&gt; An entire chapter of the [[Dhammapada]] is devoted to showing how a true brahmin in the Buddha's use of the word is one who is of totally pure mind, namely, an [[arahant]].&lt;ref&gt;Dhammapada XXVI, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu: [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.26.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is very noteworthy that the Bhagavad Gita also defines Brahmin, and other varnas, as qualities and resulting from actions, and does not mention birth as a factor in determining these. In that regard, the chapter on Brahmins in the Dhammapada may be regarded as being entirely in tune with the definition of a Brahmin in Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita. Both say that a Brahmin is a person having certain qualities.

A defining of feature of the Buddha's teachings is self-sufficiency, so much so as to render the Brahminical priesthood entirely redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism: A New Approach: The I of the Beholder.'' Routledge 2000, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddha in Hindu scriptures==
{{Main article|Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu}}
[[File:Avatars.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hinduism regards Buddha (bottom right) as one of the 10 avatars of Vishnu.]]
In one [[Puranas|Purana]], the Buddha is described as an [[incarnation]] of [[Vishnu]] who incarnated in order to delude [[demon]]s away from the [[Vedic Dharma|Vedic dharma]]. The [[Bhavishya Purana]] posits:

{{quote|At this time, reminded of the Kali Age, the god Vishnu became born as Gautama, the [[Shakyamuni]], and taught the Buddhist dharma for ten years. Then Shuddodana ruled for twenty years, and Shakyasimha for twenty. At the first stage of the [[Kali Yuga|Kali Age]], the path of the Vedas was destroyed and all men became Buddhists. Those who sought refuge with Vishnu were deluded.|&lt;ref&gt;Wendy O'Flaherty, ''Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology.'' University of California Press, 1976, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consequently, the word [[Buddha]] is mentioned in several of the [[Purana]]s that are believed to have been composed after his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Vinay Lal (2007), http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/texts/Puranas.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/24/en1 Bhag-P 1.3.24] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235132/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/24/en1 |date=2007-09-26 }} "Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of [[Añjanā|Anjana]], in the province of [[Gaya district|Gaya]], just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddha in Buddhist scriptures==
{{Main article|Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu}}
According to the biography of the Buddha, before taking his last birth on Earth as Gautama, the Buddha was a Mahapurusha (great being) named  Shvetaketu, dwelling in the [[Tushita]] Heaven (Home of the Contented Gods).  After attaining enlightenment on Earth, there is to be no more rebirth for the Buddha. Before leaving the Tushita realm to take birth on earth, he designated [[Maitreya]] to take his place there. Maitreya will come to earth as the next Buddha, instead of him coming back again.
[[Krishna]] was a past life of [[Sariputra]], a chief disciple of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahapurisa.org/ghata-jataka-no-454/ GHATA-JĀTAKA (NO. 454) ]&lt;/ref&gt; He has not attained enlightenment during that life as Krishna. Therefore, he came back to be reborn during the life of the Buddha and reached the first stage of Enlightenment after encountering an enlightened disciple of the Buddha. He reached full Arahantship or full Awakening/Enlightenment after becoming ordained in the Buddha's sangha.

==Notable views==

===Neo-Vedanta===
[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] has claimed that the Buddha did not look upon himself as an innovator, but only a restorer of the way of the [[Upanishads]],&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan: Indian Philosophy, vol.2, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the Buddha did not accept the Upanishads, viewing them as comprising a pretentious tradition, foreign to his paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vivekananda]] wrote in glowing terms about Buddha, and visited [[Bodh Gaya]] several times.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Nivedita: The Master as I Saw Him. Koenraad Elst 2001: Who is a Hindu&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Collins sees such Hindu claims regarding Buddhism as part of an effort&amp;nbsp;– itself a reaction to Christian proselytizing efforts in India&amp;nbsp;– to show that "all religions are one", and that Hinduism is uniquely valuable because it alone recognizes this fact.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Collins, ''Selfless Persons.'' Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
Some scholars have written that Buddhism should be regarded as "reformed Brahmanism",&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lindtner: "From Brahmanism to Buddhism", Asian Philosophy, 1999, John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon): Shakti and Shakta, Koenraad Elst: Who is a Hindu (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and many Hindus consider Buddhism a sect of Hinduism.{{Citation needed|reason=need to find sources yet|date=June 2009}}

===Dalit-movement===
[[B. R. Ambedkar]], the founder of the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]], declared that Buddhism offered an opportunity for low-caste and [[dalit|untouchable]] Hindus to achieve greater respect and dignity because of its non-caste doctrines.  Among the 22 vows he prescribed to his followers is an injunction against having faith in [[Brahma]], Vishnu and [[Shiva|Mahesh]]. He also regarded the belief that the Buddha was an incarnation of Vishnu as "false propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Ambedkarite website, http://www.jaibheem.com/22%20Vows.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=July 2017}}

==Hindu-Buddhist temples==
Many examples exist of temples dedicated to both faiths.  These include the [[Kaiyuan Temple (Quanzhou)|Kaiyuan Temple]] and [[Angkor Wat]].

Islamic teachings and argument have been used to censor opinions and writings throughout history, up to and including the modern era, and thus there are many cases of '''censorship in Islamic societies'''. One example is the [[fatwa]] (''religious judgment'') against ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (a novel), ordering that the author be [[Blasphemy in Islam#Punishment|executed for blasphemy]]. [[Depictions of Muhammad]] have inspired considerable controversy and censorship. Some Islamic societies have [[Islamic religious police|religious police]], who enforce the application of Islamic [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref name="asianews.it"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=5869 |title=SAUDI ARABIA Catholic priest arrested and expelled from Riyadh&amp;nbsp;— Asia News |publisher=Asianews.it |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323184717/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=5869 |archivedate=2015-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2399885.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Saudi minister rebukes religious police |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-11-04 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-Islamic countries, Islam has often been cited as a reason for self-censorship. Sometimes this self-censorship is because of threats of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Joshua Rhett|title=Comedy Central Censors 'South Park' Episode After Muslim Site's Threats |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/20/comedy-central-censors-south-park-episode-muslim-threats/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=30 July 2012|date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the member states of the world's largest Islamic organization, known as the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC), called for a categorical ban on anything that could be deemed as denigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Calls for a global ban of criticism of Muhammad ==
The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC), the world's second largest intergovernmental organization, comprising fifty-seven Islamic states, has actively lobbied for a global ban on what it perceives as [[Islam and blasphemy|anti-Islamic blasphemy]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Diaa Hadid |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120929/un-un-general-assembly-islamic-organization/ |title=Islamic group calls for ban on offending prophet |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2012-09-29 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after the publication of ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' — a "low-quality film" depicting Muhammad as a madman, philanderer, and paedophile,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; — triggered protests and demonstrations in over a dozen Islamic countries. The OIC actions constituted a major step to criminalize speech critical of religion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/islamic_bloc_abandons_push_for_blasphemy_ban_at_un/ |title=Islamic bloc abandons push for blasphemy ban at UN |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu]], a Turkish citizen and the Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, also called for a ban on insults against the Islamic prophet. He said, "If the Western world fails to understand the sensitivity of the Muslim world, then we are in trouble". He asserted provocative insults are "a threat to international peace and security and the sanctity of life."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

However, the opposition from Western nations barred the resolution from being accepted. Ihsanoglu said, "We could not convince them, [..] The European countries don't vote with us, the United States doesn't vote with us."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heneghan |first=Tom |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-islam-blasphemy-idUSBRE89E18U20121015 |title=West's free speech stand bars blasphemy ban: OIC |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2013-06-06 |date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Censorship measures in the Islamic world ==

=== Afghanistan ===
The [[Taliban]], which ruled Afghanistan after the mid-1990s, had the most strict, deeply enforced Islamic censorship of any other government in the [[Muslim World]]. They enforced and imposed a blanket ban on all films and videos.&lt;ref name=cinemas&gt;{{cite book|title=Cinemas of the World: Film and Society from 1895 to the Present|first=James|last=Chapman|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2004|ISBN=9781861891624|pages=392–393|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEFw2nnbpGAC&amp;q=%22within+the+middle+east%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22within%20the%20middle%20east%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban fully fell in 2002 and [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]]'s administration began, with expectations of a move towards more secular policies.&lt;ref name=soaps/&gt;

However, [[Hamid Karzai|Karzai]] has worked with members of the Islamic Council of Scholars to censor television programs regarded as sinful, particularly those created by the [[Entertainment Industry In India|Indian entertainment industry]] (many Afghan Islamists often euphemistically refer to Hindus in said industry as "worshipers of graven idols"). One of Afghanistan's most popular television [[soap operas]], ''[[Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Note that no exact English language translation exists of the title, but it has been described as: ''Because the Mother-in-law Was Once a Daughter-in-law Too''.&lt;/ref&gt; has faced threats of a total banning from the country unless the shows were heavily modified.&lt;ref name=soaps&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/1514/indian-soaps-fall-to-islamic-censorship-in-afghanistan|title=Indian Soaps Fall to Islamic Censorship in Afghanistan|publisher=''World Politics Review''|first=Lorenzo|last=Cremonesi|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azim Roboti, director of the Kabul company 'Caravan Film', has remarked about Islamic censorship,

{{quote|The Taliban are on the offensive and terrorism continues unabated. Ordinary Afghans view foreign troops with growing suspicion and now we have a sort of restoration. It's hardly surprising that Karzai should listen first to religious leaders, even if it means blocking social and cultural development.&lt;ref name=soaps/&gt;}}

=== Algeria ===
{{Further|Censorship in Algeria}}

During the [[Algerian civil war]] in the 1990s, at least 60 journalists were killed by [[Islamists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1543&amp;l=2 Entre menace, censure et liberté: La presse privé algérienne se bat pour survivre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214113744/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1543&amp;l=2 |date=February 14, 2007 }}, March 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
{{further|Censorship in Bangladesh}}
Several books of the Bangladeshi writer [[Taslima Nasrin]] have been banned in [[Bangladesh]], including her novel [[Lajja]]. Militant [[Islamist groups]] announced a bounty on Nasreen's head and in October 2002, a court sentenced Nasreen ''in absentia'' to a year in jail for her "derogatory remarks about Islam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://taslimanasrin.com/tn_bannedbooks.html "Taslima's Banned Books"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106160314/http://taslimanasrin.com/tn_bannedbooks.html |date=2015-01-06 }}.

=== Egypt ===
[[File:Hosni Mubarak - World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2008.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Hosni Mubarak]] implemented Islamic censorship as part of his outreach to anti-regime Islamists in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;]]

{{Further|Human rights in Egypt|Internet censorship in Egypt}}
The [[government of Egypt]], during the modern era, used a fundamentally secular legal code that went back decades. In 1985, Egyptian leader [[Hosni Mubarak]] and the [[Parliament of Egypt|National Assembly]] revised that code in order to try and take some of the heat off of Islamist anti-regime activists such as those in the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] by co-opting some of the Islamists' demands. Systematic Islamic censorship on the nation's media began at the same time as the imposition of religious education in state schools.&lt;ref name=shadow&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Ray Takeyh|author2=Nikolas K. Gvosdev|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|title=The Receding Shadow of the Prophet: The Rise and Fall of Radical Political Islam|pages=61–63, 70, 123|ISBN=9780275976293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85BTay8abYsC&amp;q=censorship#v=snippet&amp;q=censorship&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's Ministry of Culture typically worked with the Islamic Research Council, based out of [[Al-Azhar University]], to implement Islamic censorship of the nation's film industry. For example, [[Youssef Chahine]], one of the most popular Egyptian filmmakers in history, had the distribution of his successful 1994 work ''The Emigrant'' ended when the Council objected to a character's portrayal of the religious figure [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. [[Youssef Chahine|Chahine]] sued and won, ensuring further showings of his film and showing the sometimes inconsistent nature of Egyptian censorship.&lt;ref name=cinemas/&gt;

Egyptian films of the nation's [[Cinema of Egypt#The Golden Age|classic cinema period]] often depict all sorts of physical affection such as kisses and hugging, and said films receive frequent play on the state-owned [[Egyptian Television Network]]. In the aftermath of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Arab Spring toppling of Mubarak's government]], some conservative Islamists in Egypt's parliament have worked for a comprehensive censorship law banning such displays. Many Egyptians have expressed concerns about increasing Islamic censorship harming the nation's entertainment industries.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053913|title=Censorship chills Arab Spring|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=May 12, 2012|first=Nick|last=Vivarelliv|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both secular and Islamic censorship has existed, widespread use of the internet, physical distribution of DVDs, and so on has broadly allowed a large variety of arts and media access. Those measures have not kept [[Cairo]] from being regarded as the largest arts and media publishing hub in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=89|year=2011|title=Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yVeszi3b14EC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=egypt+%22islamic+censorship%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AvGmbaEnde&amp;sig=edMU5KShBHHDxGXwlMSzmOYeqNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XKSHUKGZKoqM2gW6nIHQCQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=egypt%20%22islamic%20censorship%22&amp;f=false|ISBN=9781615303922|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coalition of participants in the Egyptian art world formed the 'Egyptian Creativity Front' to oppose Islamic censorship by the ruiling Muslim Brotherhood, using the slogan "Long Live Free Art". The government has used article 44 of the new [[Egyptian Constitution]] as justification for their measures, which states "insult or abuse of all religious messengers and prophets shall be prohibited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Egypts-art-world-rallies-to-defend-freedom-of-expression/28487 |title=Egypt's art world rallies to defend freedom of expression |publisher=The Art Newspaper |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] tightened Islamic censorship of his nation's media after his election.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

{{Further|Censorship in Iran}}
{{see also|Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance (Iran)}}

The [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s government eschewed Islamic censorship, with popular commercial films featuring frank sexual themes and even nudity. The regime largely concerned itself with fostering feelings of legitimacy and making sure that films always portrayed it in a positive light. The Shah personally intervened in a 1934 film biopic to make sure that the protagonist, the poet [[Firdawsi]], viewed the ruler character as a patron of the arts.&lt;ref name=cinemas/&gt;

In the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], members of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Revolution]] sought to use film and other measures to shift public opinion's against the Shah's regime and, upon taking power, utilized filmmakers for ideological support. In some circumstances, this meant more rights than under the Shah such as use of minority dialects by characters. However, the Islamic government has strictly regulated films in order to suppress messages perceived as un-Islamic, using religious bureaucracies such as the Council of Screenplay Inspection and the Council of Film Reviewing to alter and delete specific lines and scenes against filmmaker's wishes.&lt;ref name=iranfilm/&gt;

In particular, the government forbids the depiction of women either singing, dancing, or both. Actresses also must conceal their hair at all times, even in moments when the characters are shown alone in their own homes. Censors suppress the showing of direct physical contact between members of the opposite sex. Despite this tradition of censorship, some officials have relaxed implementation of Islamic standards, particularly since the death of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in 1989 (which resulted in the film ''[[Two Women (1999 film)|Two Women]]'' by [[Tahmineh Milani]] being un-banned before receiving widespread public acclaim).&lt;ref name=iranfilm&gt;{{cite book|title=From Patriarchy to Empowerment: Women's Participation, Movements, and Rights in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia|pages=230–231|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iKsSEulnPTsC&amp;q=feminism+and+censorship+in+an+islamic+republic#v=snippet&amp;q=feminism%20and%20censorship%20in%20an%20islamic%20republic&amp;f=false|ISBN=9780815631118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's government, through the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, reviews written works before allowing authors to be published. This process tends to involve having three separate officials inspect works for offending words and phrases, which can take several months to years before approval is granted. Authors with banned works include [[Plato]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[James Joyce]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], and [[Paulo Coelho]]. [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]] has publicly attacked the impact of "harmful books" on his nation, analogizing them with "poisonous" drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Saeed Kamali|last=Dehghan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/21/iran-supreme-leader-attacks-books|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=21 July 2011|title=Iran's supreme leader attacks 'harmful' books|accessdate=9 September 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian censorship of books grew stricter after then-President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s administration began in 2005. His government authorized booksellers to distribute ''[[Memories of My Melancholy Whores|Memoria de mis putas tristes]]''&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Spanish-language title has translations such as ''Memories of My Melancholy Sweethearts'' and ''Memories of My Melancholy Whores'' (the latter being widely used).&lt;/ref&gt; by Nobel-prize winning author [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]], which had the five-thousand first edition sell out in short notice, but it reversed course and banned further reprinting. Muslim religious conservatives objected to the story's plot, which describes an isolated ninety-year-old man seeking a night of "wild love" with an adolescent prostitute.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7098233.stm|title=Iran ban for Garcia Marquez novel|publisher=BBC News|date=16 November 2007|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
{{Further|Censorship in Iraq}}

Censorship for both socio-political and religious justifications, intertwined, was widespread in Iraq's government in the 20th century. In particular, the Iraqi Law on the Censorship of Foreign Films of 1973 banned the showing of anything with "the propagation of reactionary, chauvinistic, populistic, racialist or regionist ideas, of favouring the spirit of defeatism, serving imperialism and Zionism", prohibiting as well anything "defaming the Arab nation and its goals". Iraq's government effectively had the ability to ban any film for any reason whatsoever at any notice.&lt;ref name=cinemas/&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
{{Further|Censorship in Malaysia}}

In 2006 alone, 56 publications were banned by the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Ministry]], including the Indonesian translation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mois.gov.my/opencms/export/KKDN/BhgPQ/senaraiharam2006.html 2006 List of banned publications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929011558/http://www.mois.gov.my/opencms/export/KKDN/BhgPQ/senaraiharam2006.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}''.

In November 2011, the blog of journalist [[Ismail Khilath Rasheed]] was shut down by Communications Authority of the Maldives (CAM) on the order of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, on the grounds that the site contained "anti-Islamic material".&lt;ref name="MV1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minivannews.com/politics/blog-crack-down-is-just-the-beginning-warns-censored-blogger-28433 |title=Blog crack-down "is just the beginning", warns censored blogger |author=Eleanor Johnstone |date=21 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Minivan News |accessdate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114155541/http://minivannews.com/politics/blog-crack-down-is-just-the-beginning-warns-censored-blogger-28433 |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasheed, a self-professed [[Sufi]] Muslim, had argued for greater religious tolerance.&lt;ref name="AI1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa29/001/2011/en/ |title=Maldives' Police Arrests Campaigner Seeking Religious Tolerance and Allows His Attackers Impunity |date=21 December 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
{{Further|Censorship in Pakistan}}

The [[government of Pakistan]] maintains strict censorship of its citizens' access to the internet, with the [[List of Federal Government Ministries of Pakistan|Ministry of Information Technology]]'s sub-agency the [[Pakistan Telecommunication Authority]] monitoring and filtering a variety of websites accused of playing host to perceived anti-Islamic content. Examples of cautioned websites include Google, Yahoo, Bing, YouTube, Hotmail, MSN, and Amazon. The government banned access to Facebook outright for two months in mid-2010 after the controversial page titled "[[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]]" received public attention.&lt;ref name=fastc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1663977/pakistan-dials-its-islamic-net-censorship-11-shutters-yahoo-and-bing|title=Pakistan Dials Its Islamic Net Censorship Up to 11, Shutters Yahoo and Bing|publisher=''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]''|date=June 25, 2010|first=Kit|last=Eaton|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These measures have partially contributed to underlying [[Pakistan–United States relations|tensions between the Pakistani government and the U.S. government]], with many of the aforementioned websites being American-owned.&lt;ref name=fastc/&gt;

{{Further|Censorship in Saudi Arabia}}
{{See also|Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}

The [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] has, in the words of the ''[[International Business Times]]'', "resorted to drastic measures to limit free communication within its own borders." The administration blocks hundreds of thousands of websites for having content perceived as immoral. Censorship has grown more strict since the [[Arab Spring|'Arab Spring' revolutions]] began in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/saudi-arabia-suggests-global-internet-regulations-preserve-public-order-845179|publisher=''[[International Business Times]]''|title=Saudi Arabia Suggests Global Internet Regulations To Preserve 'Public Order'|date=October 12, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|first=Jacey|last=Fortin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tunisia ===
{{Further|Censorship in Tunisia}}

In one well-publicized instance of Islamic censorship, the [[government of Tunisia]] fined Nabil Karoui, owner of [[Tunis]]-based company [[Nessma TV]], about $1,700 in May 2012 for airing the controversial film ''[[Persepolis (film)|Persepolis]]''. Said film includes a scene depicting Allah directly along with other disputed material. The government's ruling blasted Karoui for what it viewed as "broadcasting a film that disturbs public order and threatens proper morals".&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

=== Uzbekistan ===
{{Further|Human rights in Uzbekistan}}
[[Islam Karimov]], the [[President of Uzbekistan]], has implemented a degree of Islamic censorship over the nation's media, such as banning advertisements for alcohol or tobacco products. Those measures have been a part of a general plan of religious administration that has included running religious programming on state television, federally funding the building of mosques and the restorations of shrines, and the promotion of the official government ''muftiyat'' to smooth connections between the state and Islamic believers.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;

== Censorship in non-Islamic countries ==

Several examples exist of incidences of [[self-censorship]] in non-Islamic countries.

{{Main|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy}}
After 12 [[editorial cartoon]]s, most of which [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicted]] the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], were published in the Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' on 30 September 2005, Muslim groups in Denmark complained, and the issue eventually led to protests in many countries around the world, which included violent demonstrations and riots in some Islamic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klausen|first=Jytte|title=The cartoons that shook the world|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, [Conn.]|isbn=9780300124729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/08/world/main1298998.shtml |title=Rice: Iran, Syria Behind Cartoon Riots |publisher=CBS News |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,399177,00.html|title=Arson and Death Threats as Muhammad Caricature Controversy Escalates|date=4 February 2006|publisher=Spiegel online|accessdate=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/04/syria.cartoon/|title=Embassies torched in cartoon fury|date=5 February 2006|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', many of the demonstrations eventually turned violent, resulting in "at least 200 deaths" globally.&lt;ref name=NYTSummary&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Danish Cartoon Controversy|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/danish_cartoon_controversy/index.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[death threat]]s and reward offers for killing those responsible for the cartoons were made, resulting in the cartoonists going into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2024306,00.html TimesOnline: Danish cartoonists fear for their lives]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720023504/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C3-2024306%2C00.html |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo Van Gogh]] received death threats for making a film about the treatment of Muslim women by other Muslims, titled [[Submission (2004 film)|''Submission'']] and was eventually [[Death of Theo Van Gogh|murdered]] in 2004 by an Islamic radical in retribution. A letter pinned to Van Gogh's body with a knife was a death threat to [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] who provided the script and the voice-over for the film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/controversial-filmmaker-shot-dead-8027777.html "Controversial filmmaker shot dead"]. independent.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ayaan-hirsi-ali-my-life-under-a-fatwa-760666.html |title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali: My life under a fatwa |work=The Independent |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=27 January 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The United States ===
The makers of the television series ''[[South Park]]'' were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The website for the organization [[Revolution Muslim]], a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their [[depictions of Muhammad]]. It said that they "will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show." This caused the network [[Comedy Central]] to censor the episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/23/road-radicalism-man-south-park-threats/?test=latestnews|title=Road to Radicalism: The Man Behind the 'South Park' Threats|last=Miller|first=Joshua Rhett|date=April 23, 2010|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/19/security-brief-radical-islamic-web-site-takes-on-south-park/|title=Security Brief: Radical Islamic Web site takes on 'South Park'|last=Lister|first=Tim|date=April 19, 2010|work=CNN|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhett"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/20/website-warns-south-park-creators-face-retribution-depicting-muhammad/|title=South Park Creators Could Face Retribution for Depicting Muhammad, Website Warns|last=Miller|first=Joshua Rhett|date=April 20, 2010|work=Fox News|accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AC360"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Radical Islamists Threaten 'South Park' Creators; More Volcano Eruptions Ahead|series=Anderson Cooper 360°|serieslink=Anderson Cooper 360°|credits=[[Anderson Cooper|Cooper, Anderson]]|network=[[CNN]]|location=New York City|airdate=April 20, 2010||transcript=Radical Islamists Threaten 'South Park' Creators|transcript-url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1004/20/acd.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OReilly"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=South Park Episode Prompts Death Threats|credits=[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|O'Reilly, Bill]]|network=[[Fox News Channel]]|series=The O'Reilly Factor|serieslink=The O'Reilly Factor|transcript=South Park Episode Prompts Death Threats|location=New York City|airdate=April 20, 2010|transcript-url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4159547/south-park-episode-prompts-death-threats?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a16:g2:r5:c0.006712:b33088576:z6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cavna|first=Michael|title=Comic Riffs&amp;nbsp;– 'South Park': Is pro-jihad website threatening cartoonists over Muhammad satire?|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=April 20, 2010|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/south_park_threat_over_muhamma.html|accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Park Declares Jihad On the Handicapped!|work=Lineboil|date=April 28, 2010|url=http://lineboil.com/2010/04/south-park-declares-jihad-on-the-handicapped/|accessdate=May 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094946/http://lineboil.com/2010/04/south-park-declares-jihad-on-the-handicapped|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Werner Eichhorn, ''Die Religionen Chinas'', 1973, pp. 55-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Its features are especially connected to the ancient Neolithic cultures such as the [[Hongshan culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Matson, Roberts, Rock, Stencel. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese shamanic traditions are intrinsic to [[Chinese folk religion]], an overarching term for all the [[indigenous religion]]s of [[China]]. ''Wu'' masters remain important in contemporary Chinese culture.

Various ritual traditions are rooted in original Chinese shamanism: contemporary [[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|Chinese ritual masters]] are sometimes identified as ''wu'' by outsiders,&lt;ref&gt;Nadeau, 2012. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; though most orders don't self-identify as such.  Also [[Taoism]] has some of its origins from Chinese shamanism:&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldau, Patton. 2009. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; it developed around the pursuit of long life (''shou'' 壽/寿), or the status of a ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' (仙, "mountain man", "holy man").&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of ''wu''==
{{Main article|Wu (shaman)}}
[[File:中国法师.jpg|thumb|260px|A 巫 ''wu'' master]]
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' 巫 "shaman, wizard", indicating a person who can mediate with the powers generating things (the [[etymology|etymological]] meaning of "spirit", "god", or ''nomen agentis'', ''virtus'', ''energeia''), was first recorded during the [[Shang dynasty]] (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be either sex. During the late [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE) ''wu'' was used to specify [[Women in ancient and imperial China|"female shaman]]; sorceress" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "male shaman; sorcerer" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE [[Guoyu (book)|''Guoyu'']]). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include ''nanwu'' 男巫 for "male shaman; sorcerer; wizard"; and ''nüwu'' 女巫, ''wunü'' 巫女, ''wupo'' 巫婆, and ''wuyu'' 巫嫗 for "female shaman; sorceress; witch".

The word ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' 童乩 (lit. "youth diviner") "shaman; spirit-medium" is a near-synonym of ''wu''. The Chinese tradition distinguishes native ''wu'' from "[[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shaman]]": ''saman'' 薩滿 or ''saman'' 薩蠻; and from Indian ''[[Shramana]]'' "wandering monk; ascetic": ''shamen'' 沙門, ''sangmen'' 桑門, or ''sangmen'' 喪門.

[[Berthold Laufer]] (1917:370) proposed an etymological relation between [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''bügä'' "shaman", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''bögü'' "shaman", Chinese ''bu'', ''wu'' (shaman), ''buk'', ''puk'' (to divine), and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''aba'' (pronounced ''ba'', sorcerer). Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root *''{{IPA|mjaɣ}}'' "magician; sorcerer" for Chinese ''wu'' &lt; ''mju'' &lt; *''mjag'' 巫 "magician; shaman" and [[Tibetan script|Written Tibetan]]'' 'ba'-po'' "sorcerer" and'' 'ba'-mo'' "sorcereress" (of the [[Bön]] religion). Further connections are to the ''bu-mo'' priests of [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] [[Shigongism]] and the ''bi-mo'' priests of [[Bimoism]], the [[Yi people|Yi]] indigenous faith. Also Korean ''mu'' 무 (of [[Muism]]) is cognate to Chinese ''wu'' 巫.

==Shang period==
The Chinese religion from the [[Shang dynasty]] onwards developed around [[ancestral worship]].&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The main gods from this period are not forces of nature in the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] way, but [[deification|deified]] virtuous men.&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestors of the emperors were called ''di'' (帝), and the greatest of them was called ''[[Shangdi]]'' (上帝, "the Highest Lord").&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; He is identified with the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] (''[[Kui (Chinese mythology)|Kui]]'' 夔), symbol of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|universal power]] ([[qi]]).&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic powers dominate nature: the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], stars, winds and clouds were considered informed by divine energies.&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The earth god is ''She'' (社) or ''[[Tu Di Gong|Tu]]'' (土).&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shang period had two methods to enter in contact with divine ancestors: the first is the numinous-mystical ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'' (巫) practice, involving dances and trances; and the second is the method of the [[oracle bones]], a rational way.&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zhou period==
The [[Zhou dynasty]], succeeding the Shang, was more rooted in an [[agriculture|agricultural]] worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; They opposed the ancestor-gods of the Shang, and gods of nature became dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Absolute (philosophy)|utmost power]] in this period was named ''[[Tian]]'' (天, "heaven").&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; With ''[[Di (Chinese concept)|Di]]'' (地, "earth") he forms the whole [[cosmos]] in a complementary duality.&lt;ref&gt;Libbrecht, 2007. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bharat Takhtani, Esha Deol at Esha Deol's wedding at ISCKON temple 02.jpg|thumb| [[Esha Deol]] wearing choora (chooda) at her wedding]]
A '''Choora''' is a set of [[bangle]]s that are usually red and white, sometimes the red bangles are replaced with another color, but they are usually only two colors.  Traditionally made of ivory, with inlay work, though now made with plastic&lt;ref name="RatraKaur2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amiteshwar Ratra|author2=Praveen Kaur|author3=Sudha Chhikara|title=Marriage And Family : In Diverse And Changing Scenario|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XV5iBV_pYm0C&amp;pg=PA500|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-7629-758-5|pages=500–}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are worn by a bride on her wedding day, especially during [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] weddings. It is a favoured tradition in Punjabi family.  It is primarily a Punjabi tradition along with Sindhoor and mangalsutra. Chooriyan (plural) may contain different coloured bangles in various combinations, but the most common combination is red and white. The choora is worn by the bride for 1 year from the day she puts it on and on the 1st anniversary  only her inlaws can remove it for her. She can wear other choora after that for as long as she likes in any colour.

The choora ceremony is held on the morning of the wedding or the day before. The bride's maternal uncle and aunt give her a set of choorae (21 bangles in red and white ivory). Nowadays, the bride often wears 7 or 9 bangles. According to tradition, the bride should ideally wear the choora for at least a year. It is now normal for the bride to wear her choora for a month and a quarter (40 days). The bangles range in size according to the circumference of the top of the forearm and the wrist end so that the set fits neatly.

As the choora is made of fragile materials, Punjabi custom has it that the bride may refrain from heavy housework in her marital home to keep it intact for the 40 days, as a kind of [[honeymoon]]. After that, in traditional homes at least, she takes over the lion's share of domestic work from her mother-in-law..

Traditionally, the bride would wear a chura for a full year. When the color started to fade, her in-laws would actually have it re-colored, so everyone knows she was a newly wed (less than a year of marriage). On an auspicious Punjabi holiday, usually sangrand, after the 1st anniversary her in-laws would hold a small intimate ceremony in which the chura was removed and glass churiyan (bangles) were placed on both hands. This usually was accompanied with mithai (Indian sweets) and a monetary shagun. The chura then was taken to a river and a prayer was said and it left to float onto the water.

Also note, if a newly wed bride became pregnant before her first anniversary, the chura was taken off.

Modern day brides usually wear the chura for 40 days, since it difficult to return to work after the wedding with it on.

Haiti saw the introduction of Christianity when Europeans arrived to colonize the island. It was first introduced by the Spanish, later followed by French colonialists. The primary brand of Christianity was Catholicism. In recent years, some Protestant denominations have made an increased number of converts in Haiti, continuing early work done by a small number of Protestant missions since the independence of the island.

==Overview==

[[Haiti]] was first colonized by the Spanish, who later abandoned the island's western portion. That region came under French influence after 1630, and was formally recognized as the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] in 1697. Under French rule, [[Roman Catholicism]] was the sole legal religion, though African slaves frequently practiced [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]]. Slaves revolted in 1791 and managed to achieve independence in 1804. Three years later [[Protestant]] missionary activity begun. Political control of the island shifted frequently during the 19th century with different European governments, the Dominican republic, Columbia and Haiti itself alternating in power.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, David, World Christian Encyclopedia, a comparative study of churches and religions in the modern world ,1982, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical relations===
Protestant churches and sects have frequently attempted to so-ordinate their activities through organisations like the Council Churches in Haiti and the Protestant Federation. The Roman Catholic Church later participated in the Ecumenical Research group of 1968. The practice of vodou is strong in Haiti and some vodou practitioners advocate being included in any ecumenical gatherings.

==History of the development of Christianity in Haiti ==
The Spanish first brought Catholicism to the island. The first European to set foot on Haiti, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on December 6, 1492, by way of San Salvador, with three ships. His own ship, the [[Santa María (ship)|Santa Maria]] ran aground near [[Mole St. Nicolas]] on the northwest of the island. Some evangelization efforts were extended to the natives, though this population was soon nearly wiped out through disease and slavery. African slaves, brought to work in their place, were introduced to Christianity.

During Spanish rule, religion was one of the most important aspects of life on the island. Catholic missionaries traveled inland to [[Christianize]] most of the island inhabitants. In 1511, three bishoprics formed and the inhabitants appeared enthusiastic. However, missionary work among such impoverished people on a tropical island was challenging. Diseases such as 'yellow fever' and malaria killed many missionaries and their converts.&lt;ref&gt;Moraeu de Saint-Mery [1797] 1958, 1:83&lt;/ref&gt;

Under French rule, [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and Jesuits did most of the missionary work in the 18th century. From 1804, when independence was declared, until 1860, the country was in [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. Relations were regularized by a concordat concluded in 1860, when an archdiocese and four [[dioceses]] were established. Most of the population of Haiti adheres to the Catholic faith, though some combine this with elements of [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]].

Protestantism was introduced to the newly independent nation in 1807, and missionary efforts have been ongoing. Today, Protestants make up at least one-sixth of the population and as much as one-third.&lt;ref name="google.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40SIdXeUEhUC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Haitian+religion+in+miami+Protestantism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CuUsOMdd4d&amp;sig=ItTaViYsK35BV4GB2aSLD5d3DFo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HrTKVOiKJ9KxyATe6YK4CQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Haitian%20religion%20in%20miami%20Protestantism&amp;f=false|title=Crossing the Water and Keeping the Faith|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian festivals in Haiti==
[[Rara]] is the yearly festival in Haiti that the peasants and urban poor celebrate. On the eve of [[Lent]], Rara processions build for six weeks until [[Easter week]] starts. Processions include walking for miles through local territory, performing new and traditional songs, and attracting fans. The belief in this celebration is that they are conducting the spiritual work that becomes necessary when the angels and saints along with Jesus, disappear into the Underworld on Good Friday.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth A, Rara! Vodou, power, and performance in Haiti and its diaspora : Berkeley University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===First broadcast of church radio in Haiti===
Protestant was the first church allowing broadcast programs in 1950, for up to three hours from Monday to Saturday. The first broadcast was done in the backroom of a church. The two programs were Radio 4VEH and [[Radio Lumiere]]. The first test transmission was given in Haiti. The transmission emitted a message stating "4VEH, you are coming in clear and strong". It was the first transmission for the radio 4VEH. Later, the Christian radio station became known worldwide to people, and then the first transmission in Spanish from this station was announced in the year of 1952. Following that, they started doing the broadcasts in other different languages such as French, English etc. In 1978, a Catholic station, Radio Soleil, began functioning. Today there are music and programmes in French and English for 17 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianradio.org.uk/world/haiti/4veh/4veh-history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121213400/http://www.christianradio.org.uk/world/haiti/4veh/4veh-history.htm |archivedate=2008-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Faces of the Gods''. 1st ed. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1992; p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestantism in Haiti==

[[Protestantism in Haiti|Protestants in Haiti]] are a significant minority of the population.  The 2015 CIA Factbook reports that around 16% of the population is Protestant (Baptist 10%, Pentecostal 4%, Adventist 1%, other 1%). Other sources put the Protestant population higher than this, suggesting that it may form one-third of the population in 2001. Protestant churches have experienced significant growth in recent decades.&lt;ref name="google.com1"/&gt;

Protestant churches of significant size include the [[Assemblies of God|Assemblées de Dieu]], the [[Convention Baptiste d'Haïti]], the [[Seventh-day Adventists]], the [[Church of God (Cleveland)]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]] and the [[Mission Evangelique Baptiste du Sud-Haiti]].

Whereas a very small amount of Catholic Haitians combine their faith with aspects of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], this practice is much more rare among Haitian Protestants, whose churches tend to strongly denounce Vodou as diabolical.&lt;ref name="google.com1"/&gt;

The exact date of the writing of the work is unknown, apart from an earliest date (''terminum post quem''), deduced from repeated references by Seneca to the episodic anger of [[Caligula]], who died 24 January 41 AD.&lt;ref name="monty2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monteleone|first=Maria|chapter=De Ira|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jqOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" C Stark "/&gt; Seneca refers to his brother by his native name, Novatus, rather than his adoptive one, Gallio, which he bore by 52/53 AD, suggesting the work may date from the mid 40s AD.&lt;ref name="monty2"/&gt;

''De Ira'' consists of three books.&lt;ref name="C Stark"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://apaclassics.org/annual-meeting/145/abstracts/caroline-stark|author=C Stark |title=The Self-Divided Dialogical Self in Seneca's De Ira|publisher=(Society for Classical Studies)| accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of Seneca's series of ''Dialogi'' (''dialogues'').&lt;ref&gt;J Sellars - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D7jCBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 Stoicism] (Routledge, 5 Dec 2014)  {{ISBN|1317493915}} [Retrieved 2015-3-16]&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is addressed to Seneca's elder brother, [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Lucius Annaeus Novatus]]. The works first sentence reads:&lt;ref name="monty2"/&gt;

{{quote|You have asked me Novatus to write on how anger can be mitigated|}}

Although split into three books, ''De Ira'' is effectively divided into two parts. The first part (I&amp;ndash;II.17) deals with theoretical questions, whereas the second part (II.18&amp;ndash;III&amp;nbsp;end) offers therapeutic advice.&lt;ref name="coopro"/&gt; The first part begins with a preamble on the horrors of anger, followed by definitions of anger. It continues with questions such as whether anger is natural, whether it can be moderate, whether it is involuntary, and whether it can be erased altogether. The second part (Book II.18 onwards) begins with advice on how the avoidance of bad temper can be taught to both children and adults. This is followed by numerous snippets of advice on how anger can be forestalled or extinguished, and many anecdotes are given of examples to be imitated or avoided. The work concludes with a few tips on mollifying other people, followed by Seneca's summing-up.&lt;ref name="coopro"/&gt;

}}
''De Ira'' is written within the context of [[Stoicism]], which sought to guide people out of a life enslaved to the vices, to the freedom of a life characterised by virtue. This is achievable by the development of an understanding of how to control the ''passions'' (Greek: ''pathê''),  anger being classified as a passion, and to make these subject to reason.&lt;ref&gt;B.Inwood - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LYPT7lvCS58C&amp;pg=PA165 Passions and Perceptions: Studies in Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind (p.165 &amp; 166)] (Cambridge University Press, 25 Mar 1993) {{ISBN|0521402026}} [Retrieved 2015-3-15]&lt;/ref&gt; As a Stoic, Seneca believed the relationship of [[Stoic passions|the passions]] to reason are that the passions arise in a rational mind as a result of a mis-perceiving or misunderstanding of reality. A passion is a defective belief,&lt;ref name="bett"&gt;R Bett - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lK_cXAXtyXoC&amp;pg=PA546 A Companion to Ancient Philosophy] (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 9 Feb 2009) {{ISBN|1405178256}} [Retrieved 2015-3-15]&lt;/ref&gt; they occur when the mind makes errors about the values of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brennan|first=Tad|contribution=Stoic Moral Psychology|editor1-last=Inwood|editor1-first=Brad|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=276|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seneca states that his therapy has two main aims: one is that we do not become angry (resisting anger), and the other is that we do no wrong when we are angry (restraining anger).&lt;ref name="kastro"&gt;{{Cite book|author1-first=Rober A.|author1-last=Kaster|title=Seneca: Anger, Mercy, Revenge|chapter=On Anger|pages=9-13|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226748421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the advice is devoted to the first aim of preventing anger. Seneca does offer some practical advice on restraining anger (mostly in III.10-15) although after this he resumes his theme of preventing anger.&lt;ref name="kastro"/&gt; For the Stoics anger was contrary to human nature, and vengeance considered an evil, which explains Seneca's emphasis on anger prevention. The fact that he offers advice on merely restraining anger shows an awareness that his audience is one of male Roman aristocrats for whom anger was largely a part of everyday routine.&lt;ref name="kastro"/&gt;

==Later history==
The work survives due to being a part of the ''Codex Ambrosianus (no. 90)'' manuscript which dates from the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bVWcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|author=L.D.Reynolds, M.T.Griffin, E.Fantham|title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|publisher= Oxford University Press, 29 Mar 2012 (edited by S Hornblower, A Spawforth, E Eidinow) |isbn=0199545561| accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Colish|first=Marcia L.|title=The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages|volume=1|page=|year=1985|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004072675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the king|Devaraja (Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty)}}
[[Image:Harihara Majapahit 1.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The statue of [[Harihara]], the god amalgamation of [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]], as the mortuary deified portrayal of King [[Kertarajasa]] of [[Majapahit]]. Revering the king as god incarnated on earth is the concept of devaraja.]]

"'''Devarāja'''" is the [[cult]] of the "god-king", or [[divine|deified]] [[Monarch|king]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="God and King"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=7306 |title=God and King : The Devaraja Cult in South Asian Art &amp; Architecture |author=Sengupta, Arputha Rani (Ed.) |year=2005 |work= |publisher= |ISBN= 8189233262|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The devarāja cult grew out of both [[Hinduism]] and indigenous traditions.&lt;ref name ="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title = Devarāja |publisher= Britannica |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/159953/devaraja|||}}&lt;/ref&gt; It taught that the [[monarch|king]] was a divine universal ruler, a [[incarnation|manifestation]] of the Hindu god, often attributed to [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]]. The concept viewed the monarch to possess transcendental quality, the king as the living god on earth. The concept is closely related to [[India]]n concept of [[Chakravartin]] (universal monarch). In politics, it is viewed as the divine justification of a king's rule. The concept was institutionalized and gained its elaborate manifestations in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], where monuments such as [[Prambanan]] and [[Angkor Wat]] were erected to celebrate the king's divine rule on earth.

== Etymology ==
In [[Sanskrit]] the term ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]-[[raja]]'' could have different meanings such as "god-king" or "king of the gods". In [[Hindu gods|Hindu pantheon]] the title of  king of gods is often attributed to [[Shiva]], sometimes [[Vishnu]], or previously [[Indra]]. Thus the mortal kingdom on earth mirrored the celestial kingdom of gods, the concept regarded the king as the living god on earth. It is also from influences in Hinduism and indigenous traditions.

== Ritual ==
Example of devaraja cult — such as demonstrated by [[Jayavarman II]] — associate the king with the Hindu god Shiva, whose divine essence was represented by the linga (or [[lingam]]), a phallic idol housed in a mountain temple.&lt;ref name ="Britannica"/&gt; The king was deified in an elaborate and mystical ceremony, requiring a high priest, in which the divine essence of kingship was conferred on the ruler through the agency of the linga. The safeguarding of the linga became bound up with the security of the kingdom, and the great temple architecture of the Khmer period attests to the importance attached to the belief.&lt;ref name ="Britannica"/&gt;

== Purpose ==
The devaraja concept has been established through rituals and institutionalized within the [[Indianized kingdoms]] of Southeast Asia. It enables the monarch to claim the divine authority which could be use on ensuring political legitimacy, managing social order, economic and religious aspects. In political aspect it strengthen the justification of the king and the ruling dynasty as the righthful ruler of the land. It also used to maintain social order, exalting the king as living god definitely demands the utmost service and devotion of his people. Introducing the Indian [[caste system]] also defining social class, occupations, as well as the way of life of their people.

The devaraja cult also enabled the king to embark on large scale public works and grand projects, by mobilizing their people to create and maintain elaborate [[hydraulic]] irrigation system to support large scale [[rice]] agriculture, or to construct imposing grand monuments and temples in the king's honor. The example of this grand projects are [[Borobudur]], [[Prambanan]], also temples and [[baray]]s in [[Angkor]].

== Java ==

The devaraja cult is believed to be introduced to Java in 732, when [[Sanjaya of Mataram|king Sanjaya]] installed a linga to consecrate a new [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram Dynasty]], as stated in [[Canggal inscription]], thus the king seek Shiva's protection of his rule.&lt;ref name="Victor91"&gt;{{cite book |title= From Majapahit and Sukuh to Megawati Sukarnoputri: Continuity and Change in Pluralism of Religion, Culture and Politics of Indonesia from the XV to the XXI Century | first = Victor | last = M.

Even older [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom, the state religion regarded the king as god incarnated on earth. The Tarumanagara fifth century CE [[Ciaruteun inscription]], inscribed with king's [[Sole (foot)|sole]] print, regarded King Purnawarman as incarnation of Vishnu on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=tMs4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT57&amp;dq=Ciaruteun+sole+of+vishnu&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnpIzC6ubaAhXJP48KHZRDDkYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Malay Ancient Kingdoms: My Journey to the Ancient World of Nusantara|last=Khan|first=Nahar Akbar|date=2017-09-27|publisher=Partridge Publishing Singapore|isbn=9781543742602|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kebon Kopi I inscription, also called ''Telapak Gajah'' stone, with an inscription and the engraving of two large elephant footprints, associated king's elephant ride as [[Airavata]] (elephant ride of God [[Indra]]), thus associated the king also with Indra.

In [[Medang]] kingdom in Central Java, it is customary to erect ''[[candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temple) to honor and sent the soul of a dead king. The image of god inside the [[garbhagriha]] (central chamber) of the temple often portrayed the deceased king as a god, as the soul of the dead king finally united with the revered god in [[svarga]]loka. Some archaeologists propose that the statue of [[Shiva]] in the garbhagriha of [[Prambanan]] main temple was modelled after [[Balitung|King Balitung]], serving as a depiction of his posthumous deified self.&lt;ref&gt;Soetarno, Drs.

Semarang. {{ISBN|979-501-098-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the cult was the fusion of Hinduism with native [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed.|author=Drs.

In Java, the tradition of divine king continued well to [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]], [[Singhasari]], and [[Majapahit]] kingdom in the 15th century.

After the coming of [[Islam]] in the archipelago and the fall of Majapahit, the concept of God-King were most likely ceased to exist in Java, since Islam rejects the concept of divinity in mortal human being. Yet the concept survived in traditional Javanese mysticism of [[Kejawen]] as ''wahyu'', suggesting that every king and rulers in Java was bestowed ''wahyu'', a divine authority and mandate from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=kHb-640Gfa4C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Javanese+kingship+wahyu&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB28_26-baAhXMr48KHQf6BE8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Javanese%20kingship%20wahyu&amp;f=false|title=Java, Indonesia and Islam|last=Woodward|first=Mark|date=2010-10-28|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400700567|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A heavenly mandate that could be revoked and transferred by God, to explain the change of dynasty in Java during [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] era, well to the succession of the [[president of Indonesia]].

== Cambodia ==
[[File:Angkor Wat Northwest Pond View.jpg|thumb|left|The cult of Devaraja enabled Khmer kings to embark on grand-scale project, such as to build [[Angkor Wat]].]] 
In ancient Cambodia, devarāja is recognized as the state's institutionalized religion. The Cambodian the cult of the "god-king" is believed to be established early in the 9th century by Jayavarman II, founder of the Khmer empire of Angkor, with the brahmin scholar Sivakaivalya as his first chief priest at [[Mahendraparvata]].&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97,99}} For centuries, the cult provided the religious basis of the royal authority of the Khmer kings.&lt;ref name ="Britannica"/&gt;

In a [[Cambodia|Khmer]] context the term was used in the latter sense as "god-king", but occurs only in the Sanskrit portion of the inscription K. 235 from [[Sdok Kak Thom]] / Sdok Kăk Thoṃ (in modern Thailand) dated 8 February 1053 CE, referring to the Khmer term ''kamrateṅ jagat ta rāja'' ("Lord of the Universe who is King") describing the protective deity of the Khmer Empire, a distinctly Khmer deity, which was mentioned before in the inscription K. 682 of Chok Gargyar (Kòḥ Ker) dated 921/22 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Jacques, “The Kamrateṅ Jagat in ancient Cambodia”, ''Indus Valley to Mekong Delta. Explorations in Epigraphy'';  ed. by Noboru Karashima, Madras: New Era Publications, 1985, pp. 269-286&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sdok Kăk Thoṃ inscription a member of a [[brahmin]] family claimed that his ancestors since the time of [[Jayavarman II]] ({{lang-km|ជ័យវរ្ម័នទី២}}), who established around 800 CE by marriage to the daughter of a local king in the Angkor region a small realm which became at the end of the 9th century the famous [[Khmer Empire]], were responsible for the cult of the Devarāja (kamrateṅ jagat ta rāja). Historians formerly dated his reign as running from 802 CE to 850 CE, but these dates are of very late origin (11th century) and without any historical basis. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;see for example Michael Vickery, ''Society, Economics, and Politics in Pre-Angkor Cambodia: The 7th-8th Centuries'', Tokyo: The Centre for East Asian Cultural Studies for Unesco, The Toyo Bunko, 1998, p. 396: "Not only was Jayavarman II from the South; more than any other known king, he had particularly close links with Vyādhapura. This place is recorded in only one pre-Angkor inscription, K. 109/655 [exactly: 10th February 656], but in 16 Angkor-period texts, the last dated 1069 [K. 449 from Pàlhàl, dated Sunday, 3rd May 1069] … Two of them, K. 425/968 and K. 449/1069, are explicit records of Jayavarman II taking people from Vyādhapura to settle in Battambang”&lt;/ref&gt; now have tried to identify Jayavarman II with Jayavarman Ibis who is known from his inscriptions from Práḥ Thãt Práḥ Srĕi south of Kompoṅ Čàṃ (K. 103, dated 20 April 770)&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptions du Cambodge'', Vol. V, Paris 1953, pp. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; and from Lobŏ’k Srót in the vicinity of Kračèḥ close to the ancient town of Śambhupura (K. 134, dated 781 CE&lt;ref&gt;''Inscriptions du Cambodge'', Vol. II, Hanoi 1942, pp. 92-95&lt;/ref&gt;). The Sdok Kăk Thoṃ inscription incised c. 250 years after the events (of which their historicity is doubtful) recounts that on the top of the Kulen Hills, Jayavarman II instructed a brahmin priest named Hiraṇyadāman to conduct a religious ritual known as the cult of the devarāja ({{lang-km|ទេវរាជា}}) which placed him as a ''cakravartin'', universal monarch, a title never heard of before in Cambodia.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|99}}

Coedes states, "...in southern India, Mount Mahendra was considered the residence of Siva as king of all gods (''devaraja''), including Indra Devaraja, and as sovereign of the country where the mountain stands.  The ritual of the Devaraja established by the brahmin Hiranydama was based on four texts - ''Vinasikha'', ''Nayottara'', ''Sammoha'', and ''Siraccheda''...the four faces of [[Tumburu]].  These [[Tantras]] "were supposed to have been uttered by the four mouths of Siva represented by the [[gandharva]] Tumburu."  He goes on to state, "In the Indianized kingdoms of Southeast Asia, the Hindu cults...eventually became royal cults.  The essence of royalty...was supposed to reside in a [[linga]]...obtained from Siva through a brahmin who delivered it to the king...the communion between the king and the god through the medium of a priest took place on the sacred mountain."&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|100–101}}
  
Today, the tradition of public reverence to the [[King of Cambodia]] is said to be the continuation of this ancient devaraja cult,{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} and is mistakenly said of the [[King of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Wales"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/siamesestatecere030661mbp|title=Siamese state ceremonies|last=Wales|first=H.

==History and origin==
The name Dhagi is derived from the [[Hindi]] word dhaga, which means thread.  The community spin thread and weave cloth. They are one of a number of communities that have traditional been involved with weaving and spinning, such as the [[Sadh]], [[Kori (people)|Kori]] and [[Momin Ansari]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The traditional occupation of the Dhagi was weaving and spinning thread. With growing industrialisation of the Indian economy, the Dhagi have abandoned their traditional occupations. They are now mainly engaged in agriculture.&lt;ref name="A Hasan page 417"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 417&lt;/ref&gt;

The community have a fairly strong [[caste]] council, which maintains social control over the community. Any member of the community which breaches their cultural norms, can be subject to cash fines, or social ostracism.  They are a [[Hindu]] community, and follows the general customs of the area they reside. A small number of Dhagi, have converted  to [[Islam]], and now form a distinct community of [[Muslim Dhagi]]. The community is concentrated in the [[Awadh]] region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], and neighbouring state of [[Bihar]]. They speak [[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]].&lt;ref name="A Hasan page 417"/&gt;

{{about|papal document|the institution|Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei}}
'''''Ecclesia Dei''''' is the [[incipit]] of the ''[[motu proprio]]'' of 2 July 1988 that [[Pope John Paul II]] issued in reaction to the [[Ecône Consecrations|consecration]], in spite of an express prohibition by the [[Holy See]], of four bishops by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] and Bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] in [[Écône]], [[Switzerland]], at the seminary of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX), an association of priests that Archbishop Lefebvre had founded in 1970 and whose members distrusted the changes then taking place in the Church.

==Excommunication of the bishops involved==
Referring to Archbishop Lefebvre's action, the Pope declared in the ''motu proprio'': "In itself, this act was one of ''disobedience'' to the Roman Pontiff in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church, such as is the ordination of bishops whereby the apostolic succession is sacramentally perpetuated. Hence such disobedience – which implies in practice the rejection of the [[Papal primacy|Roman primacy]] – constitutes a ''[[schism (religion)|schismatic]]'' act (cf. ''Code of Canon Law'', can. 751). In performing such an act, notwithstanding the formal ''canonical warning'' sent to them by the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops on 17 June last, Mons. [[Marcel Lefebvre|Lefebvre]] and the priests [[Bernard Fellay]], [[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] and [[Alfonso de Galarreta]] have incurred the grave penalty of [[excommunication]] envisaged by ecclesiastical law (cf. ''Code of Canon Law'', can. 1382)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html ''Ecclesia Dei''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129194411/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html |date=January 29, 2015 }}, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Followers of Archbishop Lefebvre==
Pope John Paul II went on to make "an appeal both solemn and heartfelt, paternal and fraternal, to all those who until now have been linked in various ways to the movement of Archbishop Lefebvre, that they may fulfil the grave duty of remaining united to the Vicar of Christ in the unity of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and of ceasing their support in any way for that movement. Everyone should be aware that formal adherence to the [[schism (religion)|schism]] is a grave offence against God and carries the penalty of [[excommunication]] decreed by the Church's law (cf. ''Code of Canon Law'', can. 1364)."&lt;ref&gt;''Ecclesia Dei'', 5 c)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope instituted the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'']] to assist those who had been associated with Archbishop Lefebvre but who wished "to remain united to the Successor of Peter in the Catholic Church, while preserving their spiritual and liturgical traditions, in the light of the Protocol signed on 5 May last by Cardinal Ratzinger and Mons. Lefebvre",  &lt;ref&gt;''Ecclesia Dei'', 6 a)&lt;/ref&gt; a protocol that Archbishop Lefebvre later repudiated.

==Use of the Tridentine Mass==
The Pope stated: "Respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the Latin liturgical tradition, by a wide and generous application of the directives already issued some time ago by the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]] for the use of the [[Roman Missal]] according to the typical edition of 1962". In this the Pope expanded the scope of permission already granted under the 1984 special indult ''[[Quattuor Abhinc Annos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Congregation for Divine Worship, Letter ''Quattuor abhinc annos''. 3 Oct. 1984: AAS 76 (1984) pp. 1088-1089)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions indicated in the document to which Pope John Paul referred were replaced on 7 July 2007 by those indicated in the ''motu proprio'' ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_lt.html ''Summorum Pontificum''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919010024/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_lt.html |date=September 19, 2009 }}, article 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fasting girl''' was one of a number of young [[Victorian era|Victorian]] girls, usually pre-adolescent, who claimed to be able to survive over indefinitely long periods of time without consuming any food or other nourishment.  In addition to refusing food, fasting girls claimed to have special religious or magical powers.

The ability to survive without nourishment was attributed to some saints during the [[Middle Ages]], including [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Lidwina|Lidwina of Schiedam]], and regarded as a miracle and a sign of sanctity. Numerous cases of fasting girls were reported in the late 19th century. Believers regarded such cases as miraculous.

In some cases, the fasting girls also exhibited the appearance of [[stigmata]]. Doctors, however, such as [[William A. Hammond]] ascribed the phenomenon to fraud and [[hysteria]] on the part of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Blustein, Bonnie Ellen. (1991). ''Preserve Your Love for Science: Life of William A Hammond, American Neurologist''. Cambridge University Press. p. 197. {{ISBN|0-521-39262-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Joan Jacobs Brumberg]] believes the phenomenon to be an early example of [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9507E7DF173BF93BA35751C1A963948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Anorexia: It's Not A New Disease | first=Carol | last=Lawson | date=December 8, 1985 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D9123AF93AA25756C0A96E948260 | work=The New York Times | title=HEALTH; Personal Health | first=Jane E. | last=Brody | date=May 19, 1988 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mollie Fancher==
Mary J. "Mollie" Fancher (August 16, 1848 – February, 1916), otherwise known as the "Brooklyn Enigma", was extremely well known for her claim of not eating, or eating very little for extended periods of time. She attended a reputable school and, by all reports, was an excellent student. At age 16, she was diagnosed with [[dyspepsia]]. At around the age of 19, reports came out that she had abstained from eating for seven weeks.

It was after two accidents, in 1864 and 1865, that she became famous for her ability to abstain from food. As a result of the accidents, Mollie Fancher lost her ability to see, touch, taste, and smell. She claimed to have powers that involved her being able to predict events as well as to read without the ability of sight.

By the late 1870s, she was claiming to eat little or nothing at all for many months. Her claim to abstinence from food lasted for 14 years. Doctors and people in the public began to question her abilities and wished to perform tests to determine the truthfulness of her claims. The claims to abstinence were never verified, and she died in February 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Fasting Girls'' pp. 78–85&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Mystery of Mollie Fancher, ‘The Fasting Girl,’ and Others Who Lived without Eating | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 18-21 | year = 2017 | last1 = Nickell | first1 = Joe | authorlink = Joe Nickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sarah Jacob ==
[[File:Sarah jacob.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sarah Jacob.]]

A case that led to a death and arrests was that of [[Sarah Jacob]] (May 12, 1857 – December 17, 1869), the "Welsh fasting girl", who claimed not to have eaten any food at all after the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welshlegalhistory.org/research-jacob-trial-report.php |title=The Welsh Fasting Girl - Report of the trial |publisher=Welshlegalhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local vicar, initially skeptical, became convinced that the case was authentic, and Jacob enjoyed a long period of publicity, during which she received numerous gifts and donations from people who believed she was miraculous.

Doctors were becoming increasingly skeptical about her claims, and eventually proposed that she be monitored in a hospital environment to see whether her claims about fasting were true. In 1869, her parents agreed for a test to be conducted under strict supervision by nurses from [[Guy's Hospital]]. The nurses were instructed not to deny Jacob food if she asked for it, but to see that any she received was observed and recorded. After two weeks, she was showing clear signs of [[starvation]].

The [[vicar]] told the parents that she was failing and that the nurses ought to be sent away so that she could get food. The parents refused, and continued to refuse even when informed that their daughter was dying, insisting that they had frequently seen her like this before and that lack of food had nothing to do with her symptoms. Jacob died of starvation a few days later, and it was found that she had actually been consuming very little amounts of food secretly, which she could no longer do under medical supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Fasting Girls'', pp. 65–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Hammond|title=Fasting Girls: Their Physiology and Pathology|year=1879|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0DWxpX3UWeJnPL50fRxI&amp;id=7xhj190X1hgC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22fasting+girls%22&amp;as_brr=1#PPP7,M1 page images] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were convicted of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to [[hard labour]].&lt;ref name="sid"&gt;Staff (May&amp;nbsp;26, 1873). "The Case of Trance at Turville". ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'': p.&amp;nbsp;3. (Reprinted from ''[[The Observer]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other fasting girls==
Another case was that of New Jersey's Lenora Eaton in 1881. Reputable citizens in Eaton's town promoted her as someone who had "lived without eating". During these times, Eaton was marked as a "special person and symbol of faith in the miraculous". When these claims were investigated and doctors were sent to help her, Eaton continued to refuse to eat and died after forty-five days.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Fasting Girls'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, the ''Boston Globe'' ran a story, "Who Took the Cold Potato? Dr. Mary Walker Says the Fasting Girl Bit a Doughnut."&lt;ref&gt;"Who Took the Cold Potato? Dr. Mary Walker Says the Fasting Girl Bit a Doughnut." The Boston Daily Globe, April 9, 1889, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Walker reported that Josephine Marie Bedard, known as the Tingwick girl, was a fraud. The evidence was circumstantial: "At the hotel I searched her clothing and found in one of her pockets a doughnut with a bite taken out of it.... On Fast day I had a lunch served to me... I left a platter with three pieces of fried potato on it. I went there and one of the pieces was gone... when I returned, Josephine had her handkerchief to her mouth." Asked whether that was all the evidence, she said, "after I accused her of it she broke down and cried."

Because fasting girls were such a curiosity in the Victorian era, many companies and individuals rushed to put them on display. In the case of Josephine Marie Bedard, two different Boston-based enterprises, the Nickelodeon and Stone and Shaw's museum, competed in court for the right to "exhibit the girl" publicly. Still, even as she was used for blatant commercial gain, there was also an element of scientific inquiry in regarding Bedard as a medical phenomenon. While a modern institutional review board would not have approved the violation of privacy for these young women for commercial gain, the practice was allowed in the Victorian era as demonstrated in the examples.

{{Religion in Afghanistan}}
'''Freedom of religion in Afghanistan''' has changed in recent years because the current government of [[Afghanistan]] has only been in place since 2002, following a [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S.-led invasion]] which displaced the former [[Taliban]] government.  The [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] is dated January 23, 2004, and its initial three articles mandate:

:# Afghanistan shall be an Islamic Republic, independent, unitary, and indivisible state.
:# The sacred religion of Islam shall be the religion of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Followers of other faiths shall be free within the bounds of law in the exercise and performance of their religious rights.
:# No law shall contravene the tenets and provisions of the holy religion of Islam in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;

In the past, small communities of [[Hindu]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Christian]]s also lived in the country; however, most members of these communities have left.  Even at their peak, these non-Muslim minorities constituted only one percent of the population.  Almost all members of the country's small Hindu and Sikh population, which once numbered about 50,000, have emigrated or taken refuge abroad.  Non-Muslims such as Hindus and Sikhs now number only in the hundreds, often working as traders. The few Christians and Jews who live in the country are mostly foreigners who are in the country to carry out relief work on behalf of foreign [[non-governmental organization]] (NGOs).

==History==
The Taliban imposed its interpretation of Islamic law, establishing a "Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice" for purposes of enforcement. One of the Ministry's duties was to operate a body of religious police who enforced edicts on dress code, employment, access to medical care, behavior, religious practice, and expression. Persons found to be in violation of an edict were often subject to punishment meted out on the spot, which included beatings and detention.

The Taliban persecuted members of other Islamic sects as well as non-Muslims.  Traditionally, Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence has been the dominant form of [[Islam]] in Afghanistan. This school counts the Taliban among its followers. The Deoband [[madrassa]] (religious school) near Delhi, India, has been a source of influence for these Sunni for approximately 200 years. Most of the Taliban leadership attended Deobandi-influenced seminaries in Pakistan. The Deoband school has long sought to "purify" Islam by discarding supposedly un-Islamic accretions to the faith and reemphasizing the models established in the [[Qur'an]] and Hadith. Deobandi scholars often have opposed what they perceive as Western influences. Much of the population adheres to Deobandi-influenced Hanafi Sunnism, but a sizable minority adheres to a more mystical version of Hanafi Sunnism generally known as Sufism.  Sufism centers on orders or brotherhoods that follow charismatic religious leaders.

The Shi'a, under the Taliban, were among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country. An ethnic group known as the Hazara is predominantly Shi'a Muslim. There also are small numbers of [[Ismailis]] living in the central and northern parts of the country.  Ismailis are Shi'a Muslims, but consider the [[Aga Khan]] their spiritual leader.

In March 2015, a 27-year-old Afghan woman [[murder of Farkhunda|was murdered]] by a mob in [[Kabul]] over false allegations of burning a copy of the [[Koran]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/23/attention-from-media-family-would-be-in-danger | title=Farkhunda's family take comfort from tide of outrage in wake of her death | work=The Guardian | date=23 March 2015 | accessdate=23 March 2015 | author=Rasmussen, Sune Engel}}&lt;/ref&gt; After beating and kicking Farkhunda, the mob threw her over a bridge, set her body on fire and threw it in the river.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/23/asia/afghanistan-woman-killed/ | title=26 arrests after mob beats, burns Afghan woman | work=CNN | date=23 March 2015 | accessdate=23 March 2015 | author=Whiteman, Hilary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban prohibited free speech about religious issues or discussions that challenge orthodox Sunni Muslim views.  Publishing and distribution of literature of any kind, including religious material, was rare.  In 1998 television sets, videocassette recorders, videocassettes, audiocassettes, and satellite dishes were outlawed in order to enforce the prohibition.  However, subsequent reports indicated that many persons in urban areas around the country continued to own such electronic devices despite the ban.  The Taliban continues to prohibit music, movies, and television on religious grounds in areas that it still holds.

==Religious discrimination==
{{Updatesection|date=October 2017}}
===Discrimination against non-Muslims===

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), in September 1999, the Taliban issued decrees that forbade non-Muslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites, forbade non-Muslims from criticizing Muslims, ordered non-Muslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops, forbade non-Muslims from living in the same residence as Muslims, and required that non-Muslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that Muslims could keep their distance.

The constitution limits the political rights of Afghanistan's non-Muslims, and only Muslims are allowed to become the [[President of Afghanistan|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://president.gov.af/english/constitution.mspx| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305081410/http://president.gov.af/english/constitution.mspx| archivedate=5 March 2009| title=The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan| publisher=[[Government of Afghanistan]]| accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination against Sikhs===

In May 2001, according to news reports, the Taliban considered an edict requiring Sikhs to wear identifying badges on their clothing. On May 23, 2001, Taliban radio announced that the edict was approved by religious officials. However, Mullah Omar reportedly did not sign the edict and it was not implemented by the Taliban.  The Taliban claim was that the proposed edict would protect Sikh citizens from harassment by members of the religious police. International observers regarded the proposed edict as part of the Taliban's efforts to segregate and isolate non-Muslim citizens, and to encourage more Sikh emigration.  The reaction of Sikh citizens reportedly ranged from indifference to outrage.

===Discrimination against Hazara Shia Muslims===
Repression by the Taliban of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group, which is predominantly [[Shia]] Muslim, was particularly severe.  Although the conflict between the Hazaras and the Taliban was political and military as well as religious, and it is not possible to state with certainty that the Taliban engaged in its campaign against the Shi'a solely because of their religious beliefs, the religious affiliation of the Hazaras apparently was a significant factor leading to their repression.

The Taliban have been accused of committing mass killings of the Hazaras particularly in the north. It has been claimed that the Taliban massacred thousands of civilians and prisoners during and after the capture of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in August 1998; this massacre reportedly was aimed at ethnic Hazaras.  In September 1998, approximately 500 persons were killed as the Taliban gained control of the city of Bamiyan.  The Hazaras regained control of [[Bamyan City|Bamiyan]] in April 1999 following prolonged guerilla-style warfare; however, the Taliban recaptured Bamiyan in May 1999 and reportedly killed a number of Shi'a residents.

In January 2001, several NGO's reported that the Taliban massacred several hundred Shi'a civilians in [[Yakaolang]] in the center of the country.  The massacre reportedly occurred after the Taliban recaptured the area from opposition forces.  According to witnesses interviewed by HRW, after the Taliban recaptured the area, they rounded up victims from the surrounding villages, and shot or stabbed them with bayonets in the town center.

Besides claims of [[genocide]], there are claims of forced [[Population transfer|expulsion]]s of ethnic Hazaras and Tajiks from areas controlled or conquered by the Taliban, as well as harassment of these minorities throughout Taliban-controlled areas.

==Freedom to proselytize==
A small number of foreign [[Christian]] groups were allowed in the country to provide humanitarian assistance; however, they were forbidden by the Taliban to proselytize. A June 2001 decree stated that proselytizing by non-Muslims was [[Death penalty|punishable by death]] or deportation in the case of foreigners.  Taliban officials subsequently stated that the decree was only a guideline.

On August 3, 2001 Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer were arrested by the Taliban along with 22 others for their work with ''Shelter Now'', a Christian aid organization based in Germany. The Taliban also seized [[Bible]]s and videos and audio tapes from the members of the group. The workers were tried for violating the Taliban prohibition against proselytizing. On November 15, 2001 Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer were freed by [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] forces, after the Taliban had fled [[Kabul]].

==Freedom to practice a religion==
Prayer was mandatory for all, and those found not praying at appointed times or who were late attending prayer were punished, often by severe beatings.  There were reports in 1998 that Ministry members in Kabul stopped persons on the street and demanded that they recite various Koranic prayers in order to determine the extent of their religious knowledge.

== Destruction of Buddha statues ==
In March 2001, the Taliban destroyed two giant pre-Islamic [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] statues carved into cliffs in [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]] province, on the grounds that statues are [[idolatry|idolatrous]] and insulting to Islam.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  The Taliban destroyed the statues despite appeals from the [[United Nations]], international NGOs, and the world community, including many Muslim countries, to preserve the two-thousand-year-old statues.

'''Gaja''' ('''गज'''- a [[Sanskrit]] word for [[elephant]]) is one of the significant animals finding references in [[Hindu scriptures]] and [[Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] texts. In general, a gaja personifies a number of positive attributes, including abundance, fertility and richness; boldness and strength; and wisdom and royalty. In European Portuguese, it means "physically attractive female"; its origin in the Portuguese language can be related to a personification of fertility, as mentioned.

==History==
In the context of the history of [[History of India|Ancient India]], the earliest depiction of gaja is found on the seals discovered at sites (like [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]]) of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (3000 BC – 1700 BC). Some scholars believe that by that time elephants had been tamed and domesticated, and used for peaceful and possibly for other purposes. Rigveda 8-33-8 mentions a Wild Elephant.&lt;ref&gt;http://sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08033.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Megasthenes]], the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ambassador to the court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] reports use of [[war elephant]]s during warfare.

Over a period of time encompassing several centuries, elephants became an important part of Indian life and society, particularly of religious tradition, the royalty, and the aristocratic segment of the society. Capturing, taming and training of elephants developed into a specialized skill. In Ancient India, a number of treatises were written about caring and management of elephants, which included the following:

*Palakapya’s ''Hastayurvea'' dealing with the management of good health of elephants.
*''Matangalila'' by Nilakantha

==Mythology==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ganesh.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ganesha]]]] --&gt;

The legend states that [[Airavata]], the first elephant, emerged from the [[Churning of the Milky Ocean|churning of the ocean]]. There is another [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account, which states that [[Brahma]] created elephants. 

The Buddhist tradition states that Buddha came into the womb of his mother in the form of an elephant having six tusks. According to Jaina tradition, each of the mother of the twenty-four thirthankars dreamt of fourteen auspicious objects, which included an elephant. 
In Hinduism, [[Ganesh]], a god with the elephant’s head has been an object of reverence and worship for more than two millennia. He is therefore called as '''Gajanan'''(Gaj=elephant, aanan= faced). Several deities and mythological figures have elephants as their conveyance (vahan) including Balarama, Skanda and aiyanar. 

An elephant is also one of several attributes of a [[Chakravartin]], which he is expected to own to be bestowed with the title of Chakravatin, that is, the supreme and universal ruler.

The '''International Sahaja Public School''' in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], India is a school run by the [[Sahaja Yoga]] movement. The school was founded in 1990.

==Overview==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ISPS2.jpeg|thumb|The middle building]] --&gt;

The school is located in the [[Dhauladhar|Himalayas]], above [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] in the [[Kangra district]], near [[McLeod Ganj]], at an altitude of more than 1700m. Children coming to the school must have previously been brought up in Sahaja Yoga culture and understand the importance of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isps.edu.in/site/index.asp?pageid=63 ISPS, Dharamshala&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Their education is based on the teachings of [[Nirmala Srivastava]].&lt;ref name="sukhmani"/&gt; Students "learn the basic principles of Sahaja Yoga ... the tenets of Hinduism and worship the school’s patron".&lt;ref name="sukhmani"&gt;[http://www.hvk.org/articles/1200/148.html "A School for tradition"], The Indian Express, 24 December 2000, by Sukhmani Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

The medium of instruction is English. Subjects (as followed by the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] curriculum) include standard courses as well as English, German, Indian Classical Music (including instruments), and Indian Classical dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisce.org/cisce/ProgramFile/InfoGallery/HomePage/Click.asp?LinkName=SLB&amp;strLinkName=Syllabus ICSE syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed views==

Judith Coney reports that the school has accepted children from the age of four and notes that "often very young children are separated from their natural parents for prolonged periods, as they usually stay in India for nine months".&lt;ref&gt;Coney, Judith (1999) ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'', (London: Curzon Press) {{ISBN|0-7007-1061-2}} p159&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian newspaper article published in 2000 reported that students at the time were aged six and above.&lt;ref name="sukhmani"/&gt;

An official school statement said that the villagers bring presents to the students and enjoy looking after them. A 1995 report on the school by the Austrian Ministry of Justice has said that uninvited visitors 'dropping in' have been refused entry&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Sahaja Yoga School, May 1995, Ministry of Justice, Republic of Austria, cited in "Growing Up As Mother's Children: Socializing a Second Generation in Sahaja Yoga" by Judith Coney in ''Children in New Religions Susan'' J. Palmer, Charlotte Hardman, Rutgers University Press (July 1999) p.117 "It is clear, too, that in contrast to the British children of Sahaja Yogis living in the United Kingdom, those attending the India school have little access to outside influences. A statement made by Sahaja Yogis about the school in India says that 'many women from the village come to see the children, bring presents for them and look after them. The whole village enjoys looking after these children' (Sahaja Yoga 1992b:3). But the Austrian report on the school in 1995 stated: 'People dropping in at the door are—[in a] more or less unfriendly [manner]—refused. Because of that refusal of contact, the domestic and foreign population nearby does not know anything about the teachers, pupils and the daily routine at the school, which is-regarding the rustic surrounding-an astonishing fact.'&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; The school takes no children other than those belonging to Sahaja Yoga. Access to television and radio is not allowed, and 'the children seem to lack further information of or about their home countries.'&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Contact between the children and their parents has been limited. The children have been allowed to write home once a week and receive packages from home twice a year; parents may telephone from time to time."&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the domestic and foreign population nearby does not know anything about the teachers, pupils and the daily routine at the school, which is-regarding the rustic surrounding-an astonishing fact."&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Sahaja Yoga School, May 1995, Ministry of Justice, Republic of Austria, cited in ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'' by Judith Coney (1999) p161&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 article in the Indian Express noted that "an aura of secrecy envelops the school and entry is strictly forbidden."&lt;ref name="sukhmani"/&gt; The article quoted a director of the school as saying "...we don’t like the vibrations to be polluted by outsiders. Sometimes we even tell parents not to come here." Students are schooled in 'vibratory awareness'&lt;ref name="sukhmani"/&gt; which practitioners say enables them to detect and treat subtle imbalances in themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahajayoga.org.au/] Sahaja Yoga Australia - benefits of Sahaja Yoga.&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the school's vision of fulfilling the students' physical, emotional, intellectual and, above all, spiritual potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isps.edu.in/site/index.asp?pageid=7&amp;subpage=8&amp;subsubpage=18 Vision and Mission], ISPS website, viewed 22 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the school website, Sahaja Yoga education "envisages the development of the child in an atmosphere where the innate qualities, such as innocence and wisdom, are protected and enhanced; where the students imbibe the timeless and unchanging values which come from inner awareness, and are not subject to the vagaries of fashion, religion or national culture."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.isps.edu.in/site/index.asp?pageid=7 ISPS, Dharamshala&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Express article noted that the "dormitories are austere, even monastic in appearance".&lt;ref name="sukhmani"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are realised souls, there is God who is looking after them, why are you so much worried about them? Leave them alone! Send them to the Indian school. Then the mothers are sitting there, teachers don't like it, no one likes it. They are just gone there. The mothers. No school allows such nonsense! But in Sahaja Yoga they think they have the right. What right have they got? Have they paid for the school? Have they done anything for the school? What right have they got to go and sit in the school? So the discretion should be, we have to bring up our children according to Sahaj culture. The first of the principles of Sahaja Yoga is fortitude. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such .... dainty darlings. You have to be soldiers of Sahaja Yoga. - [[Nirmala Srivastava]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Austrian Ministry of Justice's 1995 ''Report on the Sahaja Yoga school'' comments that "Despite the altitude, eight months of sunshine a year and outdoor activities and sports in the open, the European children appeared pale which was unexplainable to the visitor".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Judith Coney (1999), ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'' p243&lt;/ref&gt; Coney reports that one child arrived home having lost a [[Stone (Imperial mass)|stone]] in weight, and so changed in appearance that his mother could not recognise him, although the school had consistently reported that he was 'doing fine'.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Coney, ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'' (1999) p164 "One child arrived home from the school having lost over a stone in weight and was so changed in appearance that his mother failed to recognise him at the airport. The school, however, had consistently reported throughout the year that he was 'doing fine'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Coney reports that, "whilst there is evidence that some children have enjoyed their time at the Sahaja Yoga school in India, a number of children have expressed unhappiness at being returned to the India school."&lt;ref&gt;Judith Coney, ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'' (1999) p166&lt;/ref&gt; The school advises parents not to enroll their children until they are ready.

Regarding discipline, Sukhmani writes that corporal punishment is taboo at the school.&lt;ref name="sukhmani"/&gt; Nirmala Srivastava has advised that parents are allowed to occasionally slap 'extremely difficult' children, but forbids teachers from slapping children or punishing "in such a way that the child gets hurt."&lt;ref name="Shri Mataji Sahaja Yoga"&gt;Her Holiness Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi, ''Sahaja Yoga'' (1989) p44 "The Sahaja Yogis must respect their children. The teachers must also respect the children. If the children are extremely difficult then the parents can sometimes slap them, but not the teachers. No teacher is allowed to in any way punish the child in such a way that the child gets hurt."&lt;/ref&gt; Coney reports that due to instances of children having been beaten, the Headmaster was temporarily dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Coney, ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'' (1999) p164&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of India]] banned corporal punishment in schools in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Spare_rod_or_be_punished_teachers_told/rssarticleshow/2269835.cms "Spare rod or be punished, teachers told"], ''[[The Times of India]]'', 10 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes of grandparents==

There have been instances of objections by grandparents of children at the school which have resulted in legal action being taken. In Austria, a mother's guardianship was partly substituted, after legal intervention of the grandmother, as she was not willing to take her boy out of the Sahaja Yoga boarding-school in India.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Schinkele, ''Rechtsprechung in Österreichisches Archiv für Kirchenrecht'' 45 [1998], ibid., pp. 306-317, cited in Eva M Synek, [http://www.jsri.ro/old/html%20version/index/no_3/eva_synek-articol.htm "The Limits of Religious Tolerance - a European Perspective"]&lt;/ref&gt; A French Court of Appeal allowed another mother custody of her children on condition that she did not send any of them to the school, again a result of grandparental intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Coney, ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'' (1999) p162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Coney says these instances are confined to the European continent partly because the anti cult movement there has successfully drawn attention to the differences between Sahaja Yoga and the mainstream, resulting in a media attack on the movement.&lt;ref name="Children in New Religions p119"&gt;Susan J. Palmer, Charlotte Hardman: ''Growing Up As Mother's Children: Socializing a Second Generation in Sahaja Yoga'' by Judith Coney in ''Children in New Religions'', page 119, Rutgers University Press, July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Coney says in the UK grandparents have been more likely to give parents freedom to bring up children as they wish, in a couple of instances even paying for the child's education at the school.&lt;ref name="Children in New Religions p119"/&gt; The enrolment form used in the admission procedure now asks for details of any resistance from family members to the child studying at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isps.edu.in/site/files/Enrollment_Form.pdf Enrolment Form]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as [[Archdiocese of Caracas|Archbishop of Caracas]] from 1960 to 1980, and was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1961.

==Biography==
José Quintero Parra was born in [[Mucuchíes]], [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]], to Genaro Quintero and his wife Perpetua Parra, and was later [[Baptism|baptized]] on October 31, 1902. He studied at the [[seminary]] in Mérida and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]] (from where he obtained his [[doctorate]]s in [[Doctor of Theology|theology]] and [[Doctor of Canon Law|canon law]]) before being [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] by Archbishop [[Filippo Cortesi]] on August 22, 1926. Quintero then did [[Parish (Catholic Church)|pastoral]] work in [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] until 1929, when he was named [[Personal assistant|private secretary]] to the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Archbishop]] of the same city, [[Acacio Chacón Guerra]]. Serving as Archbishop Chacón's secretary until 1934, he was also [[secretary]] of the [[Curia (Roman Catholic Church)|archdiocesan curia]] and [[vicar general]] of Mérida from 1929 to 1953.

On September 7, 1953, Quintero was appointed [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor Archbishop]] of Mérida and [[Titular bishop|Titular Archbishop]] of ''Achrida'' by [[Pope Pius XII]]. He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on the following December 6 from [[Adeodato Giovanni Piazza]], [[Discalced Carmelites|OCD]], with Archbishops [[Luigi Centoz]] and [[Giuseppe Misuraca]] serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]], in the [[chapel]] of the ''[[Collegio Pio Latinoamericano]]'' at Rome. Quintero was later named [[Archdiocese of Caracas|Archbishop of Caracas]] on August 31, 1960.

'''Julia Lynch Olin''' (October 21, 1882 &amp;ndash; March 11, 1961) was an American author and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] who co-founded the New History Society in [[New York City]], and was later expelled from the religion by [[Shoghi Effendi]] around 1939. Through marriage, she was a member of the [[Astor family|Astor]] and Dudley–Winthrop families.&lt;ref name="MrsLSCObit1961"/&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
Julia was first introduced to the teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] about 1925, as she states in her auto-biography.  Becoming intimately associated with [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] they together with her second husband, started the ''New History Society''.&lt;ref name="NSA1941"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Basis of the Bahá'í Community: A Statement Concerning the New History Society|date=1941|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States|url=http://bahai-library.com/nsa_new_history|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This Society, based in the home that Julia and Lewis owned in New York, (later called ''Caravan House''), published several books, into the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="MrsLSCObit1961"/&gt;  It apparently became defunct after Sohrab and/or Julia had died.

In 1929, he and Julia formed an educational organization called ''[[Caravan of East and West]]'' with a quarterly magazine called ''The Caravan''. This magazine is where Sohrab's partial autobiography first appeared, also in 1929.&lt;ref name="MrsLSCObit1961"/&gt;

Also that year, an article appeared in which the engagement of her daughter Elsie Benkard to Charles H. Clarke was announced.&lt;ref name="1929Engagement"/&gt;  The marriage announcement appeared on February 27, 1930, stating that ".....they were married with a Bahai ceremony. It was the first time that such a ceremony..... has been used at a society wedding in New York. Mirza Ahmad Sohrab officiated."&lt;ref name="1930Wedding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1934MarriageCeremony"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chanler|first1=Julie|title=BAHA'I MARRIAGE CEREMONY|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1934/02/25/archives/bahai-marriage-ceremony.html|accessdate=25 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 February 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New History Society was addressed by several luminaries, including [[Albert Einstein]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="EINSTEIN1930"&gt;{{cite news|title=EINSTEIN ADVOCATES RESISTANCE TO WAR; If Only 2% of Eligibles Refused to Join Army, Jails Would Not Hold Them, He Says.

===Expulsion===
She was expelled from the Bahá'í community in 1939 along with Lewis and Sohrab after they refused to allow the Local [[Spiritual Assembly]] of New York oversight over the operations of the New History Society. They went on to support the efforts of [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], and at one point petitioned the President of [[Israel]] for Muhammad `Alí's property rights when he tried to assert his control over the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name="Aghdasi1994"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aghdasi|first1=Farzin|title=The Vision of Shoghi Effendi|url=http://www.bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm|website=bci.org|publisher=Association for Baha'i Studies University of British Columbia|accessdate=25 August 2017|date=Spring 1994|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515041702/http://www.bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm|archivedate=15 May 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its mission, the New History Society, for many years sponsored an essay-contest. At least one of the winners of this, [[Jaja Wachuku]], became famous in his own right, for his essay "How Can the People of the World Achieve Universal Disarmament?" written while at the New Africa University College.&lt;ref name="Chanler1956"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chanler|first1=Julie|title=From Gaslight to Dawn|date=1956|url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/C/Chanler/FGTD.htm|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of the Russian Orthodox Church|History of Christianity in Ukraine}}
The history of the Russian (Ruthenian) Orthodox Church is usually traced to the [[Baptism of Rus']] at [[Kiev]], the date of which is commonly given as 988; however, the evidence surrounding this event is contested (see [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Christianisation of Kievan Rus']]).

It is not certainly known when exactly the Metropolis of Kiev was established.&lt;ref name=eou/&gt; Since the foundation of the church its hierarch held a title Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia with his episcopal see located in the city of [[Kiev]] (or possibly [[Tmutarakan]]).&lt;ref name=eou/&gt; The church was created as part of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. There is an evidence that the first bishop might have been dispatched to Kiev in 864 by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios I]] before the official Christianization of 988.&lt;ref name="eou"&gt;Lencyk, W. ''[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CH%5CChristianizationofUkraine.htm Christianization of Ukraine]''. [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; It happened after Kiev was captured by [[Varangians]] in 860.&lt;ref name=eou/&gt; It is also apparent that Prince of Kiev [[Askold]] might have been baptized due to the fact that there exist the [[Askold Grave Church|Saint Nicholas Church]] at the [[Askold's Grave]].&lt;ref name=eou/&gt; During a rule of Prince [[Igor of Kiev]], in Kiev existed the Saint Elijah Church,&lt;ref name=eou/&gt; while during signing the 944 treaty with the Greeks some Ruthenians took an oath on the Bible.&lt;ref name=eou/&gt;

The earliest [[metropolitan bishop]] whose name is known is [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael of Kiev]].

Following [[Mongol invasion]] and the 1240 sack of Kiev by [[Batu Khan]] communications between Kiev and Constantinople deteriorated. On the demand of the [[Golden Horde]] the newly appointed [[Kirill III of Kiev]] had to govern from the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], yet the official transfer of the episcopal see did not occur until 1299. Governing the church from Vladimir and later Moscow, hierarchs continued to be called Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia. Grand Princes of Vladimir and later Moscow were controlling Kiev on the permission of the Khan of the Golden Horde.

Two other successor states of the [[Kievan Rus']], [[Kingdom of Rus]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogotia]] that controlled portion of territory of former Rus demanded to establish separate dioceses independent from Moscow. Sometimes their demands were approved, other times former eparchies were returned under jurisdiction of Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia. During the 14th century the church was de facto split in two or three. The [[Great Duchy of Moscow]] completely lost control of Kiev in the mid 14th century.

Starting from the 15th century, the church was finally reunited and was continued to be governed from Moscow by Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia, while being located in the neighboring country. During that time in the Holy Roman Empire was taken place [[Council of Florence]] as a political and religious forum. While resisting at first, the Great Prince of Moscow allowed the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia [[Isidore of Kiev]] to attend it. Isidore who was of Greek origin went forward to sign the [[Florentine Union]] uniting the Russian Orthodox Church with the [[Latin Church]]. The Great Prince of Moscow voided the union and placed Isidore in prison for sometime. Following that incident, the next Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia [[Jonah of Moscow|Jonah]] who was not approved by the Constantinople Patriarch changed his title to Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia. Since then and until 1589, no hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow were approved by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] declaring their complete autocephaly.

Nonetheless, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] continued to appoint his metropolitans for dioceses of the '''Ruthenian Orthodox Church'''&lt;ref name="slocombe"&gt;Slocombe, G.

Oxford University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The next hierarch of the '''Ruthenian Orthodox Church'''&lt;ref name=slocombe/&gt;&lt;ref name=frick/&gt; in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth [[Gregory the Bulgarian]] was originally consecrated by a [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]] and received a title of Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia. Later his appointed was also approved by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] as well. The episcopal see of the new hierarch was located in [[Vilnius]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

In 1588–1589 [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Jeremias II of Constantinople]] when traveling across the Eastern Europe, visited both Moscow and Vilnius. In Moscow Jeremias confirmed autocephaly of the Russian Orthodox Church and for the first time since 1448 consecrated [[Patriarch Job of Moscow|Job of Moscow]] as the Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. Later Jeremias stopped in Vilnius and consecrated [[Michael Rohoza]] as Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia, thus again confirming division of the former Russian Orthodox Church. Soon thereafter, in 1596 the Metropolitan of Kiev and other top clergymen of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] signed the [[Union of Brest]] turning the Russian (Ruthenian) Orthodox Church under jurisdiction of the Latin Church and converting to the [[Ruthenian Uniate Church]].

As the previous Florentine union, the Union of Brest was not accepted by all orthodox clergymen causing some eparchies (dioceses) to continue their operations as Eastern Orthodox. In 1620 the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] Theophanes consecrated [[Job Boretsky|Job]] as the new Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia and Exarch of Ukraine. This appointment revitalized Eastern Orthodox churches and deepened the schism. On the other hand, the episcopal see was returned to [[Kiev]] for the first time since 1299. In 1646 last remnants of the Russian Orthodox Church in [[Carpathian]] region joined the [[Union of Uzhhorod]] and converted into the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]]. At the same time, the eastern territories of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] which today part of Belarus and Ukraine entered a great turmoil and eventually were occupied by the [[Tsardom of Muscovy]]. Soon after occupation of Ukraine ([[Cossack Hetmanate]]), in 1685 the Ruthenian Orthodox Church was transferred from under jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] to under jurisdiction of the [[Patriarch of Moscow]]. The newly appointed metropolitan Gedeon was titled as Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and all Little Russia. This transfer successfully terminated any remnants of the original Russian Orthodox Church centered in Kiev.

==Ruthenian Orthodox Church==
The church (Ancient Greek: ''Ρωσική Ορθόδοξη Εκκλησία'', Rhousike Orthodoxe Ekklesia) was established and governed by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] in [[Kievan Rus']] (or [[Ruthenia]]) until invasion of Mogols and eventual partition between Grand Duchy of Lithnia, Kingdom of Hungary, and [[Ulus of Jochi]] (Golden Horde) with its vassal Grand Duchy of Moscow. At first it led to succession of Muscovite dioceses into its own Metropolis and although it was not recognized in the beginning eventually it turned into Patriarchate. Later the dioceses that were under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were reorganized within the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and as part of the [[Polonization]] process eventually joined the [[Union of Brest]] coming under communion with the [[Pope of Rome]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo|Eparchy of Mukačevo]] that was under the Kingdom of Hungary became one of the longest surviving dioceses of Eastern Orthodoxy in the west until it also was [[Catholicization|Catholicized]] though the [[Union of Uzhhorod]].

The '''[[Dean (Christianity)|dean]]s in the [[Church of England]]''' are the senior [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[clergy]] who head the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of a [[collegiate church]] (almost all of which are [[cathedral]]s). If they are dean of the [[Diocese|diocesan]] chapter, they are the senior priest of the diocese and often also undertake some other diocesan and civic duties in the area.

The mountain and surrounding area are part of the [[Shasta–Trinity National Forest]].

==Description==
Mount Shasta is connected to its satellite cone of [[Shastina]], and together they dominate the landscape. Shasta rises abruptly to tower nearly {{convert|10000|ft|m|-3}} above its surroundings.&lt;ref name="selters_zanger"/&gt; On a clear winter day, the mountain can be seen from the floor of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] {{convert|140|mi|km}} to the south.&lt;ref&gt;In 1878 the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]] triangulated between heliotropes atop Mount Shasta and Mount St. Helena, {{convert|192|mi|km}} south.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The mountain has attracted the attention of poets,&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Joaquin |author2=Malcolm Margolin |author3=Alan Rosenus | title = Life amongst the Modocs: unwritten history | publisher = Urion Press (distributed by Heyday Books) | date = January 1996 | origyear = 1873 | location = Berkeley | isbn = 0-930588-79-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; authors,&lt;ref name=muir&gt;Muir, John 1838-1914.

It is dormant.

The mountain consists of four overlapping volcanic cones that have built a complex shape, including the main summit and the prominent [[satellite cone]] of {{convert|12330|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} Shastina, which has a visibly conical form. If Shastina were a separate mountain, it would rank as the fourth-highest peak of the Cascade Range (after [[Mount Rainier]], Rainier's [[Liberty Cap (Washington)|Liberty Cap]], and Mount Shasta itself).&lt;ref name="selters_zanger"/&gt;

Mount Shasta's surface is relatively free of deep glacial [[erosion]] except, paradoxically, for its south side where Sargents&lt;!--Please note: this is the correct spelling of this ridge; see GNIS cite --&gt; Ridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{Gnis3|265849}} | title=Sargents Ridge | work=[[Geographic Names Information System]] | publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] | accessdate=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; runs parallel to the [[U-shaped valley|U-shaped]] Avalanche Gulch.  This is the largest glacial valley on the volcano, although it does not now have a glacier in it. There are seven named [[glacier]]s on Mount Shasta, with the four largest ([[Whitney Glacier|Whitney]], [[Bolam Glacier|Bolam]], [[Hotlum Glacier|Hotlum]], and [[Wintun Glacier|Wintun]]) radiating down from high on the main summit cone to below {{convert|10000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} primarily on the north and east sides.&lt;ref name="selters_zanger"&gt;{{cite book | last = Selters | first = Andy |author2=Michael Zanger  | title = The Mount Shasta Book | edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Wilderness Press]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-89997-404-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whitney Glacier is the longest, and the Hotlum is the most voluminous glacier in the state of California. Three of the smaller named glaciers occupy [[Cirque (landform)|cirques]] near and above {{convert|11000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} on the south and southeast sides, including the [[Watkins Glacier|Watkins]], [[Konwakiton Glacier|Konwakiton]], and [[Mud Creek Glacier|Mud Creek]] glaciers.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==History==
The oldest-known [[human settlement]] in the area dates to about 7,000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

At the time of Euro-American contact in the 1820s, the Native American tribes who lived within view of Mount Shasta included the [[Shasta (tribe)|Shasta]], [[Okwanuchu]], [[Modoc people|Modoc]], [[Achomawi]], [[Atsugewi]], [[Karuk]], [[Klamath people|Klamath]], [[Wintu]], and [[Yana people|Yana]] tribes.

The historic eruption of Mount Shasta in 1786 may have been observed by [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]], but this is disputed. Although perhaps first seen by Spanish explorers, the first reliably reported land sighting of Mount Shasta by a European or American was by [[Peter Skene Ogden]] (a leader of a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] trapping brigade) in 1826.  In 1827, the name "Sasty" or "Sastise" was given to nearby [[Mount McLoughlin]] by Ogden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History | publisher = [[College of the Siskiyous]] | year = 1989 | url = http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/his/index.htm | accessdate = 2010-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100308200255/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/his/index.htm | archivedate = 2010-03-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1839 map by David Burr lists the mountain as Rogers Peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~1614~140001:Map-of-the-United-States-Of-North-A?sort=pub_list_no_initialsort,pub_date,pub_list_no,series_no&amp;qvq=q:Oregon;sort:pub_list_no_initialsort,pub_date,pub_list_no,series_no;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=25&amp;trs=1585#|title=Map of the United States Of North America. - David Rumsey Historical Map Collection|author=|date=|website=www.davidrumsey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was apparently dropped, and the name Shasta was transferred to present-day Mount Shasta in 1841, partly as a result of work by the [[United States Exploring Expedition]].

Beginning in the 1820s, Mount Shasta was a prominent landmark along what became known as the [[Siskiyou Trail]], which runs at Mount Shasta's base.  The Siskiyou Trail was on the track of an ancient trade and travel route of Native American footpaths between California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].

The [[California Gold Rush]] brought the first Euro-American settlements into the area in the early 1850s, including at [[Yreka, California]] and [[Upper Soda Springs]]. The first recorded ascent of Mount Shasta occurred in 1854 (by Elias Pearce), after several earlier failed attempts. In 1856, the first women (Harriette Eddy, Mary Campbell McCloud, and their party) reached the summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siskiyous.edu/library/shasta/documents/upshasta.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/bib/B11.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114702/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/bib/B11.htm |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King WhitneyGlacier.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clarence King]] exploring the [[Whitney Glacier]] in 1870]]

By the 1860s and 1870s, Mount Shasta was the subject of scientific and literary interest. In 1854 [[John Rollin Ridge]] titled a poem "Mount Shasta." A book by California pioneer and entrepreneur [[James Mason Hutchings|James Hutchings]], titled ''Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California'', contained an account of an early summit trip in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/scenes_of_wonder_and_curiosity/mount_shasta.html Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California], (1862) by James M. Hutchings&lt;/ref&gt; The summit was achieved (or nearly so) by [[John Muir]], [[Josiah Whitney]], [[Clarence King]], and [[John Wesley Powell]].  In 1877, Muir wrote a dramatic popular article about his surviving an overnight blizzard on Mount Shasta by lying in the hot sulfur springs near the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siskiyous.edu/library/shasta/documents/snowstormonmtshasta.pdf|title=Snow-Storm on Mount Shasta|website=siskiyous.edu|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience was inspiration to [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s short story "Muir on Shasta".

The 1887 completion of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], built along the line of the Siskiyou Trail between California and Oregon, brought a substantial increase in tourism, lumbering, and population into the area around Mount Shasta. Early resorts and hotels, such as [[Shasta Springs]] and [[Upper Soda Springs]], grew up along the Siskiyou Trail around Mount Shasta, catering to these early adventuresome tourists and mountaineers.

In the early 20th century, the [[Pacific Highway (US)|Pacific Highway]] followed the track of the Siskiyou Trail to the base of Mount Shasta, leading to still more access to the mountain. Today's version of the Siskiyou Trail, [[Interstate 5]], brings thousands of people each year to Mount Shasta.

From February 13–19, 1959, the [[Mount Shasta Ski Park|Mount Shasta Ski Bowl]] obtained the record for the most snowfall during one storm in the U.S., with a total of {{convert|15.75|ft|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Snowfall|work=Welcome to the Storm King|publisher=Mic Mac Publishing|date=28 January 2011|url=http://www.thestormking.com/Weather/Sierra_Snowfall/sierra_snowfall.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Shasta was declared a [[National Natural Landmark]] in December 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=NPS: Nature &amp;amp; Science » National Natural Landmarks|title=Mount Shasta | url = http://www.nature.nps.gov/nnl/site.cfm?Site=MOSH-CA | accessdate=2008-04-07 | publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends===
{{main|Legends of Mount Shasta}}
[[File:Sunrise on Mount Shasta.jpg|thumb|Sunrise on Mount Shasta]]
The lore of some of the [[Klamath Tribes]] in the area held that Mount Shasta is inhabited by the Spirit of the Above-World, Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit at the request of a Klamath chief. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at [[Mount Mazama]] by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oe.oregonexplorer.info/craterlake/history.html |title=History of Crater Lake |publisher=Oregon Explorer |work= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian settlers arrived in the early 1900s to work in the mills as stonemasons and established a strong Catholic presence in the area. Many other faiths have been attracted to Mount Shasta over the years—more than any other Cascade volcano.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[Mount Shasta, California|Mount Shasta City]] and [[Dunsmuir, California]], small towns near Shasta's western base, are focal points for many of these, which range from a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery ([[Shasta Abbey]], founded by [[Houn Jiyu-Kennett]] in 1971) to modern-day Native American rituals.   A group of Native Americans from the [[McCloud River]] area practice rituals on the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/inthelightofreverence/ |title=In The Light of Reverence|work=POV|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Shasta has also been a focus for non-Native American legends, centered on a hidden city of advanced beings from the lost continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref name=lemuria&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/fol/lem/index.htm|title=The Origin of the Lemurian Legend|work=Folklore of Mount Shasta|publisher=College of the Siskiyous|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919063057/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/fol/lem/index.htm|archivedate=2012-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend grew from an offhand mention of Lemuria in the 1880s, to a description of a hidden Lemurian village in 1925. In 1931, Wisar Spenle Cerve wrote ''Lemuria: the lost continent of the Pacific'', published by the [[Rosicrucian]]s, about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that cemented the legend in many readers' minds.&lt;ref name=lemuria/&gt;

In August 1987, believers in the spiritual significance of the [[Harmonic Convergence]] described Mount Shasta as one of a small number of global "power centers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Harmonic Convergence | publisher = [[College of the Siskiyous]] | year = 1989 | url = http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/fol/har/index.htm | accessdate = 2010-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527184532/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/fol/har/index.htm | archivedate = 2010-05-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Shasta remains a focus of "[[New Age]]" attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Legends: Ascended Masters | publisher = [[College of the Siskiyous]] | year = 1989 | url = http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/bib/B17.htm | accessdate = 2010-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100330040045/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/bib/B17.htm | archivedate = 2010-03-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
[[File:MountShasta2016orthophoto-LIDARslope50.tif|thumb|2016 60cm [[orthophoto]] mosaic overlaid on 3m [[slope]] map (derived from [[digital elevation model]]).  Scale 1:50,000.]]
About 593,000 years ago, [[andesite|andesitic]] lavas erupted in what is now Mount Shasta's western flank near McBride Spring. Over time, an ancestral Mount Shasta [[stratovolcano]] was built to a large but unknown height; sometime between 300,000 and 360,000 years ago the entire north side of the [[volcano]] collapsed, creating an enormous [[landslide]] or [[debris avalanche]], {{convert|6.5|mi3|km3|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name =eov&gt;{{cite book | last = Sigurdsson | first = Haraldur | authorlink = Haraldur Sigurdsson | title = Encyclopedia of Volcanoes | publisher = Academic Press | series = | year = 2001 | doi = | isbn = 0-12-643140-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; in volume. The slide flowed northwestward into [[Shasta Valley]], where the [[Shasta River]] now cuts through the {{convert|28|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} flow.

What remains of the oldest of Mount Shasta's four cones is exposed at Sargents Ridge on the south side of the mountain. Lavas from the Sargents Ridge vent cover the Everitt Hill shield at Mount Shasta's southern foot. The last lavas to erupt from the vent were [[hornblende]]-[[pyroxene]] andesites with a hornblende [[dacite]] dome at its summit. Glacial erosion has since modified its shape.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The next cone to form is exposed south of Mount Shasta's current summit and is called Misery Hill. It was formed 15,000 to 20,000 years ago from pyroxene andesite flows and has since been intruded by a hornblende dacite dome.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[File:Black Butte from Weed, California-750px.jpg|thumb|Nearby [[Black Butte (California)|Black Butte]], seen from Weed, California]]

There are many buried glacial scars on the mountain which were created in recent glacial periods ("ice ages") of the present [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsinian glaciation]]. Most have since been filled in with [[andesite]] [[lava]], [[pyroclastic flow]]s, and [[Scree|talus]] from lava domes. Shastina, by comparison, has a fully intact summit crater indicating Shastina developed after the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. Shastina has been built by mostly pyroxene andesite lava flows. Some 9,500 years ago, these flows reached about {{convert|6.8|mi|km|abbr=on}} south and {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the area now occupied by nearby [[Black Butte (California)|Black Butte]]. The last eruptions formed Shastina's present summit about a hundred years later. But before that, Shastina, along with the then forming Black Butte dacite [[plug dome]] complex to the west, created numerous [[pyroclastic flow]]s that covered {{convert|43|mi2|km2|abbr=on}}, including large parts of what is now [[Mount Shasta, California]] and [[Weed, California]]. Diller Canyon ({{convert|400|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|0.25|mi|m|abbr=on}} wide) is an avalanche chute that was probably carved into Shastina's western face by these flows.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the {{convert|500|ft|m|-thick|abbr=off|adj=mid|-1}} Military Pass flow, extends {{convert|5.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the {{convert|600|ft|m|-wide|abbr=off|adj=mid|-1}} summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous [[hot spring]]s and [[fumarole]]s there (only a few examples still remain).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot [[lahar]] (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed {{convert|7.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|La Pérouse]], from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/his/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829195745/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/his/ |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volcanic status===
During the last 10,000 years, Mount Shasta has erupted an average of every 800 years, but in the past 4,500 years the volcano has erupted an average of every 600 years. The last significant eruption on Mount Shasta may have occurred about two centuries ago.&lt;ref name="gvp "/&gt;
[[File:Diller Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|Diller Canyon on Shastina from Weed|283x283px]]

Mount Shasta can release [[volcanic ash]], [[pyroclastic flow]]s or [[dacite]] and [[andesite]] [[lava]]. Its deposits can be detected under nearby small towns. Mount Shasta has an explosive, eruptive history. There are [[fumarole]]s on the mountain, which show Mount Shasta is still alive.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The worst-case scenario for an eruption is a large pyroclastic flow, such as what occurred in the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]]. Since there is ice, such as [[Whitney Glacier]] and [[Mud Creek Glacier]], [[lahar]]s would also result. Ash would probably blow inland, perhaps as far as eastern [[Nevada]]. There is a small chance an eruption could result in a collapse of the mountain, as happened when [[Mount Mazama]] in [[Oregon]] collapsed to form what is now called [[Crater Lake]], but this is of much lower probability.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The [[United States Geological Survey]] monitors  Mount Shasta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mount_shasta/mount_shasta_monitoring_4.html|title=USGS: Volcano Hazards Program CalVO Mount Shasta|first=Volcano Hazards|last=Program|website=volcanoes.usgs.gov|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rates it as a very high-threat volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1164/2005-1164.pdf|title=An Assessment of Volcanic Threat and Monitoring Capabilities in the United States: NVEWS Framework for a National Volcano Early Warning System|year=2005|publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climbing==
[[File:Shasta boulab.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mount Shasta's west face, June 2009]]

The summer climbing season runs from late April until October, although many attempts are made in the winter.&lt;ref name="selters_zanger"/&gt; In winter, Sargents Ridge and Casaval Ridge, to the east and west of Avalanche Gulch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{Gnis3|256378}} | title=Avalanche Gulch | work=[[Geographic Names Information System]] | publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] | accessdate=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, become the most traveled routes, to avoid avalanche danger. Mount Shasta is also a popular destination for [[backcountry skiing]]. Many of the climbing routes can be descended by experienced skiers, and there are numerous lower-angled areas around the base of the mountain.&lt;ref name="selters_zanger"/&gt;

The most popular route on Mount Shasta is Avalanche Gulch route, which begins at the Bunny Flat Trailhead and gains about {{convert|7300|ft}} of elevation in approximately {{convert|11.5|mi}} round trip. The crux of this route is considered to be to climb from Lake Helen, at approximately {{convert|10443|ft}}, to the top of Red Banks. The Red Banks are the most technical portion of the climb, as they are usually full of snow/ice, are very steep, and top out at around {{convert|13000|ft}} before the route heads to Misery Hill.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web

  | title = Avalanche Gulch
  | publisher = Mount Shasta Avalanche Center
  | accessdate = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Casaval Ridge route is a steeper, more technical route on the mountain's southwest ridge best climbed when there's a lot of snow pack. This route tops out to the left (north) of the Red Banks, directly west of Misery Hill. So the final sections involve a trudge up Misery Hill to the summit plateau, similar to the Avalanche Gulch route.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Shasta west face.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Shasta's west face as seen from Hidden Valley high on the mountain. The west face gulley is an alternate climbing route to the summit.]]
No quota system currently exists for climbing Mount Shasta, and reservations are not required. However, climbers must obtain a summit pass and a wilderness permit to climb the mountain. Permits and passes are available at the ranger station in Mount Shasta and the ranger station in McCloud, or climbers can obtain self-issue permits and passes at any of the trailheads 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Nirjara''' is one of the seven fundamental principles, or [[Tattva (Jainism)|Tattva]] in [[Jain philosophy]], and refers to the shedding or removal of accumulated [[Karma in Jainism|karma]]s from the [[Atman (Jainism)|atma]] (soul), essential for breaking free from [[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]], the cycle of birth-death and [[Reincarnation|rebirth]], by achieving [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]], liberation.&lt;ref name=si&gt;[[#Si|Singh, p. 4525]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Da|Dasgupta, 192]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally meaning "falling off", the concept is described first in chapter 9 of the classical Jain text, [[Tattvartha Sutra]] (True nature of Reality) written by  Acharya [[Umasvati]], in 2nd century CE, the only text authoritative in both [[Svetambara]] and [[Digambara]] sects of Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ji|Jaini, p. 82]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later it also finds mention in [[Dravyasamgraha]]  (Compendium of substances), a 10th-century Jain text by Acharya [[Nemichandra]].&lt;ref name=sd&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 93]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Nirjara is preceded by stoppage of karma accumulation, or ''[[samvara]]'', thereby ending ''[[asrava]]'' or influx of karma which leads to ''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' or bondage due ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kasaya]]'' or passions of the soul, namely, ''krodha'' (anger), ''lobha'' (greed), ''mana'' (ego) and ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' (deceit), besides ''[[raaga]]'' (attachment) and ''dvesa'' (hatred). '' [[Dravyasamgraha]]'' explains that the soul becomes dim due to the dust of karmic matter,  thus nirjara itself offers a way to clear the soul, and ultimately leading to [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]], liberation.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

==Types of Nirjara==
Nirjara is of two types, ''Bhava Nirjara'', modification of soul which leads to separation of karmic matter from the soul, and ''Dravya Nirjara'', actual separation of karmic matter from the soul. In turn, ''bhava nirjara'' is of two types, ''Savipaka'' and ''Avipaka''.&lt;ref name=st&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Savipaka Nirjara''===
'''Savipaka''' - Passive Method - Also known as ''Akam'' or [[wikt:unintentional|unintentional]] ''Nirjara'', [[wikt:equanimous|equanimous]] submission to the fruition of karma, and involves natural maturing of past Karma, in due course of time and experiencing the results, both good and bad with equanimity. If the fruits of the past karmas are not received without attachment or agitation then the soul earns fresh karmic bondages.  It is also not possible for the soul to know before-hand when and which karma will start to produce results and therefore require good discipline in practicing equanimity under all circumstances.

This passive method of exhaustion of karmic matter around the soul, after enjoyment of its fruits, is compared with emptying of a pond through evaporation, while water channels are still pouring in. Naturally it is a slow method, as by the time karmas become ripe and are exhausted, new karmas fill in, as karmic matter is constantly pouring into the ''karma sharira'' (karmic body), through [[asrava]], influx of karma. Thus to achieve liberation, the active method of purging off karma, ''avipaka nirjara'' is advised.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja&gt;[[#Ja|Jainism. p. 50]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Avipaka Nirjara''===
'''Avipaka''' - Active Method - Also known as ''Sakam'' or intentional ''Nirjara'', it involves individual exertion of [[ascetic]] practices, by practicing internal and external austerities, like penances or [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]], literally meaning heat, so as to accelerate the ripening process as well as reducing the effects produced.  This is recommended approach as it prepares and conditions the soul and reminds it to be vigilant. Tapas is of two kinds, ''bahya'' or external, and ''antaranga'' or internal.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja/&gt;

====''Bahya tapas''====
The ''Bahya'' or ''bahiranga tapa'', external austerities are meant to discipline the sensual cravings, and prepares the person for internal austerities, which come next.

# ''Anasana'' - Fasting, purifies sense organs, lessens sens of attachment to bodily enjoyments
# ''Avamodarya'' or ''Alpahara'' - Eating less than one's normal diet, removed laziness/lethargy and brings in fresh energy to the mind
# ''Vritti parisankhyana'' or ''Vrita sankshepa'' - Restriction of certain kinds or number of food
# ''Rasa parityaga'' -Daily renunciation of one or more of 6 kinds of ''Rasas'' delicacies: [[ghee]] (butter, clarified butter), milk, curd, sugar, salt, oil. Abstention from tasty and stimulating food
# ''Vivikta shayyasana'' - Sleeping in a lonely place, practicing solitude and introspection
# ''Kaya-klesha'' - Bodily Endurance, practicing body austerities to get over attachment to bodily comfort  &lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/treatise.txt|title=A Treatise On Jainism|last=Sanghvi|first=Jayatilal S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some places, alternative to this list include, ''Ichhanirodha'', control of desire for food and material things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/9tatvas.txt Nine Tattvas: 8. Nirjara]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Antaraga tapas''====
The ''antaranga tapa'', internal austerities which follow are:

# ''Prayaschita'' - [[wikt:Atonement|Atonement]]/penance for sinful acts
# ''Vinaya'' - Practice politeness and humility
# ''Vaiyavritya'' - Service to others, especially monks, nuns, elders and the weaker souls without any expectations in return
# ''Swadhyaya'' - Self-study, scriptural study, questioning and expanding the spiritual knowledge
# ''Vyutsarga'' - Abandonment of passions - especially anger, ego, deceit and greed, distinction between body and soul
# ''Dhyana'' - Meditation and contemplation

All the first five internal austerities and all six external austerities are preparatory steps for the practice of [[wikt:dhyana|dhyana]], which is the primary cause of moksha.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

For layman the journey begins with practicing the [[Triple gems of Jainism]], ''[[Ratnatraya]]'', namely [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_View|Right View]] or perception (''Samyak Darshana''), [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_knowledge|Right knowledge]] (''Samyak Gyana'') and [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_conduct|Right conduct]] (''Samyak Charitra''), which constitute the path to liberation. The [[Jain monasticism|monks in Jainism]], who have dedicated their lives to achieve, moksha and acquiring the ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'', absolute knowledge, however go on to take the five ''[[Mahavrata]]'', literally Great Vows, of self-control:
# [[Non-violence]] ([[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]])
# Truth ([[Satya]])
# Non-stealing ([[Asteya]])
# Chastity ([[Brahmacharya]])
# Non-possession/[[Detachment (philosophy)|Non-attachment]] ([[Aparigraha]]) .&lt;ref name=st&gt;[[#Si|Singh, p. 4526]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from that, the monks also practices, three ''Guptis'' and five ''Samitis''. Three Restraints (''Gupti''), i.e., Control of the mind (Managupti), Control of speech (Vacanagupti), Control of body (Kayagupti); and Five Carefulness (Samiti) i.e. Carefulness while walking (Irya Samiti), Carefulness while communicating (Bhasha Samiti), Carefulness while eating (Eshana Samiti), Carefulness while handling their fly-whisks, water gourds, etc. (Adana Nikshepana Samiti), Carefulness while disposing of bodily waste matter (Pratishthapana Samiti)

According to [[Umaswati]] in ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'' 10.1.2, ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'', absolute knowledge or [[Omniscience]], comes only after, the [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Mohaniya_karman|Mohaniya karma]] are first destroyed, followed by [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Jnanavaraniya_karma|Jnanavaraniya karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Darsanavarana_karma|Darsanavarana karma]] and [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Antaraya_karma|Antaraya karma]]. However after attaining the ''Kevala jnana'', the causes of [[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]], bondage end, thus the influx of Karma, [[asrava]], ends as well, thus the person is freed from the [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Aghatiya_karmas|Aghatiya karmas]] namely, [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Ayu_Karma|Ayu karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Nama_Karma|Nama karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Gotra_Karma|Gotra karma]] and [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Vedaniya_Karma|Vedaniya karma]], which cause worldly existence. Emptied of karma the person attains liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 97]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Zachary Myers''' (born March 9, 1957) is an American biologist who founded and writes the ''[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]]'' science-[[blog]]. He is associate-professor of [[biology]] at the [[University of Minnesota Morris]] (UMM)&lt;ref name="facultypage"&gt;[http://www.morris.umn.edu/academics/biology/faculty/#myersp PZ Myers Biology Faculty] from [[University of Minnesota Morris]]&lt;/ref&gt; where he works in the field of [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;https://academics.morris.umn.edu/biology/biology-faculty&lt;/ref&gt; He is a critic of [[intelligent design]] (ID), the [[creationist]] movement, and other [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/us/16beliefs.html?_r=2|title= BELIEFS; Atheists Debate How Pushy to Be|last= Oppenheimer|first= Mark|date= 2010-10-16|work= The New York Times|page= 12|accessdate= 2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' listed Myers's ''Pharyngula'' as the top-ranked blog by a scientist based on popularity.&lt;ref name="Top five science blogs"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2006|title= Top five science blogs|journal= Nature|volume= 442|issue= 7098|pages= 9–9|issn= 0028-0836|doi= 10.1038/442009a|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7098/full/442009a.html|pmid=16823420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers received the [[American Humanist Association]]'s 2009 Humanist of the Year award and the International Humanist Award in 2011.

==Early life==
Myers was born March 9, 1957, the eldest of six children in [[Kent, Washington]]; his mother is of [[Swedish American|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian American|Norwegian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers|first=PZ|title=My Swedish/Norwegian mother, you mean?|url=https://twitter.com/pzmyers/status/82623020128153600|publisher=Twitter|date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his ancestry, Myers wrote: "I'm only half Scandinavian. The blood has been thinned with that of those domesticated English and Irish and Scots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers|first=PZ|title=Have I ever told you how proud I am of my Scandinavian ancestry?|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/02/have_i_ever_told_you_how_proud.php|work=Pharyngula|publisher=ScienceBlogs|accessdate=July 24, 2011|date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named "Paul Zachary", after his grandfather, but preferred the initials PZ to being called "Little Paul". He has described his family as "probably what would be called the working poor nowadays", and noted that "when I was growing up I was called [[white trash]] more than a few times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers|first=PZ|title=There are no marching morons|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/08/there-are-no-marching-morons/|work=Pharyngula|publisher=ScienceBlogs|accessdate=January 15, 2016|date=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims to have been a "[[science]] [[geek]]" from an early age, gaining an interest in [[zoology]] and [[marine biology]] from studying the insides of fish while on fishing trips with his father.

Growing up, Myers attended an [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) church.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, PZ (June 2, 2013). "[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/06/02/an-atheist-goes-to-church-1stlc/ An atheist goes to church — 1stLC]."&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmation]], Myers says, "I started thinking, you know, I don't believe a word of this."&lt;ref name="mad"/&gt; Now an [[atheist]], Myers comments widely on his blog about science, education, atheism and religion.&lt;ref name="blight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/03/left_or_right_religion_and_pol.php|title=Left or Right, religion and politics don't mix|accessdate=2007-08-22|date=2006-03-13|publisher=Pharyngula|first=PZ|last=Myers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212034936/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/03/left_or_right_religion_and_pol.php|archive-date=2007-02-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thehumanist.org/humanist/09_nov_dec/Myers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and activism==
Myers graduated from [[Kent-Meridian High School]] in 1975 and subsequently attended [[DePauw University]] in Indiana on a full [[scholarship]].&lt;ref name="mad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/07/my_week_in_the_pacific_northwe.php?|title=My week in the Pacific Northwest|publisher=[[ScienceBlogs]]|date=2010-07-25|accessdate=2010-07-25|quote=Saturday at 5:00pm on I'll be attending…my 35th high school reunion with a gang of strange people I haven't seen in decades. You aren't invited unless you were also a graduate of Kent-Meridian High School, Class of 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he returned home the next year after his father suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name="mad"/&gt; He then graduated from the [[University of Washington]] in 1979 with [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[zoology]]. Myers drifted away from this field toward [[evolutionary developmental biology]] and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Biology from the [[University of Oregon]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;"[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/about/ About PZ Myers]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PZ Myers at Skepticon 7.jpg|thumb|left|300px|PZ Myers presents his talk, "You, too, can know more molecular genetics than a creationist!" at [[Skepticon]] in 2014.]]

He is quoted as having "nothing but contempt" for intelligent design, arguing that it is "fundamentally dishonest".&lt;ref name="mad"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.citypages.com/2005-11-23/news/the-mad-scientist/3|title=The Mad Scientist, interview with PZ Myers|date=November 23, 2005|first=Mike|last=Mosedale|volume=26|issue=1303|accessdate=2007-08-22|journal=City Pages|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802000603/http://citypages.com/2005-11-23/news/the-mad-scientist/3|archive-date=2008-08-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also an outspoken supporter of [[sex-positive feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/02/08/the-not-so-amazing-atheist-self-immolates/|title=The not-so-Amazing Atheist self-immolates |publisher=Freethoughblogs |accessdate=2012-09-29| quote=The feminism I embrace is sex-positive.

In 2009 Myers was named the [[American Humanist Association]]'s "Humanist of the Year".&lt;ref name="AHA award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year|title=American Humanist Association: Humanist of the year|publisher=American Humanist Association|accessdate=2013-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717065124/http://www.americanhumanist.org/AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year|archivedate=2012-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, [[Atheist Ireland]] issued an official announcement, apologizing that they had given Myers "public platforms in Ireland, both at the World Atheist Convention in 2011, and at our international conference in 2013 on Empowering Women Through Secularism" and that now it is "publicly dissociating itself from the hurtful and dehumanising, hateful and violent, unjust and defamatory rhetoric of the atheist blogger PZ Myers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheist Ireland publicly dissociates itself from the harmful and hateful rhetoric of PZ Myers|url=http://atheist.ie/2015/04/atheist-ireland-dissociates-from-pz-myers/|publisher=Atheist Ireland, Executive Committee|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, PZ Myers who formerly considered himself one of the  "New Atheists", disassociated himself with the [[New Atheist]] label. Describing the label as being applied "against our protests, because we were all aware that there was nothing new about it. Maybe we were more aggressive, or maybe suddenly people were listening to us, but really, it was the same old atheism with a fancy artisan label", Myers prefers to be simply referred to as an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/07/31/the-new-atheism-is-dead-long-live-atheism/ The New Atheism is dead. Long live atheism.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-graduate career==
Myers has taught and researched at the [[University of Oregon]], the [[University of Utah]] and [[Temple University]]. He is currently an associate professor of biology at the [[University of Minnesota|University of Minnesota's]] [[Morris, Minnesota|Morris]] campus.&lt;ref name="facultypage"/&gt; He is a member of ''Minnesota Citizens for Science Education'',&lt;ref name=mcse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnscience.org/index.php?id=14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330074138/http://www.mnscience.org/index.php?id=14|archivedate=30 March 2010|title= MnCSE Scientific Advisory Board|work=Minnesota Citizens for Science Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cultivates an interest in [[cephalopod]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Blogging and writing==

Myers has been active on the internet. He was involved in scientific debates on [[USENET]] surrounding the growing [[creationism|creationist]] movement. He was a founding member of [[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb blog]]. In June 2002, he started his website ''Pharyngula.org'', which morphed into a blog now hosted by [[ScienceBlogs]]&lt;ref name="seedmedia"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/], ''Pharyngula'', Science Blogs&lt;/ref&gt; and Freethought Blogs.&lt;ref name ="FTB"&gt;[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/about/], ''About &gt;&gt; Pharyngula'', Freethought Blogs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharyngula===

{{Main article|Pharyngula (blog)}}
Pharyngula is Myers's personal [[weblog]], promoted as "Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula], ''Pharyngula'', Freethought Blogs&lt;/ref&gt; The topics Myers covers are eclectic, delving into the non-scientific as well as scientific. While Pharyngula includes many articles discussing breaking science news and research, the blog has become particularly well known for ridicule of [[intelligent design]] and of attempts to insert it into science education. In 2006, the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' listed Pharyngula as the top-ranked blog written by a scientist.&lt;ref name="topfiveblogs"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7098/full/442009a.html|volume=442|issue=7098|pages=9–9|title=Top five science blogs|date=2006-07-05| accessdate=2009-07-15|doi=10.1038/442009a|first=Decla |last=Butler|journal=Nature|pmid=16823420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharyngula.org was started on June 19, 2002.&lt;ref name="Alexa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=Pharyngula.org&amp;url=pharyngula.org |title=Related Info for: pharyngula.org/ |publisher=[[Alexa.com]] |accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class. Students were required to submit mini-essays to be published online. After the project was finished, Myers still had the web-publishing software, and started to use it himself. The blog is named after his favorite stage in [[embryonic development]], the [[pharyngula]] stage. Pharyngula moved to hosting at [[ScienceBlogs]], a project of [[Seed (magazine)|Seed Magazine]], in 2005.

On Pharyngula, Myers has repeatedly denounced the [[Discovery Institute]], [[Answers in Genesis]], and other creationist websites, as well as offering rebuttals to [[Intelligent Design]], pointing out that its claims are pseudoscientific. Other posts on Pharyngula cover a broad variety of topics that interest Myers. These include [[cephalopod]]s; science; religion; local, national and international politics, particularly those involving science and/or education; superstition; and evolutionary developmental biology. Myers dismissed the Discovery Institute's petition [[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]], stating that the scientists listed didn't have credentials relevant to [[Biology]], and that the number of them was minuscule compared to the scientific community as a whole.

On his blog in 2007, Myers reviewed [[Stuart Pivar]]'s book ''Lifecode'', which argues that self-organization at the [[embryo]]nic and [[fetus|fetal]] stages determine the development and final structure of organisms.&lt;ref name="Lifecode at Pharyngula1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode.php|title=Lifecode|accessdate=2007-08-21|last=Myers|first=PZ|date=2007-07-12|publisher=Scienceblogs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907142321/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode.php|archive-date=2007-09-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lifecode at Phayngula2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode_from_egg_to_embryo_by.php |title=Lifecode: From egg to embryo by self-organization |accessdate=2007-08-21 |last=Myers |first=PZ |date=2007-07-17 |publisher=Scienceblogs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906043449/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/lifecode_from_egg_to_embryo_by.php |archive-date=2007-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific American on Pivar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=pz_myers_scienceblogs_com_s_lead_blogger&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |title=PZ Myers, ScienceBlogs.com's lead blogger, is being sued for libel |accessdate=2007-08-21 |date=2007-08-20 |publisher=Scientific American | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823162247/http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=pz_myers_scienceblogs_com_s_lead_blogger&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;| archivedate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had no basis in actual evidence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;How his theory can be reconciled with a large body of embryological evidence that directly contradicts virtually all of it is not clear, and Pivar has chosen not to address any of it. And a book full of geometrically interesting sketches neither explains nor supports Pivar's theory.… Theories are supposed to explain observation and experiment. You don't come up with a theory first, and then invent the evidence to support it.&lt;ref name="Lifecode at Pharyngula1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After some discussion in the comments threads of Pharyngula, Pivar sued Myers for libel.&lt;ref name="Lifecode at Pharyngula1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific American on Pivar"/&gt; Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit, stating that "the real issue got sidelined" and that his problem was more with [[Seed (magazine)|Seed Media Group]].&lt;ref name="City Pages"&gt;[http://citypages.com/databank/28/1396/article15832.asp Monkey's Uncle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204455/http://citypages.com/databank/28/1396/article15832.asp |date=2007-09-30 }}, ''City Pages'', September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to articles about keeping religion out of science education, church-state separation, and complaints of misdeeds done in the name of religion, Myers continues to write about science in the disciplines of evolution,&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/evolution/] ''Pharyngula: Science: evolution''&lt;/ref&gt; palaeontology,&lt;ref name="fossils"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/fossils/], ''Pharyngula: science: fossils''&lt;/ref&gt; genetics,&lt;ref name="genetics"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/genetics/], ''Pharyngula: science: genetics''&lt;/ref&gt; development,&lt;ref name="development"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/development/], ''Pharyngula: science: development''&lt;/ref&gt; and molecular biology.&lt;ref name="molecular biology"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/science/molecular_biology/], ''Pharyngula: science: molecular biology''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Myers announced that Chris Clarke, an environmentalist and blogger, would become Pharyngula's co-author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/09/06/pharyngula-is-about-to-add-a-co-blogger/ Pharyngula is About to Add a Co-Blogger ]&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke left the blog in August 2013, partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of ''Pharyngula'' commenters. &lt;ref&gt;http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/09/01/farewell-chris/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book===
Myers's book, ''The Happy Atheist,'' was published by [[Random House]] in August, 2013.&lt;ref name=ha&gt;{{cite web |title=Random House: The Happy Atheist by P.Z.

The book has been well-received by critics.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Fellow blogger Greg Laden celebrates "the level of refinement of his writing" and noting that "these essays actually have a different feel to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2013/06/25/pz-myers-is-the-happy-atheist/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120323/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2013/06/25/pz-myers-is-the-happy-atheist/ |archivedate=2017-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eucharist incident===
{{see also|Host desecration#2008 controversy in the US|Catholic League (U.S.)#Eucharist incident}}
A controversy arose in July 2008 over a Pharyngula blog entry written by Myers expressing amazement at news reports of [[death threat]]s issued to [[University of Central Florida]] Student Senator Webster Cook. On June 29, 2008, Cook attended a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Catholic Mass]] being held in the student union at UCF by a Catholic student group that receives funding from the student government. Cook received the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Catholic Eucharist host]] but did not consume it immediately. He said later that he wanted to take it back to his seat to show a friend, but when stopped he pretended to put it in his mouth until back at his seat, then a church leader made forcible attempts to take the wafer from him.&lt;ref name=FreethoughtRadio/&gt;&lt;ref name="bodysnatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/16798008/detail.html|title='Body Of Christ' Snatched From Church, Held Hostage By UCF Student|accessdate=2008-07-11|date=2008-07-09|publisher=WFTV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711042722/http://www.wftv.com/news/16798008/detail.html|archivedate=2008-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook stored the host at his home, then returned it one week later after receiving e-mail threats and pleas.&lt;ref name=FreethoughtRadio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=361015|title=Radio interview with "Webster Cook, student senator and non-eater of communion wafers"|date=2008-07-19|format=online radio|publisher= Freethought Radio|quote=Tune in to hear the inside story about the young Orlando student whom Catholics have accused of committing a 'hate crime' for not eating a communion wafer!|accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/16806050/detail.html|title='Body Of Christ" Returned To Church After Student Receives Email Threats|accessdate=2008-07-25|date=2008-07-09|publisher=WFTV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725000057/http://www.wftv.com/news/16806050/detail.html|archivedate=2008-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Donohue]], President of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]], described the student's actions as "beyond hate speech" and said that "All options should be on the table, including expulsion."&lt;ref name=Don1&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1458|title=Florida Student Abuses Eucharist|accessdate=2008-07-25|date=2008-07-07|publisher=The Catholic League|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825035803/http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1458|archivedate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his July 8 blog entry, Myers criticized the reaction to Cook's act. Myers described the level of harassment including multiple death threats leveled against the student, and accusations against the student which included [[hate crime]], [[kidnapping]], and intent to [[Host desecration|desecrate the Eucharist]] which Catholics consider a [[mortal sin]].&lt;ref name=bodysnatch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxorlando.com/dpp/news/Student_Who_Took_Religious_Icon_Getting_Death_Threats|title= Student Who Took Religious Icon Getting Death Threats|accessdate=2009-11-18|date=2008-07-09|first=Cheryl|last=Getuiza|publisher= My [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] Orlando}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers expressed outrage that [[Fox News Channel]] appeared to be inciting readers to cause further problems for the student, and ridiculed reports that armed guards would attend the next mass. Myers suggested that if any of his readers could acquire some consecrated Eucharistic hosts for him, he would treat the wafers "with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web."&lt;ref name=frackincracker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php|title=IT'S A FRACKIN’ CRACKER!|accessdate=2008-07-11|date=2008-07-08|publisher=Pharyngula|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712015833/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php|archivedate=2008-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myers was criticized from both religious and non-religious quarters. The Catholic League accused Myers of [[anti-Catholic]] [[bigotry]],&lt;ref name=holyheck&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/faith/24313139.html|title=Communion wafer held 'hostage' raises holy heck|date=July 11, 2008|work=Minneapolis Star Tribune|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204001624/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/faith/24313139.html|archivedate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; described his proposal as a threat to desecrate what [[Transubstantiation|Catholics hold to be the Body of Christ]], and sent a letter asking the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature to take action against Myers.&lt;ref name="holyheck"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pledge2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1459|title=Minnesota Prof Pledges to Desecrate Eucharist|accessdate=2008-07-11|date=2008-07-10|publisher=The Catholic League|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713023423/http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1459|archivedate=2008-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic League argued that, as the Pharyngula website was accessible via a link from the University of Minnesota's website, it should be bound by the university's code of conduct, which requires faculty to be "respectful, fair and civil" when dealing with others.&lt;ref name="pledge2"/&gt; Joe Foley, a member of the Board of the [[Secular Student Alliance]], wrote on the organization's website that Myers had "crossed the line" from "playful satire" to "masturbatory condescension".&lt;ref name= SSA&gt;[http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2168 J. Foley, "Wafergate: PZ Myers Crossed the Line"], secularstudents.org, Aug. 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Foley concluded, "if open-minded believers are willing to join us in polite dialogue, we need to be ready to welcome them with more than ridicule and pranks."&lt;ref name= SSA/&gt;

Subsequently, Myers explained to the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' that while his post was "satire and protest," he had received death threats regarding the incident but was not taking them too seriously.&lt;ref name="holyheck"/&gt;{{wikinews|Woman fired over husband's email threat to Minnesota professor|date=July 16, 2008}} In a talk show featuring Myers on ''Catholic Radio International'', hosted by Jeff Gardner, Myers confirmed that he had been sent an unspecified number of consecrated hosts and said that he intended to “subject them to heinous cracker abuse.” When asked by Gardner to explain why he must do so, Myers said that Donohue of the Catholic League was insisting that he acknowledge the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. Gardner pointed out that Donohue had no authority to insist on such acknowledgment. The show host then asked Myers which individual possessing the [[Magisterium|Magisterial]] authority of the Catholic Church had insisted that he recognize the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. Myers replied that no one from the Catholic Church had contacted him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicradiointernational.com/heartofmatter.php|title=The Heart Of The Matter On Catholic Radio International&amp;#124;2008-07-10|work=We Need To Talk|publisher=Catholic Radio International|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2008, Myers, in his post, "The Great Desecration," wrote that he had pierced through the "goddamned cracker" with a rusty nail, which he also used to pierce a few ripped-out pages of the [[Qur'an]] (in English translation, not the original Arabic) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'', and had simply thrown them all in the trash along with old coffee grounds and a banana peel. He provided a photograph of these items in the garbage, and wrote that nothing must be held sacred, encouraging people to question everything. In addition, he described the history of allegations of [[host desecration]], emphasizing the frequent use of such allegations in medieval Europe to justify [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name=TheGreatDesecration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php|title=Pharyngula: The Great Desecration|first=PZ|last=Myers |date=2008-07-24|work=Pharyngula|publisher=[[ScienceBlogs]]|accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) Chancellor stated: "I believe that behaviors that discriminate against or harass individuals or groups on the basis of their religious beliefs are reprehensible" and that the school "affirms the freedom of a faculty member to speak or write as a public citizen without institutional discipline or restraint."&lt;ref&gt;WALSH, PAUL [http://www.startribune.com/local/25896599.html?location_refer=Homepage:latestNews:4 Morris chancellor defends instructor who defiled Eucharist, tore Qur'an] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827022715/http://www.startribune.com/local/25896599.html?location_refer=Homepage:latestNews:4 |date=2009-08-27 }} Star Tribune, July 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview and screening of ''Expelled''===
In April 2007 Myers was interviewed for what he was told would be a documentary titled ''Crossroads'', purportedly about science and religion.&lt;ref name="scienceblogs.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=PZ|last= Myers|title=I'm gonna be a MOVIE STAR|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/08/im_gonna_be_a_movie_star.php#more|work=|publisher=[[Pharyngula (blog)]]|date= 2007-08-22|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2007, executive producer [[Mark Mathis]] announced that the film was ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' about perceived censorship of intelligent design supporters in academia and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|first=Cornelia|last=Dean|title=Scientists Feel Miscast in Film on Life's Origin|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/science/27expelled.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the discrepancy of focus, Myers wrote: "I mean, seriously, not telling one of the sides in a debate about what the subject might be and then leading him around randomly to various topics, with the intent of later editing it down to the parts that just make the points you want, is the video version of [[quote-mining]] and is fundamentally dishonest."&lt;ref name="scienceblogs.com"/&gt;

On March 20, 2008, Myers was [[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed#PZ Myers and Richard Dawkins at Minnesota pre-release screening|denied entry into a screening]] of ''Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed'' at the [[Mall of America]] in [[Minneapolis]]. He was waiting with his family and guests to attend a private screening after having reserved seats for himself and guests under his own name using the freely available online procedure set up by the film's promoters. Shortly before the film started, a security guard told him that the producer [[Mark Mathis]] had instructed that Myers be removed from the premises. After telling his family of this Myers went to a nearby Apple store and [[blog]]ged about his amusement that they had expelled him, but allowed his guest entry to see the film—British [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], who had also been interviewed for the film under similar circumstances.&lt;ref name=latenightquickone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/expelled.php|title=Pharyngula: EXPELLED!|accessdate=2008-03-23|first=PZ|last=Myers|date= 2008-03-20|quote=There is a rich, deep kind of irony that must be shared.

Well, I tried… but I was Expelled!}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a question and answer session at the end of the film Dawkins asked why Myers had been excluded, and later said that "if anyone had a right to see the film, it was [Myers].

===Creation Museum visit===
[[File:PZ Myers (1).jpg|thumb|Myers at the Creation Museum]]
Myers's engagement as keynote speaker at the 2009 [[Secular Student Alliance]] Conference in [[Columbus, Ohio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secular Student Alliance|url= http://www.secularstudents.org/conference|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed into an August 7, 2009 trip, in which 304 attendees visited the nearby [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A firebrand visits Creation Museum|first=Devin|last=Powell|url= http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/53237252.html|work=StarTribune.com|publisher=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis|date=2009-08-14|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beforehand, there was a flurry of heated blog posts which resulted in the museum sending a warning letter{{rp|To whom?}} detailing appropriate behavior.{{cn|date=July 2017}} The visit resulted in two reported incidents. In one, a student wearing a T-shirt that read "There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy yourself"{{cn|date=July 2017}} It was also reported that a student was asked to leave the Creation Museum after a family visiting the museum complained to staff that they saw him "laughing at the exhibits". [[Ken Ham]] however, denied that the student was told to leave, claiming that a photographer who witnessed the incident was the one who was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2009/08/08/the-day-285-atheistsagnostics-visited-the-creation-museum/ | title=The Day 285 Atheists/Agnostics Visited the Creation Museum | publisher=Answers in Genesis | work=Around the World with Ken Ham | date=August 8, 2009 | accessdate=June 1, 2011 | author=Ham, Ken | quote=The bigger incident at this particular moment is recounted here by Dan Mangus, our museum’s director, who saw much of what went on with the young man talking with me:  “When you addressed the young man to have him apologize to the offended family, a gentleman stepped from the prof’s mob to try to film the action and listen in. I stepped in front of his camera and informed him it was a private conversation. He kept sidestepping me and being rude about it, like I didn’t exist, so I motioned for an officer to escort him away. Our officer said:  ‘Sir, will you come with me?’  The photographer said nothing; he just followed him.  Nothing else was said.  He escorted him to the crosswalk. That’s when he made the comment that he hadn’t done anything.”  I mention this in detail because Lyz and many SSA members were (falsely) told that the young man was thrown out, and that is now being reported by bloggers, and we want to set the record straight. Only one person—the videographer—was ushered out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harriet Tubman sex tape controversy==

In August 2013, Simmons launched the controversial "Harriet Tubman Sex Tape" parody video on his YouTube channel, "All Def Digital", which led to public outrage and many critics demanding an apology. The video featured an actress portraying the great abolitionist [[Harriet Tubman]] (1820-1913) having sex with her [[slave owner]] with the intent of filming the act and blackmailing him to convince him to work on the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Simmons and the Harriet Tubman Sex Tape|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYmQM1NAaWY|website=[[The Young Turks]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|location=San Bruno, California|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women from his own community, as well as filmmaker [[Spike Lee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

''Rolling Stone'' published Simmons' apology for the parody in which he said:

{{quote|I'm a very liberal person with thick skin. My first impression of the Harriet Tubman piece was that it was about what one of actors said in the video, that 162 years later, there's still tremendous injustice," Simmons wrote. "And with Harriet Tubman outwitting the slave master? I thought it was politically correct. Silly me. I can now understand why so many people are upset.

I would never condone violence against women in any form, and for all of those I offended, I am sincerely sorry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=RJ|last=Cubarrubia|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/russell-simmons-apologizes-for-harriet-tubman-sex-tape-20130815|title=Russell Simmons Apologizes for Harriet Tubman 'Sex Tape'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|date=August 15, 2013|access-date=December 8, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite his apology in 2013, the nature of shareable digital media has allowed the comedy video to continue to circulate on YouTube and around the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=StraightFromTheA1 (YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78OvnOmZvTg&amp;t=64s|title=Harriet Tubman Sex Tape Controversy (Funny?

==Sexual misconduct and assault allegations==
{{See also|Weinstein effect}}

===Background===
In November 2017, model Keri Claussen Khalighi accused Simmons of sexually assaulting her in 1991, when she was seventeen.  Simmons and [[Brett Ratner]], who was accused by Khalighi of watching them without intervening when she asked for his help, both deny that the encounter was non-consensual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/russell-simmons-accused-of-sexual-assault-alongside-brett-ratner|title=Russell Simmons accused of sexual assault alongside Brett Ratner|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=20 November 2017|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the allegation was covered in the press, [[Terry Crews]] accused Simmons of attempting to influence him to take back sexual assault allegations that Crews had recently brought up against film executive Adam Venit, asking that Crews "give him a pass ... ask that he be reinstated." Crews posted a screenshot of the alleged e-mail he had received from Simmons on his Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Soniya|last=Kelley|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-russell-simmons-to-terry-crews-give-1511114119-htmlstory.html|title=Terry Crews says Russell Simmons asked him to give target of sexual-assault allegations 'a pass'|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=November 19, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Gwilym|last=Mumford|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive|title=Actor Terry Crews: I was sexually assaulted by Hollywood executive |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England| date=11 October 2017|access-date=29 November 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41580861 |title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor claims groping|work=[[BBC News]]|location=London, England|date=11 October 2017|access-date=23 June 2018 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lexy|last=Perez|title=Terry Crews Details Alleged Sexual Assault by WME's Adam Venit|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/terry-crews-details-alleged-sexual-assault-by-wmes-adam-venit-1058506|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=London, England|date=November 15, 2017|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2017, writer [[Jenny Lumet]] claimed that Simmons had assaulted her in 1991. In response, Simmons said he would step down from his positions with his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jenny|last1=Lumet|authorlink=Jenny Lumet|title=Writer Jenny Lumet: Russell Simmons Sexually Violated Me (Guest Column)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/writer-jenny-lumet-russell-simmons-sexually-violated-me-guest-column-1062934|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, HBO announced that they would be removing Simmons's name and his likeness from his stand-up comedy specials starting with the December 1 episode.

On December 13, 2017, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' published an investigative report in which five women accused Simmons of sexual misconduct; including an alleged rape. On the same day, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the accounts of four other women who accused Simmons of inappropriate conduct; including three alleged rapes. 
In response to the allegations, Simmons stated he "never had a sexual encounter that was not consensual or lawful. Ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Daniel|last1=Miller|first2=Amy|last2=Kaufman|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-nypd-opens-investigation-into-russell-1513286033-htmlstory.html|title=NYPD opens investigation into Russell Simmons as more sexual assault allegations surface|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=December 14, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2018, Simmons denied the allegations to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', saying (in part), "I vehemently deny all the allegations made against me. They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women. I am blessed to have shared extraordinary relationships, whether through work or love, with many great women and I have enormous respect for the women's movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power. I am devastated by any reason I may have given to anyone to say or think of me in the ways that are currently being described. I have separated myself from my businesses and charities in order to not become a distraction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Elias|last=Leight|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/russell-simmons-sexual-assault-allegations-a-timeline-w516384|title=Russell Simmons Sexual Assault Allegations: A Timeline|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York City|date=February 9, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning Jarosik can not refile allegations in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/04/25/russell-simmons-scores-win-accuser-jennifer-jarosik-drops-lawsuit/552026002/|title=Russell Simmons scores a win, accuser Jennifer Jarosik drops lawsuit|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=April 25, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
After the third assault allegation was published in a guest column in [[The Hollywood Reporter]] November 2017 by Jenny Lumet, Simmons stepped down from his role in the label Def Jam Records, along with his yoga lifestyle brand, other media properties and CNNMoney. Jenny Lumet is the daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet and the granddaughter of singer and civil rights activist [[Lena Horne]]. Lumet wrote: "As a woman of color, I cannot express how wrenching it is to write this about a successful man of color. ... I feel a pang to protect your daughters. I don't think you are inclined to protect mine."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/writer-jenny-lumet-russell-simmons-sexually-violated-me-guest-column-1062934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniel|last=Victor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/arts/russell-simmons-sexual-harassment.html|title=Russell Simmons Steps Down From Businesses After Sexual Misconduct Report|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=November 30, 2017|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Chloe|last=Melas|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/30/media/russell-simmons-sexual-assault-stepping-down-companies/index.html|title=Russell Simmons steps down after sexual assault allegation|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=November 30, 2017|access-date=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SiegfriedAdolfKummerfromhisbookHeiligeRunenmacht.jpg|thumb| Siegfried Adolf Kummer from his book "[[Heilige Runenmacht]]"]]
'''Siegfried Adolf Kummer''' (born 24 September 1899 in [[Radeberg]], died 1977 in [[Dresden]]) was a [[German mystic]] and [[Germanic revivalism|Germanic revivalist]]. He is also most well known for his revivalism and use of the [[Armanen runes]] row. He, along with [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]], were imprisoned during the [[Third Reich]] for being unauthorised occultists.

==Biography==
[[File:HeilageRunenmachtOLD.jpg|thumb|left|Original 1932 cover of Siegfried Adolf Kummer’  book "[[Heilige Runenmacht]]"]]
Little is known of his life or of his fate in the wake of the events of the [[Nazi era]].

Kummer, along with [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]], were criticized by name in a report made to Heinrich Himmler by his chief esoteric runologist [[Karl Maria Wiligut]]. [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]] states that they were ''"censured by Wiligut in his capacity as Himmler's counsellor on magical and religious subjects for bringing the holy Aryan heritage into disrepute and riducule and this criticism may have led to Marby's harsh treatment in the Third Reich."''&lt;ref&gt;'[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]' by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], page162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisthor (i.e. Wiligut) to Himmler, letter dated 2 May 1934, [[Bundesarchiv]], [[Koblenz]], Himmler Nachlass 19.&lt;/ref&gt; But what his fate was is unknown. At least one report&lt;ref&gt;Flowers, Stephen E. – Introduction to his English translation (Texas, February 1993) of Kummers 'Runen-Magie', 1933&lt;/ref&gt; has him fleeing Nazi Germany in exile to South America.

In 1927, Kummer founded a "runic school" called ''Runa'', associated with the summer school [[Bielatal Bärenstein]] of [[Georg Richter|Georg]] and [[Alfred Richter]]. The runic exercises, comparable to the "runic gymnastics" of [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby|Marby]], runic dancing and runic songs were taught. Kummer held that 
:"As a we now can receive various waves by means of a radio device, so the German by means of runic exercises and dances can regulate the influx of invisible ethereal cosmic waves. Those who dismiss this as impossible will never be able to detect thought waves, because they are in disharmony with the cosmic All, and are impeded by [[Racial hygiene|racially foreign blood]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Wie man nun im Radioapperat verschiedene Wellen aufnehmen kann, so kann der Germane durch Runenübungen und Tänze ebenfalls den Zustrom von unsichtbaren, feinstofflichen Allwellen regulieren. Wer dies für unmöglich hält, wird nie Gedankenwellen aufnehmen können, denn er schwingt mit dem kosmischen All in Disharmonie, ist durch fremdrassiges Blut belastet."{{cite web |url=http://www.antiqbook.de/boox/hans/502844.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224946/http://www.antiqbook.de/boox/hans/502844.shtml |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sikh Reference Library Burned.jpg|thumb|right|There is controversy surrounding the government's version of events on what happened to historical manuscripts, books, and artifacts before the Sikh Reference Library was burned.]]
The '''Sikh Reference Library''' was a repository of over 1,500 rare manuscripts located in the [[Harmandir Sahib]] (Golden Temple) at [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] which was destroyed during [[Operation Blue Star]].&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030607/windows/note.htm|title=Fire of controversy in Sikh library still smoulders|last=Walia|first=Varinder|date=7 June 2003|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the library's contents were confiscated by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) and the empty building allegedly burned to the ground by the [[Indian Army]]. In recent years the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC) has attempted to recover the looted material but has not yet recovered substantial materials. To date, the status of library manuscripts and artifacts is unclear; the vast majority remain in the hands of the government, a few office files and passports were returned, and as many as 117 items were destroyed for being "seditious" materials.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt;

==Origin==
The Sikh Reference Library was established by the [[SGPC]] with a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] dated 27 October 1946.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt; The library had its roots in a meeting of the [[Sikh Historical Society]] under the presidency of [[Princess Bamba]] on 10 February 1945 at [[Khalsa College, Amritsar]] which established the Central Sikh library.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt; The Central Sikh library was then folded into the Sikh Reference Library.

==Historical materials==
Before its destruction, the library contained rare books and manuscripts on [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion, history, and culture. It also contained handwritten manuscripts of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and [[Hukmnama]]s containing signatures of [[Sikh Gurus]].&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SmokingGunUnitedSikhs"&gt;"The Smoking Gun Recovered, United Sikhs documentary" | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6AFP1NiF-U&lt;/ref&gt; The library also held documents related to the [[Indian Independence Movement]].

==Destruction==
According to the [[Indian Army]] white paper on [[Operation Blue Star]], the library was destroyed on the night of June 5, 1984 in the midst of a firefight.&lt;ref name="ensaaf_twenty_2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaur|first1=Jaskaran|last2=Crossette|first2=Barbara|title=Twenty years of impunity: the November 1984 pogroms of Sikhs in India |page=16 |url=http://ensaaf-org.jklaw.net/publications/reports/20years/20years-2nd.pdf|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Ensaaf|location=Portland, OR|isbn=0-9787073-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[V. M. Tarkunde]], the library was still intact on 6 June when the Army had gained control of the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], and was in fact burned down by the army at some point between 6 June and 14 June.&lt;ref name="ensaaf_twenty_2006" /&gt; Although the Indian Army has maintained that the library's contents were completely destroyed on 5 June, the SGPC has contradicted their version of events. By using witness accounts, the SGPC has alleged that material from the library was taken in [[gunny sack]]s on military truck to Amritsar's Youth Club, a temporary office of the CBI , and the empty library was burned by the army afterwards.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt; At that location, the CBI catalogued the materials until September 1984, when in light of a Sikh convention being held in the city, the library's contents were moved to an undisclosed location.

==Coverup==
In 2003, Ranjit Nanda, a former inspector for the Central Bureau of Investigation, (CBI) turned [[whistleblower]] and revealed he was part of a five member team which scrutinized the documents at the CBI's makeshift office at Amritsar's Youth Club.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt;  He revealed that officials from his department were "desperately looking for a purported letter written by [[Indira Gandhi]], the then Prime Minister, to [[Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale]]", and reported seeing letters from the other leaders addressed to Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt; Manjit Calcutta, a former secretary of the SGPC, corroborated Nanda's version of events but further alleged that the army set the library "on fire in desperation when it failed to find the letter".&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt; Nanda further confirmed the SGPC's version of events by describing how after inspecting each book and manuscript the CBI packed the documents into 165 numbered gunny sacks and bundled the material into waiting army vehicles because of a meeting of Sikh high priests taking place at the time.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt; He also showed a letter from his superiors commending his work "during examination of documents from SGPC ".&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt;

==Efforts to recover the material==
Since 1988, the SGPC has written to the [[Government of India|Central Government]] asking for the return of the material taken by the CBI but has only received minor office files.&lt;ref name="express_2009_george"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/20000525/ina25042.html|title=George Fernandes admits Army removed items from Golden Temple during Operation B|date=25 May 2000|publisher=Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Ltd.|accessdate=21 February 2011|location=Bombay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2000 [[George Fernandes]] wrote to the SGPC Secretary, Gurbachan Singh Bachan, and acknowledged that the [[Indian Army]] had taken the books and other documents from the Sikh Reference Library and handed them over to the CBI.&lt;ref name="express_2009_george" /&gt;  He asked him to refer the matter to the [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (India)|Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], whose jurisdiction the CBI falls under.&lt;ref name="express_2009_george" /&gt;

In a visit to [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]  Fernandes announced that the CBI had destroyed 117 "seditious" documents from the material taken from the Sikh Reference Library.&lt;ref name="tribune_fire_2003" /&gt;

On 25 March 2003, [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] made assurances that the books, documents, and manuscripts would be returned; however, he took no further action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-03-25/chandigarh/27269547_1_sgpc-harbeant-singh-kirpal-singh-badungar|title=Precious books will be returned: Kalam assures SGPC chief - The Times of India|last=Rana|first=Yudhvir|date=25 Mar 2003|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 26 April 2004, the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] ordered the [[Government of India|Central Government]], [[Government of Punjab (India)|Government of Punjab]], and the CBI to return the "valuables, books, scriptures, paintings, etc, that were seized from the Golden Temple during “Operation Bluestar” in 1984".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040427/punjab1.htm#38|title=Material seized during Bluestar to be returned|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|publisher=The Tribune|accessdate=21 February 2011|location=Chandigarh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February and May 2009, [[A. K. Antony]], defense minister of India, claimed in parliament that the Indian Army no longer had any material taken from the library.&lt;ref name="dna_missing_2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/special_sgpc-centre-spar-over-golden-temples-missing-manuscripts_1234589|title=SGPC, Centre spar over Golden Temple’s missing manuscripts - India - DNA|last=Bharadwaj|first=Ajay|date=27 Feb 2009|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|accessdate=22 February 2011|location=Chandigarh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune_antony_2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090522/punjab.htm#1|title=No Sikh reference books with us: Antony|last=Walia|first=Varinder|date=21 May 2009|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various members of parliament and the SGPC criticized him for "misleading parliament".&lt;ref name="dna_missing_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune_antony_2009" /&gt;

'''Taixu''' ({{CJKV|t=太虛|s=太虚|p=Tàixū|w=T'ai Hsü}}), (8 January 1890 – 17 March 1947)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Taixu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/taixu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wapbaike.baidu.com/item/太虚大师/3740330?fromtitle=释太虚&amp;fromid=448997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yufotemple.com/cstg/5386.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was a Buddhist modernist, activist and thinker who advocated the reform and renewal of [[Chinese Buddhism]].

== Biography ==
[[Image:Taixu Standing.jpeg|thumb|Taixu wearing his traditional [[Kasaya (clothing)|kāṣāya]] robes.]]

Taixu was born in Hǎiníng (海寧/海宁) in [[Zhejiang]] province. His lay name was Lǚ Pèilín (呂沛林). His parents died when he was still young, and he was raised by his grandparents. At 16 he was ordained into the [[Linji school]] of [[Zen|Chan]] Buddhism in Xiao Jiǔhuá Temple (小九華寺/小九华寺) in [[Suzhou]]. Not long after being ordained he was given the [[Dharma name]] of Taixu, meaning Great Emptiness. In 1909 he travelled to [[Nanjing]] to join the Sutra Carving Society established there by the lay Buddhist [[Yang Renshan]].

As a result of being exposed to the political writings of [[Kang Youwei]], [[Liang Qichao]], [[Tan Sitong]] and [[Zhang Taiyan]], Taixu turned his mind to the reformation of Buddhism. In 1911 while in [[Guangzhou]], he made contact with the revolutionaries plotting to overthrow the [[Qing dynasty]] and participated in some secret revolutionary activities. Taixu would later describe the formation of his political thinking during this time in his ''Autobiography'' (自傳 ''zìzhuàn''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;My social and political thought was based upon 'Mr. Constitution', the Republican Revolution, Socialism, and Anarchism. As I read works such as Zhang Taiyan's "On Establishing Religion", "On the Five Negatives", and "On Evolution", I came to see Anarchism and Buddhism as close companions, and as a possible advancement from Democratic Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guoxue.com/www/xsxx/txt.asp?id=976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the establishment of the new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], Taixu founded the ''Association for the Advancement of Buddhism'' (佛教協進會/佛教协进会 ''fójiào xiéjìn hùi''), which lasted only a short time due to resistance from conservative Buddhists. Unable to convince the Buddhist community of his ideas, and shocked by the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the sufferings in China, Taixu went into seclusion (閉關/闭关 ''bìguān'') on [[Putuoshan]] for three years from October 1914.

Until his death Taixu worked toward the revival of Buddhism in China, although because of the economic and political turmoil that China experienced through wars and revolutions, few of his projects were successful. He died on March 12, 1947 at the Jade Buddha Temple (玉佛寺 ''yùfó sì'') in [[Shanghai]]. One of his influential disciples was [[Dongchu]] 東初 (1907–1977).

== Buddhist Modernism ==
{{Main|Humanistic Buddhism|Buddhist modernism}}

Besides being a revolutionary activist for the Chinese, Taixu was a Buddhist modernist. He took the doctrine and adapted it so that he may propagate Buddhism throughout the world. One of his grand schemes was to reorganize the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. He envisioned plan was to cut the number of monks in the monastic order down and according to history of religion professor Don A. Pittman, by 1930 Taixu had

&lt;blockquote&gt;these numbers [down] to include only twenty thousand monastics; five thousand students, twelve thousand bodhisattva monastics, and three thousand elders. Of the twelve thousand bodhisattva monastics, five thousand should be spreading the Dharma through public preaching and teaching, three thousand serving as administrators in Buddhist educational institutions, fifteen hundred engaging in Buddhist charitable and relief work, fifteen hundred serving as instructors in the monastic educational system, and one thousand participating in various cultural affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman 2001, p.238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This reorganization of the Sangha was an attempt to revitalize Buddhism, an important step to bring about a Pure Land in this world. [[Pure Land Buddhism]] was widely practiced in China during his time. Taixu's modernist mentality caused him to propagate the idea of a Pure Land, not as a land of Buddhist cosmology but as something possible to create here and now in this very world.  Pittman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His views on the realization of that ideal were far from those of the mainstream of the contemporary Sangha. Rather than focusing on the glories of distant pure lands, which were accessible through reliance on the spiritual merit and power of other great bodhisattvas and buddhas, Taixu visualized this earthly world transformed into a pure land by the dedication and sacrificial hard work of thousands of average bodhisattvas who were mindful of what their concerted witness could mean.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman 2001, p.222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like many Buddhist modernists, Taixu was interested in using tactics such as cultural translation (a method of explaining Buddhism) so that non Buddhists can better comprehend the complexity of the tradition. For example, in his essay "Science and Buddhism," Taixu makes a translation of the Buddha's teaching that inside of every drop of water, there are 84 thousand microbes, a Buddhist teaching that basically states that within our world there are many more worlds. He goes on to explain how that when one looks inside of a microscope one will be able to see these tiny microbes and that each one is a life of its own.

In his writings he connected the scientific theory that there is infinite space with no center of the universe to the Buddhist Sutras that states "Space is endless and the number of worlds is infinite, for all are in mutual counterpoise like a network of innumerable beads."&lt;ref&gt;p. 87 Taixu. "Science and Buddhism" ''Lectures in Buddhism'' Paris, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Taixu did not believe that science was the be-all and end-all.  As a matter of fact he saw that in no way was it possible to reach enlightenment through science even though it is capable of explaining many of the universe's mysteries. "Scientific knowledge can prove and postulate the Buddhist doctrine, but it cannot ascertain the realities of the Buddhist doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;p. 86 Taixu, "Science and Buddhism" ''Lectures in Buddhism'' Paris, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;
He understood Buddhism to be scientific and yet surpassing science.  Like other Buddhist modernists, Taixu condemned superstition. Taixu explains that the two deeply rooted superstitions were the "Superstition of God" and the "Superstition of Reality." These two superstitions go hand-in-hand in regards to explaining why, according to Taixu, Buddhism is the only way to true enlightenment. The "Superstition of God" can be understand as how science will never be able to explain the existence of the supernatural. Also science is also only able to explain the materialistic aspects of the world, which leads to the second superstition, "Superstition of Reality." The "Superstition of Reality" is basically materialism but as materialism, in this sense, means what science is capable of explaining. These two superstitions essentially blind science and people's ability to see the truths that only Buddhism can reveal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Contacts with Christianity ==
{{See also|Buddhism and Christianity|Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity}}
Taixu's reforms of the Sangha were influenced in part by Christianity.  While in Europe, Taixu saw the successes of Christian charitable organizations and hoped to bring that organization style into his reformed Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Darui. "An Interfaith Dialogue Between the Chinese Buddhist Leader Taixu and Christians." ''Buddhist-Christian Studies'' 20 (2000): 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  He implemented these methods into organizations like the Bodhi Society and Right Faith Society, lay organizations devoted to providing charity to the sick, poor, and misfortunate.&lt;ref&gt;Justin R. Ritzinger, "Taixu: To Renew Buddhism and Save the Modern World," (Buddhist Digital Library &amp; Museum, 1999), 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, he was critical of Christian philosophy, believing that it was incompatible with modern science and failed to prevent economic depressions in Europe and both World Wars.&lt;ref&gt;D. Lancashire. "Some Views on Christianity Expressed by the Buddhist Abbot Tai Hsu." ''Quarterly Notes on Christianity and Chinese Religion'' 3, no. 2 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics argued that he was naive and ill-informed about Christian philosophy, calling his ''Lectures in Buddhism'' "a rambling, incoherent, amateurish talk."&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez Jr. ''Science and Buddhism: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survey of Writings ==

In one publication by Taixu, he discusses the importance of interreligious dialogue. He realizes the problems that exist in China and through a conversation with a French archbishop he was able to understand this importance. Taixu writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All religions should be regulated in order that they conform to the situation in China. There should be no overt rejection of Catholicism.&lt;ref name="Long-2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Long |first=Darui |year=2000 |title=An Interfaith Dialogue between the Chinese Buddhist Leader Taixu and Christians |volume=20 |pages=167–189 |journal=[[Buddhist-Christian Studies]] |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quote shows that Taixu believed there was no reason to deny the teachings of another religion because different religions, with cooperation and open-mindedness, have the ability to work together and learn from each other.  Taixu went as far as incorporating some Christian ideas, such as methods of pastoral training and revival style preaching, into his own Buddhist practices.

Beyond adopting select Christians methods, a more controversial topic that Taixu dealt with openly was the existence of God.  When Taixu went into three years of self confinement after a failed reform attempt he reflected on the subject -
&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is God? Is He made of matter or not? . . . If He exists in the heart only, then his existence is legendary, similar to such non-existent things as "turtle hair" and "hare horn." Thus, we should not believe that God created all things in the world. . . . How did He create the Universe? If the Holy Father is part of the universe, it is unreasonable that He created the world. I challenge the existence of God. Show me the evidence of the birth of God. What was He before His birth? Does He exist because He possesses an inherent nature? It is not rational to claim that all things exist before His birth. If there is a birth, or a beginning, there should be an end. It is unreasonable to say that He is almighty. . . . If, with knowledge, God created man and all things at His will, then did He create man blindly or ignorantly? How could He create sinful things, crimes, ignorance, and even blasphemers? This would be unreasonable. If He did all these things, it would be unreasonable that God sent people into exile, to make them suffer, rather than allowing them to stay in Paradise. How could God create men who do not respect Him?&lt;ref name="Long-2000" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taixu questions the existence of God because rationally if one looks at the world's situation there is no evidence of a god. He appears to tie this argument to the connections between Buddhism and science, and how superstition creates an obstacle on the path to enlightenment.

In Taixu’s own article “''Science and Buddhism''” he offers many interesting and original thoughts on science and superstition. Taixu’s main argument in the article is that all of the superstition in the world such as “The superstition of God or the restriction of the ego” and “the superstition of reality” prevent the advance of scientific discovery because of the closed-mindedness of the superstitious people to see beyond their beliefs.  Taixu writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Science therefore, can never be the main support of Buddhism although it may act as a valuable auxiliary and much may be expected from uniting the two methods of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;pg. 89 Taixu, "Science and Buddhism" ''Lectures in Buddhism'' Paris, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his writings Taixu’s followers can grasp an understanding that he believes science is a valuable resource but because of people's steadfast faith in superstitions it will never be a successful asset to Buddhism.  He seems to argue that science is a means to enlightenment but it will never allow someone to get there. In Taixu's words, "Scientific methods can only corroborate the Buddhist doctrine, they can never advance beyond it."&lt;ref&gt;pg. 89 Taixu, "Science and Buddhism" ''Lectures in Buddhism'' Paris, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Pittman wrote a book entitled “Toward a Modern Chinese Buddhism” in which he analyzes Taixu’s reform efforts.  One of his reform efforts was the attempt to make Pure Land Buddhism a reality.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If today, based on good knowledge of our minds, we can produce pure thoughts and work hard to accomplish good deeds. How hard can it be to transform an impure China into a Chinese pure land?... All persons have this force of mind, and since they already have the faculty (''benneng'') to create a pure land, they can all make the glorious vow to make this world into a pure land and work hard to achieve it."&lt;ref&gt;pg. 427, Taixu, "On Establishing a Pure Land on Earth." ''Complete Works.'' Taipei 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This among many things was one of Taixu's greatest ideas of reform. He believed that the only way to end the suffering on this world was to bring the Pure Land to it. He attempted to do so through many means, including the reorganization of the Sangha. Unfortunately for Taixu, his attempts at global propagation of the Dharma failed. Most of his institutions that were set up to help bring about this better life were crushed by many different things, including the communists.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, Don A. ''Toward a Modern Chinese Buddhism.'' Hawai'i UP. Honolulu, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

There were about 60 students enrolled in the school's first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.i-newswire.com/the-delphian-school-celebrates/a56126|title = The Delphian School Celebrates 30th Anniversary (press release)|date = 8 February 2006|accessdate = 10 February 2015|website = iNewswire|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 1978 the school had 120 students, tuition was $4,500 for boarding students and $2,800 for non-boarders.&lt;ref name="sights"/&gt;

In the mid-1980s the campus was considered as a possible location for a federal prison.

==Academics==
The Delphian School is operated by [[Delphi Schools]] using [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s study techniques, known as [[Study Tech]]. The Study Tech teaching methodology is licensed through the [[Scientology]]-related group [[Applied Scholastics]].&lt;ref name="appschol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Scholastics|url=http://www.delphian.org/page.cfm?p=280|work=Delphian School|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school is also the location of [[Heron Books]], which published textbooks and materials using Hubbard's educational philosophy (the Delphi Curriculum).

The school uses a proficiency- or competency-based education model. There are no letter grades, report cards, or traditional grade levels at the school. Students advance through the curriculum by demonstrating proficiency or competence rather than at a set time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.advanc-ed.org/source/new-paradigm-putting-all-students-drivers-seat|title = A New Paradigm - Putting All Students in the Driver's Seat|date = |accessdate = 12 February 2015|website = AdvancED|publisher = The Delphian School|last = Siegel|first = Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St John the Baptist Church - The Layer Monument.jpg|thumb|right|The Layer Monument with four Northern Mannerist figurines]]
'''The Layer Quaternity''' are four marble sculpture figurines approximately {{convert|25|cm|0}} in height located on the two columns of [[the Layer Monument]], an early 17th-century polychrome mural monument ({{convert|320 x 350|cm|disp=sqbr}}) which was installed in the [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich]] to the memory of [[Christopher Layer (merchant)|Christopher Layer]] (1531–1600).

==Style== 
The quartet of figurines sculptured in marble, ''Pax, Gloria, Vanity, Labor'' exhibit primary thematic concerns and stylistic attributes of [[Northern Mannerist]] art, namely, portraiture of animated human movement, variety and multiplicity, often set in the Classical or mythological world, and inclined towards esoteric concepts.&lt;ref&gt; [[John Shearman]] Mannerism Pelican 1967 {{ISBN|0-14-020808-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of symbolism== 
[[File:Alchemical air 1606.jpg|thumb|right| 'The Philosopher's Stone' from 'Alchemia' (1606) Libavius]]
The Layer Quaternity (''circa'' 1598–1604) share a number of iconographical details to a complex illustration found in ''Alchemia'' (1606) by the German academic [[Andreas Libavius]] in a chapter entitled ''De Lapide Philosophorum'' ([[Philosopher's stone|The Philosopher's Stone]]) in which two giants support four figures, the lower pair of which are mortal, the upper pair immortal, they form the apex to –

"Libavius' monument of the opus.......The completion of the Little Work by ''Labor and Industry'' and ''the grace of God'' (Latin lower captions translated) is followed by ''Sol'' and ''Luna'' ascending on swan's wings.....the thanksgiving by the Arab king and his white wife reading as – ''Glory to God on High'' and ''I will exalt thee my God'' ".&lt;ref&gt; Alchemy – Johannes Fabricius pub. Rosenkilde and Bagger, Copenhagen, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin upper captions translated)

Libavius' illustration and the marble sculpture of the Layer Quaternity share an identical pairing including a naked figure (lower pair), a bare-legged royal male and a regal draped female (upper pair) as well as the titled captions ''Gloria'' and ''Labor'', along with the symbols of palm branch, ''rotundum'', and moon. 

The similarities between the captioned phrases of Libavius' illustration to those of the single-word titles of the Layer Quaternity suggest that in time sequence, the Layer monument was based upon and installed before 1606, the publication date of Libavius' illustration.

Biblical verse which parallels the symbolism of each captioned entity includes for the lower and mortal pair – ''Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the '''Labour''' that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was '''Vanity''' and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun''. [[Ecclesiastes]] 2.v.11 With an antithetical response from the upper, immortal, ''Heavenly'' pair –  '''Glory''' ''to God in the highest, and on earth '''Peace''', goodwill to all men.'' [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2 v.14

The Layer Quaternity also corresponds to the alchemical 'deities' [[Apollo]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]] and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] as named in emblem XVII of [[Atalanta Fugiens]] (1617) by the German alchemist-physician [[Michael Maier]].&lt;ref&gt; J.B. Craven Count [[Michael Maier]] Life and Writings 1910 reprint 2003 Ibis Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

The four figurines housed in the monument's pilasters, ''Pax'' and ''Gloria'', ''Vanitas'' and ''Labor'', (Peace, Glory, Vanity, Labor) are relatively rare examples of Northern Mannerist sculpture extant in Britain. Collectively they exemplify how Christian iconography during the era of [[Elizabeth I]], in tandem with Renaissance Europe, integrated symbolism from the western esoteric traditions of alchemy and astrology into works of art, including the funerary monument. The Layer Quaternity in their totality are a unique alchemical mandala.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam McLean]] The Alchemical Mandala pub. Phanes 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Through polarised symbolism they delineate essential coordinates associated with mandala art, namely Space (Heaven and Earth) and Time (Young and Old). They also represent fundamental aspects of the human condition, namely, gender, youth and age, as well as pleasure and suffering. In essence, the Layer Quaternity, not unlike the ''Scaiolae''&lt;ref&gt; 'Spiritual powers of the mind comparable to psychic powers such as thought, love, hate, imagination, hope, fear'. C.G.Jung CW 13:206 citing [[Martin Ruland the Younger|Martin Ruland]],'They emanate from the soul in man. Fancy, imagination, speculative faculty, etc. are included under the term.' – from ''Lexicon Alchemiae'' (1612)&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Paracelsus]] (which are discussed by Libavius in ''Alchemia'') are a quaternity of differentiated virtues or psychic entities which represent a complete wholeness or totality in sum.

==Psychological associations==

The role of the Quaternity in religious symbolism is discussed at length by [[Carl Gustav Jung]]. Much of his in-depth study and observations upon the function and role of the quaternity in religious symbolism is applicable to the Layer Quaternity. To Jung the quaternity was a natural expression of differentiation which always represents a totality, citing the four elements, the four seasons, the ancient Greek schemata of the [[four humours]], and the [[four temperaments]], as well as the four Evangelists with their respective emblems in the form of the [[tetramorph]] in Christian iconography, as examples.  

The symbolism of the four entities of the Layer Quaternity exemplify Jung's observation that individuation develops through psychic qualities consisting of two pairs of opposites, which are often polarised to each other.&lt;ref&gt; C.G. Jung 'The Quaternio and the mediating role of Mercurius'

'''Ellen Sadler''' (15 May 1859 – after 1901), sometimes called '''The Sleeping Girl of Turville''', was a resident of [[Turville]], a small village in [[Buckinghamshire]] in the United Kingdom. In 1871, aged eleven, she purportedly fell asleep and did not wake for nine years.&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; The case attracted international attention from newspapers, medical professionals and the public.

Born to a large, impoverished family of farm workers, Ellen was sent to work as a nursemaid at the age of eleven. Soon afterwards, she began suffering periods of drowsiness and was referred to a local hospital. After four months her condition was declared incurable, and she was sent home. Two days later, Ellen had a series of seizures and—her mother claimed—fell into a deep sleep from which she could not be roused.
 
Ellen became a tourist attraction for the village, and her family made considerable money from visitors' donations. As the years progressed with no sign of Ellen's waking, speculation grew that her illness was either a hoax or caused by her mother, an issue that was never resolved. In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.

==Background==
Ellen Sadler was born on 15 May 1859&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt; to Ann and William Sadler, who lived in the small village of Turville, Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;Gurney, Rebecca J (2006). "The Sleeping Girl of Turville". ''Origins'' ([[Buckinghamshire Family History Society]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Sadlers were a large, impoverished family&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt; consisting mainly of farmhands;&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; Ellen, the youngest child, shared her home with her eleven siblings.&lt;ref name="bucks"&gt;Staff (November&amp;nbsp;6, 2009). [http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/nostalgia/nostalgiabucks/4724753.Our_very_own__Sleeping_Beauty_/ "Our very own 'Sleeping Beauty{{'"}}]. [[Bucks Free Press]] ([[Gannett Company]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen's father died while she was an infant; Ann Sadler subsequently married Thomas Frewen.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;

==Illness==

===Initial symptoms===
In 1870, aged eleven, Ellen began work as a nursemaid in nearby [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]],&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; but she began suffering periods of [[somnolence]] and her employment was terminated. She was subsequently attended by a local doctor, Henry Hayman [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|F.R.C.S.]], from nearby [[Stokenchurch]]. Ellen had been suffering for 13&amp;nbsp;weeks from "[[gland]]ular swellings"&lt;ref name="lancet1"/&gt; or an [[abscess]] on the back of her head,&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; and symptoms consistent with a [[Vertebral column|spinal]] disease.&lt;ref name="lancet1"&gt;Staff (March 8, 1873). "Medical Annotations: The Turville Trance Case". ''[[The Lancet]]'' '''101''' (2584): 352–353. [[Digital Object Identifier|doi]]:&amp;nbsp;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)44178-X 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)44178-X].&lt;/ref&gt; The family did not have much money, so the [[parish]] vicar, The Reverend Studholme, asked Hayman to secure Ellen's admission to a local hospital,{{#tag:ref|In 1873, Hayman refers to the hospital as the "County Infirmary";&lt;ref name="lancet1"/&gt; in 1880, he names "Reading Hospital".&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt;|group="nb"}} where her condition worsened. Ellen stayed at the hospital for 18&amp;nbsp;weeks before being "discharged as incurable" in March 1871.{{#tag:ref|Hospital records indicate Ellen's age at the time of her admission as nine years old;&lt;ref name="lancet1"/&gt; however, most sources say she was eleven by the time of her subsequent illness, which began two days after her discharge.&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="lancet2"&gt;Staff (June 12, 1880).

|style="text-align: left;"|"The mother's narrative is that she told the little girl to pray, and that they prayed together—the child rocking herself to and from with her hands clasped, gradually losing command over herself and growing more and more convulsed, her eyes rolling wildly and her limbs twitching. When [Dr Hayman] arrived, to use her expression 'the child was fixen down.' That is to say, she had sunk into a state of insensibility, in which she now remains."

According to Ellen's mother, upon the girl's return home on a rickety cart, she began to feel drowsy and had several seizures.&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt; Hayman states that it was two days after her discharge that the seizures occurred. He visited Ellen at her home, where he was told that the previous night, 17 March,{{#tag:ref|Other sources say March&amp;nbsp;27&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; and March&amp;nbsp;29;&lt;ref name="nz1"&gt;Staff (June&amp;nbsp;3, 1873). "A Two Years' Trance". ''West Coast Times'' ([[Allied Press]]): p.&amp;nbsp;6. (Reprinted from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; however, as the attending doctor, Hayman is more likely to have known the correct date.|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt; Ellen had endured a series of such attacks, after which she turned to lie "on her left side, with her hand under her head, and the lower extremities drawn upwards".&lt;ref name="lancet1"/&gt; It was in this position that—her mother maintained—Ellen remained for the duration of her sleep. Hayman visited Ellen many times over the next few years and he later said that he "never found her otherwise".&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt;

Ellen became something of a tourist attraction for Turville.&lt;ref name="bucks"/&gt; She was visited by journalists, medical professionals, religious personnel and the "plain curious"{{#tag:ref|Rumours persist that Ellen was visited by royalty,&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; possibly the [[King Edward VII|Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref name="tony"&gt;Barham, Tony (1973). "Turville's Sleeping Maid". ''Witchcraft in the Thames Valley''. Spurbooks. pp.&amp;nbsp;20–27. {{ISBN|9780902875371}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no supporting evidence.|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; from across the country, many of whom donated money to Ellen's family to be allowed to see her.&lt;ref name="bucks"/&gt; Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the "supply" began to run out.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; A ''[[Bucks Free Press]]'' journalist recounted his visit:&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold&amp;nbsp;... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances&amp;nbsp;... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death&amp;nbsp;... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A correspondent from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' visited Ellen about 22&amp;nbsp;months after she fell ill. He wrote:&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The girl's face is by no means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath&amp;nbsp;... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.&amp;nbsp;... The girl's [hand] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened&amp;nbsp;... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.&amp;nbsp;... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.&amp;nbsp;... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby&amp;nbsp;... [Her feet were] almost ice-cold.&amp;nbsp;... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that it is almost impossible to detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.{{#tag:ref|Aspects of the correspondent's account conflict with the known facts. Although there is no doubt that the child of which he speaks is Ellen Sadler, he names her as "Ann Trilling", Ellen's mother's maiden name. He names William Sadler as Ann's second husband, and the physician Hayman, from Stokenchurch, as "Dr Hammond" from "Stock Church". He also recounts Ellen's mother's claim that the condition was not unique in the family. Before her husband died, Ann said, he had "lay for three weeks speechless and motionless". Warning the reader to bear in mind that there was no evidence to this effect, the journalist also detailed Ann's claim that her brother-in-law had died after six months in the same condition.&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By March 1873, Ellen was believed to be suffering from starvation.&lt;ref name="lancet1"/&gt; At first, she had largely subsisted on port, tea and milk, given three times per day. After about 15&amp;nbsp;months—while her mother was attempting to administer [[arrowroot]]—Ellen's jaw locked closed.&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt; Subsequently, according to Hayman, she was fed "wine, gruel and other things" using the "spout of a toy teapot inserted between two broken teeth".&lt;ref name="lancet1"/&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' journalist expanded on Ellen's feeding: "The feeding implements stand on a little table by the side of the stump bedstead, and, at first sight, give you the idea that they are toys placed there to attract her attention should she, by a merciful termination of her trance, presently awake to life. The toys in question are two tiny 'teapots', each not much larger than a full-sized walnut and holding four small teaspoonfuls. One of these is filled with port wine, and the other with milk&amp;nbsp;... this quantity of liquid nourishment&amp;nbsp;... cannot weigh more than half an ounce&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt; At this time, it was considered "manifestly out of the question to think of moving her".&lt;ref name="lancet1"/&gt; How the family dealt with Ellen's passing of urine and faeces is unclear, but in 1880, Hayman said that Ann Frewen told him that no bowel movements had occurred for five years, and that approximately every four days "a somewhat large amount would pass from the bladder".&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt;

===Scepticism===
Some visitors were sceptical of Ellen's illness and attempted to uncover the alleged ruse through methods such as stabbing her with pins, to no effect.&lt;ref name="bucks"/&gt; The ''Bucks Free Press'' journalist was suspicious of Ann's practice of making visitors wait before seeing Ellen. Some neighbours were also "deeply sceptical", as Ellen's family was making a "healthy profit" from her illness.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; During summers, the family was taking as much as £2 per week (£{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|2|1880|r=0}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt; Others said they sometimes saw Ellen sitting by her window at night. Ann consented to "fair tests", but further suspicions were raised because medical personnel were not allowed to remain for too long, and Ann did not want Ellen to be moved to a hospital. Nor was Ellen listed as an invalid during the 1871 census.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; Hayman said that Ann was reluctant to allow handling of her daughter by medical personnel because they often concealed sharp objects with which to "test [Ellen's] powers of feeling". Her parents had also "strenuously opposed" Hayman's recommendation to [[galvanism|run an electric current]] through Ellen's sleeping body.&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt;

[[File:Sarah jacob.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sceptics of Ellen's condition drew comparison with the case of the Welsh "fasting girl", Sarah Jacob.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt;]]
Much speculation appeared in the press as to the cause of Ellen's illness; some linked the case to that of [[fasting girls#Sarah Jacob|Sarah Jacob]], a girl from Wales who, her parents claimed, was able to survive without nourishment, through divine intervention. Sarah died of starvation in 1869, and her parents were subsequently convicted of manslaughter. A journalist for ''[[The Observer]]'' commented, "It is to be hoped that [Sarah's case] is known in the obscure village of Turville, where—we are asked to believe—a fresh case of miraculous trance has taken place.&amp;nbsp;... [Ellen's case] very much&amp;nbsp;... incites suspicion of deliberate imposture." One correspondent to ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "It is by widespread publicity that such cases are multiplied, and it is difficult to overstate the harm thus done. These impostures exist through a morbid love of sympathy on the part of the children, or from the gains that accrue to the parents. Once begun, they soon pass into real disease." Another said the "ridiculous mystery" could be resolved if only Ellen were transferred, over her mother's continued objections, to a London hospital, a sentiment echoed by many. Claims that Ellen was suffering from a form of [[catalepsy]]—a condition at the time considered "so rare that not one physician in a thousand has so much as seen a single case of it"—were also disregarded as unlikely, as was any thought of [[religious ecstasy]].&lt;ref name="sid"&gt;Staff (May&amp;nbsp;26, 1873). "The Case of Trance at Turville". ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'': p.&amp;nbsp;3. (Reprinted from ''[[The Observer]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Hayman affirmed, "every effort [had] been made to discover the deception, if any, but without effect." The [[Home Secretary]] and local [[Magistrate#England and Wales|Magistrate]] corresponded about the case but the law was powerless to interfere, because despite accepting donations, Ellen's family never asked for money outright, and she "was not represented as a '[[fasting girls|fasting girl]]{{'"}},&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt; as Sarah Jacob had been.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' journalist said, "[Ann Frewen]'s manner is that of a perfectly honest woman who would be too glad if her child could be restored to consciousness." He spoke to neighbours, none of whom indicated anything other than trust in Ellen's parents and Hayman, and claimed that the family was receiving no money from Ellen's illness,&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt; although the latter point is contradicted by Hayman&lt;ref name="lancet2"/&gt; and others.&lt;ref name="sid"/&gt; The journalist concluded, "I have no medical knowledge, and [am] unqualified to give an opinion beyond what is justified by close observation of the ordinary kind. I went to Turville prepared to find an imposture. I have returned—puzzled."&lt;ref name="nz1"/&gt;

===Recovery===
Ann Frewen died in May 1880. The inquest into her death was held at the nearby Bull and Butcher [[public house]],&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; presided over by the county [[coroner]], Frederick Charsley. Part of the inquest's remit was to consider the matter of Ellen's subsequent care.&lt;ref name="marl"&gt;Staff (September&amp;nbsp;7, 1880). "Asleep for Nine Years". ''[[The Marlborough Express]]'' ([[Fairfax Media]]) '''14''' (209): p&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Frewen was reported as being "quite evasive" when the coroner asked him how Ellen was fed, and although Hayman testified to reaffirm his stance that Ellen's illness was genuine, Reverend Studholme was less certain.&lt;ref name="marl"/&gt; However, he could not offer any evidence to this effect, even though he had made several unannounced visits to Ellen's home.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; Charsley concluded that Thomas could not look after Ellen, as his job left him absent from their home all day, and that the other members of the household would be too busy with its upkeep.&lt;ref name="marl"/&gt; Therefore, he turned Ellen's care over to her married sisters, Elizabeth Stacey and Grace Blackall, both of whom lived in Turville.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; The cause of Ann's death was found to be [[edema|oedema]] of the heart,&lt;ref name="marl"/&gt; from which she had been suffering for many years.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;

Five months later, Ellen awoke;{{#tag:ref|Some sources list December 1880 rather than October; however, the former appears merely to be the date Ellen's recovery was reported in the press.|group="nb"}} by November, she had "fully recovered". By this time, Ellen was twenty-one and claimed to remember nothing of the previous nine years. She otherwise suffered few long-term effects, save for slightly stunted growth and a "weak eye".&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;

==Later life and legacy==
[[File:Sleepy Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ellen Sadler's family home in Turville, Buckinghamshire. Later named "Sleepy Cottage" after Ellen's case and also used during filming of the BBC sitcom ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]''.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;]]
In 1886, Ellen married Mark Blackall{{#tag:ref|Speculated to be related to her brother-in-law.|group="nb"}} in nearby [[Fawley, Buckinghamshire|Fawley]]. In the censuses of 1891 and 1901, the pair are listed as living in [[Barkham]] and [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]], respectively. They had five children: Ann (b.&amp;nbsp;1888), Elizabeth or Mable (b.&amp;nbsp;1889), Gladys (b.&amp;nbsp;1890), Sydney (b.&amp;nbsp;1896) and Gertrude (b.&amp;nbsp;1898).&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; Ellen and Mark appear in the 1911 census together with Sydney and Gertrude, all living in Lower Caversham. The census also records that they had six children of which one had died.

The case of Ellen Sadler has remained a part of local folklore, spawning tales of witchcraft and rumours of royal attention in Turville.&lt;ref name="tony"/&gt; The Sadler family home became known as "Sleepy Cottage", and was used for filming of the BBC situation comedy ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]''.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; No clear cause has ever been ascribed for Ellen's condition; modern diagnoses might include [[narcolepsy]],&lt;ref name="bucks"/&gt; or deliberate drugging,&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; and the possibility that it was a hoax cannot be discounted.&lt;ref name="bucks"/&gt; An embellished account of the story can be found in the 1973 collection, ''Witchcraft in the Thames Valley'' by Tony Barham.&lt;ref name="tony"/&gt;

They have replaced indigenous African religions, but are often adapted to African cultural contexts and belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Britannica Book of the Year 2003. Encyclopædia Britannica, (2003) {{ISBN|9780852299562}} p.306. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, as of mid-2002, there were 376,453,000 Christians, 329,869,000 Muslims and 98,734,000 people who practiced traditional religions in Africa. [http://www.greenwoodsvillage.com/gor/islam.htm Ian S. Markham,(A World Religions Reader. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 1996.)] is cited by Morehouse University as giving the mid-1990s figure of 278,250,800 Muslims in Africa, but still as 40.8% of the total. These numbers are estimates, and remain a matter of conjecture. See Amadu Jacky Kaba. The spread of Christianity and Islam in Africa: a survey and analysis of the numbers and percentages of Christians, Muslims and those who practice indigenous religions. The Western Journal of Black Studies, Vol 29, Number 2, June 2005. Discusses the estimations of various almanacs and encyclopedium, placing Britannica's estimate as the most agreed figure. Notes the figure presented at the [http://www.afrikaworld.net/afrel/Statistics.htm World Christian Encyclopedia, summarized here], as being an outlier. [[The World Book Encyclopedia]] has estimated that in 2002 Christians formed 40% of the continent's population, with Muslims forming 45%. It was also estimated in 2002 that Christians form 45% of Africa's population, with Muslims forming 40.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==
West and Central African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by ''force'' (or ''ashe'', ''nyama'', etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or driving drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]] is the [[Okuyi]], practiced by several [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness.&lt;ref name="Karade, B. pages 39-46"&gt;Karade, B. ''The Handbook of Yoruba Religious Concepts'', pages&amp;nbsp;39–46. Samuel Weiser Inc, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 

When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech.  Also, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie De Waal Malefijt (1968) ''Religion and Culture: an Introduction to Anthropology of Religion'', p&amp;nbsp;220–249, Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirits==
{{Main|List of African mythological figures}}
Followers of traditional African religions pray to various spirits as well as to their ancestors.
These secondary spirits serve as intermediaries between humans and the primary God, also referred to as the Supreme Deity. Most African societies believe in a single Supreme being ([[Chukwu]], [[Nyame]], [[Olodumare]], [[Ngai]], [[Roog]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Willie F. Page (2001) ''Encyclopedia of African History and Culture'', Volume 1, p55. Published by Facts on File, {{ISBN|0-8160-4472-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recognize a [[Dualistic cosmology|dual]] God and Goddess such as [[Mawu|Mawu-Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Rogers (2009) ''Ultimate Truth'', Book 1, p100. Published by AuthorHouse, {{ISBN|1-4389-7968-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices and rituals==
[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|[[Kongo people|Bakongo]] masks from the [[Kongo Central]]]]
There are more similarities than differences in all traditional African religions.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Mbiti (1990) ''African Religions &amp; Philosophy'' 2nd Ed., p&amp;nbsp;100–101, Heinemann, {{ISBN|0-435-89591-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the supreme Deity is worshiped through consultation or communion with lesser deities and ancestral spirits. The deities and spirits are honored through [[libation]], sacrifice (of [[Animal sacrifice|animals]], vegetables, cooked food, flowers, semi-precious stones and precious metals). The will of the Supreme Deity is sought by the believer also through consultation of divinities or [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;John S. Mbiti (1992) ''Introduction to African Religion'' 2nd Ed., p. 68, Published by East African Publishers {{ISBN|9966-46-928-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many traditional African religions, there is a belief in a cyclical nature of reality. The living stand between their ancestors and the unborn. Traditional African religions embrace natural phenomena&amp;nbsp;– ebb and tide, waxing and waning moon, rain and drought&amp;nbsp;– and the rhythmic pattern of agriculture. According to Gottlieb and Mbiti: &lt;blockquote&gt;The environment and nature are infused in every aspect of traditional African religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become amenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Gottlieb (2006) ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology'', p. 261, Oxford Handbooks Online {{ISBN|0-19-517872-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For example, in the [[Serer religion]], one of the most sacred stars in the cosmos is called Yoonir ([[Sirius|the Star of Sirius]]).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Gravrand (1990) ''La Civilisation Sereer Pangool'', PP 21, 152, Published by Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Sénégal, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a long farming tradition, the Serer high priests and priestesses ([[Saltigue]]) deliver yearly sermons at the Xoy Ceremony (divination ceremony) in [[Fatick]] before Yoonir's phase in order to predict winter months and enable farmers to start planting.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Kalis (1997) ''Médecine Traditionnelle, Religion et Divination Chez les Seereer Siin du Sénégal: La Coonaissance de la Nuit'', L'Harmattan, {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traditional healers of South Africa|Traditional healers]] are common in most areas, and their practices include a religious element to varying degrees.

===Divination===

{{Main|African divination }}
[[File:Early 20th century Yoruba divination board.jpg|thumb|Early-20th-century [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] [[divination]] board]]
Since Africa is a large continent with many ethnic groups and cultures, there is not one single technique of casting divination. The practice of casting may be done with small objects, such as bones, cowrie shells, stones, strips of leather, or flat pieces of wood.
[[File:Sangoma reading the Bones.jpg|thumb|left|[[Traditional healers of South Africa|Traditional healer of South Africa]] performing a divination by reading the bones]]
Some castings are done using sacred divination plates made of wood or performed on the ground (often within a circle).

In traditional African societies, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis. There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Diviner (also known as priest) are also sought for their wisdom as counselors in life and for their knowledge of herbal medicine.

==Virtue and vice==
Virtue in traditional African religion is often connected with carrying out obligations of the communal aspect of life. Examples include social behaviors such as the respect for parents and elders, raising children appropriately, providing hospitality, and being honest, trustworthy, and courageous.

In some traditional African religions, morality is associated with obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a person or a community lives. For the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], according to their primary supreme [[Creator deity|creator]], [[Ngai]], acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience. Traditionally, as now, the Kikuyu were monotheists, believing in a unique and omnipotent God whom they called Ngai. The word, is related to the [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word Enkai, and was borrowed by both the Kikuyu and Kamba. God is also known as Mungu, Murungu, or Mulungu (a variant of a word meaning God, which is found as far south as the Zambesi of Zambia), and is sometimes given the title Mwathani or Mwathi (the greatest ruler), which comes from the word gwatha, meaning to rule or reign with authority.

Ngai is the creator and giver of all things, 'the Divider of the Universe and Lord of Nature'. He gave birth to the human community, created the first Kikuyu communities, and provided them with all the resources necessary for life: land, rain, plants and animals.
He - for Ngai is male - cannot be seen, but is manifest in the sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, thunder and lightning, rain, in rainbows and in the great fig trees (mugùmò) that served as places of worship and sacrifice, and which marked the spot at Mukurue wa Gathanga where Gikuyu and Mumbi - the ancestors of the Kikuyu in the oral legend - first settled.

Yet Ngai is not the distant God that we know in the West. He had human characteristics, and although some say that he lives in the sky or in the clouds, they also say that he comes to earth from time to time to inspect it, bestow blessings and mete out punishment. When he comes he rests on Mount Kenya and four other sacred mountains. Thunder is interpreted to be the movement of God, and lightning is God's weapon by means of which he clears the way when moving from one sacred place to another. Other people believed that Ngai's abode was on [[Mount Kenya]], or else 'beyond' its peaks. Ngai, says one legend, made the mountain his resting place while on an inspection tour of earth. He then took the first man, Gikuyu, to the top to point out the beauty of the land he was giving him.In traditional African religions, such as the [[Azande]] religion, a person is said to have a good or bad conscience, depending on whether he does the bidding of God or malevolent spirits.

In many cases, Africans who have converted to other religions have still kept up their traditional customs and practices, combining them in a syncretic way.&lt;ref&gt;''Resolving the Prevailing Conflicts Between Christianity and African (Igbo) Traditional Religion Through Inculturation'', by Edwin Anaegboka Udoye&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ukrainian Radical Party, (URP)''', ({{lang-uk|Українська радикальна партія, УPП}}, ''Ukrainska Radikalna Partiya'')  founded in October 1890 and based on the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical movement]] in [[western Ukraine]] dating from the 1870s, was the first modern Ukrainian political party with a defined program, [[mass politics|mass following]], and registered membership.&lt;ref name = "encyclopediaURP"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\U\K\UkrainianRadicalparty.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine, Ukrainian Radical Party]. vol. 5, 1993.  Article written by Jean Paul Himka and Ivan Lysiak Rudnytsky
&lt;/ref&gt; It advocated [[socialism]], increased rights for Ukrainian [[peasants]], and [[secularism]].

==Programme and Ideology==

[[Image:Drahomanov mykhajlo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mykhailo Drahomanov, whose political ideas formed the basis of the Ukrainian Radical Party's ideology]]

The Radical Party ideology was based on the political thought of [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], an eastern Ukrainian thinker who spent part of the nineteenth century in western Ukraine.  Although the Radical party advocated socialism in its ideology, it considered itself different from western socialists who were beholden to the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] because western socialism was based on the industrial [[proletariat]] while the Radical party was focused on the peasantry.  Accordingly, its socialism was [[agrarian socialism|agrarian and peasant-based]].  The Ukrainian Radical party claimed kinship and affinity with the similarly peasant-based socialist [[People's Radical Party|Serbian Radical Party]] of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name = "encyclopediaradicals"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\R\A\Radicalism.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine, "Radicalism"] written by John-Paul Himka&lt;/ref&gt; It actively opposed the influence of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] and [[Western Ukrainian clergy|its priests]] in Ukrainian society. It was also opposed to the [[Cisleithania|Austria]]n government, to mainstream Ukrainophiles who were loyal to Austria, and to Ukrainian attempts to cooperate with Polish authorities.  At the same time, the URP cooperated with Polish workers and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]]. (1988). ''Ukraine: A History''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The URP supported Ukrainian independence at a party congress in 1895, the first time that the goal of an independent Ukrainian state had been expressed anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Robert Magocsi]]. (1996). ''A History of Ukraine''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Involved with the plight of the Ukrainian peasants, the URP also called for and organized [[strike action|strike]]s of Ukrainian agricultural workers.

==History==

The Radical Party was founded in [[Lviv]] on October 4, 1890 by a group of Ukrainian activists including the poet [[Ivan Franko]], the publisher Mykhailo Pavlyk, and others. It was involved in founding reading rooms and cooperatives, organizing women's groups, and training and politicizing Ukrainian peasants.  In 1895, the party passed a resolution calling for Ukrainian independence.  That same year, it sent three representatives to the Galician [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] and in 1897 two representatives to the [[Austria–Hungary|Austrian]] [[Reichsrat (Austria)|parliament]].&lt;ref name = "encyclopediaURP"/&gt;

In the mid-1890s three competing groups emerged within the URP.  One maintained its allegiance to the traditional ideology of the URP.  Another faction turned more to western European [[socialism]] and [[Marxism]].  A third faction which included most of the Radical Party's most prominent members such as [[Ivan Franko]] became increasingly disenchanted with socialist ideas and more focussed on national concerns.  In 1899 the latter two groups left the Radical Party.  The socialist-learning faction split off to form the [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (1899)|Ukrainian Social Democratic Party]].  The nationalist-leading faction merged with mainstream Ukrainiphiles to create the National Democratic Party, which was the largest Ukrainian political party in Austrian-ruled Ukraine before and during the [[World War I|first world war]].  The National Democratic party, renamed the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]], would continue to dominate western Ukrainian political life until the Second World War.

After the exodus of the Ukrainian Social Democrats and the National Democrats, the remaining Ukrainian Radical Party, having become a definitively peasant-oriented party, was the second largest political party among ethnic Ukrainians in western Ukraine.&lt;ref name = "encyclopediaURP"/&gt; In 1911, it sent five members to the Austrian parliament and in 1913 six members to the Galician Diet. On the eve of World War I, the Radical party established sporting societies and paramilitary groups that would serve as the basis for the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]], an all-Ukrainian unit within the Austrian army.&lt;ref name = "encyclopediaURP"/&gt;

The Ukrainian Radical Party was one of the founding parties of the [[West Ukrainian National Republic]], and its members occupied the posts of defence minister ([[Dmytro Vitovsky]]) and interior secretary within the West Ukrainian government.&lt;ref name = "encyclopediaURP"/&gt;   Following the war, when western Ukraine became part of the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish state]], at a party congress in 1925 the Radical Party passed a resolution simultaneously opposing cooperation with Ukrainian "bourgeois parties" and condemning [[Ukrainian Bolsheviks|Bolsheviks]] policies in [[Soviet Ukraine]]. A year later, it merged with a socialist party and renamed itself the '''Ukrainian Socialist Radical Party''' (USRP).  In the [[1928 Polish elections]], the party received 280,000 votes, the second most among western Ukrainian parties following the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]]'s 600,000 votes.&lt;ref name= "Subtelny"&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]]. (1988). ''Ukraine: a History.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 434-441&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled the USRP to send 11 representatives into the [[Polish parliament|parliament]] and 3 into the [[Polish senate|senate]]. In the [[1931 Polish elections|1931 elections]] it ran in a coalition with the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]] and obtained 1/4 of the coalition's seats. The USRP boycotted all subsequent Polish elections.&lt;ref name = "encyclopediaURP"/&gt;

The party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1931 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner.

After the [[Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine, 1939–1940|Soviets annexed western Ukrainian territory]] in 1939, the USRP like all other western Ukrainian political parties was forced by the Soviet authorities to disband.

The '''United Workers Party''' is a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Saint Lucia]], currently led  by former Tourism Minister [[Allen Chastanet]] who defeated former Prime Minister [[Stephenson King]] in a July 28, 2013 leadership contest.  The party was led previously by [[John Compton]].

==History==
The party was formed before the [[Saint Lucian general election, 1964|1964 general elections]] by an alliance of the [[People's Progressive Party (Saint Lucia)|People's Progressive Party]] and the National Labour Movement, a splinter group from the ruling [[Saint Lucia Labour Party]].&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p582 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They won the elections, taking six of the eight seats. They remained in power after winning elections in [[Saint Lucian general election, 1969|1969]] and [[Saint Lucian general election, 1974|1974]], before losing the [[Saint Lucian general election, 1979|1979 elections]] to the Labour Party. They returned to power after winning 14 of the 17 seats in the [[Saint Lucian general election, 1982|1982 elections]], and remained in power after two elections in 1987 and one in [[Saint Lucian general election, 1992|1992]]. The Labour Party won the [[Saint Lucian general election, 1997|1997]] and [[Saint Lucian general election, 2001|2001 elections]], but the UWP regained power in the [[Saint Lucian general election, 2006|2006 elections]]. In 2011 the UWP lost the election to Labour but regained power in the 2016 elections, taking 11 of the 17 seats in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elections.gov.lc/|title=Saint Lucia General Elections|website=elections.gov.lc|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Workers Party is a member of the [[Caribbean Democrat Union]], the regional organisation of the global conservative [[International Democrat Union]].

'''Zartosht no-diso''', or '''Zarthost no deeso''', is an important day of remembrance in the [[Zoroastrian]] religion.  It is a commemoration of the death anniversary of the [[prophet]] [[Zoroaster]]. It is observed on the 11th day (Khorshed) of the 10th month ([[Dadvah|Dae]]). In the seasonal calendar, Zarthost No-Diso falls on December 26.  

It is an occasion of remembrance with lectures and discussions held on the life and works of the [[Zoroaster|prophet]]. Special prayers are recited, {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and attendance at the [[fire temple]] is very high. A much higher number of [[mobed]]s are brought to pray at the [[Atash Behram]]s and [[Agyari|Atash Adaran]]s. There is no mourning in the Zoroastrian religion, only remembrance and worship of the Farohars of the departed.

However, Zoroaster’s death is not mentioned in the ''[[Avesta]]''. Nonetheless, in the ''[[Shahnama]]'' 5.92,&lt;ref name="WilliamsJackson_1899_130_131"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams Jackson|1899|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he is said to have been murdered at the altar by the [[Turan]]ians in the storming of [[Balkh]].
