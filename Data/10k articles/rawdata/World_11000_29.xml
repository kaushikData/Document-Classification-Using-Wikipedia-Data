The '''1972 Monaco Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] motor race held at [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]] on May 14, 1972. It was race 4 of 12 in both the [[1972 World Championship of Drivers]] and the [[1972 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers]]. The track was substantially modified from 1971, in the interest of safety. The pits were moved to the harbor front, between the chicane and Tabac, and a new chicane was placed near Tabac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/05/24/grand-prix-flashback-monaco-1972/ |title=Beltoise scores his only win – and BRM’s last – at Monaco |last=Collantine |first=Keith |date=24 May 2007 |website=F1Fanatic |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Pierre Beltoise]]'s victory was the only one of his Formula One World Championship career, and the last for [[British Racing Motors|BRM]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7500">'''Canada-Asia Relations''' are relations between [[Canada]] and [[Asia]]n countries. These include [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] relations between Canada and individual Asian states and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] relations through groups such as [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]].

==Historical relations==

Canada's relations with Asia stem from their respective colonial pasts, particularly with those countries who are also members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. This is because until the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] Canada's foreign affairs were mainly handled by [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Canada also shares a colonial past with Asian countries previously under French rule, namely [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Prior to the establishment of bilateral ties between Asia and Canada, thousands of Chinese and Japanese immigrants arrived in Canada throughout the 19th century.

Direct engagement with Asia began in 1919 with the formation of the [[League of Nations]]. Canada was one of the founding members, which also included the Asian states of [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]], then known as [[Siam]].

The [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|1923 Chinese Immigration Act]] banned all immigrants from China, except for those with the title of Diplomat, Merchant or Foreign student. The Act was repealed in 1947.

In 1929 Canada opened a legation in [[Tokyo]].

The next significant interaction with Asia was the Canadian's involvement in fighting the Japanese in [[World War II]]. During the War the majority of [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians were placed in internment camps]] under the [[War Measures Act]].

Canada also partook in the [[Korean War]].

Bilateral diplomatic ties with China were established in 1971, when the two countries exchanged ambassadors. This was followed by a 1973 visit to China by Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]].

Today, [[Asian Canadian]]s comprise about 11.73% of Canada's total population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiapacific.ca/statistics/population/population-2006-census/proportion-total-population-major-asian-ethnic-groups-p Proportion of Total Population of Major Asian Ethnic Groups by Province | Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political relations==

Canada's relations with Asia vary significantly between countries. For example, Canada has taken a number of political and economic measures against [[Burma]], whose military government's policies it believes violate [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/thailand-thailande/bilateral_relations_bilaterales/canada-burma-birmanie.aspx?lang=eng&amp;menu_id=10&amp;menu=L Canada's Policy on Burma&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with warmer ties with countries like [[South Korea]], with whom Canada has relaxed visa, educational and trade policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/korea-coree/bilateral_relations_bilaterales/index.aspx?lang=eng Canada - Korea Relations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan}}
Canada is one of 41 countries participating in the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) mission in [[Afghanistan]], where Canada has been engaged in Security and Reconstruction efforts since 2002.

Canada provides aid to many Asian countries, with a special focus on [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/ACDI-CIDA.nsf/eng/NIC-5510486-KDG Asia - CIDA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127172726/http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/ACDI-CIDA.nsf/eng/NIC-5510486-KDG |date=November 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergovernmental Organizations===

Canada is a member of [[APEC]], an intergovernmental forum dedicated to promoting free trade and investment, economic growth and development, and cooperation in the Asia–Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfait.gc.ca/apec/index.aspx APEC 2010 - Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada maintains close ties with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] through the Joint Cooperation Workplan signed between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/asia_pacific-asie_pacifique/asean-anase.aspx?lang=eng Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are all members of la [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]].

==Economic relations==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6763">The '''Austrian State Prize for European Literature''' ({{lang-de|Österreichischer Staatspreis für Europäische Literatur}}), also known in Austria as the '''European Literary Award''' (''Europäischer Literaturpreis''), is an [[Austria]]n literary prize awarded by the Federal Chancellery for Arts, Culture, and Media to European writers.&lt;ref name="oesterreich-bibliotheken"&gt;[https://archive.is/20120529161211/http://www.oesterreich-bibliotheken.at/preistraegerinnen.php?preis=preise_euliteratur Österreichische StaatspreisträgerInnen für Europäische Literatur] {{de icon}}.

==List of winners==
&lt;!--Note: The list at ref www.oesterreich-bibliotheken.at and elsewhere is taken to be inaccurate and the list at ref "www.kunstkultur.bka.gv.at" as accurate, as the latter cross-references with [http://www.bildarchivaustria.at/Pages/ImageDetail.aspx?p_iBildID=14942003] and [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SzgFAQAAIAAJ&amp;q="Lem+(1985)"&amp;]. The former source lists Austrian Ilse Aichinger (who as an Austrian didn't win this international prize but won the 1995 Preisträgerinnen und Preisträger Literatur instead), jumbles the order of awards, and omits three winners: 1975's Miroslav Krleža, 1986's Giorgio Manganelli, and 1999's Péter Esterházy.--&gt;

'''Borg á Mýrum''' is a farm and church estate due west of [[Borgarnes]] township in Iceland. Its [[recorded history]] reaches back to the [[settlement of Iceland]]. One of the country's original settlers was [[Skalla-Grímr|Skallagrímur Kveldúlfsson]], who claimed the area around Borg as his land, built a farm and made his home there. His son [[Egill Skallagrímsson]] then continued to live and farm at Borg á Mýrum.
[[File:Kirkja á Borg.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Church, Borg á Mýrum, Borgarnes, Iceland.]]
Borg á Mýrum has had a church ever since Iceland was [[Christianisation of Iceland|Christianised]] around the year 1000, shortly after Egill's death. The present church at Borg was built in 1880, and is notable for its [[Orientation of churches|geographical alignment]]: it faces North-South,  which is not traditional for Icelandic churches. It is also unusual in that the church building does not stand in the church yard, but is separated from it by the farm buildings. 

The [[altarpiece]], depicting Christ blessing the little children, is unique in Iceland for being painted in [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite ]] style. The artist was [[W.G. Collingwood]], who visited Iceland in 1897.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cwherald.com/a/archive/collingwood-s-letters-from-iceland.427239.html | title=Collingwood's Letters from Iceland | work=[[Cumberland and Westmorland Herald]] | date=2014 | accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collingwood made an extensive trip around the country in preparation for an illustrated book he published on "saga-steads", the locations of the [[Icelandic Sagas]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Pilgrimage to the Saga-steads of Iceland''. W.G.Collingwood, [[Jón Stefánsson (academic)|Jón Stefánsson]] (Holmes, [[Ulverston]], 1899). (The [[National Museum of Iceland]] has a collection of his art work related to the book)&lt;/ref&gt;

At Borg á Mýrum Collingwood found 'the historical homestead, still partly built of oak-beams carved and moulded in the ancient times'.  This building has not survived,&lt;ref name="leth"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sagasteads.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/egils-saga-in-past-and-present-1.html | title=Egils saga in the past and present | date=2010 | accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a twentieth-century monument to Egill by the sculptor [[Ásmundur Sveinsson]].  The abstract sculpture represents him as the poet of ''[[Sonatorrek]]'' in which he grieves for two of his sons, Gunnar and Böðvarr.

{{Politics of San Marino}}
The '''Constitution of [[San Marino]]''' is distributed over a number of legislative instruments of which the most significant are the Statutes of 1600 and the Declaration of Citizen Rights of 1974 as amended in 2002. The constitutional system has influences from the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' and [[Roman law|Roman]] customary law.  It may have the [[List of national constitutions|oldest surviving constitution]] of any [[sovereign state]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Slomp2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slomp, Hans|title=Europe, A Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;lpg=PA693&amp;ots=SXGYnu2f0V&amp;dq=oldest%20constitution%20Marino&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;pg=PA693#v=onepage&amp;q=oldest%20constitution%20Marino&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 July 2011|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39181-1|page=693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Statutes of 1600==
The current legal system of [[San Marino]] began on October 8, 1600. The government gave binding force to a compilation of ''Statuti'' written by [[Camillo Bonelli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miller |first=William |year=1901 |title=The Republic of San Marino |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=633–649 [p. 642] |doi=10.2307/1834173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the institutions and practices of Sammarinese government and justice at that time. It was written in Latin and contained in six books. The title in Latin is ''Statuta Decreta ac Ordinamenta Illustris Reipublicae ac Perpetuae Libertatis Terrae Sancti Marini''.

The new system was an update on the ''Statuti Comunali'' (Town Statute) which had served San Marino from about 1300. Existing institutions, such as the [[Grand and General Council|Council of the Sixty]], were carried forward from this period. The Statutes form the basis of all law in effect today, so it may be the oldest constitution of any existing nation.

=== Book One ===
The first book contains 62 articles. It is constitutional in character and describes the various [[Grand and General Council|councils]] of San Marino, [[court]]s, a number of administrative positions, including the [[Captains-Regent]], and the powers assigned to them. The last two articles explain how the law is to be interpreted and altered, including how the law is to be [[Promulgation|promulgated]].

=== Book Two ===
The second book, called ''Civilium Causarum'', contains 75 articles. The first half provides for [[Corpus Juris Civilis|civil law]] procedures covering [[subpoena]]s, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]], examination of [[witness]]es and judicial expenses. The second half covers [[Minor (law)|minors]], [[education]], the salaries of the [[civil service]] and [[will (law)|wills]]. There is a section which promotes [[compromise]] to resolve disputes and another which regulates the [[salary]] of [[lawyer]]s.

=== Book Three ===
The third book, called ''Maleficiorum'', contains 74 articles and covers [[criminal law]]. [[prosecutor|Prosecution]] of criminal acts is reserved for the [[Sovereign state|state]] alone. The laws provide a formula by which a [[punishment]] shall be proportional to the [[Offense (law)|offense]] and any [[mitigating circumstance]]s. Special attention is given to protecting the assets of the state and [[Roman Catholic Church|church]], and to preventing the [[pollution]] of [[water]] sources.

=== Book Four ===
The fourth book, called ''De Appellationibus'', contains 15 articles. The volume explains how [[judge]]s are nominated, the classification of [[Sentence (law)|sentences]], [[appeal]]s and [[appellant]] guarantees.

=== Book Five ===
The fifth book, called ''Extraordinarium'', contains 46 articles covering a range of topics. These include the sale of [[meat]], [[sanitation]] and [[health]], [[water]] reserves and [[road]]s.

=== Book Six ===
The sixth book contains 42 articles and covers [[Damages|compensation]], [[weight]]s and [[Tillage|plant cultivation]]. In particular, it explains that [[Pater familias|family heads]] are responsible for the actions of their sons and any [[servant]]s.

==Declaration of Citizen Rights==
On 12 July 1974 the [[Captains-Regent]] signed a law (59/1974) adopted by the [[Grand and General Council]] containing a declaration of citizen rights and the fundamental principles of the juridical order of San Marino.  The Declaration begins with a repudiation of [[war]]. It states the people are [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and explains how the [[separation of powers]] doctrine is applicable to San Marino. Citizens are guaranteed certain rights including [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[inviolability]], [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], and universal [[suffrage]].

Jorri Duursma describes the 1974 law as the fundamental law of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Duursma1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorri Duursma|title=Fragmentation and the international relations of micro-states: self-determination and statehood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgVDprXjkIYC&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=6 July 2011|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56360-4|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration was amended in 2002, providing further constitutional detail on the organisation of government and establishing the [[Guarantors’ Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules]], which is a court responsible for assessing the compliance of laws with respect to the Declaration of Rights.

}}The '''Ethiopian dwarf mongoose''' (''Helogale hirtula''), also known as the '''desert dwarf mongoose''' or '''Somali dwarf mongoose''', is a [[mongoose]] found in [[eastern Africa]], particularly [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], and [[Somalia]].

The Ethiopian dwarf mongoose will send out warning calls to its family if a predator is detected. They have also been known to produce general alarm calls when danger is not present. These calls have different pitches which indicate different levels of urgency for the family. A study of dwarf mongoose suggested that they could convey the predator's species, distance and elevation to the family all through alarm calls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Europe Begins at Sarajevo''' ({{lang-fr|L'Europe commence chez Sarajevo}}; {{lang-bs|Europa počinje kod Sarajeva}}) was a short-lived [[pan-Europeanism|pan-European]] political party established in [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/134067|title=Nice Idea, Wrong Army|date=4 July 1994|work=Newsweek|accessdate=21 December 2009}} {{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to contest the [[European Parliament election, 1994|1994 European Parliament elections]] on a campaign of support for the people of [[Bosnia]] (especially [[Sarajevo]]), and their multiracialist ideals.

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
Europe Begins at Sarajevo was established in France in 1994 in reaction to the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. It carried strong [[anti-nationalist]] and pan-European sentiments. The party was established under the direction of the French philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], who visited the [[siege of Sarajevo]] in 1992 and was disturbed by what he saw. Upon returning to Paris, he delivered a plea for aid from the Bosnian President [[Alija Izetbegović]] directly to the French President [[François Mitterrand]]. The letter may have helped to spur Mitterrand's surprise visit to besieged Sarajevo in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Short|first1=Philip|title=Mitterrand: A study in ambiguity|date=2014|publisher=Vintage/ Random House|location=London|page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the siege continued, [[Bernard-Henri Lévy|Lévy]] became increasingly frustrated with Mitterrand's refusal to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, and founded the party in protest. Initial opinion polls showed the party polling at 12%, drawing votes from the centre left [[Parti Socialiste (France)|Parti Socialiste]].&lt;ref name="Short 550"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Short|first1=Philip|title=Mitterrand: A study in ambiguity|date=2014|publisher=Vintage/ Random House|location=London|page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shorty before the election, on 30 May, Levy announced that he was withdrawing from the race, claiming that he had achieved his goal of increasing awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French Bosnia Group Quits European Race|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/31/world/french-bosnia-group-quits-european-race.html|website=The New York Times|date=31 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final tally, the list only received 1.5% of votes.&lt;ref name="Short 550"/&gt;

[[File:North Brabant-Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|Flag of North Brabant (ratio 2:3)]]
[[File:Constructietekening Brabantse vlaggen.png|right|300px]]

The '''flag of North Brabant''' ({{Lang-nl|vlag van Noord-Brabant or Brabants Bont}}) consists of a chessboard pattern with 24 distinct fields in the colours red and white or gules and argent. The [[flag]] has been used since the [[Middle Ages]], but fell into disuse in the 18th century. Thanks to the State Archivist (''rijksarchivaris'') Mr. J. Smit, the flag is back in use. It has been the official flag of [[North Brabant]] since 1959.

The flag of the province of North Brabant was adopted by the Provincial Council on January 21, 1959. In addition, the following description was used: "Rectangular, consisting of four horizontal stripes, divided into six adjacent surfaces of red and white and six vertical lines, divided into four adjacent sides of red and white."

The flag of the Belgian province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] follows the same pattern but makes use of the colours red, white, blue and yellow.

==History== 
The [[North Brabant]]ian flag dates from the Middle Ages. The colors gules and argent are used in Brabant standards, flags and pennants since the proclamation of the [[Counts of Louvain|County of Louvain]] (942 CE) during the [[Lotharingia]]n period. Later the [[Duchy of Brabant]] took these colors on. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the centuries after the red and white would be often used. Ships sailed under a red-white flag, especially in [[Antwerp]]. 
At the end of the 18th century the flag fell into disuse. Only since 1959 has the red and white checkered flag become the official flag of the province of [[North Brabant]].

==Highest seniority== 
North Brabant flag has the highest seniority among all Dutch province flags. For that reason, it hung until 2006 immediately to the right of the throne of the monarch in the [[Ridderzaal]]. On official occasions the flag should always be on the very left site for the spectators. As of [[Prinsjesdag]] 2006, the flags in de Ridderzaal were replaced by tapestries bearing the provincial coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brabant.nl/organisatie/over-brabant/vlag-wapen-en-onderscheidingen/de-provincievlag.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghomara''' are an ethnic group of northern [[Morocco]], living between the rivers [[Oued Laou]] and [[Ouringa]], east of [[Chefchaouen]] and south of [[Tetouan]], in the Western [[Rif]]. The river [[Tiguisas]] runs through their territory.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

Originally, Ghomaras are a [[Berbers|Berber]] tribal group belonging to the [[Masmuda|Masmouda]] confederacy. While most have shifted to speaking [[Arabic language|Arabic]], a minority continue to speak the [[Berber languages|Berber]] [[Ghomara language]].&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

== Tribes ==
The Ghomaras are traditionally divided into eight tribes:

'''"Have Some Fun"''' is the [[Czech Republic|Czech Republic's]] entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] and was chosen to represent them on 26 January 2008. The song is sung by [[Tereza Kerndlová]] and was performed in the 2nd place on the national final. This song was the second Czech entry for Eurovision, and Tereza Kerndlová performed the song in the second semi-final, on 22 May 2008. 

The song was written by [[Gordon Pogoda]] and Stano Simor. It failed to secure a place in the final. Despite only garnering nine points, it was the Czech Republic's most successful entry until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]] when the Czech Republic qualified to the final for the first time.

== History ==
The land was originally allocated to the [[Nova Scotian settlers]] who arrived in 1792. However, in 1812, along with adjoining land, these lots were assigned to [[Charles William Maxwell]], Governor of Sierra Leone.
Heddle's Farm was built in 1820 and housed various notable people, including governor [[Charles MacCarthy (governor)|Charles MacCarthy]] and [[Kenneth Macaulay (colonialist)|Kenneth Macaulay]] before coming into the possession of [[Charles Heddle]], an [[Black Scottish people|African-Scottish]] businessman. In 1878, Heddle sold the residence to the government, and it was proclaimed to be a national monument in 1948. In the 1960s, Heddle's Farm was incorporated into [[Fourah Bay College]]'s botanical gardens. As of today, little remains of the house beyond foundation and landscaping work.&lt;ref name="SLH"&gt;{{cite web|title=SierraLeoneHeritage.org {{!}} National Monuments {{!}} Heddles Farm|url=http://www.sierraleoneheritage.org/sites/monuments/heddle/|website=www.sierraleoneheritage.org|publisher=SierraLeoneHeritage.org|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18642">The '''International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health''' ('''ICF''') is a [[medical classification|classification]] of the health components of functioning and disability.
{{Disability}}

The ICF received approval from all 191 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) member states on May 22, 2001, during the 54th [[World Health Assembly]].&lt;ref name=WHO_ICF&gt;{{cite web |date=22 July 2016 |title=International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) |website=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its approval followed nine years of international revision efforts coordinated by WHO.&lt;ref name=CDC_ICF/&gt; WHO's initial classification for the effects of diseases, the ''International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps'' (ICIDH), was created in 1980.&lt;ref name=CDC_ICF&gt;{{cite web|date=24 January 2008 |title=International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) |website=National Center for Health Statistics |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/otheract/icd9/icfhome.htm |archive-date=10 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510090103/http://www.cdc.gov/NCHS/about/otheract/icd9/icfhome.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICF classification complements WHO's [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases]]-10th Revision (ICD), which contains information on diagnosis and health condition, but not on functional status. The ICD and ICF constitute the core classifications in the [[WHO Family of International Classifications]] (WHO-FIC).&lt;ref name=beginnerICF&gt;{{citation |title=Towards a Common Language for Functioning, Disability and Health: ICF |date=2002 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |url=http://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icf/icfbeginnersguide.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-4}}

==Overview==
The ICF is structured around the following broad components:

* Body functions and structure
* Activities (related to tasks and actions by an individual) and participation (involvement in a life situation)
* Additional information on severity and environmental factors

Functioning and disability are viewed as a complex interaction between the health condition of the individual and the contextual factors of the environment as well as personal factors. The picture produced by this combination of factors and dimensions is of "the person in his or her world". The classification treats these dimensions as interactive and dynamic rather than linear or static. It allows for an assessment of the degree of disability, although it is not a measurement instrument. It is applicable to all people, whatever their health condition. The language of the ICF is neutral as to etiology, placing the emphasis on function rather than condition or disease. It also is carefully designed to be relevant across cultures as well as age groups and genders, making it highly appropriate for heterogeneous populations.

== Benefits ==
There are benefits of using the ICF for both the patient and the health professional. A major advantage for the patient is the integration of the physical, mental, and social aspects of his or her health condition. All aspects of a person’s life (development, participation and environment) are incorporated into the ICF instead of solely focusing on his or her diagnosis. A diagnosis reveals little about one’s functional abilities. Diagnoses are important for defining the cause and prognosis, but identifying the limitations of function is often the information used to plan and implement interventions.&lt;ref name="Lollar"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lollar |first1=Donald J. |last2=Simeonsson |first2=Rune J. |date=August 2005 |title=Diagnosis to function: classification for children and youths |journal=Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=323-330 |doi=10.1097/00004703-200508000-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a rehabilitation team is aware of the daily activities a client is required to participate in, the problem solving sequence set up by the ICF can be utilized. An occupational therapist, for example, would observe a patient performing his or her daily activities and note the patient's functional abilities. This information would then be used to determine the extent to which the individual’s abilities can be improved through therapy and to what extent the environment can be changed to facilitate the individual's performance.&lt;ref name="Bornman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bornman |first=J. |date=4 February 2004 |title=The World Health Organization’s terminology and classification: application to severe disability |journal=Disability and Rehabilitation |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=182-188 |doi=10.1080/09595230020029365 |pmid=14754630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intervention at one level (current abilities) has the potential to prevent or modify events at a succeeding level (participation). For example, teaching a deaf child manual signs will foster effective interaction and increase one’s participation with his or her family.&lt;ref name="Bornman" /&gt;

Rehabilitation therapists will be empowered with the ICF not only in their daily work with their patients, but also when working with other medical disciplines; hospitals and other health care administrations; health authorities and policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stucki |first1=G. |last2=Ewert |first2=T. |last3=Cieza |first3=A. |date=20 November 2002 |title=Value and application of the ICF in rehabilitation medicine |journal=Disability and Rehabilitation |volume=24 |issue=17 |pages=932-938 |doi=10.1080/09638280210148594 |pmid=12523361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All items are operationally defined with clear descriptions that can be applied to real life evaluations with clarity and ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Üstün |first1=T.B. |last2=Chatterji |first2=S. |last3=Bickenbach |first3=J. |last4=Kostanjsek |first4=N. |last5=Schneider |first5=M. |date=3 June 2003 |title=The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: A new tool for understanding disability and health |journal=Disability and Rehabilitation |volume=25 |issue=11-12 |pages=565–571 |doi=10.1080/0963828031000137063 |pmid=12959329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language used in the ICF helps facilitate better communication between these groups of people.

== Clinical relevance ==
Knowing how a disease affects one’s functioning enables better planning of services, treatment, and rehabilitation for persons with long-term disabilities or chronic conditions. The current ICF creates a more integrative understanding of health forming a comprehensive profile of an individual instead of focusing on one’s disease, illness, or disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hemmingsson |first1=Helena |last2=Jonsson |first2=Hans |date=September 2005 |title=An occupational perspective on the concept of participation in the international classification of functioning, disability and health – some critical remarks |journal=The American Journal of Occupational Therapy |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=569-576 |doi=10.5014/ajot.59.5.569 |url=http://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1872109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of using the ICF include an emphasis on the strengths of individuals, assisting individuals in participating more extensively in society by the use of interventions aimed at enhancing their abilities, and taking into consideration the environmental and personal factors that might hamper their participation.&lt;ref name="Bornman" /&gt;
Qualifiers: The ICF qualifiers “may be best translated clinically as the levels of functioning seen in a standardized or clinic setting and in everyday environments”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reed |first1=Geoffrey M. |last2=Lux |first2=Jayne B. |last3=Bufka |first3=Lynn F. |last4=Trask |first4=Christine |last5=Peterson |first5=David B. |last6=Stark |first6=Susan |last7=Threats |first7=Travis T. |last8=Jacobson |first8=John W. |last9=Hawley |first9=Judy A. |date=May 2005 |title=Operationalizing the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health in Clinical Settings |journal=Rehabilitation Psychology |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=122-131 |url=https://www.academia.edu/download/39734204/Reed_Article_48__Reed_et_al_Rehab_Psych_2005.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/0090-5550.50.2.122 |quote=The Capacity and Performance qualifiers as outlined in the ICF Activities and Participation section may be best translated clinically as the levels of functioning seen in a standardized or clinic setting (Capacity) and in everyday environments (Performance). }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualifiers support standardization and the understanding of functioning in a multidisciplinary assessment. They enable all team members to quantify the extent of problems, even in areas of functioning where one is not a specialist.&lt;ref name="Rauch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rauch |first1=A. |last2=Cieza |first2=A. |last3=Stucki |first3=G. |date=September 2008 |title=How to apply the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) for rehabilitation management in clinical practice |journal=European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=329-342 |pmid=18762742 |url=http://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/europa-medicophysica/article.php?cod=R33Y2008N03A0329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without qualifiers codes have no inherent meaning. An impairment, limitation or restriction, is qualified from 0 (No problem; 0-4%), 1 (Mild problem: 5-24%), 2 (Moderate problem: 25-49%), 3 (Severe problem: 50-95%) to 4 (Complete problem: 96-100%). Environmental factors are quantified with a negative and positive scale denoting the extent to which the environment acts as a barrier or facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2001). International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Geneva: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; For insurance purposes, the qualifiers can describe the effectiveness of treatment. One can interpret the decreasing of a qualifier score to be an increase in the functional ability of a patient.

== Core sets ==
An ICF Core Set can serve as a reference framework and a practical tool to classify and describe patient functioning in a more time efficient way. ICF Core Sets can be used along the continuum of care and over the course of a health condition.&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt; The ICF classification includes more than 1,400 categories limiting its use in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arlinger |first1=M. |last2=Stamm |first2=T.A. |last3=Pisetsky |first3=D.S. |last4=Yarboro |first4=C.H. |last5=Cieza |first5=A. |last6=Smolen |first6=J.S. |last7=Stucki |first7=G. |date=April 2006 |title=ICF core sets: how to specify impairment and function in systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=Lupus |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=248-253 |doi=10.1191/0961203306lu2298xx |pmid=16686267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is time consuming for a clinician to utilize the main volume of the ICF with his or her patients. Only a fraction of the categories is needed. As a general rule, 20% of the codes will explain 80% of the variance observed in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ustün |first1=B. |last2=Chatterji |first2=S. |last3=Kostanjsek |first3=N. |date=July 2004 |title=Comments from WHO for the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine special supplement on ICF core sets |journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine |issue=Suppl. 44 |pages=7-8 |doi=10.1080/16501960410015344 |pmid=15370741 |url=http://www.medicaljournals.se/jrm/content/?doi=10.1080/16501960410015344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ICF Core Sets contain as few as possible, but as many ICF categories as necessary, to describe a patient’s level of functioning.&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt; It is hypothesized that using an ICF Core Set will increase the inter-rater reliability when coding clinical cases as only the relevant categories for a particular patient will be utilized. Since all of the relevant categories are listed in an ICF Core Set, its use in multidisciplinary assessments protects health professionals from missing important aspects of functioning.&lt;ref name="Rauch" /&gt;

== Pediatric use ==
As clinicians and researchers used the ICF, they became more aware of its limitations. The ICF lacks the ability to classify the functional characteristics of a developing child. Different ICF codes are needed across the first years of a child’s life to capture the growth and development of a disability even when the child's diagnosis does not change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simeonsson |first1=R.J. |last2=Scarborough |first2=A.A. |last3=Hebbeler |first3=K.M. |date=April 2006 |title=ICF and ICD codes provide a standard language of disability in young children |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=365-373 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2005.09.009 |pmid=16549258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coding system can provide essential information about the severity of a health condition in terms of its impact on functioning. This can serve a significant role for providers caring for children with spectrum disorders such as autism or cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ogonowski |first1=J. |last2=Kronk |first2=R. |last3=Rice |first3=C. |last4=Feldman |first4=H. |date=18 March 2004 |title=Inter-rater reliability in assigning ICF codes to children with disabilities |journal=Disability and Rehabilitation |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=353-361 |doi=10.1080/09638280410001658658 |pmid=15204487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with these conditions may have the same diagnoses, but their abilities and levels of functioning widely vary across and within individuals over time. 
The first draft of the ''International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth'' (ICF-CY) was completed in year 2003 and published in 2007. The ICF-CY was developed to be structurally consistent with the ICF for adults. A major difference between the ICF-CY and ICF is that the generic qualifiers from the adult ICF now include developmental aspects for children and youth in the ICF-CY. Descriptions of codes in the ICF-CY were revised and expanded and new content was added to previously unused codes. Codes were added to document characteristics as adaptability, responsivity, predictability, persistence, and approachability. “Sensing” and “exploration of objects” codes were expanded as well as the “importance of learning”.&lt;ref name="Lollar" /&gt; Since a child’s main occupation is playing, it is also important to include more codes in this area. Different levels of play have separate codes in the ICF-CY (solitary, onlooker, parallel). This contrasts with the adult ICF as only one code existed in regards to leisure or recreation.

Changes in ICF-CY codes over time reflect developmental effects attributable to the child’s interaction with the environment. Environmental factors influence functioning and development and can be documented as barriers or facilitators using the ICF-CY. The key environments of children and adolescents include their homes, day care centers, schools and recreation settings of playground, parks, and ball fields.&lt;ref name="Simeonsson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simeonsson |first1=Rune J. |last2=Lollar |first2=Donald |last3=Hollowell |first3=Joseph |last4=Adams |first4=Mike |date=February 2000 |title=Revision of the international classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps: Developmental issues |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=113-124 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00133-X |pmid=10729683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children will transition between different environments many times as they grow. For example, a child will transition into elementary or high school or from one service setting or agency to another. Attention to these transitions of children with disabilities has been identified as an important role for health care providers.&lt;ref name="Simeonsson" /&gt; A transition requires preparation and planning to find an appropriate and accommodating setting for a child’s needs. With a coding system such as the ICF-CY, the transition will be smoother and interventions can start where the previous health provider left off.

'''Jean-François Aimé, Count of Dejean''' (1749–1824), was a French army officer and minister of state in the service of the [[First French Republic]] and the [[First French Empire]].

==Biography==
Jean-François was born in 1749 in [[Castelnaudary]], [[Languedoc]]. He entered the Royal French army as a second lieutenant in the engineering school of [[Mézières, Ardennes|Mézières]] in 1766.{{sfn|Feller|1856|p=455}}

At the time of the [[French Revolution]], Dejean embraced the principles of moderate reform. His talents in military administration gained him rapid advancement through the ranks of the army engineers.{{sfn|Feller|1856|pp=455–456}} He replaced [[Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville]] as commander of the ''[[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]]'' on 16 September 1796{{sfn|Clerget|1905|p=53}} and his tenure lasted until 24 September 1797 when he handed the assignment back to Beurnonville.{{sfn|Clerget|1905|p=59}}

Dejean performed a variety of important missions as a consulate, including to Genoa, where he lived for nearly two years with the title of minister extraordinary. He was recalled to Paris in 1802 to take the portfolio of [[Minister of War (France)|Minister of War Administration]] (a position he held until 1809).  Shortly before his retirement from the ministry, he was promoted to the rank of chief inspector-general of fortifications. The Emperor [[Napoleon]] soon afterwards made him a senator and a ''Trésorier de la légion-d'honneur'' (treasurer of the Legion of Honour).{{sfn|Feller|1856|pp=455–456}}

After the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Dejean joined the Provisional Government, and performed the difficult task of extraordinary commissioner to [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]] (the future Charles X). He was also appointed, a Peer of France, Governor of [[L'Ecole Polytechnique]] and Chairman of the Committee for the Liquidation of Arrears. But in 1815, having accepted service under Napoleon Bonaparte during the [[Hundred Days]], he was removed from all public offices on [[Second restoration|return of the Bourbon regime]].{{sfn|Feller|1856|p=456}}

In 1819 Dejean returned to the ''[[Chambre des Pairs]]'' (French House of Lords), where he consistently supported the liberal opposition.  He died on 12 May 1824.{{sfn|Feller|1856|p=456}}

The '''Kabylie flag''' is a cultural and national flag proposed for the [[Kabyle people]], a [[Berber people|Berber]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Kabylia]] in the north of [[Algeria]].

The flag is composed of five horizontal stripes (azure, green, yellow, green, and azure), and in the center in green is the letter Z in [[Tifinagh]].

Each color refers to an element of [[Tamazgha]], a territory inhabited by the [[Berbers]] (corresponding to the north of Africa). The azure represents the rivers and valleys of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the green represents the plains and verdant mountains, and the yellow represents the Kabyle people.

The central symbol is the letter Z in the [[Tifinagh alphabet]] (ⵣ). The symbol of the Berber resistance represents the 'free man' and the [[Kabyle language]].

{{Other uses|Liard (disambiguation)}}

[[File:Liard de France Louis XIV 1655.jpg|thumbnail|right|Liard de France Louis XIV 1655]]

The '''liard''' was a subdivision of the [[Austrian Netherlands kronenthaler|kronenthaler]], the [[currency]] of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (modern [[Belgium]]). There were 216 liards to a kronenthaler. Following the [[France|French]] occupation of the Austrian Netherlands in 1794, the kronenthaler was replaced by the [[French franc]]. Today, in [[Walloon_language|Walloon]] dialects, '''des liards''' is still a synonym of "money" in general.

The '''liard''' was also a [[France|French]] coin, worth three [[French denier|deniers]], which appeared under [[Louis XIV]] and was the smallest in use in the period prior to the [[French revolution|Revolution]].

{{Ethnic Macedonians}}

'''[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]''' (in {{lang-fr|Macédoniens}}) in [[France]] form a small minority mainly concentrated in the capital [[Paris]]. Many of them were unskilled immigrants and returned to [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] after finishing their work in France.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} After [[World War II]] many returned this time as immigrants.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Most of the immigrants originated from the [[Struga]], [[Ohrid]] and [[Kicevo]] regions.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} They were primarily settled in migrant hostels and "ghettoes".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} More still emigrated to France after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The French government estimates the number of Macedonians in France to be 2,300 while Macedonian figures put the number at over 15,000 people.

The '''Préfet Maritime''' is a servant of the [[France|French State]] who exercises authority over the sea in one particular region (a ''Préfecture maritime''). As a [[civil servant (France)|civil servant]], he reports to the [[Prime Minister (France)|Prime Minister]]. But the Maritime Prefect is simultaneously charged of military operations, and for this reason also reports to the chief of the general staff ([[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|CEMA]], or ''Chef d'état-major des armées'').

The dignity was created in 1800 to unify the command of harbours (civil administrator) and the command of the Navy (Admiral).

The ''préfet maritime'' is in charge of the French sovereignty at sea, monitoring operation, safety of the users, police and rescue operations, etc. He also commands all armed vessel linked to his place.

The present ''Préfets maritimes'' are:
* [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Toulon]]): Admiral [[Yann Tainguy]]
* [[English Channel]] and [[North Sea]] ([[Cherbourg]]): [[Emmanuel Carlier]]
* [[Atlantic]] ([[Château de Brest]], [[Brest, France|Brest]]): [[Emmanuel de Oliveira]]

'''Michael Burawoy''' (born 15 June 1947) is a British [[Sociology|sociologist]] working within [[Marxism|Marxist]] social theory, best known as author of ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labor Process under Monopoly Capitalism]]''—a study on work and organizations that has been translated into a number of languages, and the leading proponent of [[public sociology]]. Burawoy was also president of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 2004 and is a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 2006&amp;ndash;2010, he was vice-president for the Committee of National Associations of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA). In the XVII ISA World Congress of Sociology he was elected President of the International Sociological Association (ISA) for the period 2010&amp;ndash;2014.

==Biography==
Graduating as a mathematics student from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1968, Burawoy went on to pursue post-graduate study in the newly independent African nation of [[Zambia]], while simultaneously working as a researcher for [[Anglo American PLC]]. Completing a [[Masters degree|master's degree]] at the [[University of Zambia]] in 1972, Burawoy enrolled as a doctoral student at the [[University of Chicago]], finishing a sociology dissertation with an ethnography of Chicago industrial workers, later to become ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labor Process under Monopoly Capitalism]]''.

Aside from Burawoy's sociological study of the industrial workplace in Zambia, Burawoy has studied industrial workplaces in [[Chicago]], [[Hungary]], and post-Soviet [[Russia]]. His method of choice is usually [[participant observation]], more specifically [[ethnography]].&lt;ref&gt;See his collaborative work on: ''Ethnography Unbound: Power and Resistance in the Modern Metropolis'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991) and ''Global Ethnography: Forces, Connections and Imaginations in a Postmodern World'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his studies of the workplace he has looked into the nature of [[postcolonialism]], the organization of [[state socialism]], and the problems in the transition from [[socialism]].

In more recent times, Burawoy has moved away from observing factories to looking at his own place of work—the university—to consider the way sociology is taught to students and how it is put into the [[public domain]]. His work on [[public sociology]] is most prominently shown in his presidential address to the American Sociological Association in 2004, where he divides sociology into four separate (yet overlapping) categories: public sociology, [[policy sociology]] (which has an extra-academic audience), professional sociology (which addresses an academic audience familiar with theoretical and methodological frameworks common to the discipline of sociology), and lastly [[critical sociology]] which, like public sociology, produces reflexive knowledge but which is only available to an academic audience, like professional sociology.

'''''Nuubaat''''' ({{lang-ar|'''نوبات'''}} {{IPA-ar|nuːˈbæːt|}}) is a form of [[Algeria]]n [[classical music]]. The term itself is the [[plural]] form of ''nūba'' (نوبة), a [[suite (music)|suite]] of old [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] musical pieces. It is these multi-[[movement (music)|movement]] works that give nuubaat its name. The music originally spread from [[Islamic]] [[Spain]] to [[North Africa]] following the [[Christian]] [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] of Spain and subsequent [[Alhambra decree|expulsion]] of [[Sephardic Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. In Algeria, the form originally found a home in the cities of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] and [[Tlemcen]], with [[Algiers]] later becoming an influential center as well.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds |first=Dwight |date=July 1995 |title=Music of Algeria: Selected Recordings |journal=Middle East Studies Association Bulletin |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=16–21 |issn=0026-3184 |url=http://fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/Bulletin/reynolds.htm |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606160854/http://fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/Bulletin/reynolds.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2014, FACTSHEET: Investing in African Trade for Our Common Future was released. It clarified strategies pertaining to the renewal and update of the African Growth Opportunities Act (AGOA), synergies through aligning assistance, improving infrastructure to enhance competitiveness, strengthen trade capacity and creation of new African markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/04/fact-sheet-investing-african-trade-our-common-future |title=FACTSHEET: Investing in African Trade for our Common Future |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=4 August 2014 |website= |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 2014, FACTSHEET: The Doing Business in Africa Campaign (DBIA) was released. The emphasis was on the United States' commitment to strengthen its ties and commercial relationship with Africa. The Fact Sheet clarified this new commitment to expand the Doing Business in Africa Campaign: "At today’s U.S.-Africa Business Forum, President Obama announced $7 billion in new financing to promote U.S. exports to and investments in Africa under the DBIA Campaign.  U.S. companies announced new deals in clean energy, aviation, banking, and construction worth more than $14 billion, in addition to $12 billion in new commitments under the President’s Power Africa initiative from private sector partners, the World Bank, and the government of Sweden.  Taken together, these new commitments amount to more than $33 billion, supporting economic growth across Africa and tens of thousands of U.S. jobs." In addition, the Fact Sheet emphasized the President's Executive Order to create a Presidential Advisory Council on DBIA and new U.S. Government resources to support U.S. exports and investments in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/05/fact-sheet-doing-business-africa-campaign |title=FACTSHEET: Doing Business in Africa Campaign |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=5 August 2014 |website= |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
