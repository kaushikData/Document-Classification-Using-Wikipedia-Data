      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4540">'''Al-Mansur Ahmad''' (died 1853) was a [[Zaydiyya]] [[imam]] who claimed the rulership over [[Yemen]] in the years 1849-1853. His strife-ridden career spelt the end of the Zaydi Imamate of Yemen as a coherent force.

== Background of the rebellion ==

In the 19th century, the shrinking resources of the Yemeni state, which had existed since the early 17th century, combined with religio-political strife to erode the authority of the ruling imams. In general terms, a [[Sunni]]-influenced element, which backed the imams of the Qasimi line, stood against traditional Hadawi (Zaydiyya) interests. The Hadawi imam [[an-Nasir Abdallah]] was murdered in 1840, and Sunni elements regained power.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an-Nasir Abdullah's partisan Sayyid Husayn withdrew to [[Sa'dah]], north of the capital [[Sana'a]], bringing a number of Hadawi [[ulema]]. One of his retainers was a younger scholar called Ahmad bin Hashim. He was a [[Sayyid]], but not of the Qasimi line; rather, he was a 23rd-generation descendant of the imam [[al-Mansur Yahya]] (d. 976).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=64 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201057/http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=64 |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Arabic). The line of descent is al-Mansur Yahya - Abdallah - Yahya - Ahmad - al-Husayn - Ja'far - al-Husayn - Muhammad - Ja'far - Muhammad - Abu'l-Qasim - Hamzah - Abdallah - an-Nasir - al-Maharas - an-Nasir - al-Mahdi - Izz ad-Din - al-Husayn - Isma'il - al-Qasim - al-Muhsin - Hashim - al-Mansur Ahmad.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after the death of his patron, in 1847/48, Ahmad bin Hashim undertook a hijra, an emigration from tyrannical rule, of his own. Together with some ulema he left Sana'a for Sa'dah. There he claimed the imamate in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Steven Wilhite, ''Guerilla War, Counterinsurgency, and State Formation in Ottoman Yemen'', PhD thesis, Ohio State University, 2003, p. 95-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capture of Sana'a ==

In Sa'na itself, an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion had just been repelled, but the new imam [[Al-Mansur Ali II, Imam of Yemen|al-Mansur Ali II]] lacked proper qualifications for the dignity. This became the opportunity for Ahmad bin Hashim, who took the regnal title al-Mansur Ahmad. He gained a great following from the [[Hashid]] tribe and the tribal groups to the north-east. Elements which were dissatisfied with the Sunni-oriented style of the imam's court in Sa'na, backed the new claimant. The ulema of Sana'a, realizing the poor merits of al-Mansur Ali II, deposed him in favour of the scholarly [[al-Mu'ayyad Abbas]] (1850). The population of [[Sana'a]], [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] and [[Yarim]] split into factions backing either Ali or Abbas. Under these circumstances, the followers of al-Mansur Ahmad were able to gain control over Sana'a in 1850. Al-Mu'ayyad Abbas took refuge in the citadel of the city, but was forced to capitulate.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Steven Wilhite, 2003, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Failure to rule ==

The "rebellion" of al-Mansur Ahmad was made possible through the widespread discontent with the authoritarianism and extravagance of the ruling elite in Sana'a. Nevertheless, the enterprise soon proved unsuccessful. The action virtually destroyed the Qasimi state of Yemen, which was fragmented along tribal and regional lines. The tribal groups which had supported Al-Mansur Ahmad abandoned him soon after his accession. He was unable to pay them to ensure their loyalty, or to raise an army to gain control over the country. The previous incumbent, al-Mansur Ali II, made a new bid for Sana'a. The city was taken by his followers, although it quickly changed hands again to [[al-Hadi Ghalib]] (1851).&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Steven Wilhite, 2003, p. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur Ahmad's rule over Sana'a had only lasted for three months. His imamate thus lapsed into obscurity, and he had to flee to the Arhat tribe.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, 1983. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ebore Woman (24832751592).jpg|thumb|An Arbore woman]]
The '''Arbore''' is an ethnic group living in southern [[Ethiopia]], near [[Lake Chew Bahir]]. The Arbore people exist as pastoralists (see [[Pastoralism]]), and have ancestral links to the [[Konso People]]. With a total population of 6850, the Abore population is divided into four villages, named: Gandareb, Kulaama, Murale, and Eegude.

== Arbore language ==
That the language of Arbore belongs within a "Macro-Somali" (now "Omo-Tana") group was first recognized by Sasse (1974). Other members of this group are Daasanach, Bayso, Rendille, Boni and the various Somali dialects. Omo-Tana itself is a major division of Lowland East Cushitic. Arbore's nearest relatives (jointly classified as Western Omo-Tana) are Daasanach and-especially the probably extinct Kenyan language of the Elmolo fisherman of Lake Turkana. The sub-grouping is justified&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arbore Language: a First Investigation. Including a Vocabulary|last=Hayward|first=Richard|publisher=Kuschitische Sprachstudien 2|year=1984|isbn=|location=Hamburg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of uniquely shared lexicon and certain common grammatical innovations, amongst which should be noted the generalizations of the absolute forms of the 1st person singular and 2nd person singular personal pronouns to subject function, thereby replacing the earlier Proto-Lowland East Cushitic forms, e.g. 2nd personal pronouns to subject function, thereby replacing the earlier Proto-Lowland East Cushitic forms, e.g., 2nd person singular ''tai/u'' 'thou': ''ki/u'' 'thee', but Arbore ''ke'' 'thou' and 'thee'.
Arbore well exemplifies a number of typical lowland East Cushitic features such as: a three-term number system (basic unit: singulative: plural) in nouns, within which "polarity" figures, i.e., gender alternations across the various number forms of a lexeme; a morphosyntax thoroughly deployed in distinguishing topic and contrastive focus; great morphophonological complexity in its verbal derivation and inflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hayward |first=Richard |title= Arbore language |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Aethiopica|date= |year=2003 |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |location=Wiesbaden |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of historical interest is the language's preservation of at least a dozen verbs of the archaic "Prefix Conjugation", often attributed to Proto-Afrosiatic itself.

== Arbore ethnography ==
The people who also call themselves the Hor (Hoor) live in four villages in the delta of the Limo River (also known as Dullay or Weyto) at the northern end of Lake Stephanie (Bau or Chew Bahr) in South Omo Administrative Region. The name Arbore is used by the inhabitants if two of the four villages, Gandaraba and Kulama, whereas the inhabitants of Eegude and Murale refer to themselves as Marle, Arbore being the term traditionally employed by anthropologists and by the Ethiopian government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Tadesse |first1=Wolde Gossa |last2=Peller |first2=Anni |title= Arbore ethnography |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Aethiopica|date= |year=2003 |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |location=Wiesbaden |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arbore practice pastoralism, sorghum cultivation, seasonal fishing and hunting and engage in a wide regional network of bond friendship for the exchange of gifts. In 1996 their population numbered 3,840. Their economy of subsistence depends largely on the periodical floods of the river.

The age organization controls cattle, pasture and water. It distributes cultivable land after floods and guarantees law and order in the territory of the Arbore. Each generation class (''herr'') comes to power after an initiation which is held once in about 40 years in rituals known as ''ner'' and ''chirnan''. Each generation class consists of four age classes (''jim''). The group containing the young people waiting to be initiated into a ''jim'' is called ''morqo''. The same term is used for the four age classes organized and named, but waiting to form a generation class by undergoing initiation at the close of the 40 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Garle and Olmoque clans, who are senior and junior, jointly lead the political and ritual life of the Arbore and their neighbors, and the leaders of the age organization survey the smooth running of daily life among the Arbore. The political chief is usually called ''kyrnat'', the ritual ''qawot'', even though it does not imply that political and religious life and functions are strictly separated. Both the Arbore and their neighbors enter the sacred cattle-gates of ''qawots'' (ritual chiefs) with gifts of heifers, bulls, honey, coffee, tobacco and herbs to receive blessings for human, animal and crop fertility, for rain and for victory against their enemies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Photocopier-Xerox-2004.jpg|thumb|The ALCS collects on behalf of its members and distributes to them [[royalties]] for, among other things, the [[Photocopier|photocopying]] of authors' works.]]

The '''Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society''' (ALCS) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] organisation that works to ensure that [[writer]]s are fairly compensated for any of their works that are copied, broadcast or recorded. It has operated in the United Kingdom since 1977. From that year to 2016, the ALCS distributed over £450 million to authors, and at the end of 2016 had in excess of 90,000 members.

==History==
ALCS was founded in 1977 after a long campaign in the United Kingdom by the Writers' Action Group (WAG) for writers to receive remuneration for the lending of their works by libraries. Then known as the Authors' Lending and Copyright Society, it was incorporated on 26 April 1977 to handle:

*payments from Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG Wort &amp;ndash; the Word Exploitation Corporation) for the German [[public lending right]] (PLR);
*the British PLR;
*Belgian [[cable television]]; and
*[[reprography]] ([[photocopying]]) [[royalties]].&lt;ref name="ALCS: Past"&gt;{{citation|title=Past|url=http://www.alcs.co.uk/About_ALCS/Past%20Present%20Future/Past.aspx|publisher=Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society|accessdate=2008-02-19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the organization that was eventually responsible for distributing the fees obtained from the lending of books in libraries was the Public Lending Right.&lt;ref name="ALCS: Past"/&gt;

In 1982, [[The Copyright Licensing Agency]] was founded by ALCS and the [[Publishers Licensing Society]] (PLS). ALCS receives the majority of its income (65–70%) from the CLA's photocopying licensing schemes.&lt;ref name="ALCS: Past"/&gt;

==Aims and operation==
ALCS represents the interests of many UK writers and aims to ensure they are fairly compensated for any works that are copied, broadcast or recorded. The organisation is dedicated to protecting and promoting authors' rights:

*by encouraging the establishment of collective licensing schemes, where appropriate, and ensuring that fees resulting from such schemes are efficiently collected and distributed; and
*by building an understanding of the value of the contribution writers make to society.

ALCS's Ordinary Members sign a mandate that authorizes the Society to license and collect royalties on their behalf. ALCS is granted authority to exercise rights on each author's behalf as part of schemes for the collective administration of royalties in the UK and abroad. The rights range from photocopying, scanning and cable retransmission in the UK and internationally to reproduction in journals. The authority entitles ALCS in agreed circumstances to permit or forbid the exercise of the rights, grant licences, collect fees for use and damages for misuse and take action to defend and protect the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The plain English mandate|url=http://www.alcs.co.uk/About_ALCS/Structure%20Functions/The%20Mandate/Plain_English_Mandate.aspx|publisher=Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society|accessdate=2008-02-19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ALCS works closely with other writers organisations such as [[The Society of Authors]] and [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]].

From its inception in 1977, ALCS has distributed over £450 million to authors, and in the financial year 2015-2016 it paid £28 million to over 70,000 writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ALCS Annual Report 2015-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an authority on copyright matters and authors' interests, the ALCS is committed to fostering an awareness of [[intellectual property]] issues among the writing community. It monitors matters affecting copyright both in the UK and internationally, and makes regular representations on writers' behalf to the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government]] and the [[European Commission]]. ALCS also administers the All Party Writers Group.

==Governance==
The ALCS is governed by a [[board of directors|board]] of 9 directors, the majority of whom are working writers.  The Board is responsible for the overall performance of the Society, which is incorporated as a [[company limited by guarantee]].&lt;ref name="ALCS: Governance"&gt;{{citation|title=Governance and the Board of Directors|url=http://www.alcs.co.uk/About_ALCS/Structure%20Functions/Governance_Board_Directors.aspx|publisher=Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society|accessdate=2008-02-19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7593">'''Cannabis in Guam''' is as of 2015 legal for [[medicinal marijuana|medical purposes]], but illegal for recreational purposes. Guam was the first [[United States Territory]] to legalize medical marijuana, in 2014.

The 2012 [[UNODC]] ''World Drug Report'' ranked Guam as the third-highest jurisdiction for adult cannabis in the world, at 18.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=World Drug Report|journal=UNODC|date=2012|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/WDR2012/WDR_2012_web_small.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Stone |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/us-ranks-no-7-global-list-marijuana-use-percentage-users-continues-rise-720896 |title=US Ranks No. 7 On Global List Of Marijuana Use, As Percentage Of Users Continues To Rise |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, according to [[NORML]], possession of less than an ounce, outside a school zone, can result is a [[civil infraction]] with a $100 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=NORML|title=Guam Laws and Penalties |url=http://norml.org/laws/item/guam-penalties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A 1996 report by the [[Guam Health Planning and Development Agency]] attributes the origin of marijuana usage in Guam to the Vietnam War of the 1960s and 1970s, when American servicemen on the island popularized the habit.&lt;ref name="Agency1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guam Health Planning and Development Agency|title=Guam Health Plan: 2001 and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPDaAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=The Agency|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Guam v. Guerrero''==
''Guam v. Guerrero'' was a [[United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit]] ruling issued in 2002, which ruled that Benny Guerrero was not entitled to religious protections for his possession of cannabis on Guam despite his professed [[Rastafari]] religion. Guerrero was arrested for possession at Guam International Airport in 1991. His argument for religious exemption had been approved by a lower court, then by the [[Supreme Court of Guam]] which found it valid under the Free Exercise Clause of the [[Constitution of Guam]]; however, the Guamanian government raised the issue to the Ninth Circuit which ultimately struck down the lower findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1355714.html |title=GUAM v.

==Cannabis economy==
The August 2003 ''Guam Drug Threat Assessment'' by the [[National Drug Intelligence Center]] notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Enhanced eradication, interdiction, and street-level law enforcement initiatives caused a significant increase in marijuana prices in the early 1990s, and prices have remained high. In 1991 the price for 1 pound of marijuana increased from $2,500 to between $5,000 and $8,000. According to DEA, in the second quarter of FY2002 marijuana sold for $12,800 per pound. In addition, marijuana sold for $800 per ounce, and $20 per joint. The drug typically is distributed at the retail level in machine-rolled joints. In spite of law enforcement efforts, marijuana is more readily available on Guam than in Japan. As a result, many young Japanese tourists seek the drug during their visits. The price of one machine-rolled joint for sale to a Japanese tourist ranges from $150 to $200, considerably more than the $20 paid by local users.
...

Despite the widespread availability of marijuana, the number of marijuana-related federal sentences on Guam remained very low from FY1997 through FY2001. According to USSC data, Guam had two marijuana-related federal sentences in FY1997, one in FY1998, none in FY1999, none in FY2000, and one in FY2001.

Cannabis is cultivated both outdoors and indoors on Guam, primarily for personal consumption. Because of the poor soil, domestically produced marijuana has lower THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) levels than marijuana produced in other source areas. ... Violence is occasionally associated with cannabis cultivation on Guam. Law enforcement authorities encounter a significant number of small cannabis plots in remote areas, and cannabis growers occasionally booby-trap these cultivation sites, endangering both law enforcement officers and the general public.

Marijuana typically is smuggled into Guam from the Republic of Palau and, to a lesser extent, from Hawaii and the Federated States of Micronesia via package delivery services or in commercial air cargo. Often the relatives of Guam residents who are of Palauan descent ship large coolers containing fish or yams with 5 to 10 pounds of marijuana hidden inside the coolers' walls. Bodycarriers aboard commercial aircraft also transport marijuana into Guam. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs4/4001/marijuan.htm |title=Marijuana - Guam Drug Threat Assessment |publisher=Justice.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Medical marijuana==
Guam legalized medical marijuana for "debilitative conditions" via referendum in the November 2014 mid-term elections, with 56% voting in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingraham |first=Christopher |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/04/medical-marijuana-advocates-notch-an-early-victory-in-guam/ |title=Medical marijuana advocates notch an early victory in Guam |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2014-11-04 |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guam had previously attempted to legalize medical marijuana in 2010, under "Bill 420" (later withdrawn and replaced with Bill 423); its public hearing was attended by only one person, who spoke against the measure, and the bill was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Only one shows up for pot bill |url=http://mvguam.com/local/news/13221-only-one-shows-up-for-pot-bill.html#.VaZE-rfvgWE |title=Only one shows up for pot bill |publisher=Mvguam.com |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Guam's governor vetoed legislation to allow medical cannabis license holders to cultivate cannabis in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2016/12/16/marijuana-home-cultivation-senators-raises-vetoed/95508146/ |title=Marijuana home cultivation, senators' raises vetoed |publisher=Guampdn.com |date=2016-12-16 |accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed legalization==
In January 2017 governor [[Eddie Calvo]] proposed a bill, called the Marijuana Control Law, to legalize recreational cannabis in Guam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postguam.com/news/local/calvo-submits-marijuana-bill/article_5173e2c0-d700-11e6-a3d3-834690076b77.html |title=Calvo submits marijuana bill &amp;#124; Local News |publisher=postguam.com |date=2017-01-06 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caxton Club''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] and [[Bibliophilia|bibliophilic]] society founded in [[Chicago]] in 1895 to promote the [[Artist's book|book arts]] and the [[history of the book]]. To further its goals, the club holds monthly (September through June) dinner meetings and luncheons, sponsors bibliophile events (often in collaboration with the [[Newberry Library]] and with other regional institutions) and exhibitions, and publishes books, exhibition catalogs, and a monthly journal, ''The Caxtonian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caxtonclub.org/schedule.html |title=Meetings &amp; Speakers Schedule |publisher=Caxton Club |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caxtonclub.org/events.html |title=Bibliophile Events |publisher=Caxton Club |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caxtonclub.org/exhibitions.html |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Caxton Club |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/books/21margin.html |first=Dirk |last=Johnson |title=Book Lovers Fear Dim Future for Notes in the Margins |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caxtonclub.org/publications.html |title=Publications |publisher=Caxton Club |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caxtonclub.org/caxtonian.html |title=''Caxtonian'' |publisher=Caxton Club |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caxton Club is a member club of the [[Fellowship of American Bibliophilic Societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fabsbooks.org/MemberClubs.aspx |title=Fellowship of American Bibliophilic Societies Member Clubs |publisher=Fellowship of American Bibliophilic Societies |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720044953/http://fabsbooks.org/MemberClubs.aspx |archivedate=July 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Caxton Club was founded in 1895 by a group of fifteen bibliophiles to support the publication of fine books in the style of the then-new [[Arts and Crafts Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gehl |first=Paul |encyclopedia=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago |title=Book Arts |url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/156.html |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's name honors the fifteenth-century [[England|English]] [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] [[William Caxton]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caxtonclub.org/history.html |title=History |publisher=Caxton Club |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caxton Club flourished until [[World War I]], after which its membership declined. The club was revived, however, and began to hold regular monthly meetings. The club was exclusively for men until 1976 when the first women were elected to membership.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The Club published a number of fine editions in partnership with the [[Lakeside Press#History|Lakeside Press]] of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Hutner | first1 = Martin |year = 2004 |title = A Century for the Century: Fine Printed Books from 1900 to 1999 |publisher = Grolier Club| location = |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=On2cttWtZ9AC |isbn = 9781567922202|ref = none}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=On2cttWtZ9AC&amp;pg=PR37&amp;dq=Rockwell+Kent+Moby-dick+lakeside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFHUVK3lGoWQyAT84YDQCg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rockwell%20Kent%20Moby-dick%20lakeside&amp;f=false p.

The Club gives out scholarships and grants to students and researchers in the [[Book illustration|book arts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://caxtonclub.org/grants/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bechuanaland Protectorate===
The seven censuses of Botswana before its independence happened irregularly. Due to the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]], the first census of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]], originally set to occur in 1901, took place on 17 April 1904.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content1&amp;site=census&amp;id=28&amp;parent_id=27|publisher=Central Statistics Office|accessdate=20 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69I1Cikab?url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content1&amp;site=census&amp;id=28&amp;parent_id=27|archivedate=20 July 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1931 census was postponed to 1936 because of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The early censuses were unreliable and took several years to tabulate; the results were outdated by the time they were calculated.

===Post-independence===
There have been five censuses after the independence of Botswana, each occurring every ten years in the year ending in 1 (i.e. 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011). The 1971 census was the first census in Botswana to use de facto enumeration; this method counts people based on how many people spent census night at a specific location. Previously, the citizens were counted based on their usual place of residence. The 2001 census was the first census in Botswana to comply with the [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] 2000 Census Project, the guidelines of which unify the demographic statistics in southern [[Africa]]. The most recent census was the [[2011 Botswana Population and Housing Census]], which occurred in August 2011.

'''Chechens''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|tʃ|ə|n}}; {{lang-ce|Нохчий}} ''{{transl|ce|Noxçiy}}''; Old Chechen: Нахчой ''Naxçoy'') are a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] ethnic group of the [[Nakh peoples]] originating in the [[North Caucasus]] region of [[Eastern Europe]]. They refer to themselves as '''Vainakhs''' (which means ''our people'' in Chechen) or '''Nokhchiy''' (pronounced {{ipa|[no̞xtʃʼiː]}}; singular Nokhchi, Nakhchuo or Nakhtche).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chechenzes|volume=6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chechen and [[Ingush people]]s are collectively known as the [[Vainakh]]. The majority of Chechens today live in the [[Chechnya|Chechen Republic]], a [[Subdivisions of Russia|subdivision of the Russian Federation]].

[[File:Саадулла Оспанов.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chechen warrior of the 19th century]]

The isolated terrain of the [[Caucasus mountains]] and the strategic value outsiders have placed on the areas settled by Chechens has contributed much to the Chechen community [[ethos]] and helped shape its fiercely independent national character. Chechen society has traditionally been [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and organized around many autonomous local clans, called [[teip]]s.

==Origins of the word Chechen==
The term "Chechen" first occurs in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources from the 8th century. According to popular tradition, the Russian term "Chechen" comes from the name of the village of Chechen-Aul. The word "Chechen", however, occurs in Russian sources as early as 1692 and the [[Russians]] probably derived it from the [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] "Shashan".&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and diaspora==
{{Main|Chechen diaspora}}
The Chechens are mainly inhabitants of [[Chechnya]]. There are also significant Chechen populations in other [[subdivisions of Russia]] (especially in [[Dagestan]], [[Ingushetia]] and [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]]).

Outside Russia, countries with significant diaspora populations are Kazakhstan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Arab states (especially Jordan and Iraq, where they are mainly descendants of people who had to leave Chechnya during the [[Caucasian War]], which led to the annexation of Chechnya by the [[Russian Empire]] around 1850) and the 1944 [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] deportation in the case of Kazakhstan. Tens of thousands of [[Chechen refugees]] settled in the European Union and elsewhere as the result of the recent [[Second Chechen War|Chechen War]]s, especially in the wave of emigration to the [[Western world|West]] after 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Chechnya's Exodus to Europe, ''North Caucasus Weekly'' Volume: 9 Issue: 3, [[The Jamestown Foundation]], January 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chechens are one of the Nakh peoples, who have lived in the highlands of the North Caucasus region since prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/Proceed97/Arutiunov5.html|title=ETHNICITY AND CONFLICT IN THE CAUCASUS(5)|website=Src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is archeological evidence of historical continuity dating back since 3000 B.C.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5469/1158|title=Peering Into the Past, With Words|first=Bernice|last=Wuethrich|date=19 May 2000|journal=Science|volume=288|issue=5469|pages=1158–1158|accessdate=17 October 2018|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.288.5469.1158}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as evidence proving their migration from the Fertile Crescent c.&amp;nbsp;10,000–8000&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], the lowland of Chechnya was dominated by the [[Khazars]] and then the [[Alans]]. Local culture was also subject to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] influence and some Chechens converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. Gradually, [[Islam]] prevailed, although the Chechens' [[Vainakh mythology|own pagan religion]] was still strong until the 19th century. Society was organised along feudal lines. Chechnya was [[Mongol invasions of Chechnya|devastated by the Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century and those of [[Tamerlane]] in the 14th.&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Vainakh bear the distinction of being one of the few peoples to successfully resist the Mongols and defend themselves against their invasions; not once, but twice, though this came at great cost to them, as their state was utterly destroyed. These events were key in the shaping of the Chechen nationhood and their martial-oriented and clan-based society.&lt;ref name="Minahan2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Minahan|first=James|title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC&amp;pg=PA168|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30984-7|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late Middle Ages, the [[Little Ice Age]] forced the Chechens down from the hills into the lowlands, where they came into conflict with the [[Terek Cossacks|Terek]] and [[Greben Cossacks]] who had also begun to move into the region. The Caucasus was also a major competing area for two neighbouring rival empires: the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Persian Empire]]s ([[Safavids]], [[Afsharids]], [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]]). Starting from [[Peace of Amasya|1555]] and decisely from [[Treaty of Zuhab|1639]] through the first half of the 19th century, the Caucasus was divided by these two powers, with the [[Ottomans]] prevailing in Western [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], while [[Safavid Persia|Persia]] kept the bulk of the [[Caucasus]], namely Eastern Georgia, [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5MOYzS3IDTQC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=Caucasus+divided+between+persia+and+turkey&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IdibVI7HMMOz7gahoIHgDg&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Caucasus+divided+between+persia+and+turkey&amp;f=false|title=Conflict and Security in Central Asia and the Caucasus|first=Hooman|last=Peimani|date=17 October 2018|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=17 October 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chechens, however, never really fell under the rule of either empire. As Russia expanded slowly southwards as early as the 16th century, clashes between Chechens and the Russians became more frequent, and it became three empires competing for the region. As Russia set off to increase its political influence in the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] at the expense of [[Safavid Persia]], [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]], in which Russia succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories for several years. Notable in Chechen history, this particular Russo-Persian War marked the first military encounter between Imperial Russia and the [[Vainakh]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheikh Mansur]] led a major Chechen resistance movement in the late 18th century.

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, Russia embarked on full-scale conquest of the North Caucasus in the [[Caucasian War]]. Much of the campaign was led by [[Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov|General Yermolov]] who particularly disliked the Chechens, describing them as "a bold and dangerous people".&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by Chechen raids, Yermolov resorted to a brutal policy of "[[scorched earth]]" and deportations; he also founded the fort of [[Grozny]] (now the capital of Chechnya) in 1818. Chechen resistance to Russian rule reached its peak under the leadership of the Dagestani leader [[Imam Shamil]]. The Chechens were finally defeated in 1861 after a bloody war that lasted for decades, during which they lost most of their entire population.&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha (p.50): "The Chechens suffered horrific losses in human life during the long war. From an estimated population of over a million in the 1840s, there were only 140,000 Chechens left in the Caucasus in 1861..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, large numbers of refugees also [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|emigrated or were forcibly deported]] to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="nichols"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iseees.berkeley.edu/articles/nichols_1995-chechen.pdf |title=Who are the Chechens? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915080123/http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~bsp/caucasus/articles/nichols_1995-chechen.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-15}} by [[Johanna Nichols]], [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop p.29ff. Dunlop writes (p.30): "In 1860, according to Soviet-era figures, 81,360 Chechens left for Turkey; a second emigration took place in 1865, when an additional 22,500 Chechens left. More than 100,000 Chechens were thus ethnically 'cleansed' during this process. This was perhaps a majority of their total population..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, there have been various Chechen rebellions against Russian/Soviet power (including during the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[World War II]]), as well as nonviolent resistance to [[Russification]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s collectivization and anti-religion campaigns. In 1944, all Chechens, together with several other [[peoples of the Caucasus]], were ordered by the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|to be ruthlessly deported ''en masse'']] to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz]] SSRs; and their republic and nation were abolished. At least one-quarter—and perhaps half—of the entire Chechen population perished in the process, and a severe blow was made to their culture and historical records.&lt;ref name="nichols" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, Chapter 2 "Soviet Genocide", particularly pp. 70–71 ("How many died?")&lt;/ref&gt; Though "[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]" in 1956 and allowed to return the next year, the survivors lost economic resources and civil rights and, under both Soviet and post-Soviet governments, they have been the objects of both official and unofficial discrimination and discriminatory public discourse.&lt;ref name="nichols" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Chechen attempts to regain independence in the 1990s after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] have led to the [[First Chechen War|first]] and the [[Second Chechen War|second]] war with the new Russian state, starting in 1994.

==Language==
{{Main|Chechen language}}

The main language of the Chechen people is [[Chechen language|Chechen]]. Chechen belongs to the family of [[Nakh languages]] ([[Northeast Caucasian languages]]). Literary Chechen is based on the central lowland dialect. Other related languages include [[Ingush language|Ingush]], which has speakers in the neighbouring [[Ingushetia]], and [[Bats language|Batsbi]], which is the language of the people in the adjoining part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. At various times in their history, Chechens used [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets; as of 2008, the official one is now the [[Cyrillic script]] of Russia.

Most Chechens living in their homeland can understand Ingush with ease. The two languages are not truly mutually intelligible, but it is easy for Chechens to learn how to understand the Ingush language and vice-versa over time after hearing it for a while.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1989, 73.4% spoke Russian,&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailov, Valentin. ''Chechnya and Tatarstan''&lt;/ref&gt; though this figure has declined due to the wars for a large number of reasons (including the lack of proper education, the refusal to learn the language, and the mass dispersal of the Chechen diaspora due to the war). Chechens in [[Chechen diaspora|the diaspora]] often speak the language of the country they live in (German, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Polish, [[Georgian language|Georgian]], etc.).

==Origin hypotheses==
{{main|Vainakh origin hypotheses}}
{{see also|History of Chechnya#Theories on origins}}
Chechens are a [[Nakh peoples|Nakh people]], and discussion of their origins is intertwined with the discussion of the mysterious origins of Nakh peoples as a whole. The only two surviving (and fairly numerous) Nakh peoples are Chechens and [[Ingush people|Ingush]], but they are thought by some scholars to be the remnants of what was once a larger family of peoples.

The Nakh languages are a subgroup of [[Northeast Caucasian]], and as such are related to Nakho-Dagestanian family, including the languages of the [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]], [[Dargins]], [[Lezghins]], [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Laks]], etc.
However, this relationship is not a close one: the Nakho-Dagestani family is of comparable or greater time-depth than [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], meaning Chechens are only as linguistically related to Avars or Dargins as the [[French people|French]] are to the Russians or [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Nakh peoples such as Chechens are thought to either be descended from original settlers of the Caucasus (North and/or South)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bernice Wuethrich |date=19 May 2000 |title=Peering Into the Past, With Words |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=288 |issue=5469 |pages=1158–1158 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5469/1158.full |doi=10.1126/science.288.5469.1158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ingush.berkeley.edu:7012/ingush_people.html |title=The Ingush (with notes on the Chechen): Background information |accessdate=2007-02-10 |author=[[Johanna Nichols]] |date=February 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311090332/http://ingush.berkeley.edu:7012/ingush_people.html |archivedate=March 11, 2008|work=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or supposedly Nakh-speaking ethnic minorities in the north-eastern regions of the ancient state of [[Urartu]] (whose people also spoke a language that was possibly related to the Nakh languages).&lt;ref name="Jaimoukha. Chechens. Page 29"&gt;Jaimoukha. ''Chechens''. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The two theories are not mutually incompatible, and there has been much evidence that seems to link both of the two together (either by dual origins or the "return" theory, in which the Nakh peoples originally lived in the Caucasus and then returned). Chechen genetics show a high level of genetic diversity (see section below).

In particular, the Chechens are descended from the ''Durdzuks'', a group well known in the Georgian chronicles (''Dourts'' in the Armenian version). Other groups linked Amjad Jaimoukha traces the name Durdzuk to an ancient city north of [[Lake Urmia]], near Nakhichevan (Nakhichevan is thought to be a Nakh placename by some). Other groups attributed to being the ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush include the ''Kists'' (in the Georgian chronicles), ''[[Gargareans]]'' (from the Nakh root ''gergara''; reported by [[Strabo]] to have "returned" from the South Caucasus to the North Caucasus, fleeing the wars in the south) and the ''Nakhchmateans'' (Armenian chronicles).

{{see|Genetic history of the Caucasus}}
The Chechens belong to the [[Western Eurasians|Western Eurasian or "Caucasoid" race]], specifically the Caucasus type. 
Chechens are black-, brown-, red- or fair-haired (with darker hair predominating) and eyes can be brown, blue or green, while skin is usually light. George Anchabadze notes that the physical traits of Chechens, which includes being taller than average, are typical of the "Caucasian type" which many other [[peoples of the Caucasus]] exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anchabadze|first=George|title=The Vainakhs|publisher="Caucasian House"|location=Tbilisi|date=2001|page=8|url=http://www.circassianworld.com/pdf/The_Vainakhs_George_Anchabadze.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225132940/https://www.circassianworld.com/pdf/The_Vainakhs_George_Anchabadze.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Чеченцы // Энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона: В 86 томах (82 т. и 4 доп.). – СПб., 1890–1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic tests on Chechens, though sparse and not sufficiently thorough so far, have shown roots mostly in the Caucasus as well as slight connections to and influences from the Middle East as well as Europe. As is the case with many other Caucasian peoples, Chechens are broadly connected with Europe on the [[Y-DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA (the paternal side)]] from all European regions, but narrowly closer to Western Europe in terms of [[mitochondrial DNA]] (the maternal side).&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"&gt;I.

The most recent study on Chechens, by Balanovsky ''et al.'' in 2011&lt;ref name="Balanovsky2011"&gt;Oleg Balanovsky ''et al.'', "Parallel Evolution of Genes and Languages in the Caucasus Region," ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'' 2011&lt;/ref&gt; sampled a total of 330 Chechens from three sample locations (one in [[Malgobek]], one in [[Achkhoy-Martan]], and one from two sites in Dagestan) and found the following frequencies: A weak majority of Chechens belong to [[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J2]] (56.7%&lt;ref name="Balanovsky2011"/&gt;), which is associated with [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]], [[South Caucasian peoples|South Caucasian]] and [[Fertile Crescent]] populations, with its peaks at 87.4% in Ingushetia and 72% in Georgia's [[Kazbegi Municipality]]. In the North Caucasus, the largest frequencies are those of Nakh peoples (Chechens (56.7%) and Ingush (88.8%)).&lt;ref name="Balanovsky2011"/&gt; Other notable values were found among North Caucasian [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples ([[Kumyks]] (25%)&lt;ref&gt;Yunusbaev 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Balkars (24%)&lt;ref name = "Battaglia2008" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Battaglia|first1=Vincenza|last2=Fornarino|first2=Simona|last3=Al-Zahery |first3=Nadia |last4=Olivieri|first4=Anna|last5=Pala|first5=Maria|last6=Myres|first6=Natalie M|last7=King|first7=Roy J |last8=Rootsi |first8=Siiri |last9=Marjanovic |first9=Damir |title=Y-chromosomal evidence of the cultural diffusion of agriculture in southeast Europe|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=17 |pages=820–830 |date=24 December 2008 | doi= 10.1038/ejhg.2008.249|pmc=2947100|pmid=19107149|issue=6|url=http://www.draganprimorac.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Battaglia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It is notable that J2 suddenly collapses as one enters the territory of non-Nakh Northeast Caucasian peoples, dropping to very low values among Dagestani peoples.&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balanovsky2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yunusbaev 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caciagli 2009"&gt;Caciagli et al, 2009. ''The key role of patrilineal inheritance in the genetic variation of Dagestani highlanders''.&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming bulk of Chechen J2 is of the subclade J2a4b* (J2-M67), of which the highest frequencies by far are found among Nakh peoples: Chechens were 55.2% according to the Balanovsky study, while Ingush were 87.4%. Other notable haplogroups that appeared consistently appeared at high frequencies included [[Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA)|J1]] (20.9%), [[Haplogroup L (Y-DNA)|L]] (7.0%), [[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|G2]] (5.5%), [[Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA)|R1a]] (3.9%), [[Haplogroup Q-M242 (Y-DNA)|Q-M242]] (3%) and [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b-M269]] (1.8%, but much higher in Chechnya itself as opposed to Dagestani or Ingushetian Chechens). Overall, tests have shown consistently that Chechens are most closely related to Ingush, [[Circassians]] and [[Georgians]], occasionally showing a kinship to other peoples in some tests. Balanovsky's study showed the Ingush to be the Chechens' closest relatives by far.&lt;ref name="Balanovsky2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caciagli 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasidze 2004"&gt;Nasidze et al. "Mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome Variation in the Caucasus", ''Annals of Human Genetics'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study of the [[mtDNA]] showed Chechens to be extremely diverse in the mitochondrial genome, with 18 different haplogroups out of only 23 samples.&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"/&gt; Chechens clustered closest to [[Azeris]], Georgians and [[Kabardins]]. They clustered closer to European populations than Middle Eastern populations this time, but were closer to [[Western Europe]]an populations (Basques and Britons) than to [[Eastern Europe]]an populations (Russians and other [[Slavs]], as well as [[Estonians]]), despite living in the East. They actually clustered about as close to [[Basques]] as they did to Ingush (Chechens also cluster closer to many other populations than Ingush, such as [[Abazins]]), but the Chechens were the closer to the Ingush than any other population, the imbalance probably largely being due to the uniqueness of the Ingush on the mitochondrial DNA among those tested.&lt;ref name="Nasidze2004"/&gt;

Prior to the adoption of Islam, the Chechens practiced a unique blend of religious traditions and beliefs. They partook in numerous rites and rituals, many of them pertaining to farming; these included rain rites, a celebration that occurred on the first day of plowing, as well as the Day of the Thunderer Sela and the Day of the Goddess Tusholi. In addition to sparse written record from the Middle Ages, Chechens traditionally remember history through the ''illesh'', a collection of epic poems and stories.

[[File:Ermakov. № 6042. Chechen women.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Chechen women]]

Chechen society is structured around ''tukhum'' (unions of [[clan]]s) and about 130 ''[[teip]]'', or clans. The teips are based more on land and one-side lineage than on blood (as [[exogamy]] is prevalent and encouraged), and are bonded together to form the Chechen nation. Teips are further subdivided into ''gar'' (branches), and gars into ''nekye'' ([[patronymic]] families). The Chechen social code is called ''nokhchallah'' (where ''Nokhchuo'' stands for "Chechen") and may be loosely translated as "Chechen character". The Chechen [[code of honor]] implies moral and ethical behaviour, generosity and the will to safeguard the honor of women. The traditional Chechen saying goes that the members of Chechen society, like its teips, are (ideally) "free and equal like wolves".&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha. ''Chechens''. Page 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gammer, Moshe. ''The Lone Wolf and the Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance of Russian Rule''. London 2006. Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechens today have a strong sense of nation, which is enforced by the old clan network and ''nokhchalla'' – the obligation to clan, tukhum, etc. This is often combined with old values transmuted into a modern sense. They are mythically descended from the epic hero, Turpalo-Nokhchuo ("Chechen Hero"). There is a strong theme of representing the nation with its [[national animal]], the wolf. Due to their strong dependence on the land, its farms and its forests (and indeed, the national equation with the wolf), Chechens have a strong sense of affection for nature. According to Chechen philosopher Apty Bisultanov, ruining an ant-hill or hunting Caucasian goats during their mating season was considered extremely sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chechen.8m.com/history/bisult_brnfree.html |title=Chechen Republic – History – Born to be free |website=Chechen.8m.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518002148/http://chechen.8m.com/history/bisult_brnfree.html |archivedate=2013-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the [[glasnost]] era Chechen independence movement, ''Bart'' (unity) in fact originated as a simple environmentalist organization in the republic's capital of Grozny.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Tony. ''Chechnya: The Case for Independence''. Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechen culture puts a strong value on the concept of freedom. This asserts itself in a number of ways. A large majority of the nation's [[Folk hero|national heroes]] fought for independence (or otherwise, like the legendary Zelimkhan, robbed from the nation deemed the oppressor in order to feed Chechen children in a [[Robin Hood]]-like fashion). A common greeting in the Chechen language, ''marsha oylla'', is literally translated as "enter in freedom". The word for freedom also encompasses notions of peace and prosperity.

Chechens are sometimes referred to as the "French of the Caucasus", for a number of reasons (it is notable that the Circassians are the "English of the Caucasus", and the Georgians are the "Italians of the Caucasus"). This comparison may refer to either political/historical traits, or to personality characteristics. Like the French, who overthrew their age-old monarchy in the [[French Revolution]], the Chechens had [[History of Chechnya#Ichkeria|a similar revolution a century or two earlier]],&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha, Amjad. ‘’The Chechens: A Handbook’’. Page 14&lt;/ref&gt; and like the French, they bore the distinction (for a period) of being the only egalitarian society in an area full of monarchic states. Like the French, the Chechens preferred swift, revolutionary (and often violent) methods to realize the change they wished to see – unlike the Circassians (called the "English of the Caucasus" both for their political and personality characteristics) who preferred more gradualist methods.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Paul. ''[http://www.circassianworld.com/pdf/Paul_Manning.pdf Just Like England: On the Liberal Institutions of the Circassians]'' Circassianworld.com&lt;/ref&gt; Chechens were also called "French" by early Russian military officers and the French anthropologist [[Ernest Chantre]] who noted their "happy and witty" nature.&lt;ref&gt;Carlotta Gall and Thomas de Wall. ''Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus''. Page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechnya is predominantly [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="gwu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/ponars/pm_0388.pdf|title=The George Washington University - Washington, D.C.|website=Gwu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most Chechens belong to the [[Shafi'i]] school of thought of [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref name="martinfrost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/sept2008/chechnya-info.html#Demographics|title=Chechnya:Demographics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726180701/http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/sept2008/chechnya-info.html#Demographics|archivedate=2014-07-26|deadurl=yes|df=}} by [[Martin Frost]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some adhere to the mystical [[Sufi]] tradition of [[murid]]ism, while about half of Chechens belong to Sufi brotherhoods, or ''[[tariqah]]''. The two Sufi tariqas that spread in the North Caucasus were the [[Naqshbandiya]] and the [[Qadiriya]] (the Naqshbandiya is particularly strong in Dagestan and eastern Chechnya, whereas the Qadiriya has most of its adherents in the rest of Chechnya and Ingushetia). There are also small Christian and atheist minorities, although their numbers are unknown in Chechnya; in Kazakhstan, they are roughly 3% and 2% of the Chechen population respectively.&lt;ref name="EthnicData"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.kz/p_perepis/Documents/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%20%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2.rar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104653/http://www.stat.kz/p_perepis/Documents/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%20%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2.rar |archivedate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stereotype of an average Chechen being a fundamentalist Muslim is incorrect and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=13&amp;&amp;issue_id=590 |title=Shattering the Al Qaeda-Chechen Myth: Part 1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040129132549/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=13&amp;&amp;issue_id=590 |archivedate=2004-01-29}}, by [[Brian Glyn Williams]], The Jamestown Foundation, October 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Tony. ''Chechnya: the Case for Independence''. pp. 127–145.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 2000s, however, two new trends have emerged in Chechnya. A radicalized remnant of the armed Chechen separatist movement has become dominated by [[Salafi movement|Salafis]] (popularly known in Russia as [[Wahhabi movement|Wahhabis]] and present in Chechnya in small numbers since the 1990s), mostly abandoning nationalism in favor of [[Pan-Islamism]] and merging with several other regional Islamic insurgencies to form the [[Caucasus Emirate]]. At the same time, Chechnya under Moscow-backed authoritarian rule of [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] has undergone its own controversial counter-campaign of [[Islamization]] of the republic, with the local government actively promoting and enforcing their own version of a so-called "traditional Islam", including introducing elements of [[Sharia]] that replaced Russian official laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=4565c2252&amp;toid=45d0822f2&amp;publisher=&amp;type=&amp;coi=RUS&amp;docid=4dcb91762&amp;skip=0 |title=Kadyrov Exploits Ties with Moscow to Build Islamic State |website=Refworld.org (UNHCR) |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/29/virtue-campaign-women-chechnya-under-ramzan-kadyrov |title=Virtue Campaign on Women in Chechnya under Ramzan Kadyrov &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |website=Hrw.org |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120028549 |title=Chechen Leader's Islamic Policies Stir Unease |website=Npr.org|date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Parfitt, Grozny, Russia |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/islamic-republic-chechnya |title=The Islamic Republic of Chechnya |publisher=Pulitzer Center |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Congolese Australians''' are [[Australians]] of [[Congo Basin|Congolese]] descent or who were born in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] or the [[Republic of the Congo]]. The population of Congolese born Australians has increased significantly over the past 20 years, from just 21 at the [[Census in Australia#1996|1996 Census]] to 5,522 at the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics 2014, Australian Historical Population Statistics 2014'*: Country of Birth' data cube: Excel spreadsheet, cat no. 3105.0.65.001, viewed 9 April 2018, http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012014?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Almost 75% of Congolese Australians have immmigrated from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], which has experienced significant conflict and instability since gaining independence in 1960. This has resulted in around 1.8 million Congolese being internally displaced, with around 300,000 fleeing to neighbouring countries. Most immigrants from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] have arrived in Australia after 2004 under the Australian Government's Humanitarian Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/settlement-and-multicultural-affairs/programs-policy/a-multicultural-australia/programs-and-publications/community-information-summaries/the-democratic-republic-of-congo-born-community|title=The Democratic Republic of Congo-born Community {{!}} Department of Social Services, Australian Government|website=www.dss.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 650 visas were issued to people from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] under the Australian Government Humanitarian programme in 2015-16, being the fifth highest country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/60refugee|title=Fact sheet - Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian programme {{!}} Department of Home Affairs, Australian Government|website=www.homeaffairs.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2010-2016 Congolese refugees were in the top 10 nationalities accepted into Australia every year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/article/2016/08/22/here-are-exact-countries-australia-taking-refugees DRC Refugees to Australia] SBS. 03/10/16&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cooperation and Development Network Eastern Europe''' (Acronym: '''CDN''') is a capacity-building [[Social network|network]] of political [[Green politics|green]] [[youth organisation]]s from [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[South Eastern Europe]]. CDN’s political focus is on Eastern Europe where the organisation works with local partners. CDN also collaborates with organisations and activists from the rest of Europe who want to support a Green Eastern Europe.

CDN work is committed to upholding and fostering the values of the [[Green movement]]: [[gender equality]], youth active participation in democracy, [[environmental protection]]. More elaboration on Green values is written at [https://www.cdnee.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Political_Platform_2017.pdf/ CDN's platform]. 

==History==

CDN was founded in December 2002 with the goal of developing and supporting green youth organisations in Eastern and South Eastern Europe through cooperation and [[transfer of knowledge]]. With an active collaboration and support of FYEG and Green Forum Sweden, CDN is now a network of Young Greens in Eastern Europe which supports the Young Green organisations in the region. CDN is focused on but not limited to study sessions, seminars, summer camps and other regular co-learning activities among constant communication and collaboration between its member and partner organisations. Also differences in methodology of educational work and cultural differences made it clear, that the green ideology in practice has to be differently implemented in Eastern Europe then in the West.

The first activity done by CDN was the Summer Camp 2003 "Peace and Reconciliation on the Balkan" in Jahorina, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with 80 young participants from all over Europe.

==Structure and Organisation==
{{Green politics sidebar}}
CDN was built through the structure of the [[Federation of Young European Greens]] (FYEG). Both organisations are forming a close connection, mainly because of common educational and political work. Also a lot of CDN member organisations are member of FYEG.

CDN is a network build of Member and Partner organisations. Partner organisations are those organisations with seat in a country of the [[European Union]]. This distinction aims on focusing the work on organisations from non-EU countries and on showing a signal towards these organisations. It was decided on the Network Meeting 2005 in Bitola, Macedonia. In difference to Member organisations Partner organisations do not have voting right on the network meeting and only one of the member of the CDN Executive Committee can come from a Partner organisation.

The highest decision making body of CDN is the Network Meeting. All Partner and Member organisations can send up to two delegates. Each Member organisation has one vote. The CDN Network Meeting decides upon the budget of the last and the coming year, the political and work report of the last year, the activity plan for the coming year and it elects and dismiss the CDN Executive Committee.

The CDN Executive Committee is realizing the political and organisational work of CDN between two CDN Network Meetings based on the decisions of the CDN Network Meeting. The CDN Executive Committee consists of 5 members. At least two of them have to be female and only one of them can come from a Partner organisation. The CDN Executive Committee meets at least five times a year.

Since mid-2006 CDN has a [[Gender]] Working Group. With the support of the CDN Network this Gender Groups on the issue of (un-)equal treatment of women and men in the societies of Eastern Europe. Mainly the question of compatibility of family and career which is a current problem of many young women in Eastern Europe is tackled by this Working Group.

==Founders==

The initiative for establishing CDN as a green network in Eastern Europe came from Macedonian Young Greens (DEM - Youth) and Serbian Young Greens supported by the Federation of Young European Greens in December 2002.

Since its foundation CDN is sustainable supported by the Green Forum [[Sweden]].
Another main source of support is the [[Council of Europe]] Youth foundation. The most of the current CDN activities are realized through the Council of Europe "All different - All equal" campaign.
Also from the very beginning CDN takes part in the Youth program of the [[European Commission]], mainly through Exchanges. According to the changes in the Youth program (from 2007 "Youth in Action") future youth work in Eastern Europe will be closer to its necessaries.

Further more activities are realized through the support of the Bundesverwaltungsamt, Referat Internationaler Jugendaustausch im Bereich des Bundesministeriums für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend sowie des Auswärtigen Amtes (German Federal office for international youth exchange within the range of the Federal Ministry for family, seniors, women and youth as well as the Foreign Office) as well as Member of the [[European Parliament]] and the Federation of Young European Greens.

==Educational and Political Work==

The main instrument of the educational work of CDN is the exchange of young people from all over Europe. These exchanges are either seminars (like the Summer Camp) under the support of the Council of Europe Youth Foundation, Youth Exchanges under Youth in action program of the European Commission, Study Sessions in the [[European Youth Centres|Budapest Study Center]] of the Council of Europe and Pilot Projects.

Further more the CDN homepage, e-lists and audiovisual materials are used for the exchange of knowledge and competence within the CDN Partner and Member organisations.

The activities which are planned for this year:

Study Session on Time Management and Youth participation in Budapest, Hungary
Seminar on Ethnical minorities, Youth and conflict prevention in Belgrade, Serbia
Summer Camp on Green Values for Southern Caucasus, Tbilisi, Beorgia
Youth Exchange in Armenia

==Study Session==
[[File:Photo from the study session "The Glass Ceiling Is Not Your Limit" in Budapest.jpg|thumb|Photo from the study session "The Glass Ceiling Is Not Your Limit" in Budapest.]]
CDN organized in partnership with FYEG a study session called "The Glass ceiling is not your limit" at the European Youth Center in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. The study session was focused on the participation of people who identify as women, [[Transgender|trans]] and/or [[genderqueer]] in political, business and social structures. This education activity explored and analyzed the patriarchal patterns that prevent equal opportunities based on gender discrimination and to support participants to organize themselves and change their environment in order to remove barriers and enable their participation in political, business and social structures.

[[Costa Rica]] is a [[Central America|Central American]] nation that boasts of a noteworthy record on crime as compared to its neighbors in the region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is one of few nations that have abolished their nation's armed forces. Having had a stable past, this country has been successful in developing its economy. However, since 2000 there has been a significant rise in criminal activity. Increase in domestic illegal activity, such as theft, homicide, and organised crime, has overwhelmed the local population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sebastian Huhn reports that, "In a public opinion poll in 2011, 45 percent of Costa Rican respondents said that crime and insecurity were the country’s biggest social problems."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a consequence of the overall societal changes, domestic-driven crime has been increasing in the environment that extends beyond traditional settings. Illegal activity, including distribution of weapons has been most commonly witnessed during the sporting events by 'barras' or fan clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ladb.unm.edu/noticen/2017/11/02-080448|title="Costa Rica's Soccer Hooligans are Using Games for Crime Sprees."|last=Rodriguez|first=George|date=|website=link.galegroup.com|publisher=NotiCen: Central American &amp; Caribbean Affairs, 2 Nov. 2017, p. 2.

As Vice President [[Laura Chinchilla]] described in March 2008:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdTJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=In+a+public+opinion+poll+in+2011,+45+percent+of+Costa+Rican+respondents+said+that+crime+and+insecurity+were+the+country%E2%80%99s+biggest+social+problem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DjlerMXnaa&amp;sig=PhyU9IeMUUvA-RKmSaa-ZWhtI58&amp;hl=en|title=Politics and History of Violence and Crime in Central America|last=Huhn|first=Sebastian|last2=Warnecke-Berger|first2=Hannes|date=2016-12-24|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349950676|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;''
"Costa Rica was known in the world as a nation of peace and tolerance. Over the course of our history, we (have) learned to solve our differences and conflicts through dialogue and with respect for others. These distinctive traits have been challenged in recent years by the increase of crime and violence."
''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Types of crime ==

=== Crimes targeting tourists ===
"Nearly 3 million people visited Costa Rica in 2017, and overall they spent $3.87 billion during their stay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2018/08/11/costa-rica-will-ramp-up-police-presence-after-tourist-murders|title=Costa Rica will ramp up police presence after tourist murders|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime in Costa Rica that impacts tourists is usually in form of petty theft and occasional armed robberies.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cr.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/safety-and-security/the-threat-from-crime/|title=The threat from crime {{!}} U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica|work=U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially at night tourists need to observe a high degree of precaution.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Additionally, murder and sexual assault have also been types of crime that have been committed against tourists. Cases of Arancha Gutiérrez and María Trinidad Mathus, both occurring in August 2018, are the most recent examples of tourists suffering from the rise in criminal activity.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These cases of murder and assault, respectively, indicate that crimes are escalating and are becoming quite severe. These cases additionally highlight the lack of punishment that offenders receive.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qcostarica.com/at-least-16-tourists-died-tragically-while-vacationing-in-costa-rica-in-recent-months/|title=At least 16 tourists died tragically while vacationing in Costa Rica in recent months|date=2018-08-12|work=Q Costa Rica|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the two individuals linked to the Mathus case were arrested; however, one was released due to lack of evidence, and the other was sentenced to three months of pretrial detention.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Similarly, in case of Arancha Gutiérrez, the man suspected and linked to the assault was released without any charges, and was transferred to the custody of the immigration police for being in the country illegally.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In August 2018, Tourism Minister Maria Amalia Revelo commented on the adverse impact that these deaths and assaults could have on tourism and the need for more police presence&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-murders-costa-rica-tourism-20180823-story.html|title=Murders in paradise threaten Costa Rica's main source of income|last=McDonald|first=Michael|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The minister also highlighted the restrictions on her office's ability to respond to crimes due to the Costa Rican government's fiscal policy issues&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;. Security Minister Micheal Soto also remarked that the nations image has already been damaged, which is reflected in the decrease in tourism&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;. 

=== Homicide  ===
"''The nation of about five million people, still regarded as being one of the safest as compared to others in Central America, saw 603 homicides last year, according to preliminary data from the police service responsible for investigating them.".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/costa-rica-record-murder-rate/4190033.html|title=Costa Rica Murder Rate Hits Record in 2017|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|work=VOA|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, 2015 was the year in which homicide rates were the highest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.co.cr/costa-rica-registers-decrease-in-homicides-robberies-and-thefts-from-may-to-august/75759/|title=Costa Rica Registers Decrease in Homicides, Robberies and Thefts Over the Last Four Months - Costa Rica Star News|date=2018-09-05|work=Costa Rica Star News|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Costa Rican Star reports that there has been a decline in the rate of homicide in areas throughout Costa Rica. Most notably, this decline is in the areas of San Jose and Guanacaste, wherein numbers have reduced by 19% and 62% respectively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As of early 2018, 48% of the homicides accounted for in Costa Rica were linked to drug-related gang violence, with 25% being related to drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/costa-rica-drug-traffickers-violence-record-levels-2018-1?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Drug traffickers are pushing deadly violence to record levels in a tranquil corner of Latin America|last=Woody|first=Christopher|date=2018-01-20|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Organised crime &amp; drug-related crime===
Costa Rica’s main problem with drug trafficking relates to its geography and its prime maritime network that facilitates drug trafficking on an international scale. Costa Rica’s maritime jurisdiction is more than 11 times the size of its land mass,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/toc/en/reports/TOCTACentralAmerica-Caribbean.html|title=UNODC {{!}} Transnational Organized Crime in Central America and the Caribbean: A Threat Assessment|last=carlos.gomezdelcampo|website=www.unodc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; rendering it even more difficult to police and monitor trading activity. It has been reported that  “Between 2000 and 2015, the country’s murder rate nearly doubled from 6.3 to 11.5 per 100,000 citizens. Up to 70 percent of the violence has been associated with territorial battles between local drug gangs.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/gamechangers-2016-gang-evolution-in-central-america-southern-gateway/|title=GameChangers 2016: Gang Evolution in Central America's Southern Gateway|date=2017-01-09|work=InSight Crime|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Micheal Porth reported that Costa Rica has had a history of drug trafficking and money laundering since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insightcrime.org/investigations/costa-rica-in-the-cross-hairs-part-i/|title=Costa Rica in the Crosshairs (Part I)|date=2011-12-20|work=InSight Crime|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has progressively worsened over the years and has become more reactionary to other international factors such as the United States' increase in border control and anti-drug operations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These operations have caused the drug trafficking organisations to use Costa Rica as their ‘pit-stop’ and preferred laundering area. The geography of the island makes it a prime location for hiding and transporting drugs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, the area of [[Limón Province|Limon]] that lies along the coast not only holds one of the main seaports but is also the main locale for drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, the areas of the Gulf of [[Puntarenas Province|Punta Arenas]] and [[Quepos|Puerto Quepos]], which lie on the Pacific coast, are used as refueling stops for shipments coming from neighboring areas of Colombia and Panama.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This issue has aggravated to the point that the Costa Rican Minister of Public Security, José María Tijerino Pacheco, has stated that without aid and intervention from nations such as the United States, “...the region is going to degenerate into another Mexico.”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/us-report-shows-revitalized-central-america-cocaine-corridor/|title=US Report Shows Revitalized Central America Cocaine Corridor|date=2017-03-09|work=InSight Crime|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report also highlighted the issue of money laundering occurring through banks.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In March and April 2011, it was reported that nine Guatemalans who were linked to Mexican drug trafficking organisations were detained at the [[Paso Canoas]] and Peñas Blancas border crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/26/AR2010072605661.html|title=Mexican drug cartels bring violence with them in move to Central America|last=Booth|first=Nick Miroff and William|date=2010-07-27|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common issue that has underpinned drug trafficking is the change of influence of the neighboring nations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/drug-bust-points-to-evolving-criminal-structures-in-costa-rica/|title=Drug Bust Points to Evolving Criminal Structures in Costa Rica|date=2016-11-10|work=InSight Crime|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influence has shifted from more group-orientated drug trafficking from Colombia to relatively prevalent independent and smaller groups as per the influence of the Mexican drug trafficker.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lack of resources and defence has been recognized by the government as the key factor in the inability to prevent and weaken the amount of drug trafficking that is occurring in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Chamber of Commerce officials in Punta Arenas outlined that the drug cartels have come to portray themselves as fishing businesses and use strategies of coercion, either with or without weaponry or by paying other fisherman, to get the illicit substances on land.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/world/americas/24drugs.html|title=Drug Wars Push Deeper into Central America|last=Cave|first=Randal C. Archibold and Damien|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most legitimate businesses, from farms to transport services, have been bought by Mexican cartels in the attempt to hide and transport cocaine.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Further, production of cannabis is also an issue in Costa Rica, particularly in an area called Talamanca. This remote area has also been highlighted as being involved with the trafficking of cocaine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

== Crime prevention ==

=== Government intervention ===

==== Historically ====
Discourse around crime rates in Costa Rica progressed throughout the late 1990s in an emotive manner and became more evident through the change in leadership, most notably through presidents [[José Figueres Ferrer|Figueres,]] and Rodríguez. For example, in a speech by  [[Miguel Ángel Rodríguez]], he highlights the state of the prisons and the need for development of social policy and security.            &lt;blockquote&gt;"The action against crime has made it necessary to expand the capacity of the prisons.... To restore tranquility and seguridad ciudadana it will be essential to reform legislation, to help the police fight criminals and to avoid impunity... The people demand harsher laws against crime, ladies and gentlemen. I therefore ask you with humility and vehemence to answer those demands by passing these laws without delay"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Academics highlight that the perception of crime and its prevalence was to an extent manufactured by the government as a means to support the strict legislation that they put in place. Additionally, it is also suggested that the accuracy of statistics about the criminal activity occurring could be worse due to police violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gingerich|first=Daniel W.|last2=Oliveros|first2=Virginia|date=2017-10-27|title=Police Violence and the Underreporting of Crime|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/ecpo.12102|journal=Economics &amp; Politics|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=78–105|doi=10.1111/ecpo.12102|issn=0954-1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Currently ====

====== Legislation that aims to prevent drug related activities ======
   ''General Health Law (Law 5395)''

* Aims to prevent and prohibit the cultivation, production and trafficking of drugs.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.druglawreform.info/en/country-information/central-america/costa-rica/item/5017-costa-rica#1a|title=Costa Rica - Costa Rica|last=Amira|website=www.druglawreform.info|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 ''Narcotics And Psychotropic Substances law (Law 8204) now reformed in 2009 to the  '' “Law on Narcotics, Psychotropic Substances, Unauthorised Drugs, Related Activities, Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

* Outlines the crimes in a detailed manner and includes provisions through which penalties are determined and meted out.
* UNDOC most notably highlights that a key progressive element of the Law 8204 is the reform of Article 77 which accounts for a gender perspective. In this it does not set a minimum punishment, but rather relies on judicial discretion to set a sentence for women. This reform recognized the prevalence and likelihood of women in poverty having to participate in drug trafficking out of necessity or as an escape from threatening circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nu.org.bo/noticias/naciones-unidas-en-linea/unodc-comparte-buenas-practicas-y-lecciones-aprendidas-sobre-normativas-de-drogas/|title=UNODC comparte buenas prácticas y lecciones aprendidas sobre normativas de drogas {{!}} Naciones Unidas en Bolivia|website=www.nu.org.bo|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A recent study conducted by Oya Dursun-Özkanca&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dursun-Özkanca|first=Oya|date=2017-02-22|title=Pitfalls of police reform in Costa Rica: insights into security sector reform in non-military countries|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F21647259.2017.1293350|journal=Peacebuilding|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=320–338|doi=10.1080/21647259.2017.1293350|issn=2164-7259}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined five key problems with the reforms made to the Securtiy Sector. These include the size of the police force, lack of resources, adequate training, especially for security matters that extended beyond their normal jurisdictions and fragmentation among organisations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

In an interview with the New York Times, it was reported by the coast guards in Puntarenas that they lacked adequate boating equipment to stop and search most of the skiffs that cross the waters.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. This problem exists across all key ports in Costa Rica, as out of the 26 boats involved in the maritime security, only 14 function (as of 2011)&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

=== Cost of crime ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Violent crime costs Central America an estimated $6.5 billion a year, equivalent to 7.7 percent of gross domestic product in the region, according to the study carried out in El Salvador...In total, the costs of violence amounted to $2.29 billion in Guatemala, $2.01 billion in El Salvador, $791 million in Costa Rica and $529 million in Nicaragua.''"''&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutirrez|first=Ral|date=Sep 26, 2008|title=CENTRAL AMERICA: BILLIONS LOST TO VIOLENT CRIME, STUDY FINDS|url=|journal=Political Science|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It has been outlined that due to multiple decades of social programs and the allocation of funding towards more progressive social change, Costa Rica, in comparison to other nations in Central America, incurs lower cost when it comes to negating the consequences of crime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

=== Partnerships and bilateral agreements ===

====UNODC-WCO container control program &amp; regional training  ====
In 2013, in collaboration with [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] and the [[World Customs Organization]], Costa Rican Government "joined the Container Control Program after signing a memorandum of understanding with UNODC".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2009/August/costa-rica-signs-up-to-improve-security-in-ports.html|title=Costa Rica signs up to improve security in ports|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of this project was to target illegal drug trafficking, smuggling and any main illegal activity taking place at the Port of Caldera (Puerto Caldera).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2013, the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNDOC) and the [[World Customs Organization|World Customs Organisation]] (WCO) provided training to Costa Rican customs officials with the intention of enhancing the ability of border patrol to recognize illicit substances immediately.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/ropan/en/IndexArticles/CCP/taller-costa-rica.html|title=Costa Rica hosts UNODC-WCO Container Control Programme Regional Training|last=UNDOC|first=|date=|website=www.unodc.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aided in creating an infrastructure for governments to detect illicit materials and increase responsiveness of certain maritime ports, which was the core aim of the Container Control Program.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Program was originally signed in 2010 and was supposed to be upheld only for three years. Due to the positive results that became evident from the program, an extension of this period was requested.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; “.... Since its beginning in 2010 through July 2013, this Unit has achieved seizures of 1.6 tons of drugs, 9 containers with counterfeit goods of major brands and 2 containers of tax fraud.”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
==== Cooperation program between Latin American, The Caribbean and the European Union on Drug Policy (COPLAD) ====
Purpose of this partnership is to improve the impact and the consistency of drug policy among nations.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copolad.eu/en/noticia/america-latina-y-caribe-avanzan-en-la-validacion-de-estandares-de-calidad-y-evidencia-en-reduccion-de-la-demanda-de-drogas|title=Latin America and the Caribbean advance in the validation of quality and evidence standards in Drug Demand Reduction            {{!}} COPOLAD|website=copolad.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the '''Costa Rican Drug Institute (''Instituto Costarricense sobre Drogas'', ICD)''' hosted the first meeting of the working group of Latin American countries which was aimed at establishing a criteria on prevention. The meeting was successful in the sense that the attendees incorporated individual drug policies and strategies across multiple nations and were able to become more uniform in their public policy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In 2018, it was announced that the COPLAD organisation has and will be working with other organisations such as [[World Health Organization|WHO]],[[Pan American Health Organization|PAHO]], [[European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction|EMCDDA]] and the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]], to support new plans to provide improved health services for those who use drugs.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copolad.eu/en/noticia/onudd-oms-ops-cicad-oea-oedt-y-copolad-celebran-reunion-clave-para-impulsar-mayores-sinergias-en-reduccion-de-la-demanda-de-drog|title=WHO, PAHO, CICAD/OAS, COPOLAD, EMCDDA, UNODC and NIL joining efforts to improve health services for problematic drug users in the CELAC countries |website=copolad.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan will be implemented in all [[CELAC]] states, including Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

'''Ekkirala Bharadwaja''' (30 October 1938 – 12 April 1989) authored many [[Hindu]] spiritual books, primarily on the life and worship of [[Shirdi Sai Baba]] and [[Dattatreya]]. His [[Telugu language|Telugu-language]] book ''Sri Sai Leelamrutham'' is widely sold.

==Life==
Ekkirala Bharadwaja was born at [[Bapatla]] and was a post-graduate in English literature. He left the [[Indian Administrative Service]] after having a profound spiritual experience at the Samadhi Mandir of [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]], thereafter becoming a lecturer of English literature because that gave him opportunity to spread his master's teachings.&lt;ref name="saibharadwaja.org"&gt;http://www.saibharadwaja.org/pages/acharyaeb.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Bharadwaja researched the lives and teachings of several saints, travelling extensively and personally contacting many of them. He insisted on the necessity of a [[Sadguru]] to direct devotees  in their spiritual path. The culmination of all this is a series of books on Sai Baba and many other saints. He believed Sai Baba to be the matchless saint, a blend of all religions and the answer to all the questions of the present day and spirituality.&lt;ref name="saibharadwaja.org"/&gt;

Bharadwaja died on 12 April 1989.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Institutions==
Bharadwaja founded the Shirdi Sai Cultural Mission at [[Vidyanagar]] and the Sai Baba Mission in [[Ongole]]. He also founded a Telugu-language fortnightly publication, ''Sai Baba'', that is now produced monthly and continues to spread his messages. The publication inspired the construction of several Sai Baba temples.&lt;ref name="saibharadwaja.org"/&gt; His thoughts are now promoted by the Sri Master Universal Sai Trust &amp; Acharya Bharadwaja Peace Foundation in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saisadguruvani.org/files/shriekkiralabharadwaja.html |title=SAI SADGURU VANI |work=saisadguruvani.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116064811/http://saisadguruvani.org/files/shriekkiralabharadwaja.html |archivedate=16 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bosnia Herzegovina Ethnic 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|Ethnic map of Bosnia and Herzegovina according to 2013 census]]

More than 96% of population of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] belongs to one of its three autochthonous '''constituent nations''': '''[[Bosniaks]]''', '''[[Bosnian Serbs|Serbs]]''' and '''[[Bosnian Croats|Croats]]'''. The term ''constituent'' refers to the fact that these three ethnic groups are explicitly mentioned in the constitution, and that none of them can be considered a [[minority group|minority]] or [[immigrant]]. The most easily recognizable feature that distinguishes the three ethnic groups is their religion, with Bosniaks predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]], Serbs predominantly [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and Croats [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].

While each ethnic group have their own standard language variant and a name for it, they speak, depending on view, one [[pluricentric language]] or three [[Serbo-Croatian language|mutually intelligible languages]]. On a dialectal level, Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks speak a variety of [[Shtokavian dialect]]s which have fixed phonetic, morphological and lexical minor differences. The question of standard language is resolved in such a way that three constituent ethnic groups have their educational and cultural institutions in their respective native or mother tongue languages: [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]].

A [[Y chromosome]] [[haplogroup]]s study published in 2005 found that "three main groups of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in spite of some quantitative differences, share a large fraction of the same ancient gene pool distinctive for the Balkan area". The study did however find that Serbs and Bosniaks are genetically closer to each other than either of them is to Croats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2005 | last1=Marjanović | first1=D | last2=Fornarino | first2=S | last3=Montagna | first3=S | last4=Primorac | first4=D | last5=Hadžiselimović | first5=R | last6=Vidović | first6=S | last7=Pojskić | first7=N | last8=Battaglia | first8=V | last9=Achilli | first9=A | last10=Drobnić | first10=K. | last11=Andjelinović | first11=S. | last12=Torroni | first12=A. | last13=Santachiara-Benerecetti | first13=A.

==Decision of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina==
{{onesource|section|date=March 2018}}
On 12 February 1998, [[Alija Izetbegović]], at the time Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted proceedings before the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitutional Court]] for an evaluation of the consistency of the Constitution of the Republika Srpska and the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The request was supplemented on 30 March 1998 when the applicant specified which provisions of the Entities' Constitutions he considered to be unconstitutional.

The four partial decisions were made in 2000, by which many of articles of the constitutions of entities were found to be unconstitutional, which had a great impact on the politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, because there was a need to adjust the current state in the country with the decision of the Court. A narrow majority (5-4) ruled in favour of the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:{{quotation|Elements of a [[democracy|democratic]] state and society as well as underlying assumptions – [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], just procedures, peaceful relations that arise out of the Constitution – must serve as a guideline for further elaboration of the issue of the structure of BiH as a multi-national state. Territorial division (of Entities) must not serve as an instrument of ethnic segregation – on the contrary – it must accommodate ethnic groups by preserving linguistic pluralism and peace in order to contribute to the integration of the state and society as such. Constitutional principle of collective equality of constituent peoples, arising out of designation of Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs as constituent peoples, prohibits any special privileges for one or two constituent peoples, any domination in governmental structures and any ethnic homogenisation by segregation based on territorial separation. Despite the territorial division of BiH by establishment of two Entities, this territorial division cannot serve as a constitutional legitimacy for ethnic domination, national homogenisation or the right to maintain results of [[ethnic cleansing]]. Designation of Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs as constituent peoples in the Preamble of the Constitution of BiH must be understood as an all-inclusive principle of the Constitution of BiH to which the Entities must fully adhere, pursuant to Article III.3 (b) of the Constitution of BiH.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-5/98 (Partial Decision Part 3), p. 36, [[Sarajevo]], 1 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The formal name of this item is ''U-5/98'', but it is widely known as the "Decision on the constituency of peoples" ({{lang-bs|Odluka o konstitutivnosti naroda}}), referring to the Court's interpretation of the significance of the phrase "constituent peoples" used in the Preamble of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision was also the basis for other notable cases that came before the court.

==Historical background==
Some {{Who|date=March 2018}} argue that a Bosnian identity (in the non-religious sense) goes back centuries, the Serb and Croat for Christian Bosnians a century, and Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) even more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donia|Fine|1994|p=73}} {{quote|A Bosnian's identity as a Bosnian - even if it originally referred to his geographical homeland or state membership - has roots going back many centuries, whereas the classification of any Christian Bosnian as a Serb or a Croat goes back barely a century. The idea of being Bosnian Muslim in a "national" (as opposed to a religious) sense is even more recent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the Ottoman Empire, the term ''Boşnak'' was used to describe Bosnians (of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]]) in an ethnic or "tribal" sense. After the [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1878, the Austrian administration officially endorsed [[Bosnianhood]] as the basis of a multi-confessional Bosnian nation. The policy aspired to isolate Bosnia and Herzegovina from its irredentist neighbors (Orthodox Serbia, Catholic Croatia, and the Muslims of the Ottoman Empire) and to negate the concept of Croatian and Serbian nationhood which had already begun to take ground among Bosnia and Herzegovina's Catholic and Orthodox communities, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Donia|Fine|1994|pp=?}}, {{harvnb|Eller|1999|p=262}}, {{harvnb|Velikonja|2003|pp=130–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were the constituent ("old") nations.{{sfn|Jović|2009|p=320}} During the reign of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Aleksandar I]], a modern single [[Yugoslav identity]] was unsuccessfully propagated to erase the particularistic identities.{{sfn|Nielsen|2014}} With the formation of [[Socialist Yugoslavia]], there were six republics and five constitutive nations, adding Macedonians and Montenegrins (whose identities were not earlier recognized); the Bosnian Muslims were recognized only in the late 1960s.{{sfn|Jović|2009|pp=48, 57}}

For the 1961 census a new ethnic category was introduced–''Muslims''–with which 972,954 Bosnians identified.{{sfn|Eller|1999|p=282}} In 1964, the ''Muslims'' were declared a ''narod'' ("people"), as the other five "peoples", but were not ascribed a national republic.{{sfn|Eller|1999|p=282}} In 1968, the Bosnian Central Committee declared that "...Muslims are a distinct nation". For the 1971 census, accordingly, "Muslims, in the sense of a nation" was introduced.{{sfn|Eller|1999|p=282}}

==Inter-ethnic relations==
Serbs tend to be Orthodox Christian, Croats tend to be Roman Catholic, and Bosniaks (or Bosnian Muslims) tend to be [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]. Tensions between these were expressed in terms of religion. Fundamentalists existed on all sides; in propaganda the [[Bosnian War]] took on some features of a "[[religious war]]", supported by views of religious leaders. Historical stereotypes and prejudice were further established by experiences of war. The situation still impedes the development of relations post-war. Religious symbols are used for [[Religious nationalism|nationalist purposes]].{{sfn|Fischer|2006|p=21}}

Men and women use [[social network service]]s (SNSs) differently and with different frequencies.  In general, several researchers have found that women tend to use SNSs more than men and for different and more social purposes.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Historical connections==
Technologies, including communications technologies, have a long history of shaping and being shaped by the gender of their users. Although technologies used to perform housework have an apparent historical connection to gender in many cultures,&lt;ref name=MacKenzie_and_Wajcman&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald |last1=MacKenzie |first2=Judy |last2=Wajcman |title= The Social Shaping of Technology: How the Refrigerator Got its Hum |year=1985 |publisher=Open University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more ready connection to SNSs may be drawn with [[telephone]]s as a communications technology readily and widely available in the home. Telephone use has long had gendered connections ranging from the widespread assumption that women simply talk more than men, and the employment of women as [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]]. In particular, young women have been closely associated with extensive and trivial use of the telephone for purely social purposes.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Fischer |title=America Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940 |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kearney&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. C. Kearney |year=2005 |title=Birds on the Wire |journal=Cultural Studies |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=568–601 |doi=10.1080/09502380500365499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, women's use of and influence on the development of computers has been trivialized&lt;ref name=Light&gt;{{cite journal |author=Light, J. |year=1999 |title=When Computers were Women |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=455–83 |doi=10.1353/tech.1999.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt; while significant developments in computers have been masculinized.&lt;ref name=Jonsson&gt;{{cite book |first=F. |last=Jonsson |year=2007 |chapter=The Absence of Hackerettes in the Culture of Programming | editor1-first=M. S. |editor1-last=Elm |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Sundén |title=Cyberfeminism in Northern Lights: Digital Media and Gender in a Nordic Context |pages=243–264 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the idea that there may be both real and perceived differences in how men and women use SNSs – and that those uses may shape the SNSs – is neither new nor surprising and has historical analogues.

There is historical and contemporary evidence that current fears about young girls' online safety have historical antecedents such as [[telegraph]]s and telephones. Further, in many cases those historical reactions resulted in restrictions of girls' use of technology to protect them from predators, molesters, and other criminals threatening their innocence. Like current fears focused on computer use, particularly SNSs and other communication media, these fears are most intense when the medium enters the home. These fears have the potential to – at least temporarily – overwhelm the positive and empowering uses of these technologies.&lt;ref name=Cassel_and_Cramer&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Cassel |first1=J. |last2=Cramer |first2=M. |editor-first=T. |editor-last=McPherson |title=Digital Youth, Innovation, and the Unexpected |publisher=MIT Press |year=2008 |pages=53–75 |chapter=High tech or high risk: Moral panics about girls online}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These historical fears are echoed in contemporary media accounts of youths' use of SNSs.

Finally, the histories of some SNSs themselves have ties with gender. For example, [[gay men]] were one of the earliest groups to join and use the early SNS [[Friendster]].&lt;ref name=boyd_and_Ellison&gt;{{cite journal |first1=danah |last1=boyd |first2=Nicole |last2=Ellison |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gap in gender differences has become less apparent in LinkedIn. In 2015 about 26 percent of online men and 25% of online women used the business-and employee-oriented networking site.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who have examined the gender of users of multiple SNSs have found contradictory results. Hargittai's groundbreaking 2007 study examining race, gender, and other differences between undergraduate college student users of SNSs found that women were not only more likely to have used SNSes than men but that they were also more likely to have used many different services, including Facebook, MySpace, and Friendster; these differences persisted in several models and analyses. Although she only surveyed students at one institution – the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] – Hargittai selected that institution intentionally as "an ideal location for studies of how different kinds of people use online sites and services."&lt;ref name=Hargittai&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hargittai, E. |year=2007 |title=Whose space? Differences among users and non-users of social network sites |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/hargittai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, data collected by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] found that men were more likely to have multiple SNS profiles. Although the sample sizes of the two surveys are comparable – 1,650 Internet users in the Pew survey&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; compared with 1,060 in Hargittai's survey&lt;ref name=Hargittai /&gt; – the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population.&lt;ref name=Pew_methodology&gt;{{cite web|title=IRB Information |author=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200237/http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram attract more females. Picture sharing sites overall are very popular among women. Pinterest alone attracts three times as many female users than male. Although use of Pinterest by men has increased from 5% in 2012. Facebook attracts about 77% of women online. Instagram is also more likely to attract women. Men are more likely to participate in online forums like Reddit, Digg or Slashdot. One in five men claim to be a part of an online forum.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt;

===Uses===

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; In November 2010, the gap between men and women was as high as 15%.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of Facebook users scored higher on scales for social connection and posting of photographs.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt; Studies have also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regards to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A., Madden, M., Macgill, A., &amp; Smith, A. (2007). Teens and social media. Washington, DC: Pew Internet and American Life Project. Retrieved February 27, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/Teens-andSocial-Media.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a study of [[blog]]s maintained in MySpace, women were found to be more likely to not only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs.&lt;ref name=Jones_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Jones, S., Millermaier, S., Goya-Martinez, M., &amp; Schuler, J. |year=2008 |title=Whose space is MySpace? A content analysis of MySpace profiles |journal=First Monday |volume=13 |issue=9 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2202/2024 |doi=10.5210/fm.v13i9.2202}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[Sweden|Swedish]] SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of their friends, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also more likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express [[heterosexual]] behaviors and mannerisms instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.&lt;ref name=Sveningsson&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Sveningsson Elm, M. |year=2007 |title=Gender stereotypes and young people's presentations of relationships in a Swedish Internet community |journal=YOUNG |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=145–167 |doi=10.1177/110330880701500203}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale study of gender differences in MySpace found that both men and women tended to have a majority of female Friends, and both men and women tended to have a majority of female "Top" Friends in the site.&lt;ref name=Thelwall1&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2008 |title= Social networks, gender and friending: An analysis of MySpace member profiles |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=1321–1330 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpace_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20835}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A later study found women to author disproportionately many (public) comments in MySpace,&lt;ref name=Thelwall2&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2009 |title= Homophily in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=219–231 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpaceHomophilypreprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20978}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
but an investigation into the role of emotion in public MySpace comments found that women both give and receive stronger positive emotion.&lt;ref name=Thelwall3&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M., Wilkinson, D., Uppal, S. |year=2010 |title=Data mining emotion in social network communication: Gender differences in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=190–199 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/DataMiningEmotionSNS_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.21180}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesised that women are simply more effective at using [[social networking sites]] because they are better able to harness positive emotion.

A study focused on the influence of gender and personality on individuals’ use of online social networking websites such as Facebook, reported that men use social networking sites with the intention of forming new relationships, whereas, women use them more for relationship maintenance. (Muscanell and Guadagno, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Muscanell N.L., Guadagno R.E. | year = 2012 | title = Make new friends or keep the old: Gender and personality differences in social networking use | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 107–112 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to this, women are more likely to use Facebook or MySpace to compare themselves to others and also to search for information. Men, however, are more likely to look at other people's profiles with in the intention to find friends. (Haferkamp et al., 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haferkamp N., Eimler S.C., Papadakis A.M., Kruck J.V. | year = 2012 | title = Men are from Mars, women are from Venus?

===Privacy===

[[Internet privacy|Privacy]] has been the primary topic of many studies of SNS users, and many of these studies have found differences between male and female SNS users, although some studies have found results contradictory to those found in other studies.

Some researchers have found that women are more protective of their personal information and more likely to have private profiles.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Lewis, K., Kaufman, J., &amp; Christakis, N. |year=2008 |title=The taste for privacy: An analysis of college student privacy settings in an online social network |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=79–100 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01432.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that women are less likely to post some types of information. Acquisti and Gross found that women in their sample were less likely to reveal their [[sexual orientation]], personal address, or cell phone number.&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt; This is similar to Pew Internet &amp; American Life research of children users of SNSs that found that boys and girls presented different views of privacy and behaviors, with girls being more concerned about and restrictive of information such as city, town, last name, and cell phone number that could be used to locate them.&lt;ref name=Lenhart_and_Madden&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenhart, A., &amp; Madden, M. |year=2007 |title=Teens, privacy &amp; online social networks |publisher=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219174827/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At least one group of researchers has found that women are less likely to share information that "identifies them directly – last name, cell phone number, and address or home phone number," linking that resistance to women's greater concerns about "[[cyberstalking]]", "[[cyberbullying]]", and security problems.&lt;ref name=Salaway_and_Caruso /&gt;

Despite these concerns about privacy, researchers have found that women are more likely to maintain up-to-date photos of themselves.&lt;ref name=Kolek&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Kolek, E. A., &amp; Saunders, D. |title=Online disclosure: An empirical examination of undergraduate Facebook profiles |journal=NASPA Journal |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |year=2008 |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1905}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strano&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Strano, M. M. |year=2008 |title=User descriptions and interpretations of self-presentation through Facebook profile images |journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |volume=2 |issue=2 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2008110402&amp;article=(search%20in%20Issues)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Kolek and Saunders found in their sample of college student Facebook users that women were more likely to not only post a photograph of themselves in their profile but that they were more likely to have a publicly viewable Facebook account (a contradictory finding compared to many other studies), post photos, and post photo albums.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt;

Women were more likely to have: (a) a publicly viewable Facebook account, (b) more photo albums, (c) more photos, (d) a photo of themselves as their profile picture, (e) positive references to alcohol, partying, or drugs, and (f) more positive references to or about the institution or institution-related activities. In general, women were more likely to disclose information about themselves in their Facebook profile, with the primary exception of sharing their telephone number.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt; Similarly, female respondents to Strano's study were more likely to keep their profile photo recent and choose a photo that made them appear attractive, happy, and fun-loving. Citing several examples, Strano opined that there may also be a difference in how men and women Facebook users display and interpret profile photos depicting relationships.&lt;ref name=Strano /&gt;

Privacy has also been a concern for the SnapChat app, which allows you to send messages either text or photo or video which then disappear. One study has shown that security is not a major concern for the majority of users and that most do not use Snapchat to send sensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally). As part of their research almost no statistically significant gender differences were found.&lt;ref&gt;Roesner, F., Gill, B. T., &amp; Kohno, T. (2014). Sex, Lies, Or kittens? investigating the use of snapchat’s self-destructing messages. In ''Financial Cryptography and Data Security - 18th International Conference, FC 2014, Revised Selected Papers.'' (Vol. 8437, pp. 64-76). (Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics); Vol. 8437). Springer Verlag. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberbullying'''

Past research carried out to investigate if there are any gender differences in cyber-bulling has found that boys commit more cyber verbal bullying, cyber forgery and more violence based on hidden identity or presenting themselves as other person. (Sincek 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Šincek, D., 2014, January. Gender differences in cyber-bullying. In International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference SOCIAL SCIENCES AND ARTS SGEM2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==
Although men and women users of SNSs exhibit different behavior and motivations, they share some similarities. For example, one study that examined the veracity of information shared on SNSs by college students found that men and women were as likely to "provide accurate and complete information about their birthday, schedule of classes, partner's name, AIM, or political views."&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt;

In contradiction to several of the studies described above that found that women are more likely to be SNS users, at least one very reputable study has found that men and women are equally likely to be SNS users. Data gathered in December 2008 by the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] showed that the SNS users in their sample were equally divided among men and women.&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; As mentioned above, the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population&lt;ref name="Pew_methodology" /&gt; than the data in much of the previously described research.

==Traditional gender roles==
Some studies have found that traditional gender roles are present in SNSs, with men in this study conforming to traditional views of [[masculinity]] and the women to traditional views of [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman /&gt; Qualitative work with college student SNS users by Martínez Alemán and Wartman&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Martínez Alemán |first1=A. M. |last2=Wartman |first2=K. L. |year=2009 |title=Online social networking on campus: Understanding what matters in student culture |publisher=Routledge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Managgo ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Manago, A. M., Graham, M. B., Greenfield, P. M., &amp; Salimkhan, G. |year=2008 |title=Self-presentation and gender on MySpace |journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology |volume=29 |pages=446–458 |doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.001 |issue=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; have found similar results for both Facebook and MySpace users. Moreover, the work by Managgo ''et al.'' discovered not only traditional gender roles and images but sexualisation of women users of MySpace.&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al /&gt; Similarly, research into the impact of comments in the profile of a Facebook users on that user's perceived attractiveness revealed a "sexual double standard", wherein negative statements resulted in male profile owners being judged more attractive and female profile owners less attractive.&lt;ref name=Walther_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00312.x |author=Walther, J. B., Van Der Heide, B., Kim, S., Westerman, D., &amp; Tong, S.

&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at least one study has found that men and women SNS users both left textual clues about their gender.&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;

==Other gender identities in social networking==
In February 2014, Facebook announced the vast expansion of options for choosing gender identities to list on profiles, ranging to up to 56 gender identity choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/apnewsbreak-gender-options-facebook-users-22501422|title=Technology and Science News - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=567587973337709|title=Timeline Photos - Facebook Diversity - Facebook|work=facebook.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Facebook followed up with allowing gender-neutral relationship identities for identifying family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/08/28/facebook-adds-gender-neutral-family-relationship-settings|title=Facebook Adds Gender-Neutral Family Relationship Settings|author=[[Parker Marie Molloy]]|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The working environment has gone through a major transformation over the last decade, particularly in terms of population in the workforce. The three generations dominating the workforce in 2013 are Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y. The coming decades will see further changes with emergence of newer generations, and slower removal of older generations from organisations as pension age is pushed out. Many reports, including a publication by Therese Kinal and Olga Hypponen of Unleash, warn that understanding differences between the generations, and learning to adapt their management practices is critical to building a successful multigenerational workplace.&lt;ref name=Kinal2013&gt;Kinal, T; Hipponen, O (2013, April).

==Baby Boomers==
[[Baby Boomers]], born approximately between 1946 and 1964 were brought up in a healthy post war economy and saw the world revolving around them as the largest generation of the century.&lt;ref&gt;The Older Population: 2010. U.S. Census Bureau. November 2011. https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf Accessed October 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lifestyle is to live for work and they often expect the same level of dedication and work ethics from the next generations. They are said to prefer face to face communication, are interactive team players and attain personal fulfilment from work. Baby Boomers are often branded workaholics leaving little to no work-life balance which has inevitably led to a breakdown in family values which has influenced the next generation.&lt;ref name=Kinal2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adecco /&gt;&lt;ref name=UNS&gt;Talent management Team UNJSPF. (n.d.). Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y (and Generation Z) Working together. http://www.un.org/staffdevelopment/pdf/Designing%20Recruitment,%20Selection%20&amp;%20Talent%20Management%20Model%20tailored%20to%20meet%20UNJSPF%27s%20Business%20Development%20Needs.pdf  Retrieved October 10, 2013, from Un.org:&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to be loyal to their organisations, enjoy the notion of lifetime employment and prefer to be valued or needed as opposed to rewarded with recognition or money. An article by Emma Simon in the ''Daily Telegraph'' describes them as the 'post war generation' who have enjoyed an "unbroken run of good-luck".&lt;ref&gt;Sinton, E (2011). 'Baby boomers are very privileged human beings' https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/8840963/Baby-boomers-are-very-privileged-human-beings.html retrieved October 23, 2013 from www.telegraph.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gen X==

[[Generation X]] is the generation born after the Western post-World War II Baby Boomers between approximately 1965 and 1980.&lt;ref name=Gratton2011&gt;Gratton, L. (2011). The Shift-The future of work is already here. London: Collins&lt;/ref&gt; The term was noted by photographer Robert Capa in the early 1950s. Of the generation, Capa said "We named this unknown generation, The Generation X, and even in our first enthusiasm we realised that we had something far bigger than our talents and pockets could cope with."&lt;ref&gt;GenXegesis: essays on alternative youth (sub)culture By John McAllister Ulrich, Andrea L. Harris p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation of workers were brought up in the shadow of the influential Boomer generation and as a result, are independent, resilient and adaptable. In contrast to the Baby Boomers who live to work, this generation works to live and carry with them a level of cynicism.&lt;ref name=UNS /&gt;&lt;ref name=ken&gt;Ken Blanchard Companies. (2009). Next Generation of workers. http://www.kenblanchard.com/img/pub/Blanchard_Next_Generation_of_Workers.pdf Retrieved October 14, 2013, from kenblanchard.com&lt;/ref&gt; They prefer freedom to manage their work and tasks their own way. They consider a job to be just that, and are comfortable questioning authority.

Coming out of and during the recession, there has been a significant shift in Gen X moving to management roles. Perceptions of Gen X managers are high according to an online survey published by Ernst &amp; Young. Out of 200 people, 57% of respondents believed that Gen X displayed each of the survey’s positive characteristics and were thought to be best at managing through difficult times.&lt;ref name=EY&gt;Ernst and Young. (n.d.). Younger managers rise in the ranks. http://www.ey.com/US/en/Issues/Talent-management/Talent-Survey-The-generational-management-shift Retrieved October 14, 2013, from www.EY.com:&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gen Y==

The Y generation, also referred to as "[[Millennials]]" were born around 1980 to 2000.&lt;ref name=Gratton2011 /&gt; They have been described in a report published by United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund as the next big generation after the Baby Boomers.&lt;ref name=UNS /&gt; They were raised during the good time or empowerment years and are the first generation to grow up with computers and the internet. In her book, The Shift: The future of work is already here, Grattan states that this generation admire these new platforms they use even though they grew up with them.&lt;ref name=Gratton2011 /&gt;
 
A report published by Adecco on workplace revolution outlined Gen Y’s work ethics and behaviours. According to the report, they enjoy a work life balance, akin to Gen X, and prefer to work with bright and creative people. They are participative as opposed to directive, enjoy multi-tasking and are goal oriented. They are also considered the most educated and self-aware generation in employment.&lt;ref name=Adecco /&gt;

According to an Ernest &amp; Young report on the rise of young managers in the workplace, this generation were not considered to be team players and have an attitude of entitlement.&lt;ref name=EY /&gt; This was also noted by Jean Twenge in her book ''Generation me''. In terms of management, they are considered inclusive leaders and enjoy diversification and input when making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Twenge, Jean M (2007). Generations Me. Atria Books, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gen Z==

The future [[generation]] of workers, according to Amy Glass, are referred to as generation Z. Generation Z are those born approximately after 2000 and are even more reliant on new technology and in particular communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmo.com/opinion/articles/2016/5/24/listen-up-the-founder-generation-is-making-a-name-for-itself.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glass, A. (2007). Understanding generational differences for competitive success. Industrial and commercial training, Vol 39, p98-103.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little knowledge yet of this generation in terms of attitude and characteristics in the workplace given that the eldest of this generation are now coming into their late teens. In the next decade however, we can expect to see this generation joining the workforce.

‘The Next Generation of Workers’ written by Lily Guthrie of The Ken Blanchard Companies, Office of the Future, highlights the importance of awareness and understanding of the attitudes of the intergenerational workforce. Companies will need to be collaborative, innovative and agile in their operations and management.&lt;ref name=ken /&gt; There are many reports on the management of a cohort of generations in the workplace, including one from the psychology foundation of Canada which provides effective strategies, training, and education that they believe will bridge the differences between the generations.&lt;ref&gt;Psychology Foundation of Canada.

The '''German Labour Front''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Arbeitsfront}}, {{IPA-de|ˌdɔʏtʃə ˈʔaʁbaɪtsfʁɔnt|pron}}; DAF) was the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] labour organisation which replaced the various independent [[trade unions in Germany]] after [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power.

Its leader was [[Robert Ley]], who stated that its aim was 'to create a [[Preussentum und Sozialismus#Rebuke of Marxism and definition of "true socialism"|true social]] and productive community'.&lt;ref&gt;Smelster, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, DAF existed to act as a medium through which workers and owners could mutually represent their interests. Wages were set by the 12 DAF trustees. The employees were given relatively high set wages and security of employment, and dismissal was increasingly made difficult. Social security and leisure programmes were started, canteens, breaks, and regular working times were established, and German workers were generally satisfied by what the DAF gave them in repayment for their absolute loyalty.{{Citation needed|reason=Unclear qualifiers (relatively high, made difficult, generally satisfied [in a totalitarian context]|date=August 2018}}

Following the National Socialist’s ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' approach towards developing a greater "people's community", the DAF expanded or established new social, educational, sports, health, and entertainment programs for German workers via the [[Strength through Joy]], which included factory libraries and gardens, periodic breaks, swimming pools, low-priced hot meals, adult education programs, periodic work breaks, physical education, sports facilities, gymnastic training, orchestral music during lunch breaks, free tickets to concerts and opera, and subsidized vacations that saw over 10.3 million Germans signed up by 1938.&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Mason, ''Social Policy in the Third Reich: The Working Class and the ‘National Community’, 1918-1939'', Oxford: UK, Berg Publishers, 1993, p. 160. [[Völkischer Beobachter]], Nov. 21, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; The DAF financed the building of ocean-going vessels that permitted German workers to pay minimal prices to sail to many foreign destinations. Up to six ocean liners were operating just before the start of World War II. According to the chief of the [[Associated Press]] in Berlin, [[Louis P. Lochner]], ticket prices for ocean streamer vessels ranged from twelve to sixteen marks for "a full week on such a steamer".&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis P. Lochner]], ''What About Germany?'' New York: NY, Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1942, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; For those who desired vacations closer to home, the DAF constructed spa and summer resort complexes. One of the largest was located on the island of [[Rugen]], where the DAF financed and erected a "summer resort with 20,000 beds".&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis P. Lochner]], ''What About Germany?'' New York: NY, Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1942, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

To help finance such ambitious social programs, the DAF also operated one of the largest financial institutions—the Bank of German Labour—along with additional community programs such as medical screening, occupational training, legal assistance and programs to improve the company's working environment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bessel]], ''Nazism and the War'', New York: NY, Modern Library, 2006, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The DAF was one of the largest National Socialist organizations, boasting of over 35,000 full-time employees by 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bessel]], ''Nazism and the War'', New York: NY, Modern Library, 2006, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; To help Hitler keep his promise to have every German capable of owning an affordable car ([[Volkswagen]]—the People’s Car) the DAF subsidized the construction of an automobile factory, which was partially paid from worker’s payroll deductions. None of the 340,000 workers who were paying for a car ever received one, since the factory had to be retooled for war production after [[Nazi Germany invaded Poland]].

In the case of workplace abuses, the DAF set up worker councils to regulate and manage business practices, along with working hours and wages, and conflicts rising between employers and workers. In 1934, worker councils dismissed over 50 workers, while in the same year 13 employers were punished through the expropriation of their business.&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Florinsky, ''Fascism and National Socialism: A Study of the Economic and Social Policies of the Totalitarian State'', New York, NY:Macmillan, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment contracts created under the [[Weimar Republic]] were abolished and renewed under new circumstances in the DAF. Employers could demand more of their workers, while at the same time workers were given increased security of work and increasingly enrolled into social security programmes for workers. The organisation, by its own definition, combated capitalism and liberalism, but also revolution against the factory owners and the National Socialist state. The DAF, however, did openly prefer to have large companies nationalised by the German state, instead of privately owned companies.

DAF membership was theoretically voluntary, but any workers in any area of German commerce or industry would have found it hard to get a job without being a member. Membership required a fee within the range of 15 [[pfennig]] to three [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]], depending on the category a member fell into in a large scale of 20 membership groups. A substantially large amount of income was raised through fees. In 1934, the total intake was 300,000,000 Reichsmark. In US dollars, the annual income from dues to the Labour Front came to $160,000,000 in 1937 and $200,000,000 by 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany]]'', New York, NY, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2011, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Betriebssportgruppe.JPG|thumb|right|170px|Members of the German Labour Front, ca. 1943.]] --&gt;
There were two main components of the DAF and these were:
* ''[[Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellenorganisation]]'' (NSBO; National Socialist Factory Organization)
* ''[[Nationalsozialistische Handels- und Gewerbeorganisation]]'' (NSHAGO; National Socialist Trade and Industry Organization)

Several other sub-organisations were set up:
*''[[Kraft durch Freude]]'' (KdF; Strength through Joy) &amp;ndash; Organisation giving the workers cheap/free holidays in addition to subsidised sporting and leisure facilities.
*''[[Schönheit der Arbeit]]'' (SdA; Beauty of Labour) &amp;ndash; Aimed to make workplaces more enticing to workers (e.g., renovations of outdated factories, new canteens for workers, smoking-free rooms, cleaner working spaces etc.).

The Front also organised the ''[[Reichsberufswettkampf]]'', a national vocational competition.

'''Ghanaian Australians''' are Australian citizens and residents of [[Ghanaian]] origin and descent. More than 50% of those who are Ghana-born live in Sydney.&lt;ref name="CIS2011"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|title=Community Information Summary: Ghana-born|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/02_2014/ghana.pdf|work=Australian Government Department of Immigration &amp; Citizenship|date=February 2012|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan allowed students from West African countries, including from Ghana, to come to Australia the mid-1960s. More than 70 per cent of these students remained in Australia following military coups in their countries. While small in number, the Ghana-born steadily increased from the mid-1970s following the easing of immigration restrictions.&lt;ref name="CIS2011"/&gt; The majority of Ghanaian Australians are skilled and educated, with 70.6% of the Ghana-born aged 15 years and over possessing higher non-school qualifications, compared to 55.9% of the Australian population.&lt;ref name="CIS2011"/&gt;

==Population==
The 2011 Census noted there were 3,866 Ghana-born people in Australia.&lt;ref name="SBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/censusexplorer/|title=Census Explorer: SBS World News|publisher=Sbs.com.au|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akan language|Akan]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]] and [[Ga language|Ga]] all have many speakers in Australia.

It was noted in 2014 that the Ghanaian student population in Australia (like the Nigerian one) was growing fast to the extent that Australian universities were keen to attract more students from Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim|last=Dodd|url=http://www.afr.com/news/policy/education/big-increase-in-number-of-nigerian-students-at-australian-universities-20140706-jgq12|title=Big increase in number of Nigerian students at Australian universities|publisher=Australian Financial Review|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gudipati Venkata Chalam aka Chalam''' (1894–1979), a [[Telugu language|Telugu]] writer and [[philosopher]], was one of the most influential personalities in modern [[Telugu literature]].

Most of his writings were regarding women, especially the kind of difficulties women encounter—physical as well as psychological—in society, from their families and from those with whom they are close. Chalam discussed how he believed women should face these problems. The themes philosophical tinge of his writings blended with a distinctive style which would earn for him an enviable place in the Telugu literary world.

== Life ==
Much that is known about Chalam’s childhood comes from his 1972 autobiography titled ''Chalam''. In it, he vividly mentions how he suffered beatings from his father and how his mother, residing at her parents’ home even after having been married and starting a family with her husband, had to face a flurry of insults. Chalam brazenly puts across why he wrote his autobiography in its foreword:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "I hate autobiographies. By writing an autobiography, I am admitting to myself and indirectly telling everybody that I am an important person, I made lots of good things to help people and society and if I do not tell the world about myself, there is great loss to the world and by not knowing about me, the world is losing something. For a person like me who always thinks and  wonders, "Why was I born? And OK, I was born but why I did not die immediately without polluting my surroundings? Writing an autobiography and telling my story shamelessly is not a matter to be excused [...]"

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Birth and childhood ===
Known more widely as "Chalam"', Gudipati Venkata Chalam was born on 18 May 1894 in [[Chennai]] in India.  His mother was Venkata Subbamma and his father was Kommuri Sambasivarao. In his childhood, his maternal grandfather adopted him and his surname was changed to "Gudipati" from "Kommuri". He used to practice [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals very religiously. Before he completing, he had committed himself to an exhaustive study of Hindu epics as well as Hindu doctrinal teachings. The way his father abused his mother made an indelible impression on his young mind. Besides this, the manner in which his sister "Ammmanni" (Venkata Ramanamma, Dulla) was coerced into an arranged marriage against her will also made him concentrate on the difficulties that women faced in society.

=== Education, marriage and employment ===
Chalam joined Pithapuram Maharaja College in 1911. At that time, he was attracted by the preachings of [[Raghupathi Venkataratnam Naidu|Raghupati Venkata Ratnam Naidu]]—a social reformer and founder of the [[Brahma Samaj]] in Andhra. Chalam went to Chennai to study for his Bachelor of Arts. Before joining the college, he was married to Chitti Ranganayakamma. While studying for his degree in Chennai, he got his wife admitted into a convent for her education and he used to drop her at school on his bicycle. This was a spectacle for the people to see -a husband dropping off the wife on his cycle. Chalam stopped wearing the sacred thread ([[Yagnopaveetham]]), started eating non-vegetarian food ([[Brahmins]] were strict [[vegetarianism in Hinduism|vegetarians]]) and he used to mingle with all castes. This infuriated all his relatives and more so his father-in-law. His father-in-law banished him from entering his house. By that time, Chalam's wife's age was merely 13. When his mother-in-law died, Chalam and his friends were not allowed in his father-in-law's the house for the funeral, and they were served food outside.

After completing his studies in Madras, Chalam joined in a job as tutor in [[Kakinada]]. Again, he started participating in the Brahma Samaj activities. He also became busy with his friendship with a beautiful girl named "Ratnamma" who happened to be his friend's sister-in-law. He worked as a teacher in [[Karimnagar]]. Then he joined in a job with Teacher's Training College in Rajahmundry. He later became a school inspector. About his job, Chalam wrote in his famous book "Musings" (in Telugu language) (Page 72, 5th Print in 2005) as follows:

'''I am a stone, slave of the government, school inspector and for the poor mice like teachers, I am the cat.'''

== Philosophy ==
Chalam was a strong critic of the fundamental societal architecture of his time. He believed that the barriers created by the society precluded love and mutual understanding from human relationships.

In a society that believed in children being indebted to their parents, he proclaimed caring for and bringing up of children as the fundamental duty as parents.

He was widely shunned during his times especially for his advocacy of women’s rights and his total rejection of the family system.
== Adaptations ==
His Short story Doshagunam was adapted as a [[Grahanam]] movie.

== Quotes ==
* From Brahmanikam: ''to be verified''
''Stri oka mata valla,chupu vallaa purushuniki Sandichhindaa....ika atani adhikaraniki,korikalaki,vinnapalaki antam undadu. Asalu paryavasanam akkarleni stri modatininchi vimukhamgane undali......nippu vale undali,kaalanu kudadani chala mandi moorkhula aasa...''

''స్త్రీ ఒక మాట వల్ల,చూపు వల్లా పురుషునికి సందిచ్చిందా....ఇక అతని అధికారానికి, కోరికలకి, విన్నపాలకి అంతం ఉండదు. అసలు పర్యవసానం అక్కర్లేని స్త్రీ మొదటినించి విముఖంగానే ఉండాలి......నిప్పు వలె ఉండాలి, ...''
----
The novel Maidanam made an indelible mark on the reader for its free and  frank way of expression, the relationship between man and woman disregarding caste and creed.

'''Human population planning''' is the practice of intentionally controlling the rate of [[Human population growth|growth of a human population]]. Historically, human population planning has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of human population growth. However, in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its effects on [[poverty]], [[Human impact on the environment|environmental degradation]] and [[political stability]] led to efforts to reduce human population growth rates. More recently, some countries, such as Iran and Spain, have begun efforts to increase their birth rates once again.

While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government's "[[one-child policy]] and [[two-child policy]]", have resorted to coercive measures.

==Types==
Four types of population planning goals pursued by governments can be identified:
# Increasing the overall population growth rate
# Reducing the overall population growth rate
# Decreasing the relative population growth of a less favoured subgroup of a national population or ethnic group, such as people of low intelligence or people with disabilities. This is known as [[eugenics]].
# Instead of trying to control the rate of population growth ''per se'', trying to arrange things so that all population groups of a certain type (e.g. all social classes within a society) have the same average rate of population growth. This is not eugenics, because it does not discriminate, but it is an attempt to avoid a [[dysgenic]] outcome.

==Methods==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}

While a specific population planning practice may be legal/mandated in one country, it may be illegal or restricted in another, indicative of the controversy surrounding this topic.

===Reducing population growth===
Population planning that is intended to reduce a population or sub-population's growth rates may promote or enforce one or more of the following practices, although there are other methods as well:

* Higher [[taxation]] of parents who have "excess" children
* [[Contraception]]
* [[Sexual abstinence|Abstinence]]
* Reducing [[infant mortality]] so that parents do not need to have many children to ensure at least some survive to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Lifeblood: How to Change the World One Dead Mosquito at a Time, Alex Perry p9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abortion]]
* Changing [[status of women]] causing departure from traditional sexual division of labour.
* [[Sterilisation (medicine)|Sterilization]]
* [[One child policy|One-child]] and [[Two child policy|Two-child]] policies, and other policies restricting or discouraging births directly.
* [[Family planning]]&lt;ref name="Ryerson 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryerson|first1=William N.|title=The Post Carbon Reader: Managing the 21st Century's Sustainability Crises, "Ch.12: Population: The Multiplier of Everything Else"|date=2010|publisher=Watershed Media|location=Healdsburg, Calif.|isbn=978-0970950062|pages=153–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Create small family "role models"&lt;ref name="Ryerson 2010"/&gt;
* Changes to immigration policies

The method(s) chosen can be strongly influenced by the religious and cultural beliefs of community members. The failure of other methods of population planning can lead to the use of abortion or [[infanticide]] as solutions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== Increasing population growth ===
Population policies that are intended to increase a population or sub-population's growth rates may use practices such as:

* Higher [[taxation]] of married couples who have no, or too few, children
* Politicians imploring the populace to have bigger families
* Tax breaks and subsidies for families with children
* Loosening of immigration restrictions, and/or mass recruitment of foreign workers by the government

==History==

===Ancient times through Middle Ages===
A number of ancient writers have reflected on the issue of population. At about 300 BC, the Indian [[political philosopher]] [[Chanakya]] (c. 350-283 BC) considered population a source of political, economic, and military strength. Though a given region can house too many or too few people, he considered the latter possibility to be the greater evil. Chanakya favored the remarriage of [[widows]] (which at the time was forbidden in India), opposed taxes encouraging emigration, and believed in restricting [[asceticism]] to the aged.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 7"&gt;{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn=9781563244070 |pages=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&amp;dq=%22population+control%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], [[Plato]] (427-347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC) discussed the best population size for Greek [[city-state]]s such as Sparta, and concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation in public affairs, but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile neighbors. In order to maintain a desired population size, the philosophers advised that [[procreation]], and if necessary, immigration, should be encouraged if the population size was too small. Emigration to colonies would be encouraged should the population become too large.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 6"/&gt; Aristotle concluded that a large increase in population would bring, "certain poverty on the citizenry, and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil." To halt rapid population increase, Aristotle advocated the use of [[abortion]] and the exposure of newborns (that is, [[infanticide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn=9781563244070 |pages=6–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&amp;dq=%22population+control%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confucius]] (551-478 BC) and other Chinese writers cautioned that, "excessive growth may reduce output per worker, repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife." Confucius also observed that, "mortality increases when food supply is insufficient; that premature marriage makes for high infantile mortality rates, that war checks population growth."&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 6"&gt;{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E.

[[Ancient Rome]], especially in the time of [[Augustus]] (63 BC- AD 14), needed manpower to acquire and administer the vast [[Roman Empire]]. A series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth. Lex Julia (18 BC) and the Lex Papia Poppaea (AD 9) are two well known examples of such laws, which among others, provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those that complied with the laws. Severe limitations were imposed on those who did not. For example, the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune, while the rest was taken by the state. These laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 7"/&gt;

[[Tertullian]], an early Christian author (ca. AD 160-220), was one of the first to describe famine and war as factors that can prevent overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 7"/&gt; He wrote: "The strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs; as our demands grow greater, our complaints against Nature's inadequacy are heard by all. The scourges of pestilence, famine, wars and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations, since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race."&lt;ref name="Neurath94-page8"/&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]], a North African [[Arab]] [[polymath]] (1332–1406), considered population changes to be connected to economic development, linking high birth rates and low death rates to times of economic upswing, and low birth rates and high death rates to economic downswing. Khaldoun concluded that high [[population density]] rather than high absolute population numbers were desirable to achieve more efficient division of labour and cheap administration.&lt;ref name=Neurath94-page8 &gt;{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Christian Europe, population issues were rarely discussed in isolation. Attitudes were generally pro-[[natalist]] in line with the [[Biblical]] command, "Be ye fruitful and multiply."&lt;ref name=Neurath94-page8 /&gt;

===16th and 17th centuries===
European cities grew more rapidly than before, and throughout the 16th century and early 17th century discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of population growth were frequent.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 10"&gt;{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E.

He is also going to feed them."&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 9"/&gt;

[[Jean Bodin]], a French [[jurist]] and [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] (1530–1596), argued that larger populations meant more production and more exports, increasing the wealth of a country.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 9"/&gt; [[Giovanni Botero]], an Italian priest and diplomat (1540–1617), emphasized that, "the greatness of a city rests on the multitude of its inhabitants and their power," but pointed out that a population cannot increase beyond its food supply. If this limit was approached, late marriage, emigration, and war would serve to restore the balance.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 9"/&gt;

[[Richard Hakluyt]], an English writer (1527–1616), observed that, "Throughe our longe peace and seldome sickness... wee are growen more populous than ever heretofore;... many thousandes of idle persons are within this realme, which, havinge no way to be sett on worke, be either mutinous and seeke alteration in the state, or at leaste very burdensome to the commonwealthe." Hakluyt believed that this led to crime and full jails and in ''A Discourse on Western Planting'' (1584), Hakluyt advocated for the emigration of the surplus population.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 10"/&gt; With the onset of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), characterized by widespread devastation and deaths brought on by hunger and disease in Europe, concerns about depopulation returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E.

==Population planning movement==
In the 20th century, population planning proponents have drawn from the insights of [[Thomas Malthus]], a British clergyman and economist who published ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798. Malthus argued that, "Population, when unchecked, increases in a [[geometric progression|geometrical]] ratio. [[Subsistence]] increases only in an [[arithmetic progression|arithmetical]] ratio." He also outlined the idea of "positive checks" and "preventative checks." "Positive checks", such as diseases, war, disaster, famine, and genocide are factors that Malthus considered to increase the death rate.&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"&gt;Rosenberg, M. (2007, September 09)3-2. Thomas Malthus on Population.

"Preventative checks" were factors that Malthus believed to affect the birth rate such as moral restraint, abstinence and birth control.&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"/&gt; He predicted that "positive checks" on [[exponential growth|exponential population growth]] would ultimately save humanity from itself and that human misery was an "absolute necessary consequence."&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 2–3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=9780826515285 |pages=2–3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner.

{{quote|There is a constant effort towards an increase in population which tends to subject the lower classes of society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition…. The way in which these effects are produced seems to be this. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population... increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food, therefore which before supplied seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress.&lt;ref&gt;Bleier, R. The Home Page of the International Society of Malthus.

In his concluding chapter, Ehrlich offered a partial solution to the "population problem,"
"[We need] compulsory birth regulation... [through] the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired family size".&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 3"/&gt;

Ehrlich's views came to be accepted by many population planning advocates in the United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=9780826515285 |pages=3–4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ehrlich introduced his idea of the "population bomb," overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues, including increasing poverty, high unemployment rates, environmental degradation, famine and genocide.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 2–3"/&gt; In a 2004 interview, Ehrlich reviewed the predictions in his book and found that while the specific dates within his predictions may have been wrong, his predictions about climate change and disease were valid. Ehrlich continued to advocate for population planning and co-authored the book ''The Population Explosion'', released in 1990 with his wife Anne Ehrlich.

==Population planning and economics==
Opinions vary among economists about the effects of population change on a nation's economic health. US scientific research in 2009 concluded that the raising of a child cost about $16,000 yearly ($291,570 total for raising the child to its 18th birthday).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE57367220090804 | work=Reuters | first=Charles | last=Abbott | title=Pricetag to raise a child -- $291,570, says U.S | date=August 4, 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824010713/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE57367220090804 | archivedate=August 24, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the multiplication of this number with the yearly population growth will yield the overall cost of the population growth. Costs for other developed countries are usually of similar order of magnitude.

Some economists, such as [[Thomas Sowell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell021298.html%22 Thomas Sowell Julian Simon, combatant in a 200-year war] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708044535/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell021298.html%22 |date=2009-07-08 }} Thomas Sowell, February 12, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter E.

==Views on population planning==
{{POV section|date=February 2013}}

===Population increase reductions===
====Support====

As early as 1798, [[Thomas Malthus]] argued in his [[Essay on the Principle of Population]] for implementation of population planning. Around the year 1900, Sir [[Francis Galton]] said in his publication ''Hereditary Improvement'': "The unfit could become enemies to the State, if they continue to propagate." In 1968, Paul Ehrlich noted in ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', "We must cut the cancer of population growth", and "if this was not done, there would be only one other solution, namely the 'death rate solution' in which we raise the death rate through war-famine-pestilence etc.”

In the same year, another prominent modern advocate for mandatory population planning was [[Garrett Hardin]], who proposed in his landmark 1968 essay ''[[Tragedy of the commons]]'', society must relinquish the "freedom to breed" through "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon." Later on, in 1972, he reaffirmed his support in his new essay "[[Exploring New Ethics for Survival]]", by stating, " We are breeding ourselves into oblivion." Many prominent personalities, such as [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Margaret Sanger]] (1939), [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Frederick Osborn]] (1952), [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Arne Næss]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (1998). ''Hitler's Priestess: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism''. NY: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-3110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacques Cousteau]] have also advocated for population planning.
Today, a number of influential people advocate population planning such as these:

The head of the UN Millennium Project [[Jeffrey Sachs]] is also a strong proponent of decreasing the effects of overpopulation. In 2007, Jeffrey Sachs gave a number of lectures (2007 [[Reith Lectures]]) about population planning and overpopulation. In his lectures, called "[[Bursting at the seams (Reith lectures)|Bursting at the Seams]]", he featured an integrated approach that would deal with a number of problems associated with overpopulation and [[poverty reduction]]. For example, when criticized for advocating mosquito nets he argued that child survival was, "by far one of the most powerful ways," to achieve fertility reduction, as this would assure poor families that the smaller number of children they had would survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2007/lecture1.shtml BBC.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412162642/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2007/lecture1.shtml |date=2009-04-12 }} Bursting at the Seams&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition====
The Roman Catholic Church [[Catholic Church and abortion|has opposed abortion, sterilization, and artificial contraception]] as a general practice but especially in regard to population planning policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=William|title=Church Has Always Condemned Abortion|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/abortion/catholic-teaching/the-catholic-church-and-abortion/|website=Catholic News Agency|publisher=Arlington Catholic Herald|accessdate=20 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081341/http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/abortion/catholic-teaching/the-catholic-church-and-abortion/|archivedate=21 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] has stated, "The extermination of millions of unborn children, in the name of the fight against poverty, actually constitutes the destruction of the poorest of all human beings."&lt;ref name="Vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20081208_xlii-world-day-peace_en.html|title=42nd World Day of Peace 2009, Fighting Poverty to Build Peace - BENEDICT XVI|author=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011230252/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20081208_xlii-world-day-peace_en.html|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Protestantism, at least an organisation called "ChurchCouncil.org" (which does not reveal any actual churches as members on its web site) wrote a "Reformed Theology ICCP Document Topic 24 Article 20" which states that "We affirm that human multiplication and filling of the Earth are intrinsically good (Genesis 1:28) and that, in principle, children, lots of them, are a blessing from God to their faithful parents and the rest of the Earth (Psalm 127; 128). We deny that the Earth is overpopulated; that “overpopulation” is even a meaningful term, since it cannot be defined by demographic quantities such as population density, population growth rate, or age distribution; and that godly dominion over the Earth requires population control or “family planning” to limit fertility."&lt;ref name="ICCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://churchcouncil.org/index.php/the-official-documents/24-environmentalism/|title=#24-Environmentalism - International Church Council Project|author=|date=|website=churchcouncil.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921000405/http://churchcouncil.org/index.php/the-official-documents/24-environmentalism/|archivedate=21 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed Theology pastor Dr. [[Stephen Tong]] also opposes the planning of human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ww123.net/redirect.php?tid=4862770&amp;goto=lastpost |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053413/https://ww123.net/redirect.php?tid=4862770&amp;goto=lastpost |archivedate=2017-03-23 |df= }} 唐崇荣牧师 圣经难解经文 第二十九讲 诺亚咒诅迦南, Retrieved 22 Mar 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natalism===
[[The Nation]] has criticised some white [[Quiverfull]] families for having large families motivated by [[racism]] and worries about "race suicide".&lt;ref name='nation'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war?page=full|title=Arrows for the War|accessdate=2010-09-18|publisher=The Nation|date=9 November 2006|author=Kathryn Joyce|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902004749/http://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war?page=full|archivedate=2 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro-natalist policies==
{{see also|Natalism}}
In 1946, Poland introduced a [[:pl:Bykowe|tax on childlessness]], discontinued in the 1970s, as part of natalist policies in the Communist government. From 1941 to the 1990s, the Soviet Union had a [[Tax on childlessness|similar tax]] to replenish the population losses incurred during the Second World War.

The [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] severely [[abortion in Romania|repressed abortion]], (the most common [[birth control]] method at the time) in 1966,&lt;ref name="Scarlat"&gt;{{Citation | language = RO | last = Scarlat | first = Sandra | url = http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_22541-Decreteii-produsele-unei-epoci-care-a-imbolnavit-Romania.htm | title = 'Decreţeii': produsele unei epoci care a îmbolnăvit România | trans-title = Scions of the Decree': Products of an Era that Sickened Romania | newspaper = [[Evenimentul Zilei]] | date = May 17, 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221359/http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_22541-Decreteii-produsele-unei-epoci-care-a-imbolnavit-Romania.htm | archivedate = September 26, 2007 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Gail | last = Kligman | title = The Politics of Duplicity.

The surge of the birth rate taxed the public services received by the ''[[Decree 770|decreţei 770]]'' ("Scions of the Decree 770") generation. A consequence of Ceaușescu's natalist policy is that large numbers of children ended up living in [[orphanages]], because their parents could not cope. The vast majority of children who lived in the communist orphanages were not actually orphans, but were simply children whose parents could not afford to raise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4629589.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - What happened to Romania's orphans?|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989 preceded a fall in population growth.

===Balanced birth policies===
Nativity in the Western world dropped during the [[interwar period]]. Swedish sociologists [[Alva Myrdal|Alva]] and [[Gunnar Myrdal]] published [[Crisis in the Population Question]] in 1934, suggesting an extensive [[welfare state]] with universal healthcare and childcare, to increase overall Swedish birth rates, and level the number of children at a reproductive level for all social classes in Sweden. [[Demographics of Sweden|Swedish fertility]] rose throughout World War II (as [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden was largely unharmed by the war]]) and peaked in 1946.

==Modern practice by country==

===Australia===
[[Australia]] currently offers fortnightly Family Tax Benefit payments plus a free immunisation scheme, and recently proposed to pay all child care costs for women who want to work.

===China===
====One-child era (1978–2014)====
{{Main article|One-child policy}}
The most significant population planning system in the world was China's [[one-child policy]], in which, with various exceptions, having more than one child was discouraged. Unauthorized births were punished by fines, although there were also allegations of illegal forced [[abortion]]s and [[forced sterilization]].&lt;ref name=dewey&gt;Arthur E. Dewey, Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and Migration Testimony before the House International Relations Committee Washington, DC December 14, 2004 {{cite web |url=http://statelists.state.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0412c&amp;L=dossdo&amp;P=401 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062432/http://statelists.state.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0412c&amp;L=dossdo&amp;P=401 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of China's planned birth policy, (work) unit supervisors monitored the fertility of married women and may decide whose turn it is to have a baby.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0081) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303220526/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+cn0081%29 |date=2013-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government introduced the policy in 1978 to alleviate the social and [[Environmental issues in the People's Republic of China|environmental problems of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Rocha da Silva, "La politique de l'enfant unique en République Populaire de Chine", 2006, [[Université de Genève]], pp. 22–28, cf.

The success of the policy has been questioned, and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7000931.stm | work = BBC News | title = Has China's one-child policy worked? | date = September 20, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080719103208/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7000931.stm | archivedate = July 19, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy is controversial both within and outside of China because of its manner of implementation and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences e.g. [[female infanticide]].  In oriental cultures, the oldest male child has responsibility of caring for the parents in their old age.  Therefore, it is common for oriental families to invest most heavily in the oldest male child, such as providing college, steering them into the most lucrative careers, and so on.  To these families, having an oldest male child is paramount, so in a one-child policy, a daughter has no economic benefit, so daughters, especially as a first child, is often targeted for abortion or infanticide.  China introduced several government reforms to increase retirement payments to coincide with the one-child policy. During that time, couples could request permission to have more than one child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Max |last=Fisher |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/11/16/chinas-rules-for-when-families-can-and-cant-have-more-than-one-child/ |title=China’s rules for when families can and can’t have more than one child |work=The Washington Post |date=November 16, 2013 |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610152024/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/11/16/chinas-rules-for-when-families-can-and-cant-have-more-than-one-child/ |archivedate=June 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Melvyn Goldstein]], natalist feelings run high in China's [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], among both ordinary people and government officials. Seeing [[population control]] "as a matter of power and ethnic survival" rather than in terms of ecological [[sustainability]], Tibetans successfully argued for an exemption of [[Tibetan people]] from the usual [[family planning]] policies in China such as the [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1525/as.1991.31.3.00p0043x | title = China's Birth Control Policy in the Tibet Autonomous Region| journal= [[Asian Survey]] | author1-link= Melvyn Goldstein |first= Melvyn |last= Goldstein |first2= Beall|last2= Cynthia|date=March 1991|volume= 31 | issue= 3| pages= 285–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Two-child era (2014-)====
In November 2014, the Chinese government allowed its people to conceive a second child under the supervision of government regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-08-01/with-end-of-chinas-one-child-policy-there-hasnt-been-a-baby-boom | work=Bloomberg | title=Why China's Second-Baby Boom Might Not Happen | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306230412/http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-08-01/with-end-of-chinas-one-child-policy-there-hasnt-been-a-baby-boom | archivedate=2016-03-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2015, the ruling Chinese Communist Party announced that all one-child policies would be scrapped, allowing all couples to have two children.  The change was needed to allow a better balance of male and female children, and to grow the young population to ease the problem of paying for the aging population.

===India===
{{Main article|Family planning in India}}
Only those with two or fewer children are eligible for election to a [[gram panchayat]], or local government{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

''We two, our two'' ("Hum do, hamare do" in Hindi) is a slogan meaning ''one family, two children'' and is intended to reinforce the message of family planning thereby aiding population planning.

Facilities offered by government to its employees are limited to two children. The government offers incentives for families accepted for sterilization. Moreover, India was the first country to take measures for family planning back in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}
{{cquote |In the south west of India lies the long narrow coastal state of Kerala. Most of its thirty-two million inhabitants live off the land and the ocean, a rich tropical ecosystem watered by two monsoons a year. It's also one of India's most crowded states – but the population is stable because nearly everybody has small families…  At the root of it all is education. Thanks to a long tradition of compulsory schooling for boys and girls Kerala has one of the highest literacy rates in the World.  Where women are well educated they tend to choose to have smaller families…  What Kerala shows is that you don't need aggressive policies or government incentives for birthrates to fall. Everywhere in the world where women have access to education and have the freedom to run their own lives, on the whole they and their partners have been choosing to have smaller families than their parents.  But reducing birthrates is very difficult to achieve without a simple piece of medical technology, contraception.||[[David Attenborough]]|[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|BBC ''Horizon'']] (2009)|''How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth''}}

{{main article|Population planning in Singapore}}

Singapore has undergone two major phases in its population planning: first to slow and reverse the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] in the [[Post-World War II]] era; then from the 1980s onwards to encourage couples to have more children as the [[birth rate]] had fallen below the [[Sub-replacement fertility|replacement-level fertility]]. In addition, during the [[demographic transition|interim period]], [[eugenics]] policies were adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.populationasia.org/Publications/RP/AMCRP12.pdf | title = Fertility and the Family: An Overview of Pro-natalist Population Policies in Singapore | first1 = Theresa | last1 = Wong | first2 = Brenda S.A | last2 = Yeoh | series = Asian MetaCentre Research Paper Series | date = June 2003 | issue = 12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182245/http://www.populationasia.org/Publications/RP/AMCRP12.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anti-natalist]] policies flourished in the 1960s and 1970s: initiatives advocating small families were launched and developed into the ''Stop at Two'' programme, pushing for two-children families and promoting [[sterilisation (medicine)|sterilisation]].  In 1984, the government announced the ''Graduate Mothers' Scheme'', which favoured children of [[Population Planning in Singapore#The demographic transition and the Graduate Mothers Scheme|more well-educated mothers]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first =Pekka | last = Louhiala |title= Preventing intellectual disability: ethical and clinical issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9bb8grOsEyEC&amp;pg=PA62|year= 2004|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53371-3|page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; the policy was however soon abandoned due to the outcry in the [[Singapore general election, 1984|general election of the same year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quah|first=Jon |title= Singapore in 1984: Leadership Transition in an Election Year |journal=Asian Survey|year=1985|page =225|jstor=2644306 |doi= 10.1525/as.1985.25.2.01p0247v |volume= 25|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually, the government became [[pro-natalist]] in the late 1980s, marked by its ''Have Three or More'' plan in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Singapore: Population Control Policies |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/singapore/society/singapore_society_population_control_p~11008.html |work=Country Studies |year=1989 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=11 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411115633/http://www.photius.com/countries/singapore/society/singapore_society_population_control_p~11008.html |archivedate=11 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore pays $3,000 for the first child, $9,000 in cash and savings for the second; and up to $18,000 each for the third and fourth.&lt;ref name= 'nytimes-russia' /&gt;

===Spain===
In 2017, the government of Spain appointed a "minister for sex", in a pro-natalist attempt to reverse a ''negative'' population growth rate.&lt;ref name='spain-independent'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-sex-tsar-population-crisis-baby-parents-demographic-government-a7599091.html|title=Spain appoints 'sex tsar' in bid to boost declining population|website=The Independent|date=25 February 2017|accessdate=25 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326052733/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-sex-tsar-population-crisis-baby-parents-demographic-government-a7599091.html|archivedate=26 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In May 2012, [[Turkey]]'s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan argued that abortion is murder and announced that legislative preparations to severely limit the practice are underway.  Erdogan also argued that abortion and [[Caesarean section|C-section deliveries]] are plots to stall Turkey's economic growth.  Prior to this move, Erdogan had repeatedly demanded that each couple have at least three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/03/us-turkey-abortion-idUSBRE85207520120603 | publisher = Reuters | date = 2012-06-03 | type = article | title = US, Turkey: abortion | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150102120545/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/03/us-turkey-abortion-idUSBRE85207520120603 | archivedate = 2015-01-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Enacted in 1970, [[Title X]] of the [[Public Health Service Act]] provides access to contraceptive services, supplies and information to those in need.  Priority for services is given to people with low incomes.  The Title X Family Planning program is administered through the [[Office of Population Affairs]] under the Office of Public Health and Science.
It is directed by the [[Office of Population Affairs#Office of Family Planning|Office of Family Planning]].&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;[http://opa.osophs.dhhs.gov/titlex/ofp.html Office of Population Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019032539/http://opa.osophs.dhhs.gov/titlex/ofp.html |date=2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Congress appropriated roughly $283 million for family planning under Title X, at least 90 percent of which was used for services in family planning clinics.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;  Title X is a vital source of funding for family planning clinics throughout the nation,&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/news-articles-press/politics-policy-issues/birth-control-access-prevention/family-planning-6553.htm|title=Newsroom and Media Kit - Planned Parenthood|author=|date=|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208000810/http://www.plannedparenthood.org/news-articles-press/politics-policy-issues/birth-control-access-prevention/family-planning-6553.htm|archivedate=8 December 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provide reproductive health care, including abortion.

The education and services supplied by the Title X-funded clinics support young individuals and low-income families. The goals of developing healthy families are accomplished by helping individuals and couples decide whether to have children and when the appropriate time to do so would be.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Title X has made the prevention of [[unintended pregnancies]] possible.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;  It has allowed millions of American women to receive necessary reproductive health care, plan their pregnancies and prevent abortions. Title X is dedicated exclusively to funding family planning and reproductive health care services.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;

Title X as a percentage of total public funding to family planning client services has steadily declined from 44% of total expenditures in 1980 to 12% in 2006. Medicaid has increased from 20% to 71% in the same time. In 2006, Medicaid contributed $1.3 billion to public family planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Sonfield | first1 = Adam | last2 = Alrich | first2 = Casey | last3 = Gold | first3 = Rachel Benson | title = Public Funding for Family Planning, Sterilization and Abortion Services, FY 1980–2006 | url = https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/2008/01/28/or38.pdf | series = Occasional Report | place = New York | publisher = Guttmacher Institute | year = 2008 | number = 38 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910082729/https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/2008/01/28/or38.pdf | archivedate = 2017-09-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natalism in the United States====
In a 2004 [[editorial]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] expressed the opinion that the relatively high birthrate of the United States in comparison to Europe could be attributed to social groups with "natalist" attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/opinion/07brooks.html?ex=1260162000&amp;en=ebdde83f03fe6d2e&amp;ei=5090 | title = The New Red-Diaper Babies | first = David | last = Brooks | newspaper = The New York Times | accessdate = 21 Jan 2006 | date = 2004-12-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311175027/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/opinion/07brooks.html?ex=1260162000&amp;en=ebdde83f03fe6d2e&amp;ei=5090 | archivedate = 2007-03-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The article is referred to in an analysis of the [[Quiverfull]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war | newspaper = The Nation | date = 27 November 2006 | first = Kathryn | last = Joyce | title = 'Arrows for the War' | accessdate = 10 March 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150320060132/http://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war | archivedate = 20 March 2015 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the figures identified for the demographic are extremely low.

Former US Senator [[Rick Santorum]] made natalism part of his platform for his [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2012|2012 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="santorum"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/01/santorum-more-babies-please-110897.html |first= Seung Min |last= Kim |website= Politico |date= 15 January 2012 |title= Santorum: More babies, please! |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118215636/http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/01/santorum-more-babies-please-110897.html |archivedate= 18 January 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not an isolated case.  Many of those categorized in the General Social Survey as "Fundamentalist Protestant" are more or less natalist, and have a higher birth rate than "Moderate" and "Liberal" Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.15countries40-6385.2010.00517.x/abstract|title= Modern Protestant Natalism | journal = Dialog | year = 2010 | publisher = Wiley | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6385.2010.00517.x | volume= 49 |issue= 2 | pages=133–40|last1= McKeown |first1= John }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Rick Santorum is not a Protestant but a practicing Catholic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4693">The '''intention economy''' is an approach to viewing [[markets]] and [[economies]] focusing on buyers as a [[scarcity|scarce]] commodity. The consumers' intent to buy drives the production of goods to meet their specific needs. It is also the title of [[Doc Searls]] book: ''[[The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge]]'' published in May, 2012.

==Concept==
[[Doc Searls]] coined the term in an article for [[Linux Journal]].  He wrote:&lt;br /&gt;
"The Intention Economy grows around buyers, not sellers. It leverages the simple fact that buyers are the first source of money, and that they come ready-made. You don't need advertising to make them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Doc | last=Searls | coauthors= | title=The Intention Economy | date=2006-03-08 | publisher= | url =http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000035 | work =Linux Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the advancement of the internet businesses are still seller oriented. Even successful businesses like [[Google]] still have the point of view of the sellers, with their revenue coming nearly all from advertising. Searls describes the current condition as a series of silos. The only option a buyer has is merely moving from silo to silo. Nothing has fundamentally changed.&lt;ref&gt;''idem''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sites have similar characteristics of an intention economy. For example, flight booking services [[Priceline.com]], which let users name their price for an airline ticket still functions like a "silo."  In an intention economy a site like Priceline might serve as an intermediary with the airline coordinating new flight dates and times that correspond around the buyers intentions.

Companies need to be able to respond to a customer's precise needs. "[[Mass customization]], in a lot of areas it is no longer inherently necessary that I get the exact same thing as a million other people. A computer manufacturer can be geared for assembling a computer just for me, to my specifications. A travel agency can construct a travel plan particularly for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Crowd Clout | date=April 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/crowdclout.htm | work =[[Trendwatching.com]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Searls gives an example of intention economy scenario: "A car rental customer should be able to say to the car rental market, 'I'll be skiing in Park City from March 20–25. I want to rent a 4-wheel drive SUV. I belong to Avis Wizard, Budget FastBreak and Hertz 1 Club. I don't want to pay up front for gas or get any insurance. What can any of you companies do for me?' — and have the sellers compete for the buyer's business."

[[Jody Turner|Trendwatching.com]] describes two problems with intention economy sites. "...Most of these ‘information brokers’ focus on only one product/category. Many of them also work (too) closely with a limited set of suppliers. Sites that seem to act like intention economy sites are not. For example, [[Priceline.com|Priceline]] which lets customers name their own price and then matches it with the (pre-set) minimum prices that airlines, hotels and rental car companies have provided [[Priceline.com]] with this space remains wide open for intention-brokers who can handle a variety of intentions per customer, and genuinely operate on behalf of those customers." {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Trendwatching]] lists examples of intention economy sites currently online:
*[[Igglo]] lets potential buyers bid on houses that aren't on the market.
*[[Zillow]] lets home owners name their "Make Me Move" before putting their house on the market.
*[[Eventful]] allows users to collectively persuade performers to come to their town.
*[[SellaBand]] allows users to collectively sponsor and help manage a band for a cut of the revenue.
*[http://www.kleemi.com Kleemi] allows members to create list of intentions that friends and vendors can; comment, review, or make offers on.
*[[Infinite Buyer]] allows registered consumers to make their offer on seller listings; benefit to consumers is that they can buy what they want (relevant), at their price (personal), when they need it (efficient)
*[http://intently.co Intently.co] allows users to request any service anywhere.

== Early life ==
Jaggayya was born to Kongara Seetaramaih and Rajya Lakshmamma. He was born in a well-to-do family in Morampudi village near [[Tenali]] in [[Guntur district]]. He quoted on several occasions in his essays the influence his father had on his interest towards arts. He started acting at the age of 11, with the role of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] in a [[Hindi]] play during his high school days in [[Duggirala]]. He got trained in the art of painting under the guidance of [[Adivi Bapiraju]], a noted painter, during his college days. 

As a student, he joined the [[Congress Socialist Party|Congress Socialist party]] in Tenali, which was involved in the [[Indian Independence Movement]] at that time. 

He joined the [[Andhra-Christian College]], in 1942, in [[Guntur]] for his higher studies. He used to be a member of Navya Sahitya Parishath in Guntur. Later he joined a periodical named ''Desabhimani'' (meaning "Patriot") as a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmchamber.com/tmpl.asp?it=prfbjagaya&lt;/ref&gt;Later he worked as an editor for the weekly Andhra Republic. During his B.A. days in A-C College, he along with [[N. T. Rama Rao]], acted in several plays. He also used to be a part of Navajyothi Artists, a cultural organisation run by [[Mukkamala]].

== Film career ==
He made his cinematic debut in 1952 drama film ''Priyuralu'' directed by [[Tripuraneni Gopichand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apherald.com/Movies/ViewArticle/3671|title=Rutherford of Telugu cinema|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movie was produced by Donepudi Krishnamurthy, also known popularly as Gokul Krishnamurthy. He quit the job as news announcer as he signed three movies on a trot. His second movie, ''Adarsham,'' didn't do well at box office. His planned third movie ''Paleru'' did not even see light of the day. 

''[[Bangaru Papa]],'' directed by [[Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy|B N Reddy]], released in 1955, was the first breakthrough film for Jaggayya. He was distinguished for his booming voice and contributed as a voice artist for more than hundred feature films. He dubbed in Telugu language for veteran [[Sivaji Ganesan]].

Rajendra Prasad|VB Rajendra Parasad]]'s ''Jagapathi Pictures,''  [[K. B. Tilak|K B Tilak]]'s ''Anupama Pictures'' and ''Ramavijeta Films'' owned by brothers Prabhakar and Baburao.  His last film as an actor was ''Kunthi Putrudu,'' which starred [[Mohan Babu]] as lead and was directed by [[Dasari Narayana Rao]].

He turned into producer with a film ''[[Padandi Munduku]],'' under the banner of ''Jagruthi Chitra.'' The film was released in January 1962 and was a regarded as first Telugu social film made on the basis of Indian Independence movement. 

He was awarded the 'Kala Vachaspathi' for his sonorous voice.&lt;ref&gt;earlytollywood.blogspot.in/2008/02/kongara-jaggaiah.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Jaggayya was active in politics right from his student days and was allied with the socialist group within the Congress party.

In 1967, he was elected as a member of the fourth [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the [[Parliament of India]] from the constituency of [[Ongole]] on a Congress Party ticket. He was the first Indian film actor to be elected as a member of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;tollywood.info/actor/k/kongara_jaggayya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite [[North Korea–South Korea relations|tense relations]], North Korea agreed to [[North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics|participate]] in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang]]. Following the Olympics, Kim Jong-un and [[President of South Korea|President]] [[Moon Jae-in]] conducted the [[April 2018 inter-Korean summit]]. It was the first time since the end of the [[Korean War]] in 1953 that a North Korean leader entered the South's territory. On 12 June 2018, Kim Jong-un and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Donald Trump]] met for the [[2018 North Korea–United States summit]] in [[Singapore]], the first-ever talks held between a North Korean leader and a sitting US President, to discuss the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korean nuclear program]].

== Early life==
[[File:Schule Liebefeld-Steinhölzli, Köniz.jpg|thumb|left|The Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in [[Köniz]], [[Switzerland]], which Kim Jong-un is reported to have attended.]]
Scarce information on Kim Jong-un's early life comes from [[North Korean defectors]] and people who have claimed to witness him abroad, such as during his school attendance in [[Switzerland]]. Some of the information has been conflicting and contradictory, perhaps confusing him with his brother, [[Kim Jong-chul]], who also attended school in Switzerland around the same time.

North Korean authorities and state-run media have stated that Kim's birthdate was 8 January 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everything you need to know about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korean-leader-kim-jong/story?id=46804057 |accessdate=2018-06-15 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; but South Korean intelligence officials believe the actual date is a year later.&lt;ref name=NYTRodman/&gt; It is thought that Kim's official birth year was changed for symbolic reasons; 1982 marks 70 years after the birth of his grandfather, [[Kim Il-sung]], and 40 years after the official birth of his father [[Kim Jong-il]]. The [[US Treasury Department]] lists Kim Jong-un's official birthdate as 8 January 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Szoldra |first1=Paul |last2=Bondranenko |first2=Veronika |title=How North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, 33, became one of the world's scariest dictators |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/how-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-33-became-one-of-the-worlds-scariest-dictators-a7691396.html |accessdate=2018-06-15 |work=The Independent |date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former basketball star [[Dennis Rodman]] said that this was Kim's birthdate after meeting in September 2013 in North Korea.&lt;ref name=NYTRodman/&gt;

Authorities of Köniz confirmed that a student from North Korea, registered as the son of a member of the embassy, attended the school from August 1998 until the autumn of 2000, but were unable to give details about his identity. Pak-un first attended a special class for foreign-language children and later attended the regular classes of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and part of the final 9th year, leaving the school abruptly in the autumn of 2000.

In April 2012, new documents came to light indicating that Kim Jong-un had lived in Switzerland since 1991 or 1992, earlier than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/kim-jongun-reste-neuf-ans-suisse/story/20273993 |title=Kim Jong-un est resté neuf ans en Suisse |author=Titus Plattner |accessdate=24 April 2012 |date=21 April 2012 |work=Le Matin |language=French |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823194510/http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/kim-jongun-reste-neuf-ans-suisse/story/20273993 |archivedate=23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laboratory of Anatomic Anthropology at the [[University of Lyon]], France, after comparing the picture of the boy Pak-un taken at the Liebefeld Steinhölzli school in 1999 with a picture of Kim Jong-un from 2012 came to the conclusion that the two faces show a conformity of 95%. The head of the institute, Raoul Perrot, a forensic anthropologist, considers it most likely that the two pictures show the same person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Titus Plattner |author2=Daniel Glaus |author3=Julian Schmidli |url=http://www.sonntagszeitung.ch/fokus/artikel-detailseite/?newsid=212533 |title=Der Diktator aus Liebefeld |work=[[SonntagsZeitung]] |date=1 April 2012 |page=17 |language=German |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66cIlKe2M?url=http://www.sonntagszeitung.ch/fokus/artikel-detailseite/?newsid=212533 |archivedate= 2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;br/&gt;"Der Schüler Un Pak ist identisch mit Kim Jong-un."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the student at the Gümligen International School may not have been Kim Jong-un, but his elder brother Kim Jong-chul. It is not known whether the student known as Pak-un in Liebefeld Steinhölzli lived in Switzerland prior to 1998.&lt;ref name="Plattner2009"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Der Diktator spricht Deutsch |first1=Titus |last1=Plattner |first2=Julie |last2=Zaugg |date=8 May 2009 |work=Cicero |url=http://www.cicero.de/weltbühne/der-diktator-spricht-deutsch/39681 |language=de |archive-date=30 September 2015 |issn=1613-4826 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930081816/http://www.cicero.de/weltb%C3%BChne/der-diktator-spricht-deutsch/39681 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the children of Kim Jong-il are said to have lived in Switzerland, as well as the mother of the two youngest sons, who lived in [[Geneva]] for some time.&lt;ref name="Figaro" /&gt;

In late February 2018, Reuters reported that Kim and his father had used forged passports—supposedly issued by [[Brazil]] and dated 26 February 1996—to apply for visas in various countries. Both 10-year passports carry a stamp saying "Embassy of Brazil in Prague".

Kim Jong-il's personal chef [[Kenji Fujimoto]] stated, "Stores in Pyongyang were brimming with products and people in the streets looked cheerful.

[[File:Kim Jong Il Books (33012753981).jpg|thumb|upright|A selection of [[Kim Jong-un's works]]]]
Officially, Kim Jong-un is part of a [[triumvirate]] heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier [[Pak Pong-ju]] and parliament chairman [[Kim Yong-nam]] (no relation). Each nominally holds powers equivalent to a third of a president's powers in most presidential systems. Kim Jong-un commands the armed forces, Pak Pong-ju heads the government, and Kim Yong-nam handles foreign relations. Nevertheless, it is generally understood that Kim Jong-un, like his father and grandfather before him, exercises absolute control over the government and the country.  Indeed, a constitutional amendment enacted by his father explicitly named the NDC (first) chairman as "the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea".&lt;ref name="leon_DPRK"&gt;{{cite web|title=DPRK has quietly amended its Constitution |last=Petrov |first=Leonid |work=Leonid Petrov's KOREA VISION |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2015 |url=https://leonidpetrov.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/dprk-has-quietly-amended-its-constitution/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015037/https://leonidpetrov.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/dprk-has-quietly-amended-its-constitution/ |archivedate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|others=Amended and supplemented on 1 April, Juche 102 (2013), at the Seventh Session of the Twelfth Supreme People's Assembly |title=Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea |url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047 |year=2014 |format=PDF |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |location=Pyongyang |isbn=978-9946-0-1099-1 |page=22 |chapter=Article 100 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608030306/http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?4+4047 |archivedate=8 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2012, Kim met with [[Li Jianguo]], who "briefed Kim on the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th National Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of China]]", according to the state's official news agency, the [[Korean Central News Agency]].&lt;ref name="letter Dec 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Jong-un Gets Letter from China's New Leader |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/12/03/2012120301309.html |publisher=Chosun.com |accessdate=6 December 2012 |date=3 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206041056/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/12/03/2012120301309.html |archivedate=6 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], was hand-delivered during the discussion.&lt;ref name="letter Dec 3" /&gt;

In May 2014, following the collapse of an apartment building in Pyongyang, Kim Jong-un was said to be very upset at the loss of life that resulted. A statement issued by the country's official news agency the [[Korean Central News Agency]] used the rare expression "profound consolation and apology".

=== Economic policies ===
A set of comprehensive economic measures, the "Socialist Corporate Responsible Management System", were introduced in 2013.&lt;ref name="IFES1" /&gt; The measures increase the autonomy of enterprises by granting them "certain rights to engage in business activities autonomously and elevate the will to labor through appropriately implementing the socialist distribution system". Another priority of economic policies that year was agriculture, where the ''pojon'' (vegetable garden) responsibility system was implemented. The system reportedly achieved a major increase in output in some collective farms.&lt;ref name="IFES1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150224_0001 |title="Socialist Enterprise Management System" under Full Implementation |publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies |date=24 February 2015 |accessdate=28 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702134340/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150224_0001 |archivedate=2 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
North Korean media were describing the economy as a "flexible collectivist system" where enterprises were applying "active and evolutionary actions" to achieve economic development.&lt;ref name="IFES2" /&gt; These reports reflect Kim's general economic policy of reforming management, increasing the autonomy and incentives for economic actors. This set of reforms known as the "May 30th measures" reaffirms both socialist ownership and "objective economic laws in guidance and management" to improve living standards. Other objectives of the measures are to increase the availability of domestically manufactured goods on markets, introduction of defence innovations into the civilian sector and boost international trade.&lt;ref name="IFES2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150115_0001 |title=Kim Jong Un Stresses the Principles of Market Economy through 'May 30th Measures' |publisher=Institute for Far Eastern Studies |date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=28 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702103857/http://ifes.kyungnam.ac.kr/eng/FRM/FRM_0101V.aspx?code=FRM150115_0001 |archivedate=2 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unha-9 rocket model.jpg|thumb|left|Model of a [[Unha]]-9 rocket on display at a floral exhibition in Pyongyang, 30 August 2013]]
Under Kim Jong-un, North Korea has continued to develop nuclear weapons. At a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party held on 31 March 2013, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea will adopt "a new strategic line on carrying out economic construction and building nuclear armed forces simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Plenary Meeting of WPK Central Committee |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201303/news31/20130331-24ee.html |publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency]] |archive-date= 3 April 2015 |date=31 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403171327/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201303/news31/20130331-24ee.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several analysts, North Korea sees the nuclear arsenal as vital to deter an attack, and it is unlikely that North Korea would launch a nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/north-korea-nuclear-bomb-war-south-atomic-ballistic-missile-test-a7578016.html |title=Should we really be so afraid of a nuclear North Korea? |first1=Markus |last1=Bell |first2=Marco |last2=Milani |work=The Independent |date=16 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216012421/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/north-korea-nuclear-bomb-war-south-atomic-ballistic-missile-test-a7578016.html |archivedate=16 February 2017 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fpif.org/north-koreas-nuclear-ticket-survival/ |title=North Korea's Nuclear Ticket to Survival |first=Edward |last=Hunt |publisher=Foreign Policy in Focus |date=31 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325112931/http://fpif.org/north-koreas-nuclear-ticket-survival/ |archivedate=25 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[RAND Corporation]] senior researcher, Kim Jong-un believes that nuclear weapons are his guarantee of regime survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-koreas-military-capabilities|title=What's the Status of North Korea's Nuclear Program?|author=|date=|website=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 7th [[Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea]] in 2016, Kim Jong-un stated that North Korea would "not use nuclear weapons first unless aggressive hostile forces use nuclear weapons to invade on our sovereignty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/north-korea-party-give-kim-jong-title-38948654 |title=Kim Jong Un Says Pyongyang Won't Use Nukes First; Associated Press |publisher=ABC |date=7 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508122147/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/north-korea-party-give-kim-jong-title-38948654 |archivedate=8 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on other occasions, North Korea has threatened [[Preemptive war|"pre-emptive" nuclear attacks]] against a US-led attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/06/asia/north-korea-preemptive-nuclear-strike-threat/ |title=North Korea threatens nuclear strike over U.S.-South Korean |publisher=CNN |date=7 March 2016 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524135322/http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/06/asia/north-korea-preemptive-nuclear-strike-threat/ |archivedate=24 May 2016 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/07/17220065-un-passes-sanctions-despite-north-korea-threat-of-pre-emptive-nuclear-attack |title=UN passes sanctions despite North Korea threat of 'pre-emptive nuclear attack' |publisher=NBC News |date=7 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309191714/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/07/17220065-un-passes-sanctions-despite-north-korea-threat-of-pre-emptive-nuclear-attack |archivedate=9 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Kim stated that his family "turned the DPRK into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation".&lt;ref name="Kim has H-bomb?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Jong-Un claims North Korea has a hydrogen bomb |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/12/10/kim-jong-un-claims-north-korea-has-hydrogen-bomb/ |publisher=Fox News Channel |accessdate=11 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213060907/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/12/10/kim-jong-un-claims-north-korea-has-hydrogen-bomb/ |archivedate=13 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Kim Jong-un showed a change in cultural policy from his father by attending a [[Moranbong Band]] concert. The concert contained several elements of pop culture from [[Western culture|the West]], particularly the United States. Kim used this event to debut his wife to the public, an unprecedented move in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Lankov, Andrei (10 April 2013).

During Dennis Rodman's trip, ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine correspondent [[Ryan Duffy (correspondent)|Ryan Duffy]] observed that "the leader was 'socially awkward' and didn't make eye contact when shaking hands".&lt;ref name="Vice 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/vice-tracks-rodman-strange-days-north-korea-article-1.1357860 |title='Vice' season finale on HBO gives fresh look at Dennis Rodman's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-un |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2013 |last=Silverman |first=Justin Rocket |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608052205/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/vice-tracks-rodman-strange-days-north-korea-article-1.1357860 |archivedate=8 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cheong Seong-chang of the [[Sejong Institute]], Kim Jong-un has greater visible interest in the welfare of his people and engages in greater interaction with them than his father did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N.K. leader seen moving toward economic reform |url=http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.php?ud=20120627001074 |accessdate=28 June 2012 |newspaper=The Korea Herald |date=27 June 2012 |author=Song Sang-ho |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703021456/http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.php?ud=20120627001074 |archivedate=3 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Koreans who saw Kim at the summit in April 2018 described him as straightforward, humorous, and attentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/kim-jong-un-uncensored-what-does-footage-say-about-personality-of-reclusive-leader|title=Kim Jong Un uncensored: 7 impressions gleaned from historic summit|publisher=Straits Times|date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting him, Donald Trump said,  "I learned he was a talented man.

'''Kluet''' or '''Kluwat''' people dwell in a number of districts in [[South Aceh Regency]], [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]] namely North Kluet, South Kluet, Central Kluet and East Kluet. The Kluet people are regarded as part of the [[Batak people]] sub-ethnicity. The Kluet regions are separated by Lawé Kluet River, where it disgorges from the [[Mount Leuser]] and disembogues into the [[Indian Ocean]]. Residential region of the Kluet people is 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tapaktuan]] city or 500&amp;nbsp;km from [[Banda Aceh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ryan Ver Berkmoes |author2=Celeste Brash |author3=Muhammad Cohen |author4=Mark Elliott |author5=Guyan Mitra |author6=John Noble |author7=Adam Skolnick |author8=Iain Stewart |author9=Steve Waters |title=Lonely Planet Indonesia|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=1-7422-0348-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of the population and as well as the Kluet people practices [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lesley McCulloch|title=Aceh: Then And Now|year=2005|publisher=Minority Rights Group International|isbn=1-9045-8428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language spoken by the Kluet people is [[Alas-Kluet language]], which is categorized as part of the [[Batak languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara F. Grimes |author2=Joseph Evans Grimes |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the world, Volume 1 of Ethnologue, Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=2000|publisher=SIL International|isbn=1-5567-1103-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kluet language itself is divided into three dialects, which are the Paya Dapur, Manggamat and Lawe Sawah dialect.

During the colonial period, the [[Acehnese people]] are known to have had political influence on the coastal area that became known as Kluet kingdom. Therefore, the [[Acehnese people]] also had cultural influence in the culture of the Kluet people to a certain degree, where the ''adat'' (customary) authority structure of the Kluet people are historically similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Fitzgerald McCarthy|title=The Fourth Circle: A Political Ecology of Sumatra's Rainforest Frontier|year=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-5212-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming is the main source of income for the Kluet people.

Just like any other [[Batak people]], the Kluet people have [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] (surnames or family names) of their own that are still being used today:-
* Pelis
* Selian
* Bencawan
* Pinem
* Caniago

These [[Marga (Batak)|margas]] are also found among other [[Batak people]] such as [[Alas people]], [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo people]] and [[Pakpak people]]; except for Caniago which are believed to be the descendants of [[Minangkabau people]] that have assimilated with the Kluet people centuries ago.

The official [[language]] of the [[Faroe Islands]] is [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. The Faroese language is a [[Germanic language]] which is descended from [[Old Norse]].

Faroese is similar in grammar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], but closer in pronunciation to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. In the twentieth century Faroese became the official language and, because the Faroe Islands are a self-governing country within the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], [[Danish language|Danish]] is taught in Faroese schools.

The first recorded settlers of the Faroe Islands were Irish monks ([[papar]]), so it is possible to assume, that one of the first languages in the islands was some form of [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. Neighbouring [[Shetland]] was inhabited from the [[Stone Age]], and was [[Pictish language|Pictish]] speaking when the Norse arrived.

Norse settlers arrived in the middle of the 9th century, bringing their [[Old Norse#Old West Norse|West Norse language]] (from which the Faroese language evolved).

Other groups are known to have lived in the Faroes as well. These include Norwegian peoples, and this is evident in certain Faroese places names, such as [[Signabøur]] (Bø of 'Sygnir') and [[Øravík]] (bay of 'Hörðir'). People from [[Suðuroy]] also refer to 'Frísarnir í Akrabergi' (The [[Frisians]] of [[Akraberg]]).

[[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] are sometimes used for the purposes of tourism. Norwegian is occasionally heard too, due to the islands' geographical proximity to Norway.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

'''Maasai'''  are a [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic group inhabiting central and southern [[Kenya]] and northern [[Tanzania]]. They are among the best known local populations due to their residence near the many game parks of the [[African Great Lakes]], and their distinctive customs and dress.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/maasai/ Maasai - Introduction] Jens Fincke, 2000–2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Maasai speak the [[Maasai language|Maa]] language (ɔl Maa),&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; a member of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family that is related to [[Dinka language|Dinka]] and [[Nuer language|Nuer languages]]. Some have become educated in the official languages of Kenya and Tanzania, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[English language|English]]. The Maasai population has been reported as numbering 841,622 in Kenya in the 2009 census,&lt;ref name="Kenya2009Census"/&gt; compared to 377,089 in the 1989 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kenya.rcbowen.com/people/population.html Kenya - Population Distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanzanian and Kenyan governments have instituted programs to encourage the Maasai to abandon their traditional semi-[[nomad]]ic lifestyle, but the people have continued their age-old customs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''. Mohamed Amin, Duncan Willetts, John Eames. 1987. Page 122. Camerapix Publishers International. {{ISBN|1-874041-32-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Oxfam]] study has suggested that the Maasai could pass on traditional survival skills such as the ability to produce food in deserts and scrublands that could help populations adapt to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7568695.stm | title = Maasai 'can fight climate change' | date = 18 August 2008 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Maasai tribes throughout Tanzania and Kenya welcome visits to their villages to experience their culture, traditions, and lifestyle, in return for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climbkili.com/safari-etc/climb-kili-safaris/masai-tribes/ Visiting a Maasai Village &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511002536/http://www.climbkili.com/safari-etc/climb-kili-safaris/masai-tribes/ |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Maasai speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]]. They inhabit the [[African Great Lakes]] region and arrived via the [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Okothndaloh"&gt;A. Okoth &amp; A. Ndaloh, ''Peak Revision K.C.P.E. Social Studies'', East African, p.60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]] speakers in the area, including the Maasai, the Turkana and the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]], are [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]], and are famous for their fearsome reputations as warriors and cattle-rustlers.&lt;ref name="Okothndaloh"/&gt; The Maasai and other groups in [[East Africa]] have adopted customs and practices from neighboring [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic-speaking]] groups, including the [[age set]] system of social organization, [[circumcision]], and vocabulary terms.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;Robert O. Collins, ''The southern Sudan in historical perspective'', (Transaction Publishers: 2006), p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wandi"&gt;S. Wandibba et al., p.19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin, migration and assimilation===
[[File:Maasai man, Eastern Serengeti, October 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Maasai man]]
According to their [[oral history]], the Maasai originated from the lower Nile valley north of [[Lake Turkana]] (Northwest Kenya) and began migrating south around the 15th century, arriving in a long trunk of land stretching from what is now northern Kenya to what is now central Tanzania between the 17th and late 18th century. Many ethnic groups that had already formed settlements in the region were forcibly displaced by the incoming Maasai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maasaieducation.org/maasai-culture/maasai-history.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606081652/http://www.maasaieducation.org/maasai-culture/maasai-history.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-06 |title=Maasai Education Discovery |publisher=Maasaieducation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other, mainly Southern Cushitic groups, were assimilated into Maasai society. The Nilotic ancestors of the Kalenjin likewise absorbed some early Cushitic populations.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Office, ''Traditional occupations of indigenous and tribal peoples: emerging trends'', (International Labour Organization: 2000), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement in East Africa===
The Maasai territory reached its largest size in the mid-[[19th century]], and covered almost all of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] and adjacent lands from [[Mount Marsabit]] in the north to [[Dodoma]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Tanzania with Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar'' by Phillip Briggs 2006 page 200 {{ISBN|1-84162-146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the Maasai, as well as the larger Nilotic group they were part of, raised cattle as far east as the [[Tanga Region|Tanga coast]] in Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania). Raiders used spears and shields, but were most feared for throwing clubs (orinka) which could be accurately thrown from up to 70 [[Pace (unit of length)|paces]] (appx. 100 metres). In 1852, there was a report of a concentration of 800 Maasai warriors on the move in what is now Kenya. In 1857, after having depopulated the "Wakuafi wilderness" in what is now southeastern Kenya, Maasai warriors threatened [[Mombasa]] on the Kenyan coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQJjYC74tu8C&amp;pg=PA183 |title=Sources and methods in African history: spoken, written, unearthed - Toyin Falola - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed'' by Toyin Falola, Christian Jennings (2003), page 18 2. Boydell &amp; Brewer. {{ISBN|1-58046-134-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0556, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Massaikrieger.jpg|thumb|Maasai warriors in [[German East Africa]], c. 1906–1918]]

Because of this migration, the Maasai are the southernmost Nilotic speakers. The period of expansion was followed by the Maasai "Emutai" of 1883–1902. This period was marked by epidemics of [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]], [[rinderpest]] (see [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic]]), and [[smallpox]]. The estimate first put forward by a German lieutenant in what was then northwest [[Tanganyika]], was that 90 percent of cattle and half of wild animals perished from rinderpest. German doctors in the same area claimed that "every second" African had a pock-marked face as the result of smallpox. This period coincided with drought. Rains failed completely in 1897 and 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ecology/news/news.asp?id=192 |title=Ecology Books and Journals |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003192715/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ecology/news/news.asp?id=192 |archivedate=2012-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austria]]n explorer [[Oscar Baumann]] travelled in Maasai lands between 1891 and 1893, and described the old Maasai settlement in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area|Ngorongoro Crater]] in the 1894 book ''Durch Massailand zur Nilquelle'' ("Through the lands of the Maasai to the source of the Nile"): "There were women wasted to skeletons from whose eyes the madness of starvation glared ... warriors scarcely able to crawl on all fours, and apathetic, languishing elders. Swarms of vultures followed them from high, awaiting their certain victims." By one estimate two-thirds of the Maasai died during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntz.info/gen/n00526.html |title=Rinderpest |publisher=Ntz.info |date=1997-02-14 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with a 1904 treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,699336,00.html|title=The Land Is Ours | work=Time | first=Stephan|last=Faris|date=19 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed by another in 1911, Maasai lands in Kenya were reduced by 60 percent when the British evicted them to make room for settler ranches, subsequently confining them to present-day Samburu,Laikipia,Kajiado and Narok districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitumusote |url=http://www.kitumusote.org/history |title=History of the Maasai |publisher=Kitumusote |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maasai in Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania) were displaced from the fertile lands between [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]] and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and most of the fertile highlands near Ngorongoro in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Myth of Wild Africa: Conservation Without Illusion''. Jonathan S. Adams, Thomas O. McShane. 1996. University of California Press. page = 44. {{ISBN|0-520-20671-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWtWDN0BWt0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=maasai+ears&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7u768brgsE&amp;sig=q8PlaGC5C_ot35-PeLPJYlFDhxQ#PPA44,M1 |title=The myth of wild Africa: conservation without illusion - Jonathan S. Adams, Thomas O. McShane - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; More land was taken to create wildlife reserves and national parks: [[Amboseli National Park]], [[Nairobi National Park]], [[Maasai Mara]], [[Samburu National Reserve]], [[Lake Nakuru#Lake Nakuru National Park|Lake Nakuru National Park]] and [[Tsavo]] in Kenya; and [[Lake Manyara]], Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tarangire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanzaniaparks.com/tarangire.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814101508/http://www.tanzaniaparks.com/tarangire.htm |archivedate=2007-08-14 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-08-14 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Serengeti National Park]] in what is now Tanzania.

Maasai are pastoralist and have resisted the urging of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. They have demanded grazing rights to many of the national parks in both countries.

The Maasai people stood against slavery and lived alongside most wild animals with an aversion to eating game and birds. Maasai land now has East Africa's finest game areas. Maasai society never condoned traffic of human beings, and outsiders looking for people to enslave avoided the Maasai.&lt;ref&gt;''Africa's Great Rift Valley''. Nigel Pavitt. 2001. Page 122. Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated, New York {{ISBN|0-8109-0602-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially there are twenty two geographic sectors or sub tribes of the Maasai community, each one having its own customs, appearance, leadership and dialects. These subdivisions are known as 'nations' or' iloshon'in the Maa language: the Keekonyokie, Damat, Purko, Wuasinkishu, Siria, Laitayiok, Loitai, Kisonko, Matapato, Dalalekutuk, Loodokolani ,Kaputiei,Moitanik,Ilkirasha,[[Samburu people|Samburu]],Lchamus,Laikipia,Loitokitoki,Larusa,Salei,Sirinket and Parakuyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laleyio.com/facts.html |title=archived copy of laleyio.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212003604/http://www.laleyio.com/facts.html |archivedate=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Maasai people. [[Genetic genealogy]], a tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Maasai.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Autosomal DNA===
The Maasai's [[autosome|autosomal]] [[DNA]] has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic affiliations of various populations in Africa. According to the study's authors, the Maasai "have maintained their culture in the face of extensive genetic introgression".&lt;ref name="Tishkoff2009"&gt;{{Citation |first1=Sarah A. |last1=Tishkoff |first2=Floyd A. |last2=Reed |first3=Françoise R. |last3=Friedlaender |first4=Christopher |last4=Ehret |first5=Alessia |last5=Ranciaro |first6=Alain |last6=Froment |first7=Jibril B. |last7=Hirbo |first8=Agnes A. |last8=Awomoyi |first9=Jean-Marie |last9=Bodo |first10=Ogobara |last10=Doumbo |first11=Muntaser |last11=Ibrahim |first12=Abdalla T. |last12=Juma |first13=Maritha J. |last13=Kotze |first14=Godfrey |last14=Lema |first15=Jason H. |last15=Moore |first16=Holly |last16=Mortensen |first17=Thomas B. |last17=Nyambo |first18=Sabah A. |last18=Omar |first19=Kweli |last19=Powell |first20=Gideon S. |last20=Pretorius |first21=Michael W. |last21=Smith |first22=Mahamadou A. |last22=Thera |first23=Charles |last23=Wambebe |first24=James L. |last24=Weber |first25=Scott M. |last25=Williams | title = The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans | journal = Science | year = 2009 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1172257 | doi=10.1126/science.1172257 | pmid=19407144 | pmc=2947357 | volume=324 | pages=1035–44}} Also see [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/1172257/DC1 Supplementary Data].&lt;/ref&gt; Tishkoff et al. also indicate that: "Many Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations in East Africa, such as the Maasai, show multiple cluster assignments from the Nilo-Saharan [...] and Cushitic [...] AACs, in accord with linguistic evidence of repeated [[Nilotic]] assimilation of [[Cushitic languages|Cushites]] over the past 3000 years and with the high frequency of a shared East African–specific mutation associated with lactose tolerance."&lt;ref name="Tishkoff2009"/&gt;

===Y-DNA===
A [[Y chromosome]] study by Wood et al. (2005) tested various Sub-Saharan populations, including 26 Maasai males from Kenya, for paternal lineages. The authors observed haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] in 50% of the studied Maasai,&lt;ref name="Wood2005"&gt;Elizabeth T Wood, Daryn A Stover, Christopher Ehret ''et al.'', "[https://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/WoodEJHG2005.pdf Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex-biased demographic processes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227061248/http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/WoodEJHG2005.pdf |date=2010-12-27 }}", ''European Journal of Human Genetics'' (2005) 13, 867–876.

The third most frequently observed paternal DNA marker in the Maasai was [[haplogroup E-V38]] (E-P1), which is very common in the Sub-Saharan region; it was found in 12% of the Maasai samples. [[Haplogroup B-M60]] was also observed in 8% of the studied Maasai,&lt;ref name = "Wood2005"/&gt; which is also found in 30% (16/53) of Southern Sudanese Nilotes.&lt;ref name="Hassan"/&gt;

===Mitochondrial DNA===
According to an [[mtDNA]] study by Castri et al. (2008), which tested Maasai individuals in Kenya, the maternal lineages found among the Maasai are quite diverse, but similar in overall frequency to that observed in other Nilo-Hamitic populations from the region, such as the [[Samburu people|Samburu]]. Most of the tested Maasai belonged to various [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|macro-haplogroup L]] sub-clades, including [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]], [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]], [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]], [[Haplogroup L4 (mtDNA)|L4]] and [[Haplogroup L5 (mtDNA)|L5]]. Some maternal gene flow from [[North Africa|North]] and Northeast Africa was also reported, particularly via the presence of mtDNA [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]] lineages in about 12.5% of the Maasai samples.&lt;ref name="Castrí"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kenyan crossroads: migration and gene flow in six ethnic groups from Eastern Africa.|year= 2008|last=Castrí|pmid=19934476|url=http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/2008%20vol86/12_Castri.pdf|volume=86|pages=189–92|journal=J Anthropol Sci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maasai society is strongly [[patriarchal]] in nature, with elder men, sometimes joined by retired elders, deciding most major matters for each Maasai group. A full body of [[oral law]] covers many aspects of behavior. Formal [[execution]] is unknown, and normally payment in cattle will settle matters. An out-of-court process is also practiced called 'amitu', 'to make peace', or 'arop', which involves a substantial apology.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''.

Traditional Maasai [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] centres around their [[cattle]] which constitute their primary source of food. The measure of a man's wealth is in terms of cattle and children. A herd of 50 cattle is respectable, and the more children the better. A man who has plenty of one but not the other is considered to be poor.&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Tanzania with Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar'' by Phillip Briggs (2006), page 200. {{ISBN|1-84162-146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Maasai [[religious belief]] relates that God gave them all the cattle on earth, leading to the belief that [[rustling]] cattle from other tribes is a matter of taking back what is rightfully theirs, a practice that has become much less common.&lt;ref&gt;''Africa's Great Rift Valley''. Nigel Pavitt. 2001. pages 138. Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated, New York {{ISBN|0-8109-0602-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the Maasai’s needs for food are met by their cattle. They eat the meat, drink the milk daily, and drink the blood on occasion. Bulls, oxen and lambs are slaughtered for meat on special occasions and for ceremonies. Though the Maasai’s entire way of life has historically depended on their cattle, more recently with their cattle dwindling, the Maasai have grown dependent on food such as sorghum, rice, potatoes and cabbage (known to the Maasai as goat leaves).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Jimmy. The Maasai Tribe. Beforethey.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences from the outside world===

Maintaining a traditional pastoral lifestyle has become increasingly difficult due to outside influences of the modern world. [[Garrett Hardin]]'s article, outlining the "tragedy of the commons", as well as [[Melville Herskovits]]' "cattle complex" helped to influence ecologists and policy makers about the harm Maasai pastoralists were causing to savannah rangelands. This concept was later proven false by [[anthropologist]]s but is still deeply ingrained in the minds of ecologists and Tanzanian officials.&lt;ref name="Sustain"&gt;McCabe, Terrence. (2003). "Sustainability and livelihood diversification among the Maasai of Northern Tanzania". Human Organization. Vol 62.2. pp. 100–111.&lt;/ref&gt; This influenced British colonial policy makers in 1951 to remove all Maasai from the Serengeti National Park and relegate them to areas in and around the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] (NCA). The plan for the NCA was to put Maasai interests above all else, but this promise was never met. The spread of HIV was rampant.

Due to an increase in Maasai population, loss of cattle populations to disease, and lack of available rangelands because of new park boundaries and the incursion of settlements and farms by other tribes (this is also the chief reason for the decline in wildlife-habitat loss, with the second being poaching), the Maasai were forced to develop new ways of sustaining themselves. Many Maasai began to cultivate maize and other crops to get by, a practice that was culturally viewed negatively.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;  Cultivation was first introduced to the Maasai by displaced [[Arusha people|WaArusha]] and [[Wameru|WaMeru]] women who were married to Maasai men; subsequent generations practiced a mixed livelihood. To further complicate their situation, in 1975 the Ngorongoro Conservation Area banned cultivation practices. In order to survive they are forced to participate in Tanzania’s monetary economy. They have to sell their animals and traditional medicines in order to buy food. The ban on cultivation was lifted in 1992 and cultivation has again become an important part of Maasai livelihood. Park boundaries and land privatisation has continued to limit grazing area for the Maasai and have forced them to change considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Ric. (2002). "Pastoral livelihoods in Tanzania: Can the Maasai benefit from conservation?" Current Issues in Tourism. Vol 5.3,4. P.280-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ludzie06(js).jpg|thumb|left|Maasai women repairing a house in Masai Mara (1996)]]

Over the years, many projects have begun to help Maasai tribal leaders find ways to preserve their traditions while also balancing the education needs of their children for the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siyabona Africa|title=The Maasai Tribe, East Africa|url=http://www.siyabona.com/maasai-tribe-east-africa.html|website=Siyabona Africa|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging forms of employment among the Maasai people include farming, business (selling of traditional medicine, running of restaurants/shops, buying and selling of minerals, selling milk and milk products by women, embroideries), and wage employment (as security guards/ watchmen, waiters, tourist guides), and others who are engaged in the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/infoecon/docs/790/F2096573592/Pastoralists.pdf |title=Challenges To Traditional Livelihoods And Newly Emerging Employment Patterns Of Pastoralists In Tanzania |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924104436/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/infoecon/docs/790/F2096573592/Pastoralists.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social organization==
[[File:Young Maasai Warrior.jpg|thumb|right|Young Maasai warrior (a junior ''Moran'') with headdress and markings]]

The central unit of Maasai society is the age-set. Young boys are sent out with the calves and lambs as soon as they can toddle, but childhood for boys is mostly playtime, with the exception of ritual beatings to test courage and endurance. Girls are responsible for chores such as cooking and milking, skills which they learn from their mothers at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''. Mohamed Amin, Duncan Willetts, John Eames. 1987. Pages 55, 94. Camerapix Publishers International. {{ISBN|1-874041-32-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every 15 years or so, a new and individually named generation of Morans or Il-murran (warriors) will be initiated. This involves most boys between 12 and 25, who have reached puberty and are not part of the previous age-set. One rite of passage from boyhood to the status of junior warrior is a [[circumcision]] ceremony performed without anaesthetic. In modern times, boys living close to towns with doctors may endure the ceremony in safer conditions, but still without anaesthetic because they must endure the pain that will lead them to manhood. This ritual is typically performed by the elders, who use a sharpened knife and makeshift cattle hide bandages for the procedure. The Maa word for circumcision is emorata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dlpayne/Maa%20Lexicon/index-english/main.htm |title=English - Maa |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy must endure the operation in silence. Expressions of pain bring dishonor, albeit temporarily. Any exclamations can cause a mistake in the delicate and tedious process, which can result in lifelong scarring, dysfunction, and pain. The healing process will take 3–4 months, during which urination is painful and nearly impossible at times, and boys must remain in black clothes for a period of 4–8 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maasai-association.org/ceremonies.html |title=Maasai Association |publisher=Maasai Association |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the newly circumcised young men will live in a "manyatta", a "village" built by their mothers. The manyatta has no encircling barricade for protection, emphasizing the warrior role of protecting the community. No inner [[kraal]] is built, since warriors neither own cattle nor undertake stock duties. Further rites of passage are required before achieving the status of senior warrior, culminating in the eunoto ceremony, the "coming of age".&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''. Mohamed Amin, Duncan Willetts, John Eames. 1987. Page 83, 100-103. Camerapix Publishers International. {{ISBN|1-874041-32-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a new generation of warriors is initiated, the existing Il-murran will graduate to become junior elders, who are responsible for political decisions until they in turn become senior elders.&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Tanzania - The Bradt Safari Guide'' by Phillip Briggs (2006). British Library. {{ISBN|1-84162-146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maasai-association.org/ceremonies.html |title=Maasai Association |publisher=Maasai Association |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This graduation from warrior to junior elder takes place at a large gathering known as Eunoto. The long hair of the former warriors is [[head shaving|shaved off]]; elders must wear their hair short. Warriors are not allowed to have sexual relations with circumcised women, though they may have girlfriends who are uncircumcised girls. At Eunoto, the warriors who managed to abide by this rule are specially recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year= 2005|title= Tribal Odyssey - Maasai: The Last Dance Of The Warriors|medium=Motion picture|publisher=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warriors spend most of their time now on walkabouts throughout Maasai lands, beyond the confines of their sectional boundaries. They are also much more involved in cattle trading than they used to be, developing and improving basic stock through trades and bartering rather than stealing as in the past.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''.

One myth about the Maasai is that each young man is supposed to kill a lion before he is circumcised. Lion hunting was an activity of the past, but it has been banned in Southeast Africa – yet lions are still hunted when they maul Maasai livestock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maasai-association.org/lion.html |title=Maasai Association |publisher=Maasai Association |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and young warriors who engage in traditional lion killing do not face significant consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionconservation.org/LionKillinginAmboseliregion2000-May2006.pdf Lion Killing in the Amboseli-Tsavo Ecosystem, 2001–2006, and its Implications for Kenya’s Lion Population] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224220706/http://www.lionconservation.org/LionKillinginAmboseliregion2000-May2006.pdf |date=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing concern regarding lion populations has given rise to at least one program which promotes accepting compensation when a lion kills livestock, rather than hunting and killing the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigcatrescue.blogspot.com/2007/07/maasai-tribesmen-help-lions-rather-than.html |title=Field Reports: Maasai tribesmen help lions rather than kill them |publisher=Bigcatrescue.blogspot.com |date=2007-07-06 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, killing a lion gives one great value and celebrity status in the community.

Young women also undergo [[wiktionary:excision|excision]] ("[[female circumcision]]", "[[female genital mutilation]],"  "emorata") as part of an elaborate [[rite of passage]] ritual called "Emuratare," the ceremony that initiates young Maasai girls into adulthood through ritual circumcision and then into early arranged marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orato.com/world-affairs/maasai-ritual-of-female-circumcision |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807211153/http://www.orato.com/world-affairs/maasai-ritual-of-female-circumcision |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-07 |title=Maasai Ritual of Female Circumcision: Genital Cutting Practiced throughout Africa and Middle East |publisher=Orato.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maasai believe that female circumcision is necessary and Maasai men may reject any woman who has not undergone it as either not marriageable or worthy of a much-reduced bride price.  In Eastern Africa, uncircumcised women, even those highly educated members of parliament like [[Linah Kilimo]], can be accused of not being mature enough to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="irinnews.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/IndepthMain.aspx?IndepthId=15&amp;ReportId=62462 |title=In-depth: Razor's Edge - The Controversy of Female Genital Mutilation |publisher=IRIN Humanitarian News and Analysis, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs |date=March 2005 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; To others the practice of female circumcision is known as female genital mutilation, and draws a great deal of criticism from both abroad and many women who have undergone it, such as Maasai activist [[Agnes Pareyio]]. It has recently been replaced in some instances by a "cutting with words" ceremony involving singing and dancing in place of the mutilation. However, the practice remains deeply ingrained and valued by the culture. The Maa word for circumcision, "emorata," is used for both female and male genital mutilation. Female genital cutting is illegal in both Kenya and Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/News2001/tan007_fgm.htm |title=tan007 Tanzania fails to enforce law against female mutilation |publisher=Afrol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001524.html |title=The Abolition of Female Genital Mutilation — |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These circumcisions are usually performed by an invited 'practitioner' who is often not Maasai, usually from a [[Dorobo]] group. The knives and blades which make the cut are fashioned by blacksmiths, il-kunono, who make their weapons for the Maasai who do not make their own:(knives, short swords (ol alem or simi or seme), spears, etc.).

The Maasai are traditionally [[Polygyny|polygynous]]; this is thought to be a long-standing and practical adaptation to high infant and warrior mortality rates. [[Polyandry]] is also practiced. However, today this practice is usually abandoned. A woman marries not just her husband but the entire age group. Men are expected to give up their bed to a visiting age-mate guest; however, today this practice is usually abandoned. The woman decides strictly on her own if she will join the visiting male. Any child which may result is the husband's child and his descendant in the [[patrilineal]] order of Maasai society. "Kitala", a kind of divorce or refuge, is possible in the house of a wife's father, usually for gross mistreatment of the wife. Repayment of the bride price, custody of children, etc., are mutually agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''. Mohamed Amin, Duncan Willetts, John Eames. 1987. Page 86-87.

==Music and dance==
&lt;!-- [[Maasai music]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Maasai-Adumu.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional jumping dance]]
Maasai music traditionally consists of rhythms provided by a chorus of vocalists singing harmonies while a song leader, or olaranyani, sings the melody. The olaranyani is usually the singer who can best sing that song, although several individuals may lead a song. The olaranyani begins by singing a line or title (namba) of a song. The group will respond with one unanimous call in acknowledgment, and the olaranyani will sing a verse over the group's rhythmic throat singing. Each song has its specific namba structure based on [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]]. Common rhythms are variations of 5/4, 6/4 and 3/4 time signatures.  Lyrics follow a typical theme and are often repeated verbatim over time. Neck movements accompany singing. When breathing out the head is leaned forward. The head is tilted back for an inward breath. Overall the effect is one of polyphonic syncopation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmurran.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428050356/http://www.ilmurran.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-04-28 |title=ilMurran |language=fi |publisher=ilMurran |date=1999-12-04 |accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laleyio.com/music.html |title=Maasai Music (archived copy) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104184707/http://www.laleyio.com/music.html |archivedate=November 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other African tribes, Maasai widely use [[drone (music)|drone]] polyphony.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jordania]].

One exception to the vocal nature of Maasai music is the use of the horn of the [[Greater Kudu]] to summon morans for the Eunoto ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''.

Both singing and dancing sometimes occur around manyattas, and involve flirting. Young men will form a line and chant rhythmically, "Oooooh-yah", with a growl and staccato cough along with the thrust and withdrawal of their lower bodies. Girls stand in front of the men and make the same pelvis lunges while singing a high dying fall of "Oiiiyo..yo" in counterpoint to the men. Although bodies come in close proximity, they do not touch.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''. Mohamed Amin, Duncan Willetts, John Eames. 1987. Page 85.

Eunoto, the coming of age ceremony of the warrior, can involve ten or more days of singing, dancing and ritual. The warriors of the Il-Oodokilani perform a kind of march-past as well as the '''adumu''', or aigus, sometimes referred as "the jumping dance" by non-Maasai. (Both adumu and aigus are Maa verbs meaning "to jump" with adumu meaning "To jump up and down in a dance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dlpayne/Maa%20Lexicon/categories/main.htm |title=Maa - Categories |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Warriors are well known for, and often photographed during, this competitive jumping. A circle is formed by the warriors, and one or two at a time will enter the center to begin jumping while maintaining a narrow posture, never letting their heels touch the ground. Members of the group may raise the pitch of their voices based on the height of the jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laleyio.com/performance.html |title=Archived copy of laleyio.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802172342/http://www.laleyio.com/performance.html |archivedate=August 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body modification==
[[File:Masai Woman.jpg|thumb|Maasai woman with stretched earlobes]]
The piercing and stretching of [[earlobes]] is common among the Maasai as with other tribes. Various materials have been used to both pierce and stretch the lobes, including thorns for piercing, twigs, bundles of twigs, stones, the cross section of elephant tusks and empty film canisters. Fewer and fewer Maasai, particularly boys, follow this custom.&lt;ref&gt;''The Myth of Wild Africa: Conservation Without Illusion''. Jonathan S. Adams, Thomas O. McShane. 1996.

Women are also circumcised (as described above).

The removal of [[Deciduous teeth|deciduous canine tooth]] buds in early childhood is a practice that has been documented in the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania. There exists a strong belief among the Maasai that diarrheoa, vomiting and other febrile illnesses of early childhood are caused by the gingival swelling over the canine region, which is thought to contain 'worms' or 'nylon' teeth. This belief and practice is not unique to the Maasai. In rural Kenya a group of 95 children aged between six months and two years were examined in 1991/92. 87% were found to have undergone the removal of one or more deciduous canine tooth buds. In an older age group (3–7 years of age), 72% of the 111 children examined exhibited missing mandibular or maxillary deciduous canines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hassanali J, Amwayi P, Muriithi A |title=Removal of deciduous canine tooth buds in Kenyan rural Maasai |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=207–9 |date=Apr 1995 |pmid=7621751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiza JF, Kikwilu EN |title=Missing primary teeth due to tooth bud extraction in a remote village in Tanzania |journal=Int J Paediatr Dent |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–4 |date=Apr 1992 |pmid=1525129 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-263x.1992.tb00005.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
[[File:Masaai with cattle.jpg|thumb|left|400px|A Maasai herdsman grazing his cattle inside the Ngorongoro crater]]
Traditionally, the Maasai diet consisted of raw meat, raw milk, and raw blood from [[cattle]].  Note that the Maasai cattle are of the [[Zebu]] variety. In the summer of 1935 Dr. [[Weston A. Price]] visited the Maasai and reported that according to Dr. Anderson from the local government hospital in Kenya most tribes were disease-free.  Many had not a single tooth attacked by dental caries nor a single malformed [[dental arch]]. In particular the Maasai had a very low 0.4% of bone caries.  He attributed that to their diet consisting of (in order of volume) raw milk, raw blood, raw meat and some vegetables and fruits, although in many villages they do not eat any fruit or vegetables at all.  He noted that when available every growing child and every pregnant or lactating woman would receive a daily ration of raw blood.  Dr. Weston A. Price also noted the government efforts back in 1935 to turn the Maasai into farmers.  An ILCA study (Nestel 1989) states: "Today, the stable diet of the Maasai consists of cow's milk and maize-meal. The former is largely drunk fresh or in sweet tea and the latter is used to make a liquid or solid porridge. The solid porridge is known as [[ugali]] and is eaten with milk; unlike the liquid porridge, ugali is not prepared with milk. Animal fats or butter are used in cooking, primarily of porridge, maize, and beans. Butter is also an important infant food."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taa.org.uk/TAAScotland/LivestockasfoodforpastoralistsinAfrica2001.htm Livestock as food for pastoralists in Africa.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311031855/http://www.taa.org.uk/TAAScotland/LivestockasfoodforpastoralistsinAfrica2001.htm |date=2009-03-11 }} J. M. Suttie. quoting from Nestel, P. 1989. A society in transition: developmental and seasonal influences on the nutrition of Maasai women and children ILCA, Nairobi&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by the International Livestock Centre for Africa (Bekure et al. 1991) shows a very great change in the diet of the Maasai towards non-livestock products with maize comprising 12–39 percent and sugar 8–13 percent; about one litre of milk is consumed per person daily.
Most of the milk is consumed as fermented milk or [[buttermilk]] (a by-product of butter making). Milk consumption figures are very high by any standards. The needs for protein and essential amino acids are more than adequately satisfied. However, the supply of iron, niacin, vitamin C, vitamin A, thiamine and energy are never fully met by a purely milk diet. Due to changing circumstances, especially the seasonal nature of the milk supply and frequent droughts, most pastoralists, including the Maasai, now include substantial amounts of grain in their diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/t0251e/T0251E07.htm |title=The technology of traditional milk products in developing countries |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taa.org.uk/TAAScotland/LivestockasfoodforpastoralistsinAfrica2001.htm |title=Livestock as food for pastoralists in Africa |last=Suttie |first=J.M. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311031855/http://www.taa.org.uk/TAAScotland/LivestockasfoodforpastoralistsinAfrica2001.htm |archive-date=11 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maasai herd goats and sheep, including the [[Red Maasai]] sheep, as well as the more prized cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilri.org/ILRIPubAware/Uploaded%20Files/20041029128410.00BR_ISS_AfricanGeneticTreasuresKeyToReducingDiseaseAndPoverty.pdf African Genetic Treasures Key to Reducing Disease and Poverty] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrocardiogram tests applied to 400 young adult male Maasai found no evidence whatsoever of heart disease, abnormalities or malfunction. Further study with carbon-14 tracers showed that the average cholesterol level was about 50 percent of that of an average American. These findings were ascribed to the amazing fitness of morans, which was evaluated as "Olympic standard".&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''. Mohamed Amin, Duncan Willetts, John Eames. 1987. Page 87. Camerapix Publishers International. {{ISBN|1-874041-32-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soups are probably the most important use of plants for food by Maasai. ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' is the most frequently used soup plant. The root or stem bark is boiled in water and the decoction drunk alone or added to soup. The Maasai are fond of taking this as a drug, and is known to make them energetic, aggressive and fearless. Maasai eat soup laced with bitter bark and roots containing cholesterol-lowering [[saponin]]s; those urban Maasai who don't have access to the bitter plants tend to develop heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Oct. 1995, page 161&lt;/ref&gt; Although consumed as snacks, fruits constitute a major part of the food ingested by children and women looking after cattle as well as morans in the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001266/126660e.pdf |title=Ethnobotany of the Loita Maasai: towards community management of the Forest of the Lost Child; experiences from the Loita Ethnobotany Project; People and plants working paper; Vol.:8; 2001 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixing of cattle blood, obtained by nicking the jugular vein, and milk is done to prepare a ritual drink for special celebrations and as nourishment for the sick.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last of the Maasai''. Mohamed Amin, Duncan Willetts, John Eames. 1987. Page 90. Camerapix Publishers International. {{ISBN|1-874041-32-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the inclusion of blood in the traditional diet is waning due to the reduction of livestock numbers. More recently, the Maasai have grown dependent on food produced in other areas such as maize meal, rice, potatoes, cabbage (known to the Maasai as goat leaves) etc. The Maasai who live near crop farmers have engaged in cultivation as their primary mode of subsistence. In these areas, plot sizes are generally not large enough to accommodate herds of animals; thus the Maasai are forced to farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maasai-association.org/maasai.htm |title=maasai-association.org }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelter==
[[File:Maasai shelter.jpg|thumb|right|Shelter covered in cattle dung for waterproofing]]

As a historically [[nomad]]ic and then semi-nomadic people, the Maasai have traditionally relied on local, readily available materials and indigenous [[technology]] to construct their [[house|housing]]. The traditional Maasai house was in the first instance designed for people on the move and was thus very impermanent in nature. The ''Boma'' (houses) are either somewhat rectangular shaped with extensions or circular, and are constructed by able-bodied women. The structural framework is formed of timber poles fixed directly into the ground and interwoven with a lattice of smaller branches [[wattle (construction)|wattle]], which is then plastered with a mix of [[mud]], sticks, grass, cow [[feces|dung]], human [[urine]], and ash. The cow dung ensures that the roof is waterproof. The enkaj or engaji is small, measuring about 3x5&amp;nbsp;m and standing only 1.5&amp;nbsp;m high. Within this space, the family cooks, eats, sleeps, socializes, and stores food, fuel, and other household possessions. Small [[livestock]] are also often accommodated within the enkaji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkcycle.org/tc-filesystem/download/development_by_design_2001/sustainable_improvement_of_traditional_maasai_housing_through_participatory_technology_development/Maasai%2520Housing.pdf |title=Maasai Housing |date= |access-date= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maasai-association.org/maasai.html |title=Maasai People, Kenya |publisher=Maasai-association.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villages are enclosed in a circular fence (an enkang) built by the men, usually of thorned [[acacia]], a native tree. At night, all [[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, and [[sheep]] are placed in an enclosure in the centre, safe from [[wild animal]]s.

==Clothing==
[[File:Maasai Woman Meeyu Sale Wearing her Finest.jpg|thumb|right|A Maasai woman wearing her finest clothes]]
Clothing changes by age and location. Young men, for instance, wear black for several months following their circumcision. However, red is a favored colour. Blue, black, striped, and checkered cloth are also worn, as are multicolored African designs. The Maasai began to replace animal-skin, [[calfskin|calf hides]] and sheep skin, with commercial cotton cloth in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5217/is_1999/ai_n19133542/pg_4 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708194742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5217/is_1999/ai_n19133542/pg_4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |work=Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of World Cultures |title=Maasai |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shúkà is the [[Maasai language|Maa]] word for sheets traditionally worn wrapped around the body. These are typically [[red]], though with some other [[colors]] (e.g. [[blue]]) and patterns (e.g. [[Tartan|plaid]]). Pink, even with [[flowers]], is not shunned by warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dlpayne/Maa%20Lexicon/categories/main.htm |title=Maa (Maasai) Dictionary |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One piece garments known as [[Kanga (African garment)|kanga]], a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term, are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glcom.com/hassan/kanga_history.html |title=Kanga history |publisher=Glcom.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maasai near the coast may wear [[kikoi]], a type of [[sarong]] that comes in many different [[colors]] and [[textiles]]. However, the preferred style is stripes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/kmatculture.htm |title=East Africa Living Encyclopedia |publisher=Africa.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Maasai in [[Tanzania]] wear simple [[sandals]], which were until recently made from cowhides. They are now soled with [[tire]] strips or [[plastic]]. Both men and women wear wooden [[bracelets]]. The Maasai women regularly weave and bead [[jewellery]]. This bead work plays an essential part in the ornamentation of their body. Although there are variations in the meaning of the color of the beads, some general meanings for a few colors are: [[white]], [[peace]]; [[blue]], [[water]]; [[red]], [[warrior]]/[[blood]]/bravery.&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Tanzania with Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar'' by Phillip Briggs (2006), page 216. {{ISBN|1-84162-146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beadworking, done by [[women]], has a long [[history]] among the Maasai, who articulate their identity and position in society through body ornaments and [[body painting]]. Before contact with [[Europe]]ans, the beads were produced mostly from local raw materials. White beads were made from [[clay]], [[exoskeleton|shells]], [[ivory]], or [[bone]]. Black and blue beads were made from [[iron]], [[charcoal]], [[seed]]s, [[clay]], or [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]. Red beads came from [[seed]]s, [[wood]]s, [[gourd]]s, [[bone]], [[ivory]], [[copper]], or [[brass]]. When late in the nineteenth century, great quantities of brightly colored European [[glass]] beads arrived in Southeast Africa, beadworkers replaced the older beads with the new materials and began to use more elaborate color schemes. Currently, dense, [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] glass beads with no surface decoration and a naturally smooth finish are preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/beads/essay3.html |title=Klumpp 1987, 105, 30, 31, 67 |publisher=Smithsonianeducation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maltese of Egypt''', also known as '''Egyptian Franco-Maltese''', are an ethnic minority group in [[Egypt]]. Though culturally very similar to the Franco-Maltese of Tunisia and Algeria, most people of Maltese or part-Maltese descent born in Egypt remained British subjects. They are immigrants, or descendants of immigrants, from the islands of [[Malta]], who settled in Egypt largely during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and intermarried heavily with Italians, French and other Europeans. Those with a French father assumed French citizenship. Some Maltese had been present in the country as early as the era of [[Napoleon]] and his [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|conquest of Egypt]]. The proximity between the two countries and the similarity between the [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages have led many Maltese to settle in Egypt in the past, mainly in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cassar|first=George|title=Welcome Note: The Embassy of Malta in Egypt|url=http://www.foreign.gov.mt/Default.aspx?MDIS=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Italians in Egypt|Italians who settled in Egypt]], the Egyptian-born Maltese constituted a portion of [[Roman Catholicism in Egypt|Egypt's Roman Catholic community]]. By 1939, up to 20,000 Maltese were living in Egypt. Practically all of these were French-speaking, and those with a French parent had French as their mother tongue. In many middle-class families (especially in Alexandria and Cairo) a language shift had occurred, with Italian used as the home language alongside French; a large minority of Egyptian Maltese (for example those of the Suez Canal Zone) still retained Maltese as their mother tongue. This number was greatly reduced by emigration years after, and almost completely wiped out by expulsions in 1956 due to the Maltese being British nationals. Most of the Egyptian Franco-Maltese settled in Australia or Britain, where they remained culturally distinct from immigrants from Malta. Those with French citizenship were repatriated to France. Post-war Malta in general did not accept refugees from Egypt.

==History==
[[Catholic]] Malta and predominantly [[Muslim]] North Africa have had troubled relations since at least the [[Crusades]], when Malta became the final stand against the [[Turkey|Turk]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s by the [[Knights Hospitallers]]. Malta held, and after the Crusades many attacks against Arab and Turkish coastal towns were launched from it. Not all of the Maltese who joined the Knights in these attacks returned home. Some lost their liberty, settling against their will in North Africa.{{fact|date=August 2013}}

The Knights remained in possession of Malta until its seizure by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1798. Bonaparte formed a troop of Maltese--the number of men varies in sources from 400 or 500 to 2000--who went with him into Egypt as part of the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2009-10-12/news/napoleon-bonaparte-and-his-maltese-soldiers-264684/ | title = Napoleon Bonaparte and His Maltese Soldiers | work = The Malta Independent | date = 12 October 2003 | accessdate = 17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Andrew James|title=A Military History of Modern Egypt: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98601-8|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asprey2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asprey|first=Robert B.|title=The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-04881-6|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these men settled in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] after Napoleon's loss at the [[Battle of the Nile]], becoming some of the first Maltese settlers in Egypt.{{fact|date=August 2013}} Opportunity for work with the British drew more Maltese into the area thereafter, although there was an exodus of Maltese refugees back to their native land in 1822, when [[Alexandria]] was besieged by the British. Nevertheless, Alexandria, [[Cairo]], [[Suez]], [[Rosetta]] and [[Port Said]] continued to be a draw for Maltese settlers.

Maltese immigrants joined the many others who flocked to the area for work in 1859 with the construction of the [[Suez Canal]]. The Egyptian Maltese community was heavily employed in such construction areas as [[masonry]], [[carpentry]], and [[smithing]] as well as in administration and commerce. Many became employees of the French Suez Canal Company. As [[English language|English]] was known to some and they were quicker than Europeans to learn [[Arabic language|Arabic]], they proved useful to British employers. Language became a major focus of the Maltese work force. While many had left their homes illiterate, speaking Maltese and usually also Italian, they sent their children to French [[Catholic schools]] where they developed fluency not only in French, which became the principal language of the subsequent generations, but also in English and Arabic. This education made them useful both in [[Consular office|consular]] work and to European companies entering the area.{{fact|date=August 2013}}

Relations between the Maltese immigrants and the Egyptian population were not always easy. In Alexandria in 1882, a fight between a Maltese immigrant and an Egyptian donkey driver, in which the donkey driver was killed, led the Egyptians to riot. As word spread that the Europeans were killing Egyptians the residents took to the streets. They met return fire from Europeans, Greeks, Syrians and other Christians, with violence continuing until finally the army was called in to intervene.&lt;ref name="McGregor2006"&gt;McGregor (2006), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, there were nearly 20,000 Maltese residents living and working in Egypt. However, the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; when Malta was used as a point of deployment by the British and French for troops to invade Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The 1956 War: Collusion and Rivalry in the Middle East|last = Tal|first = David|year = 2001|publisher = Psychology Press|page = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by the expulsion of Maltese immigrants, along with many other groups, from the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Attard|first=Lawrence E.|title=The Great Exodus, 1918-1939|year=1989|publisher=Publishers Enterprises Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian Maltese, like the very similar Tunisian Maltese and Algerian Maltese varieties, is an archaic form of the language, characterized by the preservation of late nineteenth-century features (including numerous Italian lexical elements now replaced by English loanwords in the Maltese of Malta), a large number of borrowings from French and a small number of Arabic loanwords and expressions relating to life in Egypt. As a majority of Egyptian-born Maltese had origins in the Cottonera ([[Three Cities]]) harbourside district of Malta, Cottoneran dialectalisms are another feature distinguishing Egyptian Maltese from the current metropolitan standard variety of the language.

'''Mennonites in Belize''' form different religious bodies and come from different [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] backgrounds. There are groups of [[Mennonite]]s living in [[Belize]], who are quite traditional and conservative (e. g. in [[Shipyard, Belize|Shipyard]] and [[Upper Barton Creek]]), while others have modernized to various degrees (e. g. in [[Spanish Lookout]] and [[Blue Creek, Orange Walk|Blue Creek]]).

There were 4,961 members as of 2014, but the total number including children and young unbaptized adults was around 12,000. Of these some 10,000 were [[ethnic Mennonite]]s, most of them [[Russian Mennonites|"Russian" Mennonites]], who speak [[Plautdietsch]], a [[Low German]] dialect. In addition to this, there were another 2,000 mostly [[Belizean Kriol people|Kriol]] and [[Mestizo]] Belizeans who had converted to [[Mennonite|Mennonitism]].&lt;ref name=cepal/&gt;

==History of Belizean Mennonites==

The Friesian and Flemish ancestors of the vast majority of Belizean Mennonites settled in the Vistula delta (Poland) 1600-1791 then South Russia 1791 - 1873.  In the years after 1873 some 11,000 left the Russian Empire and settled in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]] and an equal number went to the US. The more conservative ones left Canada between 1922 and 1925 and [[Mennonites in Mexico|settled in Mexico]]. In the years after 1958 some 1,700 Mennonites from the Mexican settlements moved to what was then British Honduras. [[Mennonites in El Salvador|Mennonites from El Salvador]] moved to Belize during their [[Salvadoran Civil War|civil war]]. The so-called "Russian Mennonites" speak [[Plautdietsch]] in everyday life among themselves. There are also some hundred [[Pennsylvania German]] speaking [[Old Order Mennonites]] who came from the USA and Canada in the late 1960s and settle now in [[Upper Barton Creek]] and daughter settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Belize&amp;oldid=122447 |title=Belize |publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |last1=Gingerich |first1=Melvin |last2=Loewen |first2=John B. |date=23 May 2014 |website= |access-date=29 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs and Traditions==
[[File:Mennonites on New River, Belize.jpg|thumb|left|Mennonites on New River, Belize]]
Mennonites are easily identified by their clothing, except from the ones who have modernized to a large degree or have never been traditional, because they have converted in recent times. The women wear bonnets and long dresses while the men wear denim overalls and hats. The men may wear traditional suspenders and dark trousers. The women wear brightly colored dresses. In many of the Mennonite communities there is a softening of the old tradition. In [[Upper Barton Creek]] and daughter settlements, men and women dress similar to the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]]. Both [[Old Colony Mennonites]] and [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s use horse drawn buggies for transportation, but only the Noah Hoovers also till fields with horse drawn implements.

Traditional Mennonites conduct burial services mainly in German, but with some parts in English so that visitors can take part. They use bibles like other Christians. The caskets are made of plain lumber which is lined with white cloth inside and black cloth outside. Expensive caskets are not used. A portion of the shoulder remains open during the service. After the rites the whole congregation files orderly to the front of the church to pay their last respect. In Spanish Lookout, members and friends of the deceased address the congregation after the obituary has been read. Tombs are not used, but a cross marks the name and spot. Before returning the body to the earth, hymns are sung. Members of the community take turns shoveling the earth until the burial is complete. After that the community comes together and feasts on bread, sausages and coffee with the bereaved family.

Weddings usually start with courtship and last for six months to a year. The boy's parents ask the girl's father for permission. After that the parents get together and set wedding dates. The penultimate Saturday evening before the wedding is called "Falafnes" ([[Standard German]]: "Verlöbnis"). On this event, the friend of the bride and the groom share the bible reading. Weddings are performed on Sundays. They usually consist of two ministers, one to explain the meaning of matrimony and the other to do the blessings. Gifts given are usually tools and household items.

Mennonites from the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite|Noah Hoover group]] in [[Upper Barton Creek]] and daughter settlements are extremely restrictive concerning the use of motors and electricity, that is, both motors and electricity are forbidden in the settlement by the members of the group. Their clothing is very similar to the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]], and men wear beards like the Amish. Therefore, they are often perceived as Amish and called Amish, even though this is not the case. This has caused some confusion.

The Mennonites have made it a point to have their own school, church, and financial institution in their community.

==Languages==

The vast majority, more than 95%, of ethnic Mennonites in Belize speak [[Plautdietsch]] in everyday life. A small minority of very conservative Mennonites that came from North America mostly in the second half of the 1960s speak [[Pennsylvania German]] instead. Both groups use [[Standard German]] for reading the Bible, in school and in Church. [[English language|English]] and [[Belizean Spanish]] are used mainly by men for communication outside their communities, Belizean Spanish is also spoken by descendants of Mexican Mennonites and Salvadoran Mennonites. Almost all Mennonites from churches who do outreach in Belize, e. g. Beachy Amish Mennonites, speak mainly English. Mennonites from other ethnic backgrounds use their ethno-languages.

==Colonies==
The total population of Mennonites, including unbaptized children, stood at 4,959 in 1987. The major colonies with their population in 1987 were Shipyard (1,946), Spanish Lookout (1,125) and Little Belize (1,004). [[Richmond Hill, Belize|Richmond Hill]] existed only from 1960 to 1965. Presently in Belize there are different communities of Mennonites, namely [[Shipyard, Belize|Shipyard]], [[Blue Creek, Orange Walk|Blue Creek]], [[Little Belize]], [[Spanish Lookout]], [[Indian Creek Colony|Indian Creek]], [[Barton Creek (Belize)|Upper and Lower Barton Creek]], [[Springfield, Belize|Springfield]] and [[Pine Hill, Belize|Pine Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schroeder |first=William |last2=Huebert |first2=Helmut T. |date=1996 |title=Mennonite Historical Atlas |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=OfyYXOGoMy8C |location= |publisher=Kindred Productions |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demographics of Belize#Ethnic groups|In 1999]], the Mennonites (excluding converts from other groups) had a birth rate of 42.53 per 1000, which was well above the national average of 30.71 per 1000.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller outreaches of [[Conservative Mennonites]] can be found in numerous communities throughout Belize.

== Mennonite Groups and membership ==

As Mennonites accept only adults as members, the total population of the Mennonite congregations in Belize is underestimated by membership counts. The largest denomination was Altkolonier Mennoniten Gemeinde with 2,052 members. Other denominations were [[Kleine Gemeinde]] zu Spanish Lookout with 710 members and Kleine Gemeinde zu Blue Creek with 60 members, Iglesia Evangélica Menonita de Belice with 400 members (mostly [[Mestizos]]), [[Evangelical Mennonite Mission Conference]] with 388 members, [[Beachy Amish Mennonite Fellowship]] with 140 members, Caribbean Light and Truth with 137 members (mostly Kriol) and [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]] with 42 members (mostly [[Belizean Kriol people|Kriol]]) (All figures as of 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mwc-cmm.org/en15/PDF-PPT/2006carcsam.pdf |title=Caribbean, Central &amp; South America |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= Mennonite World Conference &amp;#124; A Community of Anabaptist-Related Churches |publisher=Mennonite World Conference |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170234/http://www.mwc-cmm.org/en15/PDF-PPT/2006carcsam.pdf |archive-date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic contributions to Belize==

Mennonites in Belize contribute to the carpentry, engineering and agricultural industries of Belize. They produce milk, cheese, beans, corn, melons, honey, chicken, and eggs. They have turned sections of tropical jungle into highly productive farmland. They are also skilled in manufacturing household furniture as well as constructing houses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Controversy ==
While the Mennonites in Belize have been very prosperous in agriculture, Michael Trapasso wrote, in a 1992 article published in [[GeoJournal]], that there have been complaints that they often do so with no regard for the environment or environmental laws.

In a paper of the [[FAO]] the following is stated about Mennonites in Belize. (Even though the report speaks of "Amish", meant are [[Old Order Mennonite]]s of the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite|Noah Hoover]] group who live in settlements like Upper Barton Creek, Springfield and Pine Hill):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/climatechange/28917-0341a24dd0e4102906ed245d28d82700d.pdf G.

{{Cquote| Amish agriculture is characterized by the use of animal power and natural forms of energy, and is almost completely independent from fossil fuels as a form of energy. Success is measured in a number of ways foremost amongst these are the capacity to feed themselves, contribute to national food security, create sustainable livelihoods based on farming for all community members, be independent from government financial support, social, and educational services, though they use health services. Last but not least, their capacity to purchase their own production resources. Amish agriculture is well planned, sustainable, and expanding. }}

The '''Mexico Peace Index (MPI)''' is one in a series of National Peace Indices produced by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace|Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP)]]. The MPI provides a comprehensive measure of peacefulness in Mexico, the fifth edition of the MPI was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones/view/Violencia_le_costo_a_Mexico_el_18_de_su_PIB_en_2016_segun_estudio-1077123|title=Violencia le costó a México el 18% de su PIB en 2016, según estudio - Periódico Noroeste|website=Noroeste.com.mx|language=es|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is released in both Spanish and English, and analyzes the economic benefits that would occur from increases in peace, and provides an estimate relating to the economic impact violence has had on Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/12/mexico-peace-index-just-launched/ 'Mexico Peace Index just launched'] Alliance for Peacebuilding, retrieved 2013-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index uses the same definition of peace as the [[Global Peace Index]], [[United States Peace Index]] and [[United Kingdom Peace Index]], which it defines as the absence of violence or the absence of the fear of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/MPI%20Report%202013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mexico Peace Index 2013 |page=4 |website=Visionofhumanity.org |accessdate=2017-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213145206/http://visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/MPI%20Report%202013.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year a large press conference is held and attended by many civil society reps, including [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]], COMCE, [[Coparmex]], [[FEMSA]], Mexico Evalua, Mexico Contra la Delincuencia. Additionally the press conferences are attended by journalists from multiple media outlets including the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]], AFP, EFE, [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], [[The New York Times|NY Times]], [[Telemundo]], Reforma, [[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]], [[El Economista (Mexico)|El Economista]], [[TV Azteca]], [[Milenio Televisión|Milenio TV]], Expansion, Radio Formula, MVS Radio, W Radio, [[Notimex]]. Each year the launch of the report generates wide spread domestic media coverage, with 500 media pieces covering the 2017 launch.

The '''Milki''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They are also known as Malik, and found entirely in the [[Awadh]] region. A small number of Milki are also found in [[Karachi]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke&lt;/ref&gt; The Milki, together with the [[Qidwai]], Malik and Chaudhary are one of the four sub-group of a community who collectively form the '''Mian Muslim'''. The Mian Muslim were once a community of substantial landowners in the [[Awadh]] region.&lt;ref&gt; People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 968 to 972 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The Milki get their name from the fact that their ancestors were a class to whom revenue free grants (''milk'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]) of land were made during the period of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. They were given these grants of land as an incentive to settle the land. In [[Unnao District]], they were substantial landowners, and played an important role in the history of that district. 

They were also the scribes, administrators, writers, magistrates, judges. lawyers, chief executive officers and village accountants in the [[Awadh]] region. The Milki were also appointed to the position of clerks and official record keepers by the state. As part of their duties, they learnt [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], economics, administration and taxation. They successfully adapted themselves as scribes and functionaries under the new colonial British. The Milki have much in common with the neighbouring [[Muslim]] community, the [[Muslim Kayasths|Kayatha Muslim]], with whom they share many traditions and customs.&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

The Milki of [[Unnao District]] claim to be [[Siddiqui|Siddiqui Shaikhs]], while those of [[Azamgarh District|Azamgarh]] and [[Ballia District|Ballia]] claim to be of [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] origin. All the various groups of Milki intermarry, and there are also instances of intermarriage with the [[Qidwai]] and [[Muslim Kayasths|Kayastha Muslim]] communities. The Milki are also found in the districts of [[Faizabad District|Faizabad]], [[Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh|Pratapgarh]], [[Barabanki District|Barabanki]] and [[Allahabad District|Allahabad]]. Some Milk are [[Sunni]], while other are [[Shia]]. They speak standard [[Urdu]], although most also have an understanding of the [[Awadhi]] dialect of [[Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt; People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 968 to 972 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of entering [[combat]] without the use of clothing and armor is rare; apart from the social aspects of [[nudity]], the combatant lacks even the basic protection of clothes, for instance when diving for cover or crawling. Also the combatant misses the practicality of hiding/carrying objects in pockets and attached to clothes.

The artistic convention of [[heroic nudity]], however, was established in the [[Art in ancient Greece|art of ancient Greece]] by the Archaic period.

== History ==

=== Celtic peoples ===

[[The Histories (Polybius)|Polybius' Histories]] describe how the [[Gaesatae]], hired by other Celtic peoples, the [[Boii]] and [[Insubres]] as mercenaries to fight the Romans, stood naked at the head of their army at the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225BC.&lt;ref name="pers_Poly"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Histories, book 2, The Gauls Defeated On Their Way Home | author = Polybius|author-link=Polybius | work = perseus.tufts.edu | date = 110 BCE | accessdate = 2016-06-03 | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+2.28&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234 | language =   | at= Book 2 Ch 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] reported other instances of such combat: "Some use iron breast-plates in battle, while others fight naked, trusting only in the protection which nature gives."{{sfn|Stephen Allen|2001|p=3}} Another possible reason for this was to avoid infection of wounds caused by contact with contaminated clothing and debris.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

[[Livy]] tells of how the [[Tolistobogii]] of [[Galatia]] fought naked, being proud of their spilt blood and even widening gashes they received themselves. &lt;ref&gt; [[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita]], Book XXXVIII, Chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julius Caesar]] records in [[de Bello Gallico|his account of the Gallic War]] that the [[Gaul]]s went into battle naked save for their weapons.

Sometimes the soldiers wore no clothing but were covered in war paint, a custom that allegedly gave the [[Picts]] their name.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

== Modern occurrences ==

In some present [[martial arts]] which are designed to be fit for military fighting, full or partial nudity still occurs. The traditional ''donga'' style of [[stick fighting]] practiced by the young warriors, now bearing firearms, of the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo Valley]] [[Surma people|Suri tribe]] of South Sudan and western Ethiopia, is often practiced entirely naked: serious injury is not uncommon, and it is occasionally fatal.{{cn|date=June 2016}} Another example is the stick fighting style of the neighbouring [[Nyangatom people|Nyangatom]], which fight [[bare-chested]]; the goal is to mark the adversary with visible stripes on the back.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In the [[Vietnam War]], [[Vietcong]] [[sapper]]s used to slip through the barbed wire naked or almost naked.{{sfn|Don Winslow|2004|p=367}}

In modern [[Liberia]], soldiers under [[Joshua Blahyi|"General Butt Naked" Joshua Blahyi]] fought naked in order to terrorize their opponents.{{sfn|Tony Tate|2004|p=26}}

The '''Sambia''' people  are a tribe of mountain-dwelling, hunting and horticultural people who inhabit the fringes of the [[Eastern Highlands Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], and are extensively described by the American [[anthropologist]] [[Gilbert Herdt]].&lt;ref name=Herdt&gt;{{harvnb|Herdt|1981|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herdt2&gt;{{harvnb|Herdt|1982|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sambia{{snd}} a [[pseudonym]] created by Herdt himself{{snd}} are well known by cultural anthropologists for their acts of [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] "ritualized homosexuality" and [[semen ingestion]] practices with pubescent boys. In his studies of the Sambia, Herdt describes the people in light of their sexual culture and how their practices shape the masculinities of adolescent Sambia boys.&lt;ref name=Herdt&gt;{{harvnb|Herdt|1981|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full initiation is reported to start with members of the tribe being removed from their mothers at the age of nine.&lt;ref name=gilesreview /&gt; This process is not always voluntary and can involve threats of death.&lt;ref name=gilesreview /&gt; The children are then beaten and stabbed in their nostrils with sticks to make them bleed.&lt;ref name=gilesreview /&gt; In the next stage the children are hit with [[stinging nettles]].&lt;ref name=gilesreview /&gt; The boys are then dressed in ritual clothing and an attempt is made to force them to suck on ritual flutes.&lt;ref name=gilesreview /&gt; The boys are then taken to a [[cult house]] and older boys dance in front of them making sexual gestures.&lt;ref name=gilesreview /&gt; Once it gets darker the younger boys are taken to the dancing ground where they are expected to perform fellatio on the older boys.&lt;ref name=gilesreview&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giles |first=James |date=August 2004 |title=Book Reviews Sambia  Sexual  Culture:  Essays  From  the  Field.

== Male Rites of Passage ==

Male Rites of Passages:

# Maku: This is the first rite of passage for the boys. They are separated from their mothers at this stage, they participate in blood letting (process in which they stick long sticks up their nostrils to make them bleed, and therefore rid themselves of their mothers' presence in them. The Sambia people don't believe that males are born with semen and so, during Maku, the boys participate in "fellatio". They are also required to stick to a strict diet during this time period which is from age 7-10. This stage lasts for three years, from the age 10–13 years old.
# Imbutu: Imbutu is filled with camaraderie, male bonding, and rewards for making it through the first set of Rites. 
# Ipmangwi: During this stage the boys begin to go through puberty, and they no longer need to participate in "fellatio". They also learn gender roles, and how to have appropriate intercourse. Once they have learned this they look for a wife and marry during this stage. It lasts for three years as well, during the ages 13–16.
# Nupusha: During this stage the men get married and have appropriate intercourse. This stage happens once the others are completed, however, they must be at least 16 years old.
# Taiketnyi: They undergo blood letting again during this stage, when their wives have their first menstrual cycle as married women.
# Moondung: This stage is when the women give birth to their first child. This is the final step, and signifies completion of the Rites of passage. They can now be considered full grown respectable men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Cross-Cultural Perspective|last1=Brettell|last2=Sargent|first1=Caroline|first2=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=0-205-24728-8|location=New York|pages=175, 176, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender roles and sexuality ==

The Sambia people believe in the necessity of gender roles within their culture. Relationships between men and women of all ages, within this tribe, are complex, with many rules and restrictions. For example, boys are removed from their mothers at age seven, to strip them of contact with their mothers. They even perform a ritual called "blood letting" on the boys who have just been isolated from their mothers to rid them of their mother's contaminated blood that has a presence within them. This separation is due to their fear of the women in the tribe, as men are taught at a young age about the women's ability to emasculate and manipulate men. The women possess what the sambia call ''tingu'', through which they use their manipulation skills. To combat the women's sorcery, the men go through rites of passage, in which they learn to safely have intercourse with women without becoming metaphorically trapped. The women are also separated from the men when they go through their menstrual cycle. During this time they stay in the "menarche hut" because of the belief that the women's powers are strengthened during this time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Nazrul Islam, a panel mayor of Narayanganj City Corporation who was in good terms with Mayor Dr. Selina Hayat Ivy, with three associates and his driver went missing from Fatullah area of Narayanganj on 27 April 2014. His lawyer Chandan Kumar Sarker who was following the car of Nazrul Islam, also went missing on the same day with his driver from the same place. Within one week of the event, the dead bodies of the victims were seen floating on the [[Shitalakshya River]] on which the [[Narayanganj District]] stands on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shitalakkhya: River of the floating dead |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/news2014/shitalakkhya-river-of-the-floating-dead-22482 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=3 May 2014 |accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cases were filed in connection with the murders.

== Investigation ==
Several probe committees were formed by the government, Police and RAB. [[Criminal Investigation Department (Bangladesh)|CID]] was given the charge to investigate the case as per the directive of the High Court while the government assigned Detective Branch of Police with the task.

[[File:Purity-Rings.jpg|thumb|right|[[Purity ring]]s are worn by some [[youth]] committed to the practice of sexual abstinence.&lt;ref name="O'Brien2009"/&gt;]]
'''Sexual abstinence''' or '''sexual restraint''' is the practice of refraining from some or all aspects of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral, or religious reasons.  [[Asexuality]] is distinct from sexual abstinence; and [[celibacy]] is sexual abstinence generally motivated by factors such as an individual's personal or religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (3d ed. 1992), entries for ''celibacy'' and thence ''abstinence''&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual abstinence before [[marriage]] is required in some societies by social norms, or, in some countries, even by laws, and is considered part of [[chastity]].

Abstinence may be voluntary (when an individual chooses not to engage in sexual activity due to moral, religious, philosophical, etc. reasons), an involuntary result of social circumstances (when one cannot find any willing [[sexual partner]]s), or legally mandated (e.g. in countries where sexual activity outside marriage is illegal, in prisons etc.).

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

The ancient world discouraged [[promiscuity]] for both health and social reasons.&lt;ref name=Uta&gt;{{cite book |title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven - the Catholic Church and Sexuality|author=Uta Ranke.Heinman|publisher=Penguin Books USA|year=1988|isbn=0 385 26527 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BCE) sex should be practiced in the winter, but not the summer, but was harmful to male health in every season because the loss of semen was dangerous, hard to control and both physically and spiritually exhausting, but had no effect on females.&lt;ref name="Uta" /&gt; This idea may have been merged with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ideas of [[good and evil]] in a philosophy known as [[gnosticism]], which influenced [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|Christian]] and [[Mariwan Halabjaee|Islamic]] attitudes to sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Uta" /&gt; But others stated that the Christian religion's hold on to the ideal of sexual abstinence prior to the appearing of gnosticism and Zoroastrianism and its root are to be found in the Old Testament (which is the base of the New Testament) in which  virginity was required by law and marriage was especially protected (see Deuteronomy chapter 22).

Throughout history, and especially prior to the 20th century, there have been those who have held that sexual abstinence confers numerous health benefits. For males, lack of abstinence was thought to cause a reduction of vitality. In modern times, the argument has been phrased in biological terms, claiming that loss of [[semen]] through ejaculation results in a depletion of vital nutrients such as [[lecithin]] and [[phosphorus]], which are also found at high levels in the [[Human brain|brain]]. Conservation of the semen allegedly allows it to be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream and aid in the healthy development of the body. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Along these lines, the noted German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spoke of the positive physiological effects of abstinence: "The reabsorption of semen by the blood ... perhaps prompts the stimulus of power, the unrest of all forces towards the overcoming of resistances ... The feeling of power has so far mounted highest in abstinent priests and hermits" (quoted by Walter Kaufman in his classic, ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'', p.&amp;nbsp;222). Before the "[[sexual revolution]]" of the 1960s, it was commonly believed by members of the medical profession that numerous mental and physical diseases in men were caused primarily by loss of [[nutrient]]s through seminal discharge, and that the deliberate conservation of this substance would lead to increased health, vitality, and intellectual prowess. This also applied to masturbation, which was also thought to lead to [[bedwetting]] and [[Pseudoscience|hairy palms]].

Some advantages in favor of sexual abstinence were also claimed by Walter Siegmeister, better known as Dr. Raymond W. Bernard A.B., M.A., PhD, an early 20th-century American alternative health, esoteric writer, author and mystic, who formed part of the alternative reality subculture. In his essay entitled ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100818043434/http://ktk.ru/~cm/contin.htm Science discovers the physiological value of continence]'' (1957) he states:

: "[I]t is clear that there is an important internal [[physiology|physiological]] relation between the secretions of the sex [[gland]]s and the [[central nervous system]], that the loss of these secretions, voluntarily or involuntarily, exercises a detrimental effect on the nutrition and vitality of the nerves and brain, while, on the other hand, the conservation of these secretions has a vitalizing effect on the nervous system, a regenerating effect on the [[endocrine glands]][,] and a rejuvenating effect on the organism as a whole."

Historically, there has been a swing from the [[Libertine|sexually liberal]] end of the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the chaste values of the early [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This was then followed by a new [[Religious fanaticism|puritanism]] from the late Victorian era to the mid-1900s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This important transformation often colors discussion of sexual behavior in the later 20th century. [[World War I]] began a return to sexual freedom and indulgence, but more often than not, the appearance of conforming to the earlier moral values of abstinence before marriage was retained.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} With the conclusion of [[World War II]], the societal importance of abstinence declined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The advent of the first [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive pill]] and widely available [[antibiotics]] suppressed many consequences of wide and free sexual behavior,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} while social morals were also changing. By the 1970s, abandonment of premarital chastity was no longer taboo in the majority of western societies, and the reverse became true.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Some cultural groups continued to place a value on the moral purity of an abstainer, but abstinence was caught up in a wider reevaluation of [[moral values]].

During the early 20th century, prominent [[feminist]] and [[birth control]] advocate [[Margaret Sanger]] argued that abstinence from sexual activity led to greater endurance and strength, and was a sign of the best of the species:

: "Though sex cells are placed in a part of the anatomy for the essential purpose of easily expelling them into the female for the purpose of reproduction, there are other elements in the sexual fluid which are the essence of blood, nerve, brain, and muscle. When redirected into the building and strengthening of these, we find men or women of the greatest endurance and greatest magnetic power. A girl can waste her creative powers by brooding over a love affair to the extent of exhausting her system, with the results not unlike the effects of masturbation and debauchery."&lt;ref name="Sanger"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=304923.xml | title = What Every Girl Should Know: Sexual Impulses — Part II | first = Margaret | last = Sanger | date = 29 December 1912 | accessdate = 6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During fertile period==
[[File:Abstinence during fertile period.png|thumb|right|200px|Schematic indicating the fertile period of a woman]]
Sexual abstinence can be practiced during the period in which the woman is fertile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contraception.about.com/od/contraceptionoverview/p/conception.htm Abstinence during infertile period to prevent conception]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before marriage==
=== Premarital chastity ===
{{Main article| Chastity}}
In most cultural, ethical, and religious contexts, [[sexual intercourse|sex]] within [[marriage]] is not considered to be contrary to notions of chastity.  Some religious systems prohibit sexual activities between a person and anyone other than a spouse of that person, as have, in the past, legal systems and societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. In such contexts, sexual abstinence was prescribed for unmarried individuals for the purpose of chastity. ''Chastity'' has been used as a synonym for sexual abstinence, they are similar but with different behavior and restrictions.

===Legal issues===
In some countries any [[sexual activity outside marriage]] is illegal. Such laws are mostly tied to [[religion]] and the legal and political traditions within the particular jurisdiction. Laws differ greatly from country to country. In some Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordan|first=Mary|title=Searching for Freedom, Chained by the Law|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/20/AR2008082003754.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allArticles/807B10B75C9F425487257A740056F9CD?OpenDocument |title=Afghanistan sees rise in ‘dancing boys’ exploitation |work=The Washington Post |date=9 September 2012 |author=Ernesto Londoño |location=DEHRAZI, Afghanistan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510180701/http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allArticles/807B10B75C9F425487257A740056F9CD?OpenDocument |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |title=Home |publisher=AIDSPortal |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081026065259/http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |archivedate=26 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=travel.state.gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |publisher=Travel.state.gov |accessdate=3 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801084310/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |archivedate=1 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran,&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; Kuwait,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2f5665ae20b956cb8025675a0033cafb?Opendocument |title=United Nations Human Rights Website - Treaty Bodies Database - Document - Summary Record - Kuwait |publisher=Unhchr.ch |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maldives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Maldives|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ja-Ma/Maldives.html|publisher=Every Culture|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19049000 | work=BBC News | title=Morocco: Should pre-marital sex be legal? | date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauritania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154358.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Mauritania |publisher=State.gov |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Arab Emirates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dubaifaqs.com/education-dubai.php |title=Education in Dubai |publisher=Dubaifaqs.com |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Briton faces jail for sex on Dubai beach|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/briton-faces-jail-for-sex-on-dubai-beach-863918.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 July 2008|first1=Terri|last1=Judd|first2=Nikolina|last2=Sajn|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Sex outside of marriage is a criminal offense here," PH ambassador to Qatar warns Pinoys|url=http://www.spot.ph/the-feed/49282/ph-ambassador-to-qatar-warns-pinoys-sex-outside-of-marriage-is-a-criminal-offense-here/|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=SPOT.ph|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/28/idUSL28849488._CH_.2400 |title=Sudan must rewrite rape laws to protect victims |publisher=Reuters |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yemen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47387b712f.html/ |title=Women's Rights in the Middle East and North Africa - Yemen |publisher=Unhcr.org |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.

=== Abstinence-only sex education in the United States ===
{{Globalize |date=February 2013 |discuss=Talk:Sexual abstinence#Globalize }}
{{Main article|Abstinence-only sex education}}
Abstinence-only sex education is a form of sex education that teaches abstinence from sex, and often excludes many other types of sexual and reproductive health education, particularly regarding birth control and safe sex.  Education programs which focus exclusively on abstinence have hardly been shown to delay sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/06/5/gr060504.html The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy] December 2003, Volume 6, Number 5 By Cynthia Dailard&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs promote sexual abstinence until marriage and often also condemn the use of contraceptives. [[Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of contraceptives as well as abstinence.

Organizations such as [[SIECUS]] have called abstinence-only programs "fear-based," and "designed to control young people’s sexual behavior by instilling fear, shame, and guilt." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siecus.org/pubs/tsha_scaredchaste.pdf 6-SHA2_Interior&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513043100/http://www.siecus.org/pubs/tsha_scaredchaste.pdf |date=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Judith Levine]] has argued that there might be a natural tendency of abstinence educators to escalate their messages: "Like advertising, which must continually jack up its seduction just to stay visible as other advertising proliferates, abstinence education had to make sex scarier and scarier and, at the same time, chastity sweeter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harmful to Minors]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these criticisms, federal government support has made abstinence the [[de facto]] focus of sex education in the [[United States]], so that opponents frequently adopt the line that abstinence education is acceptable only if it is combined with other methods, such as instruction in the use of condoms, and easy availability thereof. Most nations of [[Western Europe]] use more comprehensive measures, and in sharp contrast to the heated discussion in the U.S., abstinence is hardly discussed as an educational measure.

A [[U.S. federal government]]-promoted abstinence-only program was aimed at teens in 1981 in order to discourage premarital sex and unwanted pregnancies. However, recent studies  conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, showed ineffectiveness of this [https://web.archive.org/web/20140703152443/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/Family_Support/abstinence.asp program].  The Responsible Education About Life Act was introduced by Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New Jersey|NJ]]) and Representatives [[Barbara Lee]] (D-[[California|CA]]) and [[Christopher Shays]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Connecticut|CT]]) to support age-appropriate sexual education. This program is focused to provide teenagers with science-based information on sexual health, so that they can make a sound decision regarding their sex-life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.xxx-sextoys.net/post/congress-abstinence.html Congress changed its mind on abstinence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025082806/http://info.xxx-sextoys.net/post/congress-abstinence.html |date=25 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[George W. Bush]] [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]] expanded abstinence programs from teens to adults, by introducing programs to encourage unmarried adults to remain abstinent until marriage.&lt;ref&gt;New Bush Administration Policy Promotes Abstinence Until Marriage Among People in their 20s, Guttmacher Policy Review 2006, Volume 9, Number 4. Available online at http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/4/gpr090423.html&lt;/ref&gt; Family-planning advocates and researchers denounced the program as unrealistic, due to the rising age of first-time marriage in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Boerner, Heather. Questioning Abstinence Until Marriage.

In 2010, University of Pennsylvania researchers released a model study showing that abstinence programs can be effective. The study randomly assigned some middle-school students to an eight-hour abstinence curriculum and others to sex-ed programs that included contraceptives and mixed messages. Penn researchers found that the abstinence-only offering reduced subsequent sexual activity by one-third more than other programs.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, Charles A. "Encouraging the Abstinent Majority."

The advent of [[AIDS]] helped build a more favorable view of abstinence. However, a review of 13 U.S. sex-abstinence programs involving over 15,000 people by Oxford University found that they do not stop [[risky sexual behavior]], or help in the prevention of unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6927733.stm|title=No-sex programmes 'not working'|publisher=BBC News|date=2 August 2007|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found that abstinence-only education does little to affect the "age of sexual initiation; number of sexual partners; and rates of sexual abstinence, condom use,
vaginal sex, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)" &lt;ref&gt;

Movements such as [[True Love Waits]] in America, which ask teenagers to refrain from sex before marriage, are heavily subscribed, but surveys of sexual behavior indicate an increase in the popularity of oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lisa Remez |date=Nov–Dec 2000 |title=Oral Sex among Adolescents: Is It Sex or Is It Abstinence? |journal=Family Planning Perspectives |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=298–304 |url=http://www.zmag.org/0007.htm |doi=10.2307/2648199 |pmid=11138867 |jstor=2648199 |publisher=Family Planning Perspectives, Vol. 32, No. 6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050421032424/http://www.zmag.org/0007.htm |archivedate=21 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of abstinence on society ===
[[Alfred Kinsey]] is widely regarded as the first and among the most influential figures in American [[sexology]]; his research is cited as having paved the way for a deeper exploration into sexuality among sexologists and the general public, and as having liberated [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =978-1592131518|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|year=2005|pages=37–43|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=|author=Janice M. Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zastrow"&gt;{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link=Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|pages=227–228|accessdate = 15 March 2014| isbn = 0495095109 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=tco4YjyZab4C&amp;pg=PT248&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alfred Kinsey sexual ignorance led to real suffering in society and that [[sexual liberation]], as opposed to sexual abstinence, was the key to both a strong marriage and a happy life. Kinsey believed that abstinence was a sexual dysfunction: "The only kinds of sexual dysfunction are [[abstinence]], [[celibacy]] and delayed marriage."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/filmmore/pt.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. D. Unwin]] was a British ethnologist and social anthropologist at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]]. Joseph Unwin wrote several books including ''Sex and Culture'',  (1934). In ''Sex and Culture'' Unwin studied 80 primitive tribes and 6 known civilizations through 5,000 years of history and found a positive correlation between the cultural achievement of a people and the amount of sexual restraint which they observed. The author finds that the most culturally successful groups always exhibit lifelong monogamous relationships which include sexual abstinence outside of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"Any human society is free to choose either to display great energy or to enjoy sexual freedom; the evidence is that it cannot do both for more than one generation." Unwin, J. D. (1934) ''Sex and Culture,'' p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Unwin, after a nation becomes prosperous it becomes increasingly liberal with regard to sexual morality and as a result loses its cohesion, its impetus and its purpose, ultimately having a negative effect on society: "The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs."&lt;ref&gt;Unwin, J. D. (1927). "Monogamy as a Condition of Social Energy,” ''The Hibbert Journal,'' Vol. XXV, p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term abstinence as a lifestyle==
[[Image:Young monks of Drepung.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Young [[Buddhist monk]]s in [[Tibet]]. Celibacy is required for some religious orders like [[Jainism]]]]
Lifelong (or at least long-term) abstinence, often associated with philosophical or religious [[asceticism]], is distinguished from chastity before marriage. Abstinence is often viewed as an act of self-control over the natural desire to have sex. The display of the strength of character allows the abstainer to set an example for those not able to contain their "base urges". At other times, abstinence has been seen as a great social skill practiced by those who refuse to engage with the material and physical world. Some groups and teachers that propose sexual abstinence consider it an essential means to reach a particular intellectual or spiritual condition, or that chastity allows one to achieve a required self-control or self-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=979394 SSRN-The Hermeneutics of Sexual Order by L. Khan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Sexual abstinence is required for some religious orders, such as [[Catholic]] priests, nuns, monks. Although many individuals abstain from sex for reasons such as religion or morality, some individuals may simply have a dislike of sex ([[antisexualism]]), or are simply not interested in it ([[asexuality]]). They may view sexual activity as an unnecessary part of human life. As with other lifestyle choices, this attitude toward sexual activity and relationships can vary. Some who choose such a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] still accept sexual activity for [[reproduction]], some engage in romantic [[intimate relationship|relationship]]s, and some engage in [[masturbation]]. This is a long paragraph and needs refs to make it relevant --&gt;

==Abstinence in religions==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Some religions regard [[chastity]] as a [[virtue]] expected of faithful adherents. This usually includes abstinence from sex for the unmarried, and fidelity to a [[marriage]] partner.

In some religions, some groups of people are expected to remain unmarried and to abstain from sex completely. These groups include [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and [[priest]]s in various sects of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Christianity. Chastity is required of the respective [[clergy|sacerdotal]] orders. The [[Shakers]], on the other hand, impose chastity in the form of celibacy for all members, even forgoing procreation such as the case with the [[castration cult]].

===Christianity===
There are many Christians who teach that [[fornication|sexual intercourse is meant to take place within the context of marriage]], and that sexual abstinence is the norm outside of that. But for married couples, [[Paul of Tarsus]] wrote that they should not deprive each other, except for a short time for devotion to [[prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207.3-5;&amp;version=31; 1 Corinthians 7.3-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholicism defines chastity as the virtue that moderates the sexual appetite.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologia'' I-II q. 60 a. 5; ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', "Chastity"&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried Catholics express chastity through sexual abstinence.  Sexual intercourse within marriage is considered chaste when it retains the twofold significance of union and procreation.&lt;ref&gt;''Humanae vitae'' 12&lt;/ref&gt; See also the [[Evangelical counsels]]. The [[Methodist Church]] teaches that "Although all persons are sexual beings whether or not they are married, sexual relations are only clearly affirmed in the marriage bond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1728|title=Human Sexuality|year=2014|work=[[The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church]]|publisher=The United Methodist Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orthodox Church]] teaches chastity until marriage. But even then, in accordance with the teaching of the Apostle Paul, periods of abstinence are encouraged among married couples. Traditionally, Orthodox spouses abstain from physical relations on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays the eves of [[Great Feasts]] and throughout the four lenten periods ([[Great Lent]]. [[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]] and [[Dormition Fast]]).

However, some churches, such as the [[United Church of Christ]], are "liberal in their approaches, believing that individuals must decide for themselves how to express their sexual nature."&lt;ref name="Buehler2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Stephanie|title=What Every Mental Health Professional Needs to Know About Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccI7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=19 June 2014|date=29 July 2013|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826171214|page=55|quote=Religions notably vary in their view of sexuality and its expression, especially regarding premarital sex, sexual orientation, and masturbation. Some religions, such as the United Church of Christ, are liberal in their approaches, believing that individuals must decide for themselves how to express their sexual nature. Others, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormonism) and Catholicism, take an austere view of premarital experimentation and masturbation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
The [[India]]n tradition of [[Brahmacharya]] places great emphasis on abstinence as a way of harnessing the energy of body and mind towards the goal of [[spirituality|spiritual]] realization. In males, the semen ([[Vīrya]]) is considered sacred, and its preservation (except when used for procreation) and conversion into higher life-energy ([[Ojas]]) is considered essential for the development of enhanced intellectual and [[spirituality|spiritual]] capacities.

The blending of sexual and spiritual is portrayed in Hindu iconography, as seen in ubiquitous phallic and vaginal iconography in Hindu temples and for instance in the Kharjuraho and Konarak medieval temples, where thousands of couples having sex in endless positions, and with the gods, are carved in deep bas-relief.  However, these depictions of sex are not generally understood to be a license for free sexual practices, but are instead meant to celebrate procreation as an integral part of existence in the universe.  In actual practice, there is a strong societal taboo against pre-marital sex for both males and females, which still exists today in Hindu cultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Islam===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Islam forbids [[zina|intercourse outside of marriage]] (''zina''). However, maintaining celibacy as an act of piety is not recognized, while marriage for all who are able is strongly encouraged. Abstinence is practiced during the time of a woman's [[menstruation]]. Abstinence from sexual intercourse is also practiced from dawn to dusk during days where fasting is observed. Also in the time of Hajj people are not allowed to have sexual relationships, because their body has to stay pure while performing pilgrimage.

===Jainism===
{{Main|Brahmacharya#Brahmacharya in Jainism}}
[[File:In-jain.svg|alt=Jain Flag Photo|thumb|Green colour in the [[Jain flag]] stands for ''brahmacharya''{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=iv}}]]
''[[Brahmacharya]]'' is one of the five [[Ethics in Jainism|major vows]] prescribed for the ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvakā]]'' (layman) and ascetics in [[Jainism]]. For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of ''brahmacharya'' requires remaining sexually faithful to one's chosen partner ([[fidelity]]). For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Brahmacarya |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/brahmacarya.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jain monastic tradition, ''brahmacharya'' implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage. For a lay Jain, it represents a virtuous lifestyle devoid of constant sexual urges, that also includes simple living, meditation and other behaviors.

===Judaism===
{{further information|Abstinence in Judaism}}
[[Judaism]] forbids intercourse outside marriage (which is termed ''znut'' or promiscuity), but has no ideal of chastity. Within marriage abstinence is also required during and following a woman's menstruation. The husband is not allowed to deprive sex from his wife, even if she is not fertile (known as ''mitzvat onah'').

==Associated practices==
{{Further information|Silver Ring Thing}}
Among some groups of people, the wearing of a [[purity ring]] is a reminder to oneself and others, that they are practicing sexual abstinence.&lt;ref name="O'Brien2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Jodi|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412909167|page=155|quote=In this subset of abstinence-only education programs, young people vow chastity until marriage and wear a "purity ring" to demonstrate a commitment to sexual abstinence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Historically, some individuals were said to wear a [[chastity belt]], a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse. They were used to protect the wearer from rape or temptation.  Some devices have been designed with additional features to prevent masturbation.  Chastity belts have been created for males and females, ostensibly for the purpose of chastity. This needs refs to make it relevant--&gt;
==Health effects==
{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}

Abstinence prevents the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], [[HPV]] and others.&lt;ref name="CDC2013P"&gt;{{cite web|title=How You Can Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Early sexual debut is associated with certain long-term negative sexual health outcomes, including increased sexual risk behaviors and problems in sexual functioning. Late initiation was also associated with sexual problems, especially among men."&lt;ref&gt;TGM Sandfort, M Orr, JS Hirsch, J Santelli, "[http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2006.097444 Long-term health correlates of timing of sexual debut: Results from a national US study]', ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the earliest parks in Canada to incorporate a neighborhood-wide storm water treatment facility into its design. Located east of Lower Sherbourne Street, the 1.47 &lt;ref name="waterfrontoronto"&gt;''http://www.waterfrontoronto.ca/sherbourne_common Sherbourne Common, Toronto Official Page''&lt;/ref&gt;  hectare park spans two city blocks. It stretches from Lake Ontario to Lake Shore Boulevard in the north.
[[File:Sherbourne Common July 2012.jpg|thumb|left|View of "Light Showers" art sculpture.]]

Sherbourne Common consists of a 240&lt;ref name="urbanntoronto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="waterfrontoronto" /&gt;  meter long water channel featuring three art sculptures that rise nine meters, called "Light Showers", by artist Jill Anholt.&lt;ref name="urbanntoronto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="waterfrontoronto" /&gt; The sculptures were made off-site utilizing reinforced fiberglass molds that were filled with agila concrete. In total, there are 182 planted trees, 108 Pacific Sunset Maple, 45 Red Oak, and 29 American Beech. The storm water treatment facility is located in the basement of the park’s Pavilion. The plant treats the water and then returns it into the park through the three art installations.&lt;ref name="waterfrontoronto" /&gt;

The '''State of Vietnam referendum of 1955''' determined the future [[form of government]] of the [[State of Vietnam]], the nation that was to become the [[Republic of Vietnam]] (widely known as [[South Vietnam]]). It was contested by Prime Minister [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Ngô Đình Diệm]], who proposed a [[republic]], and former emperor [[Bảo Đại]]. Bảo Đại had abdicated as emperor in 1945 and at the time of the referendum held the title of head of state. Though published counts showed Diệm winning the election with 98.2% of the vote, the referendum was widely marred by  [[electoral fraud]]. In the capital, [[Saigon]], Diệm was credited with more than 600,000 votes, although only 450,000 people were on the electoral roll.&lt;ref name="karnow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;Tucker, p.366.&lt;/ref&gt; He accumulated tallies in excess of 90% of the registered voters, even in rural regions where opposition groups prevented voting.

The referendum was the last phase in the power struggle between Bảo Đại and his prime minister. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm and had frequently attempted to undermine him, having appointed him only because he was a conduit to American aid. At the time, the country was going through a period of insecurity, as Vietnam had been temporarily partitioned as a result of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] that ended the [[First Indochina War]]. The State of Vietnam controlled the southern half of the country, pending national elections that were intended to reunify the country under a common government. Still, the [[Vietnamese National Army]] was not in full control of southern Vietnam; the [[Cao Đài]] and [[Hòa Hảo]] religious sects ran their own administrations in the countryside supported by private armies, while the [[Bình Xuyên]] organised crime syndicate controlled the streets of Saigon. Despite interference from these groups, Bảo Đại, and even French officials, Diệm managed to subdue the private armies and consolidate government control over the country by mid-1955.

Emboldened by his success, Diệm began to plot Bảo Đại's downfall. He scheduled a referendum for 23 October 1955 and pushed Bảo Đại out of the political scene, hindering the former emperor's attempts to derail the poll. In the period leading up to the vote, campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused on personal attacks against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons of the head of state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote. After his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu|Ngô Đình Nhu]] successfully rigged the poll, Diệm proclaimed himself president of the newly created [[Republic of Vietnam]].

==Background==
{{Main|Geneva Conference (1954)|Operation Passage to Freedom|Battle of Saigon (1955)}}
The defeat of the [[French Army]] at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Điện Biên Phủ]] in 1954, followed by the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]], led to a divided Vietnam. The French-backed [[State of Vietnam]], led by former Emperor [[Bảo Đại]], provisionally held control south of the 17th parallel. [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]]'s [[Viet Minh]] held the north under the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], which Hồ Chí Minh had proclaimed in 1945. The agreements stated that nationwide elections were to be held in 1956 to unify the country under a common government. In July 1954, during the transition period, Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1954, the border was closed by the [[International Control Commission]], after a period of 300 days during which free passage between both halves of Vietnam had been allowed. Under the Geneva Accords, anti-communist military personnel were obliged to evacuate to the south, while communist forces were to be moved north. Civilians were free to move to whichever zone they preferred. During the 300 days, Diệm and U.S. [[CIA]] adviser Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]] staged a campaign to convince people to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Diệm's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan "God has gone south". Between 800,000 and 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;people migrated to the south, mostly Catholics. At the start of 1955, [[French Indochina]] was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south.&lt;ref&gt;Maclear, pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 43–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Diệm had little authority beyond the gates of his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing the head of state to be weak and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 20–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; During the transition period, the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps|French Expeditionary Corps]] maintained a presence in South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 22–25, 43, 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diệm faced challenges to his authority from four more groups. The [[Hòa Hảo]] and [[Cao Đài]] religious sects had private armies that controlled the [[Mekong Delta]] and the areas west of [[Saigon]], respectively. The [[Bình Xuyên]] was an armed, organised crime empire that controlled much of Saigon with a 40,000&amp;nbsp;strong private army, while the Vietminh still controlled much of the rural area. Diệm's [[Vietnamese National Army]] (VNA) was led by General [[Nguyễn Văn Hinh]], a French citizen who loathed and frequently disobeyed him. Bảo Đại sold the operating license of the national police to the Bình Xuyên, effectively putting administrative control of the police in the hands of a crime syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid growing French and US skepticism of his ability to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the [[Battle of Saigon (1955)|Battle for Saigon]]. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss him in the middle of the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 71–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm;&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buoyed by his successes, and fueled by increased hatred of both the French and Bảo Đại after their attempts to prevent him from dismantling the Bình Xuyên,&lt;ref name=c677&gt;Chapman, p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diệm became more confident as he went about consolidating his hold on power. On 15 May, Diệm abolished Bảo Đại's Imperial Guard; its 5,000 men became the 11th and 42nd Infantry Regiments of the VNA. Diệm then stripped Bảo Đại of his extensive crown lands. On 15 June, Diệm had the Council of the Royal Family at Huế declare that Bảo Đại be stripped of his powers, and that he, Diệm, be made president.&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt; Bảo Đại's relatives condemned him for abdicating as head of state, and for his links with France and the Bình Xuyên.&lt;ref name=c678&gt;Chapman, p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have speculated that the royals agreed to turn on Bảo Đại so Diệm would not seize their assets.&lt;ref name=c678/&gt;

==Organization of the referendum==
[[File:Major-general-lansdale.jpg|Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]], who helped Diệm in his campaign|170px|thumb|alt=Man with dark hair and moustache in a dress uniform, consisting of a military suit and tie, sitting at a table, with two stars on each lapel indicating his rank, in front of a world map on a wall.]]
On 7 July 1955, the first anniversary of his installation as prime minister, Diệm announced that a national referendum would be held to determine the future of the country.&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt; On 16 July, Diệm publicly announced his intention to not take part in the reunification elections: "We will not be tied down by the [Geneva] treaty that was signed against the wishes of the Vietnamese people."&lt;ref name=c694&gt;Chapman, p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diệm contended that the Communists would never allow free elections in the north, so therefore South Vietnam must strike out on its own and establish a separate, non-Communist state.&lt;ref name=c694/&gt; This was echoed by the Saigon press, which ran articles assailing communist elections as shambolic, rigged, and meaningless;&lt;ref name=c694/&gt; at the time, the northern half of Vietnam had a greater population than the south. A month earlier, North Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] wrote to Saigon asking to begin negotiations over the specific details of the elections. While the Americans were happy to avoid elections because of fears of a communist victory, they hoped that Diệm would enter the dialogue over planning matters and wait for North Vietnam to object to a proposal, and thus use it to blame Ho [Chi Minh] for violating the Geneva Accords.&lt;ref name=c694/&gt; The Americans had earlier advised Diệm, who had been acting in defiance of Bảo Đại, that continued aid was contingent on Diệm establishing a legal basis for usurping the head of state's power.&lt;ref name=c679&gt;Chapman, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 1955, Diệm announced the referendum would be held on 23 October.&lt;ref name=c697&gt;Chapman, p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt; The election was open to men and women aged 18 or over, and the government arranged to have a polling station set up for every 1,000 registered voters.&lt;ref name=c697/&gt;&lt;ref name=mi206/&gt; The poll was contested by Bảo Đại, who had spent much of his time in France and advocated a monarchy, and Diệm, who ran on a republican platform.&lt;ref name=karnow/&gt; According to historian Jessica Chapman, it was a choice between "the country's obsolete emperor and its far-from-popular prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem".&lt;ref name=c671&gt;Chapman, p. 671.&lt;/ref&gt; In announcing the referendum, Diệm portrayed his decision as being motivated by a love of democracy and popular discontent with the rule of Bảo Đại. The prime minister cited a plethora of petitions from various social, religious, and political groups calling on him to stage a plebiscite to remove Bảo Đại, claiming he was motivated by these "legitimate and democratic" sentiments.&lt;ref name=c691/&gt; Lansdale cautioned Diệm against electoral fraud, confident that Diệm would win a free election: "While I'm away I don't want to suddenly read that you have won by 99.99%. I would know that it's rigged then." U.S. officials thought that a fair election would have seen Diệm poll between 60% and 70% of the vote.&lt;ref name="karnow"&gt;Karnow, p. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Elysee Accords and the subsequent legislation that created the State of Vietnam in 1949, Bảo Đại's position as head of state was neither permanent nor indefinite. Sovereignty was presumed to rest solely upon the people, with Bảo Đại being a mere conduit. As a result, the referendum itself was within the law.&lt;ref name=mi205&gt;Miller, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm had not been elected to his post, so he saw the referendum as an opportunity to rebuff opponents, who claimed that he was undemocratic and autocratic. The event also gave Diệm an opportunity to boost his prestige by defeating Bảo Đại in a head-to-head contest.&lt;ref name=mi205/&gt; It was previously agreed that a National Assembly would be elected first, but Diệm went ahead with the plebiscite, which meant that he would have total power if he deposed Bảo Đại before a legislature was formed.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 204–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. diplomats were concerned that the move would be seen as a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice.&lt;ref name=mi206&gt;Miller, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c695/&gt; Ambassador [[G. Frederick Reinhardt]] informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade.&lt;ref name=c695&gt;Chapman, p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 695–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.&lt;ref name=c673&gt;Chapman, p. 673.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having declared his disdain for the 1956 reunification elections, Diệm saw the referendum as the first step in creating a long-term state to rule over South Vietnam. He repeatedly said that the creation of a legislature and a constitution for his new state would follow the referendum.&lt;ref name=c695/&gt;

Diệm reportedly saw the poll as an opportunity to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.&lt;ref name=c694/&gt;

One of Diệm's main themes was that the referendum would usher in a new era of unprecedented democracy: "This shall be but the first step made by our people in the free use of our political rights."&lt;ref name=c691&gt;Chapman, p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the poll, Diệm said: "This 23 October, for the first time in our country's history, our men and women will exercise one of many basic civil rights of a democracy, the right to vote."&lt;ref name=c692/&gt; A government proclamation four days before the poll said: "Dear compatriots, proclaim your will forcefully! Go forward firmly in the path of Freedom, Independence and Democracy!"&lt;ref name=c692/&gt;

==Campaign==
Diệm ran a personal attack campaign against the head of state, for whom campaigning was prohibited.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; The army and national police went about enforcing the ban on pro-Bảo Đại and anti-Diệm activities.&lt;ref name=m54&gt;Moyar, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Police went from door to door, explaining the consequences of failing to vote.&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt; They organized conferences in rural villages and addressed the populace with loudspeakers. In general, Diệm's line of attack was to portray Bảo Đại as a drunken womanizer who was preoccupied with immoral pleasures and unconcerned with the problems of the populace.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;&lt;ref name=m54/&gt;&lt;ref name=c684&gt;Chapman, p. 684.&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam's monarchic tradition was built on [[Confucianism]] and the emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven]], and Diệm's campaign claimed Bảo Đại had lost this mandate through his debauched lifestyle.&lt;ref name="c684"/&gt; According to [[Joseph Buttinger]], who was based in Vietnam as the second in command at the [[International Rescue Committee]], the methods used to influence the poll were "outrageous".&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt; Donald Lancaster, a journalist who covered the poll, said "Whereas Bao Dai was given no opportunity to defend himself, the government-controlled press proceeded to overwhelm him with scurrilous abuse."&lt;ref name=c672&gt;Chapman, p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm later banned Bảo Đại from entering the State of Vietnam.&lt;ref name=b153&gt;Brownell, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diệm's advertising included the parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại through the streets of Saigon, depicted with [[bags of money]] on his shoulders, a [[deck of cards]] in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of [[cognac]] in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m54/&gt; In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials.&lt;ref name=m54/&gt; Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated,&lt;ref name=butt/&gt; while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.&lt;ref name=c685&gt;Chapman, p. 685.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walls and public transport vehicles were plastered with slogans, including "Beware of the evil king Bảo Đại's preference for gambling, women, wine, milk, and butter. Those who vote for him betray their country."&lt;ref name=m54/&gt; Aside from referring to his opulent lifestyle, other slogans such as "Bao Dai, puppet king selling his country", and "Bao Dai, master keeper of gambling dens and brothels",&lt;ref name="c684"/&gt; referred to his alleged softness towards the communists. The radio was used to verbally abuse Bảo Đại, who was accused of treason and corruption in these broadcasts.&lt;ref name=b153/&gt;

On the other hand, the bachelor Diệm was described as the "hero of the people" and "father of all children".&lt;ref name=m54/&gt; The slogans exhorted the populace to vote for the prime minister because "To vote for the revolutionary man Ngo Dinh Diem is to build a society of welfare and justice". They portrayed Diệm as a patriotic and nationalist anti-communist, proclaiming "To kill communists, depose the king, [and] struggle against colonialists is a citizen's duty in Free Vietnam."&lt;ref name="c684"/&gt;

Diệm's government-controlled press overwhelmed Bảo Đại with endless personal propaganda attacks, with special editions of newspapers being devoted to polemical biographical accounts of the former emperor.&lt;ref name=butt/&gt; This allowed Diệm's campaign to condemn Bảo Đại with much more salacious detail than was possible through mere slogans. This started in August when the daily newspaper ''Thoi Dai'' started a three-week series that disseminated unsubstantiated and scandalous details about Bảo Đại's life. These were written by editorialist Hong Van, who called Bảo Đại a "dung beetle who sold his country for personal glory".&lt;ref name="c684"/&gt; Van claimed Bảo Đại was the illegitimate son of Emperor [[Khải Định]], alleging Khải Định had been infertile and married a maid, before claiming the maid's son, by another man, as his own.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 684–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper claimed Bảo Đại was "big like a lubber, had many children, and was very fond of women" while Khải Định was uncomfortable with females, hinting that the different personalities were inconsistent with a common biological lineage.&lt;ref name=c685/&gt;

Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, the paper went on to discuss Bảo Đại's upbringing in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing.&lt;ref name=c687&gt;Chapman, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress [[Nam Phương]], who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and claimed she had treated the queen mother badly,&lt;ref name=c687/&gt; a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using sex to turn the head of state into a puppet of France.&lt;ref name=c688&gt;Chapman, p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt;

The culmination of the newspaper campaign was a satirical pornographic cartoon, entitled "The Story of Bảo Đại".&lt;ref name=c689&gt;Chapman, p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt; It summarized the scandalous depictions of the head of state made by ''Thoi Dai'' in the preceding weeks and was published on 19 October, four days before the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 688–89.&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures featured full frontal nude depictions of Bảo Đại and his mistresses, with genitalia clearly visible, including a frame showing a naked blonde performing an erotic dance for the head of state.&lt;ref name=c689/&gt;

Aside from painting Bảo Đại as a sexually insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked the head of state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving as the head of state of the [[Empire of Vietnam]], a puppet regime set up by [[Imperial Japan]] after they invaded during World War II.&lt;ref name=c688/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists.&lt;ref name=c688/&gt; The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.&lt;ref name=c689/&gt;

Diệm used the Ministry of Information's electoral education campaign as a partisan political tool. Instead of using it purely to explain the democratic process, the campaign was used to extol Diệm and his allies.&lt;ref name=c698&gt;Chapman, p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt; After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why ''Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act.''&lt;ref name=c692/&gt; After elaborating on the powers of the head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying that he did not have respect among the international community.&lt;ref name=c692&gt;Chapman, p. 692.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October, Bảo Đại issued a statement protesting against the referendum. He urged the governments of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, India and even the Soviet Union not to recognise Diệm, asserting that he was an obstacle to the reunification of Vietnam under the Geneva Accords.&lt;ref name=butt/&gt; He accused Diệm's poll of being "a governmental activity which conforms neither to the profound sentiment of the Vietnamese people nor to the common cause of peace".&lt;ref name=c679/&gt;

On 18 October, he made the token gesture of formally dismissing Diệm. The following day, he denounced "the police methods" of Diệm's "dictatorship" and warned the Vietnamese populace "against a regime that was bound to lead them to ruin, famine, and war". Bảo Đại accused Diệm of trying to foment conflict between the French and the Americans.&lt;ref name=c680&gt;Chapman, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the poll, Bảo Đại stated "I can even tell you that I know the percentage of favourable votes that Mr. Diem has decided to obtain."&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt;

==Other opposition==
The staging of the election was subsidised by foreign funding. The United States government and a combination of American Roman Catholic charities contributed US$2 million each.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 701–02.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ba Cụt]], a leader of an anti-government [[Hòa Hảo]] religious sect, distributed a pamphlet condemning Diệm as an American puppet, citing the funding as proof and further asserting that Diệm was going to "Catholicize" the country.&lt;ref name=c701&gt;Chapman, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese Socialist Party, which was affiliated to the Hòa Hảo, claimed Diệm had "bribed the world of laborers and young students to petition in support of Diem's rise to chief-of-state and to petition in favor of deposing Bao Dai", using the American election funding.&lt;ref name=c702&gt;Chapman, p. 702.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hòa Hảo rebel leader, General Trần Văn Soái, assailed Diệm's undemocratic regime and declared the referendum illegal. He invited "friendly countries and the people of Vietnam to distrust this political maneuver". Diệm had earlier told a cabinet minister that there was only one political party&amp;nbsp;– Nhu's outfit, and went about eradicating opposition by force.&lt;ref name=c702/&gt; Opponents claimed Diệm's declarations about the value of democracy were hollow.&lt;ref name=c701/&gt;

==Logistics and voting==
Lansdale advised Diệm to print his ballots in red, while those of Bảo Đại were printed in green. In Vietnam, red is associated with good luck and prosperity, whereas green is often associated with a [[cuckold]] and bad luck.&lt;ref name="karnow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=m54/&gt;&lt;ref name="langguth"&gt;Langguth, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm's red ballots pictured him with youthful and modern-looking people, while Bảo Đại's photo was placed in old-fashioned robes, which he never wore.&lt;ref name=butt/&gt; In addition, Bảo Đại's portrait showed him to appear dazed and bloated, while Diệm and those surrounding him were smiling and appeared to be energetic.&lt;ref name=c696&gt;Chapman, p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot claimed that a vote for Diệm would be a vote for democracy, stating "I depose Bảo Đại and recognise Ngô Đình Diệm as Head of State, charged with the commission of setting up a democratic regime."&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mi206/&gt;&lt;ref name=c696/&gt; Bảo Đại's ballot read "I do not depose Bảo Đại and do not regard Ngô Đình Diệm as the Head of State charged with the commission of setting up a democratic regime."&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=c696/&gt; The voters would place the red or green ballot into the box, according to their preference, while discarding the other, which meant the voting was actually not secret.&lt;ref name=mi206/&gt;

[[File:LBJ nhu.jpg|[[Ngô Đình Nhu]] (right), Diệm's brother, supervised and rigged the referendum; on the left is US Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. (1961)|right|200px|thumb|alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie.]]
The logistics of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, who was the leader of the family's secret [[Cần Lao party]], which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence and intimidation were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with [[pepper sauce]] and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils.&lt;ref name=karnow/&gt;&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; The violations were particularly flagrant in central Vietnam,&lt;ref name=mi207&gt;Miller, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, [[Ngô Đình Cẩn]], ruled.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of [[Huế]], home of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] and a source of support for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote.&lt;ref name=mi207/&gt; In the city of [[Hội An]], several people were killed in election violence on the day of the poll.&lt;ref name=mi208&gt;Miller, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.&lt;ref name=b154&gt;Brownell, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counting and results==
Diệm's government formulated procedural regulations ostensibly designed to ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts.&lt;ref name="karnow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs"/&gt; French newspapers claimed that only half of the registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election,&lt;ref name=c700&gt;Chapman, p. 700.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale [[ballot stuffing]].&lt;ref name=mi208/&gt;

Diệm's regime had announced that 5,335,668 people were eligible to vote, but when the results were declared, there were 5,784,752 ballots.&lt;ref name=b154/&gt; Diệm's government claimed his candidacy had been endorsed by the mother of Bảo Đại, although Diệm had ordered the military to confiscate her family's property and evict her from the land.&lt;ref name=b157&gt;Brownell, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The near unanimous voter turnout and support for Diệm was replicated in highland and [[Mekong Delta]] swamp areas, which were not even under the control of the government and its [[Vietnamese National Army]].&lt;ref name="f"&gt;Fall, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; In some districts of the Mekong Delta, overwhelming tallies for Diệm in excess of 90% of the registered voters were recorded,&lt;ref name=m55&gt;Moyar, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; even though the [[Hòa Hảo]] warlord [[Ba Cut|Ba Cụt]] and his army had prevented voting.&lt;ref name="butt"&gt;Buttinger, pp. 890–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was widely condemned for being fraudulent.&lt;ref name=mi207/&gt; Historian and writer Jessica Chapman said "Even Diệm apologists like Anthony Trawick Bouscaren and American CIA officer Edward Lansdale concur with the prime minister's harshest critics on the conclusion that the South Vietnamese government was either incapable of or unwilling to hold a truly free, representative plebiscite".&lt;ref name=c672/&gt; A CIA report written in 1966 adjudged the poll to be the most heavily manipulated in the first 11 years of South Vietnam's history.&lt;ref name=c698/&gt; The U.S. government privately concluded that the monopoly Diệm had on the media and the election campaign was a greater factor in the victory than intimidation and the fact that the voting was effectively public. Reinhardt cabled Washington, saying that the "referendum proved [a] resounding success for [the] Diem government".&lt;ref name=c698/&gt; He indicated that the poll results were not necessarily a reflection of reality by adding that the result did not show that Diệm had majority support but that he was able to control the country, effectively unchallenged. The U.S. government was heartened by Diệm's apparent ability to negate communist and other opposition.&lt;ref name=c698/&gt;

The scholar [[Bernard B. Fall]] stated that "there is not the slightest doubt that this plebiscite was only a shade more fraudulent than most electoral tests under a dictatorship".&lt;ref name="f"/&gt; The American journalist [[Stanley Karnow]] cited the dubious plebiscite as evidence of Diệm's "mandarin mentality".&lt;ref name=karnow/&gt; Chapman wrote that "...&amp;nbsp;no amount of unilateral campaigning, anti-Bảo Đại sentiment, or Confucian political restraint could explain Diệm's 98 percent margin of victory in a politically heterogeneous South Vietnam. Corruption and intimidation must have played a significant role."&lt;ref name=c699&gt;Chapman, p. 699.&lt;/ref&gt; Buttinger said that while the monarchy was "another rotten relic of Vietnam's past" and Bảo Đại "its last, unworthy representative", fraud and intimidation were unnecessary as Diệm would have won easily in any event.&lt;ref name=c672/&gt; Historian David Anderson said the victory "was not a true representation of Diệm's power or popularity. The emperor's weakness, the disarray of the political opposition, and other such factors explain his triumph".&lt;ref name=c673/&gt;

==Reaction and aftermath==
Three days after the vote, Diệm proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Vietnam, naming himself as its president.&lt;ref name="langguth"/&gt; He said "The October 23rd plebiscite in which [the people of South Vietnam] took such an enthusiastic part, constitutes an approval of the policies pursued thus far and at the same time augurs a whole new era for the future of our country."&lt;ref name=c680/&gt; Diệm reiterated that he would not partake in national reunification elections, saying that they would be futile unless "true liberty" came about in the communist North Vietnam, which impressed American observers, who feared a total communist takeover.&lt;ref name=c699/&gt;

Having claimed the election was entirely without irregularities,&lt;ref name=mi208/&gt; the United States government hailed Diệm as a new hero of the "free world".&lt;ref name="butt"/&gt; Senator [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) claimed the referendum "was a reflection of their [the Vietnamese people's] search for a leader who would respond to their needs&amp;nbsp;... they sensed that Diệm could provide that kind of leadership."&lt;ref name=b158&gt;Brownell, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield had been a professor of Asian history before entering politics; as a result his opinions about Vietnam were more influential and held in high regard by his fellow senators.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Archives of policy discussions show that the Americans were concerned more about the negative image created by Diem's autocratic and antidemocratic style among the international community, rather than its possible effects on national cohesion.&lt;ref name=c703&gt;Chapman, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; The US State Department spokesman said "the people of Viet-Nam have spoken, and we, of course, recognise their decision".&lt;ref name="b158"/&gt; An official congratulatory statement from the department said "The Department of State is gratified that according to reports the referendum was conducted in such an orderly and efficient manner and that the people of Viet-Nam have made their choice unmistakably clear&amp;nbsp;... we look forward to a continuation of the friendly relations between the Government of Viet-Nam and the United States."&lt;ref name=b159&gt;Brownell, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to Diệm's victory among the American press varied with geographic location.&lt;ref name=c698/&gt; Newspapers in the Midwest hailed Diệm's win as a triumph for democracy and extolled the new president as a champion of democracy. However, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the extreme margin of victory made "Diem's administrative control look more pervasive than is thought to be the case by a number of observers here."&lt;ref name=c699/&gt; However, the paper also obligingly claimed the poll a "sound democratic procedure" and a "public tribute to a strong-willed leader". ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' called it an "overwhelming endorsement" and dubbed Diệm a "beacon of light, showing the way to free people".&lt;ref name="b158"/&gt;

Diệm's victory was seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949.&lt;ref name=c699/&gt; They consistently opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 22–25, 43, 60, 61, 71–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave too much of a burden on the American government.&lt;ref name=c699/&gt; The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.&lt;ref name=c700/&gt;

Diệm severed economic relations with France on 9 December 1955, and withdrew from the [[French Union]] shortly afterwards. Neither the [[Soviet Union]] nor [[People's Republic of China|communist China]] overtly objected to Diệm's actions in creating a new state in the southern half of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, by the time of Diệm's [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|deposal]] and [[Arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm|assassination]] in 1963, France bought 46.3% of South Vietnam's exports and accounted for most of the foreign investment in the country.&lt;ref name=r159&gt;Roberts, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; French cultural influences and the language remained prevalent.&lt;ref name=r159/&gt;

In January 1956, with no legislature and constitution in place, Diệm used his absolute power to dissolve the Revolutionary Council by launching police raids on the members, forcing those from the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo who had rallied to his side to go on the run. As a result, they turned against him.&lt;ref name=c702/&gt;

The '''Tangkhuls''' are a major [[Naga people|Naga]] ethnic group living in the Indo-Burma border area occupying the [[Ukhrul district]] in [[Manipur]], [[India]] and the Somra tract hills, Layshi township, Homalin township in Upper [[Burma]] and Tamu Township in Burma. Despite this international border, many Tangkhul have continued to regard themselves as "one nation".&lt;ref&gt;Khamrang, Khayaipam (2000) "The Tangkhul Naga Tribe between Tradition and Modernity" pp. 37&amp;ndash;71, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6cHQHThtD20C&amp;pg=PA49 page 49], ''In'' Frei, Fritz (editor) (2000) ''Inkulturation zwischen Tradition und Modernität: Kontext, Begriffe, Modelle'' Freiberg University Press, Freiberg, Switzerland, {{ISBN|3-7278-1292-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;Tangkhuls living in Burma are also known as Hogo Naga or Eastern Tangkhul or Somra Tangkhul. Also Kokak Naga, Akyaung Ari Naga and Hogo Naga are included tribally within Tangkhul Naga tribe but their language are quite distinct. The Tangkhul (Somra/Hogo) language in Mayanmar is very different from Tangkhul (Ukhrul) spoken in India.

==History==
The Tangkhuls, as with other tribes on the hills, came to Manipur, Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh from Myanmar entering their present habitats in successive waves of immigration. The Tangkhuls came together with the [[Angami Naga|Angamis]], [[Chakhesang Naga|Chakhesangs]], [[Mao Naga|Maos]], [[Poumai Naga|Poumais]], [[Maram Naga|Marams]] and [[Thangal Naga |Thangals]] because all of them have references to their dispersal from Makhel, a Mao village in Senapati district. They had also erected megaliths at Makhel in memory of their having dispersed from there to various directions. 

The Tangkhuls point to the association of their forefathers with the seashore. Most of the ornaments of the Tangkhuls such as kongsang, huishon, etc. were made of sea shells, cowrie and conch shells a prominent feature of the people who live on the shore.

By the 2nd century A.D. the Tangkhuls were living in Samshok (Thuangdut) in Myanmar. Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer and geographer of Alexandria, in his ''Geography of Further India'', c. 140 A.D., referred to the Tangkhul at Triglypton (Thuangdut). The Tangkhuls began disperse from Samshok after the invasion of Ko-lo-feng and his successor I-mau-shun the king of Nan-chao in the closing part of the 8th century A.D. and beginning of the 9th century A.D. They were further driven towards the north-west of Myanmar by the Shan people.

Thus, the Tangkhuls as also other tribes who travelled from Myanmar and from there finally they came into their present land traversing through innumerable snow-covered landscapes, mountains and wild forests confronting wild beasts and wild tribes may be grouped collectively as Naga on the basis of ethnicity. The exodus of the Tangkhuls from China to Myanmar and finally to India is indeed a story of heroism of human courage and endurance in the face of great famine in China during those days.

In course of time every Tangkhul village became a small republic like the Greek city states. Every village had an unwritten constitution made up of age-old conventions and traditions. The Tangkhul villages were self-sufficient except for salt, and self-governing units ruled by hereditary or elected chief assisted by a Council of Elders. The chief was a judge, administrator and commander roled into one.

Hunphun was the headquarters of the Tangkhul Long (Tangkhul Assembly). The Tangkhul annual fair locally known as "Leih Khangapha" used to be held at Somsai in Ukhrul.

The boundary of Manipur and Burma (Myanmar) was laid down by an agreement signed between the British authorities (East India Company) and Burma on 9 January 1834 on the river bank of Nighthee (Chindwin). The Article No.4 (iii) of this agreement relates to the Tangkhul country. “Fourth (iii) - On the north, the line of boundary will begin at the foot of the same hills at the northern extremity of the Kabo Valley and pass due north up to the first range of hills, east of that upon which stand the villages of Chortor (Choithar), Noongbee (Nungbi), Nonghar (Lunghar), of the tribe called by the Munepooriis (Manipuris) Loohooppa (Tangkhul), and by the Burmahs Lagwensoung, now tributary of Manipoor.”
As a result of this boundary demarcation without the knowledge let alone consent of the Tangkhuls, many Tangkhul villages situated in the Somrah hills, Layshi township, Tamu township and Homalin township are included under Burma. Later, when India and Burma attained national independence, the Tangkhuls found themselves belonging to two different countries.

==Language==
{{main|Tangkhul language}}
The Tangkhul tribe has more than hundreds of regional dialects. Each village has its own dialect including Khangoi, Khunggoi, Kupome, Phadang, Roudei and Ukhrul. Tangkhul is the principle dialect. Although the Tangkhul Naga tribe speaks more than a hundred dialects, the lingua franca is the Hunphun dialect.
Also Hogo Naga or Eastern tangkhul or Somra Tangkhul in Burma Speaks Somra dialect.

A slightly modified English alphabet is used. Tangkhul Language is included in the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] syllabus and is the first Tribal language from [[North East India]] to be included in the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] syllabus.

==Demographics==

===Literacy rate in first language===
Because of the diversity in dialects and lack of a standardized language, it is difficult to gauge the literacy level. However, if the knowledge of Tangkhul is taken as an indicator, most young Tangkhuls are losing their grasp of the language, often preferring to use the [[English language]] to describe more complex ideas. There are some important factors that contribute to the standardization of English language as the primary medium of learning and communication. Firstly, there are various concrete and abstracts objects and ideas which cannot be termed in Tangkhul language, simply because unlike the English language it does not have a rich vocabulary. Secondly, the emergence of western education, which rapidly change and uplift the live and standard of Tangkhuls led the people to neglect learning the language and hence became a secondary subject. Thirdly, the idea of globalization captures the attention of the people to neglect their own language and culture.

===Literacy rate in other languages===
English is taught in primary schools, and the number of people able to read the Roman script is high. Almost all young people can read and write the Roman script; older people are less proficient.  The literacy rate is 79%.&lt;ref&gt;2001 census in {{cite web|title=Naga, Tangkhul|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/nmf|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are English and bi-lingual publications, such as the magazine ''The Legacy'' and the English newspaper ''The Aja Daily''. Aja is edited by Mrs Valley Rose Hungyo, the only lady editor of the state. A new bi-lingual daily newspaper ''The Shirui Lily Times'' was started in Ukhrul district headquarters from August 16, 2010. Owned and published by Shimreingam A.Shatsang, ''The Shirui Lily Times'' is jointly edited by the publisher himself and another dynamic editor Ngakuini A Shatsang. With this new edition-Ukhrul now has two local dailies published in Tangkhul.&lt;ref&gt;'New daily launched in Ukhrul', ''Hueiyen Lanpao'', September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The culture of Tangkhul revolves around traditional beliefs and custom exercises being passed down, and ancient tools and materials, like spears, swords, shields, bows, axes and spades. Culturally, the Tangkhuls share close affinities with the [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] of the Imphal Valley. 

The Tangkhuls are fond of singing, dancing and festivities. For every season, there is a festival that lasts almost a week. Luira phanit, the seed sowing festival is the major festival. The Tangkhuls artistic creativity is manifested in their handicrafts and wood carvings. 

The Tangkhuls are an egalitarian society. There is no caste or classes in the society. Every person is equal in the society and the society follows patriarchal system.

The life and art of the Tangkhul are attractive and captivating. Their different clothing, utensils, architecture, monumental erections and memorial set-ups depict their dexterity in art, which also speak of their sense of beauty and finesse. Though there are common articles of unisex clothing, there are also some articles of clothing exclusively meant for men or women.

==Music and dance==
Tangkhuls are music lovers and their songs are soft and melodious. Apart from encoding into the music the varied seasonal and cultural ideas and philosophies, music is a medium wherein historical events are also related in the lyrics. In as much as religious fervor is incorporated and composed in the songs, the romantic nature of the people also finds its expressions in the music. There are various varieties of songs, some are mood special, some are festival/seasonal specials. These folk songs and folklores can be taught and sung by anybody, anytime, but there are also some specific musical expressive melodies of every region or area. People are restricted from singing certain songs outside of particular seasons or occasions{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Some festivals have ceased since the introduction of Christianity to the region.
 
These folk songs and folklores can be played or accompanied by musical instruments. Some of the musical instruments are tingteila (violin), tala (trumpet), pung (drum), mazo (woman's mouth-piece), sipa (flute), and kaha ngashingkhon (bamboo pipe).

Corresponding to the rhythmic composition of the songs, the dances of the Tangkhuls are also rhythmic and these are eventful and vigorous. There are also some special occasional dances, like the Kathi Mahon, a dance for the dead; Laa Khanganui, a virgin dance during Luira Festival; and Rai Pheichak, a war dance. [[Rewben Mashangva]], a member of the Tangkhul community, is instrumental in popularising the music of the community to the world. The majority of the youth know how to play the guitar and other musical instruments. However, Western culture has been blamed for the declining popularity of some ancestral songs.

==History of Christianity among Tangkhuls==
Christianity is the major religion of the Tangkhul Nagas. Tangkhuls were the first community in Manipur to become Christians. Christianity was first brought to the Tangkhul people by Rev. William Pettigrew in 1896. The first christian church of Manipur, [[Phungyo Baptist Church]] was set up among the Tangkhuls in Ukhrul. The story goes that the chief of Hunphun, Raihao, had stories about his great grandfather dreaming that a white missionary would come to Ukhrul. Because of this, when Rev. Pettigrew showed up, Raihao allowed him to live among them and work as a missionary. When the chief was converted, the whole tribe converted as well, and Christianity has remained a prominent religion among Tangkhul Nagas to this day.
Also Tangkhuls(Hogo/Somra) in Burma follow the religion of Animism, Buddhism and Christianity.

'''Women in Australia''' refers to women's demographic and cultural presence in Australia. Historically, a masculine [[bias]] has dominated Australian culture.
==History==

===Settlement===
Early colonial administrations were anxious to address the gender imbalance in the population brought about by the importation of large numbers of convict men. Between 1788 and 1792, around 3546 male to 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fletcher, B. H. |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020292b.htm?hilite=arthur%3Bphillip |title=Biography – Arthur Phillip – Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women came to play an important role in education and welfare during colonial times. Governor Macquarie's wife, [[Elizabeth Macquarie]] took an interest in convict women's welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnard |first=Marjorie |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020161b.htm?hilite=Mrs%3BMacquarie |title=Biography – Elizabeth Henrietta Macquarie – Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her contemporary [[Elizabeth Macarthur]] was noted for her 'feminine strength' in assisting the establishment of the Australian merino wool industry during her husband [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]]'s enforced absence from the colony following the [[Rum Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conway |first=Jill |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020130b.htm |title=Biography – Elizabeth Macarthur – Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic [[Sisters of Charity of Australia|Sisters of Charity]] arrived in 1838 and set about providing pastoral care in a women's prison, visiting hospitals and schools and establishing employment for convict women. They established hospitals in four of the eastern states, beginning with [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney]] in 1857 as a free hospital for all people, but especially for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stvincents.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=132&amp;Itemid=160 |title=Facility heritage |publisher=St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney |date= |accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caroline Chisholm]] (1808–1877) established a migrant women's shelter and worked for women's welfare in the colonies in the 1840s. Her humanitarian efforts later won her fame in England and great influence in achieving support for families in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iltis |first=Judith |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010208b.htm |title=Biography – Caroline Chisholm – Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney's first Catholic bishop, [[John Bede Polding]] founded an Australian order of nuns—the [[Sisters of the Good Samaritan]]—in 1857 to work in education and social work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodsams.org.au/html/who/who.htm |title=Sisters of The Good Samaritans |publisher=Goodsams.org.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart|Sisters of St Joseph]] were founded in South Australia by [[Saint Mary MacKillop]] and Fr [[Julian Tenison Woods]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfc.edu.au/Brothers_in_Australia/brothers_in_australia.htm |title=Brothers in Australia |publisher=Cfc.edu.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercy.org.au/whoweare/default.cfm?loadref=21 |title=Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of Australia – Who We Are |publisher=Mercy.org.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKillop travelled throughout [[Australasia]] and established schools, convents and charitable institutions.

===Late 19th-century suffrage ===
[[File:Catherine Helen Spence.jpg|thumb|upright|[[South Australia]]n suffragette [[Catherine Helen Spence]] (1825-1910). In 1895 women in South Australia were among the first in the world to attain the vote and were the first to be able to stand for parliament.]]
Australia had led the world in bringing [[women's suffrage]] rights during the late 19th century. Propertied women in the colony of South Australia were granted the vote in local elections (but not parliamentary elections) in 1861. [[Henrietta Dugdale]] formed the first Australian women's suffrage society in Melbourne in 1884. Women became eligible to vote for the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895. This was the first legislation in the world permitting women also to stand for election to political office and, in 1897, [[Catherine Helen Spence]] became the first female political candidate for political office, unsuccessfully standing for election as a delegate to the Federal Convention on Australian Federation. [[Western Australia]] granted voting rights to qualified non-aboriginal women in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-14.html|title=Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899 (WA)|publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy|accessdate=2017-07-02}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/scan-sid-807.html Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899 (WA), p.5 ''et seq''] at [[Old Parliament House, Canberra#Museum of Australian Democracy|Museum of Australian Democracy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1901-1945===
{{further|Australian Women's Land Army|Australian Women's Army Service}}
Women energetically participated in the war effort, with few signs of defeatism or resistance to government policies.&lt;ref&gt;Adam-Smith, Patsy. ''Australian Women at War'' (Thomas Nelson Australia, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the [[Country Women's Association]] was formed with the intention to improve the lives of women in rural Australia. It has since expanded to become the largest women's organisation in the country.

===Since 1945===
[[File:Victory job (AWM ARTV00332).jpg|thumb|left|In the [[World War II|Second World War]], government propaganda encouraged women to contribute to the war effort by joining one of the female branches of the armed forces or joining the labour force]]
In 1974, the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]] granted women the full adult wage. However, resistance to women being employed in certain industries remained until well into the 1970s. Because of obstruction from elements of the Unions movement, it would take until 1975 for women to be admitted as drivers on [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne's trams]], and [[Sir Reginald Ansett]] refused to allow women to train as pilots as late as 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Bolton |editor-first=Geoffrey |series=The Oxford history of Australia |title=1942-1995: The Middle Way |volume=Volume 5 |year=1990 |edition=2nd |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the Sex Discrimination Act became enforced, making sex-based discrimination and sexual harassment illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/education/face-facts/face-facts-gender-equality-2018|title=Face the facts: Gender Equality 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical writings===
Until the 1960s, the Australian [[ethnic stereotype|national character]] was typically masculine.&lt;ref name="watb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Women and the Bush: Forces of Desire in the Australian Cultural Tradition |last=Schaffer |first=Kay |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521368162 |page=5-7 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3gWHrCDW01AC |accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Damned_whores_and_God_s_police.html?id=aba3AAAAIAAJ|title=Damned Whores and God's Police: The Colonization of Women in Australia|last=Summers|first=Anne|date=1975-01-01|publisher=Penguin Books|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in more recent decades has attention been paid to the role and marginal status of women and minority groups. One of the earliest studies on the role of women in Australian culture was conducted by [[Miriam Dixson]] in her 1975 study, The Real Matilda.&lt;ref name="watb"/&gt; Dixson concluded that there was deep contempt for women in the Australian [[ethos]] and that the only role for women was within the family.&lt;ref name="watb"/&gt;

[[Marilyn Lake]] argues that the first stage of women's history in the 1970s demonstrated an angry tone, with a revolutionary critique that reflected its close connections with the [[women's liberation movement]]. By the late 20th century, women's history was less strident and more thoroughly integrated into social history and labour history. In the 21st century, the emphasis has turned to a broader horizon of "gender relations", which includes such concepts as femininity and masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, Marilyn.

'''[[Esiẹ Museum]]''' is a museum in [[Esiẹ]], Irepodun. The museum was the first to be established in [[Nigeria]] when it opened in 1945. The museum once housed over one thousand tombstone figures or images representing human beings. It is reputed to have the largest collection of soapstone images in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200905041139.html |title=Esie Museum|publisher=All Africa|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times the Esie museum has been the center of religious activities and hosts a festival in the month of April every year.

[[File:Moin Moin.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Cut [[Moin Moin]];"Ewe eran" leaves (Thaumatococcus daniellii) are traditionally used to improve flavoring.]]

Some common foods native to the Yoruba include [[moin-moin]] (steamed bean pudding) and [[akara]] (bean cake). Native Yoruba soups include ewedu, gbegiri, and efo riro (a type of vegetable soup). Such soups as [[okra]] (locally known as "ila asepo") and egusi have become very popular in Western Nigeria in recent times and, in addition to amala, a traditional Yoruba fufu made of yam flour, these can be eaten with numerous Nigerian fufu meals, including pounded yam (locally referred to as "iyan"), 'lafun' a Nigeria fufu made from cassava, semolina, and garri (eba).

Some dishes are prepared specially for festivities and ceremonies. Jollof rice and fried rice are very common in Nigeria. Other popular dishes include ekuru and aro, stews, corn, cassava, and flours (e.g., maize, yam and plantain Flours), eggs, chicken, and assorted meat and fish). Some less well known meals and many miscellaneous staples are arrowroot gruel, sweetmeats, fritters and coconut concoctions; and some breads - yeast bread, rock buns, and palm wine bread to name a few. Yoruba cuisine is quite vast.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kudeti book of Yoruba cookery|author1=Mars, J.A.|author2=Tooleyò, E.M.|date=2002|publisher=CSS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIIOAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming customs==
The Yoruba people believe that people live out the meanings of their names. As such, [[Yoruba people]] put considerable effort into naming a baby. Their philosophy of naming is conveyed in a common adage, ''ile ni a n wo, ki a to so omo l'oruko'' ("one pays attention to the family before naming a child"): one must consider the tradition and history of a child's relatives when choosing a name.

Some families have long-standing traditions for naming their children. Such customs are often derived from their profession or religion. For example, a family of hunters could name their baby ''Ogunbunmi'' ([[Ogoun|Ogun]] gives me this) to show their respect to the divinity who gives them metal tools for hunting. Meanwhile, a family that venerates [[Ifá]] may name their child ''Falola'' (Ifa has honor).&lt;ref name="Culture"/&gt;

===Naming===
Since it is generally believed that names are like spirits which would like to live out their meanings, parents do a thorough search before giving names to their babies. Naming ceremonies are performed with the same meticulous care, generally by the oldest family member. Symbolic of the hopes, expectations and prayers of the parents for the new baby, honey, [[kola nut|kola]], bitter kola, atare ([[alligator pepper]]), water, [[palm oil]], sugar, [[sugar cane]], salt, and liquor each have a place and a special meaning in the world-view of the Yoruba. For instance, honey represents sweetness, and the prayer of the parents is that their baby's life will be as sweet as honey.&lt;ref&gt;Ogunyemi, Yemi D; (Yemi D. Prince) The Oral Traditions in Ike-Ife, Academics Press, 2009, Palo Alto, USA. {{ISBN|978-1-933146-65-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ritual, the child is named and members of the extended family have the honour of also giving a name to the child. The gift of a name comes with gifts of money and clothing. In many cases, the relative will subsequently call the child by the name they give to him or her, so a new baby may thereafter have more than a dozen names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Johnson |title=''The History of the Yorubas'' |publisher=Michigan State Univ Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-32292-9-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oruko Amutorunwa (Preordained name)===
* Amutorunwa (brought from heaven)
* [[Yoruba name|Oruko]] - name
Some
Yoruba believe that a baby may come with pre-destined names. For instance, twins (''[[ibeji]]'') are believed to have natural-birth names. Thus the first to be born of the two is called ''Taiwo'' or "Taiye", shortened forms of Taiyewo, meaning the taster of the world. This is to identify the first twin as the one sent by the other one to first go and taste the world. If he/she stays there, it follows that it is not bad, and that would send a signal to the other one to start coming. Hence the second to arrive is named ''Kehinde'' (late arrival; it is now common for many Kehindes to be called by the familiar diminutive "Kenny".Irrespective of the sex the child born to the same woman after the twins is called Idowu, and the one after this is called ''Alaba'', then the next child is called ''Idogbe''. ''Ige'' is a child born with the legs coming out first instead of the head; and ''Ojo'' (male) or ''Aina'' (female) is the one born with the umbilical cord around his or her neck. When a child is conceived with no prior menstruation, he or she is named Ilori. ''Dada'' is the child born with locked hair; and ''Ajayi'' (nicknamed ''Ogidi Olu'') is the one born face-downwards.&lt;ref&gt;Ogunyemi, Yemi D; (Yemi D. Prince) The Aura of Yoruba Philosophy, Religion and Literature, Diaspora Press of America, 2003, Boston, USA. {{ISBN|0-9652860-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other natural names include ''Abiodun'' (one born on a festival day or period),"Abiona"(one born on a journey) ''Abidemi'' or ''Bidemi'' (one born without the presence of its father) i.e the child's father didn't witness his baby's naming ceremony but not dead, maybe he just traveled, ''Enitan'' (one of a story) this child might have had any of its parent dead before its birth,  ''Bosede'' (one born on a holy day); ''Babatunde''/''Babatunji'' (meaning father has come back) is the son born to a family where a father has recently passed. This testifies to the belief in reincarnation. ''Iyabode'', ''Yeside'', ''Yewande'', and ''Yetunde'', ("mother has come back") are female counterparts, names with the same meaning.

===Oruko Abiso (Name given at birth)===
* Oruko - name
* Abi - birthed
* So - named
These are names that are not natural with the child at birth but are given on either the seventh day of birth (for females) and ninth day of birth (for males). Some Yoruba groups practice ifalomo(6th) holding the naming rites on the sixth day. The influence of Islam in Yoruba culture was responsible for the eighth-day naming ceremony. Twin-births when they are male and female are usually named on the eighth day but on the seventh or ninth day if they are same-sex twins. They are given in accordance with significant events at time of birth or with reference to the family tradition as has been mentioned above.

Examples of names given with reference to the family tradition include ''Ogundiran'' (Ogun has become a living tradition in the family); ''Ayanlowo'' (Ayan drumming tradition is honorable); ''Oyetoso'' (Chieftaincy is ornament); ''Olanrewaju'' (Honor is advancing forward); ''Olusegun'' (God has conquered the enemy)."ajewole" (wealth as being the family)

===Abiku Names===
* Abi - birthed, or Bi - born
* Iku - death, or Ku - die / dead
The Yoruba believe that some children are born to die. This derives from the phenomenon of the tragic incidents of high rate of infant mortality sometimes afflicting the same family for a long time. When this occurs, the family devises all kinds of method to forestall a recurrence, including giving special names at a new birth.&lt;ref&gt;Ogunyemi, Yemi D; (Yemi D. Prince) Introduction to Yoruba Philosophy, Religion and Literature, Athelia Henrietta Press, 1998, New York, USA. {{ISBN|1-890157-14-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such names reflect the frustration of the poor parents:

* Malomo (do not go again)
* Kosoko (there is no hoe anymore). This refers to the hoe that is used to dig the grave.
* Kashimawo (let's wait and see). This suggests a somewhat cynical attitude in the parent(s).
* Banjoko (sit with me)
* Orukotan (all names have been exhausted)
* Yemiitan (stop deceiving me)
* Kokumo (this will not die)
* Durojaiye (stay and enjoy life)
* Durotimi or Rotimi (stay with me)

===Pet names===
The Yoruba also have pet names or oriki. These are praise names, and they are used to suggest what the child's family background is or to express one's hope for the child: ''Akanbi''- (one who is deliberately born); ''Ayinde'' (one who is praised on arrival); ''Akande'' (one who comes or arrives in full determination); ''Atanda'' (one who is deliberately created after thorough search). For females, ''Aduke'' (one who everyone likes to take care of), Ayoke (one who people are happy to care for), ''Arike'' (one who is cared for on sight), ''Atinuke'' or ''Abike'' (one that is born to be pampered),"Anike" which come from a longer name meaning we have a crown and it is as delicate as an egg.

==Law==

Yoruba law is the legal system of [[Yorubaland]]. It is quite intricate, each group and subgroup having a system that varies, but in general, government begins within the immediate family. The next level is the clan, or extended family, with its own head known as a Baálé. This chief will be subject to town chiefs, and these chiefs are usually themselves subject to their [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]], who may or may not be subject to another [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[William R. Bascom]]: ''[http://isbndb.com/d/book/the_yoruba_of_southwestern_nigeria.html page 43.]'' {{ISBN|0-03-081249-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of what survived of this legal code has been assimilated into the [[customary law]]s of the sovereign nations that the Yoruba inhabit.

==Linguistics==
{{Main article|Yoruba language}}
Yoruba written literature begins with the formation of its grammar published in 1843. The standard language incorporates several features from other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Fagborun, J. Gbenga, ''Yorùbá verbs and their usage: An introductory handbook for learners'', Virgocap Press, Bradford, West Yorkshire, 1994. {{ISBN|0-9524360-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedding==
[[File:Traditional Marriage ceremony.jpg|thumb|Marriage ceremony. The dress pattern is typical of the yoruba ethnic group in Nigeria.]]The child that is named will grow to adulthood. The Yoruba culture provides for the upbringing of the child by the extended family. In traditional society, the child is placed with a master of whatever craft the gods specify for him or her. Or he may take to the profession of the father, in the case of a boy, or the mother, in the case of a girl. The parents have the responsibility for his/her socialization into the norms of the larger society, in addition to giving him a means of livelihood. His or her wedding is also the responsibility of the parents.

The wedding ceremony is the climax of a process that starts with courtship. The young man identifies a young woman that he loves. He and his friends seek her out through various means. The young man sends messages of interest to the young woman until such a time that they are close enough to avoid a go-between (alarina). Then once they both express mutual love, they let their parents know about their feelings for each other. The man's parents arrange to pay a visit to the prospective bride's parents. Once their consent is secured, the wedding day may be set. Prior to the wedding day, the payment of bride price is arranged. This secures the final consent of the bride's parents, and the wedding day is fixed. Once the day has been fixed through either consultation of the [[Orisha]]s by a [[babalawo]] (in the case of followers of the [[Yoruba religion]]) or the decision of a man of God (in the case of the [[Christian]]s or [[Muslim]]s), the bride and bridegroom are warned to avoid travelling out of town, including to the farm. This is to prevent any mishap. The wedding day is a day of celebration, eating, drinking and dancing for parents, relations, the new husband and wife and their friends and, often, even foes. Marriage is not considered to be only a union of the husband and wife, it is also seen among the Yoruba as the union of the families on both sides.
But before the bride goes to her husbands house, she is escorted by different people i.e. family and friends to the door step of her new home in a ritual called [[Ekun Iyawo]] 
[[File:A Yoruba bride and mother.JPG|thumb| A Yoruba bride hugs her mother on her traditional wedding day. This is a farewell hug from mother to daughter.]] meaning 'The cry of the new bride', this is to show that she is sad leaving her parents' home and signify her presence in the new home. There she is prayed for and her legs are washed. It is believed that she is washing every bad-luck that she might have brought into her husband's house away. Before she is finally ushered into her house, if she is an adherent of the Yoruba faith, she is given a calabash (igba) and is then asked to break it. When it breaks, the number of pieces it is broken into is believed to be the number of children she will give birth to. On the wedding night she and her husband have their first meeting and he is ordinarily expected to find her to be a virgin. If he doesn't, she and her parents are disgraced and may be banished from the village where they live.

While this is the only marital ceremony that is practiced by the more traditional members of the tribe, Christian and Muslim members generally blend it with a [[Marriage in Christianity|church wedding]] and [[Civil marriage|registry wedding]] (in the case of Christians) or a [[nikkah]] and [[Civil marriage|registry wedding]] (in the case of Muslims). In their communities, the Yoruba ceremony described above is commonly seen as more of an [[engagement party]] than a proper wedding rite.

==Funeral==

In Yoruba belief, death is not the end of life; rather, it is a transition from one form of existence to another. The ogberis (ignorant folks) fear death because it marks the end of an existence that is known and the beginning of one that is unknown. Immortality is the dream of many, as "Eji-ogbe" puts it: ''Mo dogbogbo orose; Ng ko ku mo; Mo digba oke; Mo duro Gbonin''. (I have become an aged ose tree; I will no longer die; I have become two hundred hills rolled into one; I am immovable.) Reference to hills is found in the saying "Gboningbonin ni t'oke, oke Gboningbonin".

The Yoruba also pray for many blessings, but the most important three are wealth, children and immortality: ire owo; ire omo; ire aiku pari iwa. There is a belief in an afterlife that is a continuation of this life, only in a different setting, and the abode of the dead is usually placed at a place just outside this abode, and is sometimes thought of as separated by a stream. Participation in this afterlife is conditional on the nature of one's life and the nature of one's death. This is the meaning of life: to deliver the message of Olodumare, the Supreme Creator by promoting the good of existence. For it is the wish of the Deity that human beings should promote the good as much as is possible. Hence it is insisted that one has a good capacity for moral uprightness and personhood. Personhood is an achieved state judged by the standard of goodness to self, to the community and to the ancestors. As people say: ''Keni huwa gbedegbede; keni lee ku pelepele; K'omo eni lee n'owo gbogboro L'eni sin''. (Let one conduct one's life gently; that one may die a good death; that one's children may stretch their hands over one's body in burial.)

The achievement of a good death is an occasion for celebration of the life of the deceased. This falls into several categories. First, children and grand children would celebrate the life of their parent who passed and left a good name for them. Second, the Yoruba are realistic and pragmatic about their attitude to death. They know that one may die at a young age. The important thing is a good life and a good name. As the saying goes: ''Ki a ku l'omode, ki a fi esin se irele eni; o san ju ki a dagba ki a ma ni adie irana''. (if we die young, and a horse is killed in celebration of one's life; it is better than dying old without people killing even a chicken in celebration.)

It is also believed that ancestors have enormous power to watch over their descendants. Therefore, people make an effort to remember their ancestors on a regular basis. This is ancestor veneration, which some have wrongly labelled ancestor worship. It is believed that the love that exists between a parent and a child here on earth should continue even after death. And since the parent has only ascended to another plane of existence, it should be possible for the link to remain strong.

==Philosophy==
Yoruba culture consists of the folk/cultural philosophy, the autochthonous religion and folktales. They are embodied in Ifa-Ife Divination, known as the tripartite Book of Enlightenment or the Body of Knowledge in Yorubaland and in Diaspora. Other components of the Book of Knowledge or the Book of Enlightenment are psychology, sociology, mathematics, cosmogony, cosmology, and other areas of human interests.


Yoruba cultural thought is a witness of two epochs. The first epoch is an epoch-making history in mythology and cosmology. This is also an epoch-making history in the oral culture during which time divinity-philosopher Orunmila was the head and a pre-eminent diviner. He pondered the visible and invisible worlds, reminiscing about cosmogony, cosmology, and the mythological creatures in the visible and invisible worlds. Divinity-philosopher Orunmila epitomizes wisdom and idealism. But he is more of a psychologist than a philosopher. He is the cultivator of ambitions and desires, and the interpreter of ori (head) and its destiny. The non-literate world, compelled by the need to survive, impelled by the need to unravel the mysteries of the days and nights made divinity-philosopher Orunmila to cultivate the idea of Divination.

The second epoch is the epoch of metaphysical discourse. This commenced in the 19th century when the land became a literate land through the diligence and pragmatism of Dr. Bishop Ajayi Crowther, the first African Anglican Bishop.He is regarded as the cultivator of modern Yoruba idealism.

The uniqueness of Yoruba thought is that it is mainly narrative in form, explicating and pointing to the knowledge of the causes and nature of things, affecting the corporeal and the spiritual universe and its wellness. Yoruba people have hundreds of aphorisms, folktales, and lore, and they believe that any lore that widens people's horizons and presents food for thought is the beginning of a philosophy.

As it were in the ancient times, Yoruba people always attach philosophical and religious connotations to whatever they produced or created. Hence some of them are referred to as artist-philosophers. This is an accretion to the fact that one can find a sculptor, a weaver, a carver or a potter in every household in Yoruba land.

Despite the fact that the Yoruba cannot detail all their long pedigrees, such as divinity-philosopher Oduduwa, divinity-philosopher Obatala, divinity-philosopher Orunmila, divinity-philosopher Sango, divinity-philosopher Ogun, divinity-philosopher Oshun, divinity-philosopher Olokun, divinity-philosopher Oya, divinity-philosopher Esu, divinity-philosopher Oshosi, divinity-philosopher Yemoja, divinity-philosopher Sopona, etc., nonetheless it is a fact of truth that they had all impacted the Yoruba people and contributed to the wellness and well-being of the Yoruba society.Without their various contributions, Yoruba land could have been lost in a hay of confusion.

Although religion is often first in Yoruba culture, nonetheless, it is the thought of man that actually leads spiritual consciousness (ori) to the creation and the practice of religion. Thus thought/philosophy is antecedent to religion.

Today, the academic and the nonacademic communities are becoming more and more interested in Yoruba culture, its Book of Enlightenment. Thus more and more researches are being carried out on Yoruba cultural thought, as more and more books are being written on it—embossing its mark and advancing its research amongst non-African thinkers such as the political philosophers and political scientists who are beginning to open their doors to other cultures, widening their views.

==Yoruba Idealism==
Idealism in Yoruba-land and for the Yoruba people is equated with the ideal purpose of life, the search for the meaning of life and the yearning for the best in life. Divinity-philosopher Orunmila, the cultivator of Ifa-Ife Divination, is the father of ancient Yoruba Idealism. His (divine) idealism has inspired the entire Yoruba people in Africa and in Diaspora, especially those who were stolen (to the Americas and the West Indies) during the inhuman slave trade. 

Based on the definition of the Yoruba Idealism, which is the search for the meaning of life and the yearning for the best in life, Yoruba Idealism is a kind of Enlightenment Movement in its own right, as every scion in the land endeavors to reach the height or the acme of his idealistic ambition. 

Divinity-philosopher Orunmila's idealism ushered in modern idealism that inspired pragmatic Dr. Ajayi Crowther in the 19th century, and Chief Obafemi Awolowo in the 20th century who succeeded in creating a moral atmosphere for the Yoruba land to thrive, impacting a moral majority to which idealism belongs and from which realism emerges. His leadership philosophy helped him with big ideas. He built the first Radio and TV Houses in Africa. He cultivated the big ideas that led to the building of the first modern stadium in Africa and the first Cocoa House in the world. Generally speaking, Yoruba people are idealists by nature.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Yoruba religion}}
The Yoruba are said to be religious people, but they are also pragmatic and tolerant about their religious differences. Whilst many profess the [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba school of thought]]; many more profess other faiths e.g. Christianity, Islam etc.&lt;ref&gt;Baba Ifa Karade, The Handbook of Yoruba Religious Concepts, [[Weiser Books]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-87728-789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

[[Yoruba people]] traditionally speak the [[Yorùbá language]], a member of the [[Niger–Congo]] [[language family]]. Apart from referring to the aggregate of dialects and their speakers, the term Yoruba is used for the standard, written form of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Yorùbá Online [http://www.africa.uga.edu/Yoruba/yorubabout.html Yorùbá People And Culture: Yorùbá Language]&lt;/ref&gt;
