      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3591">'''AWQAF Africa''' (also known or referred to as AWQAF or The Awqaf) serves all [[countries of Africa]]: South, North, West, East, and other territorial geography of the continent including its islands in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Atlantic ocean]]s and [[Mediterranean Sea]], as well as the [[West Indies]].  Awqaf Africa, from time to time, extends its works to all [[Muslims]] outside the continent - especially in the Muslim World.  Awqaf Africa carries out its projects in all parts of the world{{spaced ndash}} globalizing, as necessary, in the cause of [[One Human Race]] under the banner of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esinislam.com/AwqafAfrica/Awqaf_Africa_Index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Awqaf Africa was founded while studying [[Postgraduate education|Postgraduate Degrees]] in [[Damascus]] early 1990s by [[Sheikh Adelabu|Sheikh Abu-Abdullah Adelabu]], PhD (Damas), a West African Muslim scholar and cleric of [[Nigerian people|Nigerian]] origin who is the international organization's first [[al Amir]] (i.e., president).&lt;ref name = alitihad&gt;Al-Itihad Arabic Newspaper, Clifton NJ07015 Number 321 page 7 July 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and Activities==
Awqaf Africa is an international organization which is incorporated in its structure with [[African Union]] Muslim working to relieve human suffering amongst the Muslims of Africa - in particular and as a primary objective - and around the world - as necessary.  The aim is projected for all nations of the continent, especially, their Muslim societies where each national society effectuates programmes of Awqaf Africa.  Relief, [[human dignity]], and spiritual uplift remain main goals of the international body. Through education at its [[AWQAF Africa Muslim Open College|Awqaf Africa Muslim Open College]] in London, the organization seeks the causes of suffering, poverty, and [[Islamophobia]] and tries to eliminate them under the amiable banner of Islam.

==Education==
The organization says it projected the Open College with the aim of providing, particularly, Muslims of African origins with studies and qualifications that enable them to serve themselves and their Muslim communities.  Awqaf Africa's college offers its people an alternative means of learning with maximum flexibility, in order that they can build a program of studies that fits both their personal and community needs and adapt accordingly. Awqaf Africa gives priority to those who serve or intend to serve the Muslim communities through teachings and preachings or administration and career development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esinislam.com/Awqaf_Africa_Exclusives/College/College_1.htm Studying With Awqaf Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;  Projects supported by Awqaf Africa include the Muslim portals [http://www.esinislam.com/ EsinIslam.com] and [http://www.islamafrica.com/ IslamAfrica.com].

==Status==
Awqaf Africa is an independent establishment with a firm principle to stay neutral and distance itself from exploitations by politicians, lobbies from prominent business, or affiliations with military struggles.  Awqaf Africa maintains [[Jihad]] or Struggling For The Cause of Islam is a faith as well as a duty, and therefore does not champion any struggling other than that of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[Delab International Magazine, London August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amirim''' ({{lang-he-n|אֲמִירִים}}, ''lit.'' Treetops) is a [[moshav]] in northern [[Israel]]. Located 650 [[metres above sea level]] on a hill overlooking  the [[Sea of Galilee]], it was established by [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Amirim}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

==History==
Early attempts by [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Morocco]] to establish a settlement in the 1950s were not successful. The original name was ''Shefa Bet.'' In 1958, a group of people of various backgrounds banded together to create a moshav based on a vegetarian, vegan, and organic lifestyle and ideology. Among them were numerous [[Branch Davidian|Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventist]] families under the leadership of [[Lois Roden|Ben and Lois Roden]]. The founders of Amirim were among the pioneers of the vegetarian movement in Israel.&lt;ref name="living_the_high_life"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1196847380136&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Israel News : Jerusalem Post Internet Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rodens established "The Branch Organic Agricultural Association," one of the first organizations to encourage organic gardening in Israel, which produces an abundance of crops for the area and for Europe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Tourism==
One of the moshav's main sources of income is tourism. The moshav runs guesthouses and restaurants featuring vegetarian and vegan food.  In the early 1960s, the Jewish Agency helped 10 families build the first ''zimmerim'', as the guest chalets are known.&lt;ref name="living_the_high_life" /&gt;

The moshav has a sculpture garden which displays 20 statues belonging to the [[Israel Museum]] collections. The works are made by Israeli and international artists, including a steel statue by [[David Palombo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amirey-hagalil.com/en/galilean-attractions/amirim-village/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:David_Palombo,_sculpture,_1966.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Babalawo Opele opon.jpg|thumb]]

'''Babaaláwo''' or '''Babalawo '''('''Babalao''' or '''Babalaô''' in [[Latin America]]; literally meaning 'father of the mysteries' in the [[Yoruba language]]) is a spiritual title that denotes a [[priest]] of the [[Ifá]] [[oracle]]. Ifá is a [[divination]] system that represents the teachings of the [[Orisha|Òrìṣà]] [[Orunmila]], the Òrìṣà of Wisdom, who in turn serves as the oracular representative of [[Olodumare]]. A Babalawo's female counterpart is known as an '''[[Iyanifa]]'''.

==Functions in society==
The Babalawos ascertain the future of their clients through communication with Ifá. This is done through the interpretation of either the patterns of the [[divination|divining]] chain known as ''Opele'', or the sacred palm nuts called ''Ikin'', on the traditionally wooden divination tray called ''[[Opon Ifá]]''. 

In addition to this, some of them also perform divination services on behalf of the [[king]]s and [[paramount chief]]s of the [[Yoruba people]]. These figures, holders of [[chieftaincy]] titles like '''Araba''' and '''Oluwo Ifa''' in their own right, are members of the recognised [[aristocracy (class)|aristocracies]] of the various Yoruba [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]].

==Training==
Babalawos undergo training in the memorization and interpretation of the 256 ''[[Ifá#Od.C3.B9 If.C3.A1|Odu]]'' or mysteries, as well as in the numerous verses or ''Ese'' of Ifá. Traditionally, the Babalawo usually have additional professional specialties. For instance, several would also be [[herbalist]]s, while others would specialize in extinguishing the troubles caused by Ajogun. The Babalawos are, however, generally trained in the determination of problems, or to divine how good luck can be maintained, and the application of both spiritual and related secular solutions. Their primary function is to assist people in finding, understanding, and being in alignment with their individual destiny until they experience spiritual wisdom as a part of their daily experience. 

The Babalawo is charged with helping people develop the discipline and character that supports such spiritual growth called "Iwa Pele", or good character. This is done by identifying the client's spiritual destiny, or [[Ori (Yoruba)|Ori]], and developing a spiritual blueprint which can be used to support, cultivate, and live out that destiny.

'''Kisyakbika  Bayryasova''' is forcibly baptized Muslim woman, sentenced to be burned for returning to Islam.

==Political situation in the province==
Kysyabika Bayryasova was born in 1679 in the Duvanskoy volost  of the Siberian road in Russia. At the beginning of the XVIII century the so-called "mountain power" was created in the Urals. [[Vasily Tatishchev]], known as the founder of the city of [[Yekaterinburg]], the author of the book "The History of Russia" was the head of the "mountain power". At that time, the active development of new deposits began, new plants and mines were built in the province. The local population the [[Bashkirs]] feared losing their patrimonial rights to lands obtained under the conditions of accession to Russia, and sought to protect their cultural, religious and domestic traditions. The discontent of the people have caused an [[Bashkir rebellion of 1735–1740]]. On the rebellion "mountain power" responded with punitive campaigns. Residents of insurgent villages were killed, sold into slavery, forcibly baptized. Bashkir woman Kisyakbika Bayryasova  was captured by punitive power and have brought to Ekaterinburg. She was given as serf to the  writer and translator Kiriak Kondratovich. She was baptized, and after baptism she was named  Katerina.

Like the rest of the slaves, Kisyakbika dreamed of freedom. September 18, 1737, she made her first escape with another slave. The old woman was caught and whipped. But the freedom-loving woman did not stop this. On September 26 of the same year Kisyakbika made her second escape from Ekaterinburg with the secretary of the manager of the "mountain power". Kisyabika was caught and this time was carved with a whip.

Meanwhile, on April 20, 1738, the execution of Toigilda Zhulyakov was executed. He was also forcibly baptized, but he returned to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedomosti-ural.ru/notes/16222/  ''Логинов Олег.'' Уральская преступность.

{{Bible-related |interpretation}}

'''Bible prophecy''' or '''biblical prophecy''' comprises the passages of the [[Bible]] that supposedly reflect communications from [[Abrahamic god#The Supreme Deity|God]] to humans through [[prophets]]. [[Jews]], [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]] usually consider the biblical prophets to have received [[revelation]]s from God.

Prophetic passages{{mdash}}inspirations, interpretations, admonitions or predictions&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite OED|prophecy}} "b. An instance of divinely inspired speech or writing; a revelation from God or a god; a prophetic text. Also as a mass noun: such writings considered collectively."&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}appear widely distributed throughout Biblical narratives. Some future-looking [[prophecy| prophecies]] in the Bible are conditional, with the conditions either implicitly assumed or explicitly stated.

In general, believers in biblical prophecy engage in [[exegesis]] and [[hermeneutics]] of scriptures which they believe contain descriptions of [[global politics]], [[natural disaster]]s, the future of the nation of [[Israel]], the coming of a [[Messiah]] and of a [[Kingdom of God| Messianic Kingdom]]—as well as the [[eschatology |ultimate destiny of humankind]].

==Overview==
Prophets in the [[Hebrew Bible]] often warn the [[Israelites]] to repent of their [[sin]]s and [[idolatry|idolatries]], with the threat of punishment or reward. [[Blessing]]s and [[Curse#Biblical curses|catastrophes]] are attributed to the deity. According to believers in Bible prophecy, many of these prophecies are viewed as having been fulfilled within later passages.

In Judaism and Christianity, a number of biblical passages have been taken as prophecies of a coming [[Messiah]]. [[Christian]]s believe that these [[Messianic prophecies]] are fulfilled by Christ [[Jesus]], while followers of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] still await the arrival of the [[Jewish Messiah]] and other signs of [[Jewish eschatology]]. Most Christians believe many messianic prophecies will be fulfilled with the [[Second Coming of Christ]], though some Christians ([[Full Preterism|Full Preterists]]) believe that all [[Messianic prophecies]] have already been fulfilled. Rabbinic Judaism does not separate the original coming of the Messiah and the advent of the [[Messianic Age]]. For details of the differences, see [[Christianity and Judaism]].

Another much-discussed issue concerns the "[[end times]]", or "last days", particularly according to the Revelation of John.

===Genesis===
{{See also|Covenant of the pieces|Greater Israel}}
{{bibleref2|Genesis|15:18}} promises [[Abraham]] and his descendants the land of [[Canaan]] from the river of Egypt to the [[Euphrates]], and Genesis 17:8 states:
{{quote|And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual holding; and I will be their God.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|17:8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[F. F. Bruce]] argues that the fulfilment of this prophecy occurred during [[David]]'s reign. He writes:
{{quote|David's sphere of influence now extended from the Egyptian frontier on the Wadi el-Arish (the "brook of Egypt") to the Euphrates; and these limits remained the ideal boundaries of Israel's dominion long after David's empire had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the Nations'', Michigan, 1981 [1963], page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

[[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] point to [[corporate personality]] here to connect Abraham with the Jewish nation. [[H. Wheeler Robinson]] writes:
{{quote|Corporate personality is the important Semitic complex of thought in which there is a constant oscillation between the individual and the group – family, tribe, or nation – to which he belongs, so that the king or some other representative figure may be said to embody the group, or the group may be said to sum up the host of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6KubFGfBXUMC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=corporate+personality+Wheeler |first= Sidney|last= Greidanus|author-link= Sidney Greidanus|title= Preaching Christ from the Old Testament|date= 1999|page= 198|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|accessdate= 2009-04-13 | isbn= 978-0-8028-4449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, and Judges===
God is represented as guaranteeing that the Israelites would drive out the [[Amorite]]s, Canaanites, [[Hittites|Hittite]]s, [[Perizzite]]s, [[Hivite]]s and [[Jebusite]]s from their lands, which the [[Israelites]] wanted to appropriate ({{bibleref2|Exodus|34:10–11}}). The same applies to the [[Girgashite]]s ({{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|7:1–2}}). In {{bibleref2|Exodus|34:10–27}}, this is referred to as a [[biblical covenant|covenant]], commandments being given. In Judges, the Israelites are described as disobeying the commandment to worship no other gods ({{bibleref2|Judges|3:6}}) and, as a result, not being able to drive out the Jebusites ({{bibleref2|Joshua|15:63}}). The Israelites did not drive all of the Canaanite tribes out in the lifetime of Joshua. The books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] (Chapters 1) mention towns that could not be defeated. According to [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]], the Israelites occupied Canaan but the complete seizure took place only when David defeated the Jebusites in [[Jerusalem]] and made it the capital of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. ({{bibleref2|2 Sam|5:6–7}})&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Herrmann, ''A History of Israel in Old Testament Times'', London, 1981, SCM Press Ltd, page 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Davidic dynasty===
{{Main article|Davidic dynasty in Bible prophecy}}
God states that the house, throne and kingdom of David and his offspring (called "the one who will build a house for my Name" in the verse) will last forever (2 Samuel 7:12–16; 2 Chronicles 13:5; Psalm 89:20–37). 1 Kings 9:4–7 as well as 1 Chronicles 28:5 and 2 Chronicle 7:17 state that Solomon's establishment is conditional on [[Solomon]] obeying God's commandments.

Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 2:1; 6:7–10) and did not obey God's commandments (1 Kings 11:1–14).

The destruction of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 586 BC brought an end to the rule of the royal house of David.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=593&amp;letter=J|title=Judah, Kingdom of - JewishEncyclopedia.com|last=|first=|date=|work=jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars including Saul of Cyrene{{who|date=November 2018}} state that God has promised an eternal dynasty to David unconditionally (1 Kings 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19). They feel the conditional promise of 1 Kings 9:4–7 seems to undercut this unconditional covenant. Most interpreters have taken the expression "throne of Israel" as a reference to the throne of the [[United Monarchy]]. They see this as a conditionalization of the unconditional dynastic promise to David's house expressed in 1 Kings 11:36, 15:4 and 2 Kings 8:19. They argue the presence of both unconditional and conditional promises to the house of David would create intense theological dissonance in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]].&lt;ref name="Nelson1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard D. Nelson|title=First and Second Kings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCgUvQOIvD0C&amp;pg=PA29|year=1987|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-23742-4|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Joseph Collins|title=A Short Introduction to the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWNohGTPy48C&amp;pg=PA125|year=2007|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6207-3|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChaferWalvoord1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis Sperry Chafer|author2=John F.

[[Christian]]s believe that the promise is of surviving descendants that could fulfill the role of king rather than a permanent earthly kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, L. O.

===Kings===
*According to the [[Books of Kings]], God told [[Zedekiah]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon... You will not die by the sword; you will die peacefully. (Jeremiah 34:2–5)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Books of Kings and [[Jeremiah]] relate that Zedekiah's eyes were put out after he was taken to the King of Babylon and that he remained a prisoner in Babylon until his death (2 Kings 25:6–7 and Jeremiah 52:10–11). There is no other historical record of what happened with Zedekiah in Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Herrmann, ''A history of Israel in Old Testament times'', London, 1981, SCM Press Ltd, page 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

*God is also represented as promising Josiah that because he humbled himself before God, he would be ''"buried in peace"'' and the book goes on to say he shall not see the disaster to come on Judah (2 Kings 22:19–20).
Josiah fought against the Egyptians although the pharaoh, [[Necho II]], prophesied that God would destroy him if he did (2 Chronicles 35:21–22)—possibly Josiah was ''"opposing the faithful prophetic party"''.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the Nations'', Michigan, 1981, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah was killed in battle against the Egyptians (2 Kings 23:29–30).  However, Judah was in a time of peace when Josiah died, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

===Isaiah===
{{Details|Isaiah 7:14}}
*When the Jews heard that "Aram has allied itself with Ephraim" God is said to have told them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It will not take place, it will not happen... Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:1–9|31}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|28:5–6|31}} "God delivered the King of the Jews, [[Ahaz]], into the hands of the King of Syria, who carried away a great multitude of them captives to [[Damascus]]. And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter".&lt;br /&gt;In {{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:9|31}} the prophet says clearly that a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the prophecy is that Ahaz stands firm in his faith. This means that he should trust God and not seek military help in the Assyrians which Ahaz nevertheless did.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the Nations'', Michigan, 1981, pages 62–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Book of Isaiah also foretold;'''
*Babylon would be overthrown by the [[Medes]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|13:17–19|31}}) and its palaces taken over by wild animals. ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|13:21–22|31}})
Christian apologists state that the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 13 and 21 could possibly have been directed originally against [[Assyria]] whose capital Nineveh was defeated in 612 BC by a combined onslaught of the Medes and Babylonians. According to this explanation the prophecy was later updated and referred to Babylon&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Isaiah 21:1.&lt;/ref&gt; not recognizing the rising power of Persia. On the other hand, it can be mentioned that the Persian King [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] after overthrowing Media in 550 BC did not treat the [[Medes]] as a subject nation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of treating the Medes as a beaten foe and a subject nation, he had himself installed as king of Media and governed Media and Persia as a dual monarchy, each part of which enjoyed equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, ''Israel and the nations'', Michigan, 1981, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Damascus will become a "heap of ruins. The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left to flocks". ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|17:1–2|31}})
The prophecy may date from 735 BC when Damascus and Israel were allied against Judah.&lt;ref name="New Jerusalem Bible 1985"&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Isaiah 17:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiglath-Pileser took Damascus in 732 BC,&lt;ref name="New Jerusalem Bible 1985"/&gt; which some apologists point to as a fulfillment of this prophecy, but this campaign never reduced the city to rubble.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The depiction of Damascus as a "heap of ruins" has been understood as figurative language to describe the despoiling of the city, the leading of its people as captives to Kir (an unidentified city), and the way that the city lost much of its wealth and political influence in the years following Tiglath-Pileser's attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TbMCAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=bible+then+and+now&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qMOCT9HTMqXQ0QXw8fWABw Jenny Roberts, ''Bible Then and Now'', MacMillan, p. 59]&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecy is also believed by some to have a future fulfilment relating to end-time developments concerning Israel.

The passage is consistent with {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|31}}, which states that Assyria defeated the city and exiled the civilians to Kir.

*The river of [[Ancient Egypt]] (identified as the Nile in RSV) shall dry up. (19:5).
*"The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt." ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|19:17|31}})
*"There shall be five cities in [[Ancient Egypt]] that speak the Canaanite language." ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|19:18|31}})
*"In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 24 In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. 25 The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, 'Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.'" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|19:23–25|31}})
Some theologians argue the statement that the "land of Judah" will terrify the Egyptians is not a reference to a large army from Judah attacking Egypt but a circumlocution for the place where God lives. They argue it is God and his plans that will cause Egypt to be terrified. They go on to argue the second "in that day" message from verse 18 announces the beginning of a deeper relationship between God and Egypt which leads to Egypt's conversion and worshiping God (verses 19–21). They say the last "in that day" prophecy (verses 23–25) speaks about Israel, Assyria and Egypt as God's special people, thus, describing eschatological events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cLN08jf_C2EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=isaiah+19:17#PPA360,M1 Gary V. Smith, ''Isaiah 1–39'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2007, pages 360–363]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ldDLYd2AuAsC&amp;pg=PA740&amp;dq=isaiah+19:17#PPA375,M1 John N. Oswalt, ''The Book of Isaiah, Chapters 1–39'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1986, pages 375–381]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The generals of [[Astyages]], the last king of the Medes, mutinied  at [[Pasargadae]] and the empire surrendered to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;The Persian Empire: a corpus of sources from the Achaemenid period, By [[Amélie Kuhrt]] p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; which conquered Babylon in 539 BC under [[Cyrus the Great]]. The unknown second prophet [[Book of Isaiah#Authorship|(See ''Deutero-Isaiah'')]] predicts the coming of Cyrus, ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|44:28|31}}, {{bibleverse||Isaiah|45:1|31}}) who will liberate the Jews from their Babylonian exile and bring them to the promised land. The second Isaiah, 40–55, comes from the late exilic period, about 540 BC. Some scholars believe the reference to Cyrus is a [[vaticinium ex eventu]] or "prophecy from the event".&lt;ref&gt;Laato, Antti. "The composition of Isaiah 40–55." ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 109.2 (Sum 1990): 207–228. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials.

There are many scholars, however, who point out that the prophet himself spoke of Cyrus arguing that Deutero-Isaiah interpreted Cyrus' victorious entry into Babylon in 539 BC as evidence of divine commission to benefit Israel. The main argument against the idols in these chapters is that they cannot declare the future, whereas God does tell future events like the Cyrus predictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dBY5iuvcKawC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=isaiah+45+cyrus#PPA99,M1 Paul D.

===Jeremiah===
[[Jeremiah]] prophesied that;
*"...all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honour the name of the Lord." (3:17 (NIV))
*Hazor will be desolated. (49:33)
*The [[Babylonian captivity]] would end when the "70 years" ended. ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|29:10|31}})
It lasted 68 years (605 BC–537 BC) from the capture of the land of Israel by Babylon&lt;ref&gt;Jehoiakim in Harper Collins' Bible Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and the exile of a small number of hostages including Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael ({{bibleverse||Daniel|1:1–4|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |pages=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted 60 years (597–537 BC) from the deportation of the 10,000 elite ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:14|31}}) including Jehoiachin and Ezekiel&lt;ref name="Harbin 2005 309"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a discrepancy with Jeremiah's numbers of exiles ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:28–30|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted 49 years (586–537 BC) from the exile of the majority of Judah ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:11|31}}) including Jeremiah who was taken to Egypt and leaving behind a poor remnant ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:12|31}}).&lt;ref name="Harbin 2005 309" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, some Christian scholars try to explain the figure in a different way stating that Jeremiah gave a round number.&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Jeremiah 25:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "kings of the [[Medes]]" would "take vengeance" on Babylon. ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|51:11|31}})
Christian commentaries have considered the conquering Persian force an alliance between the Persians and the Medes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wycliffe Bible Commentary: Old Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Reader's Companion''&lt;/ref&gt; One suggests the use of the term "Medes" is due to earlier recognition among the Jews and because the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 51:11 in ''The Pulpit Commentary: Jeremiah (Vol. II)''&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Babylon Ruins Marines.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|US Marines in front of [[Babylon#Reconstruction|Babylon as it stood in 2003]]]]
*Jeremiah prophesied that Babylon would be destroyed at the end of the seventy years.

===Gospels===
{{Details|Abomination of desolation|Olivet Discourse|Second Coming}}
*In Matthew 10, when Jesus sent forth the twelve disciples, he told them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the [[Son of man|Son of Man]] comes." (Matthew 10:23)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Christian response is varied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Moffatt puts it "before the Son of man arrives" as if Jesus referred to this special tour of Galilee. Jesus could overtake them. Possibly so, but it is by no means clear. Some refer it to the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], others to the coming of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost]], others to the [[Second Coming]]. Some hold that Matthew has put the saying in the wrong context. Others bluntly say that Jesus was mistaken, a very serious charge to make in his instructions to these preachers. The use of ἑως [heōs] with aorist subjunctive for a future event is a good Greek idiom.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, A. (1997). Word Pictures in the New Testament. Vol.V c1932, Vol.VI c1933 by Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. (Mt 10:23). Oak Harbor: Logos Research Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Preterist]] scholars explain this verse as referring to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD with the phrase "before the [[Son of Man]] comes" meaning before judgment comes upon the nation of Israel and the city of Jerusalem for [[Rejection of Jesus|rejecting Jesus Christ as The Messiah]]. They reject to refer Matthew 10:23 to the second coming of Jesus because Jesus speaks to his disciples about the towns of Israel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Such a view completely divorces the passage from its immediate and localized context, such as the fact that this was an admonition to the apostles – and not directed to a generation several millennia removed from the first century.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Zahn, F.F. Bruce, J. Barton Payne, etc. hold this opinion [http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/668-what-is-the-meaning-of-matthew-10-23 – What is the meaning of Matthew 10:23?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Wycliffe Bible Commentary disagrees with this view:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the similar context of Mt 24:8–31 the great tribulation and the second advent are in view. Hence, the "coming of the Son of man" is probably eschatological here also. This would have been more readily understood by the disciples, who would hardly have thought to equate this "coming" with the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962). The Wycliffe Bible commentary : New Testament (Mt 10:16). Chicago: Moody Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In Matthew 12:40 Jesus says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." (See also Matthew 16:21, 20:19, Mark 8:31, 9:31, 10:34, Luke 11:29–30 and John 2:19) According to Mark 15:42–46, Jesus was buried in Friday night and according to Matthew 28:1–6 and John 20:1, Jesus' tomb was found empty on Sunday dawn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is customary for eastern nations to count part of a day as a whole 24-hour day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matthew 12:40 (multiple translations)|url=http://bible.cc/matthew/12-40.htm|work=bible.cc|accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Jesus prophesies in Matthew 16:27–28:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the Son of Man is going to come in his [[God the Father|Father's]] glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Christian responses have been varied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some of them that stand here (τινες των ὁδε ἑστωτων [tines tōn hode hestōtōn]). A ''crux interpretum'' in reality. Does Jesus refer to the transfiguration, the resurrection of Jesus, the great day of Pentecost, the destruction of Jerusalem, the second coming and judgment? We do not know, only that Jesus was certain of his final victory which would be typified and symbolized in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, A. (1997). Word Pictures in the New Testament. Vol.V c1932, Vol.VI c1933 by Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. (Mt 16:28). Oak Harbor: Logos Research Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Preterism|Preterists]] respond that Jesus did not mean His second coming but a demonstration of His might when He says "coming in his kingdom". In this view, this was accomplished by the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD when some of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] were still living and thus fulfilling the word of Jesus that only some will not have died.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Knox Chamblin, Professor of New Testament Emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary: [http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/kno_chamblin/NT.Chamblin.Matt.16.21-28.pdf Commentary on Matthew 16:21–28] – see last 4 paragraphs&lt;/ref&gt;
Others argue it refers to the Transfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, C. (2001, c1992). Vol. 22: Matthew (electronic ed.). Logos Library System; ''The New American Commentary'' (261). Nashville: Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walvoord, J. F., Zuck, R. B., &amp; Dallas Theological Seminary. (1983-c1985). The Bible Knowledge Commentary: An Exposition of the Scriptures (2:59). Wheaton, Illinois: Victor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wycliffe Bible Commentary states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This coming of the Son of Man in his kingdom is explained by some as the destruction of Jerusalem and by others as the beginning of the Church. But referring it to the Transfiguration meets the requirements of the context (all Synoptists follow this statement with the Transfiguration, Mk 9:1; Lk 9:27). Furthermore, Peter, who was one of those standing here, referred to the Transfiguration in the same words (II Pet 1:16–18). Chafer calls the Transfiguration a "preview of the coming kingdom on earth" (L. S. Chafer, Systematic Theology, V, 85).&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962). The Wycliffe Bible commentary : New Testament (Mt 16:28). Chicago: Moody Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*He also prophesies to [[Caiaphas]] (Matthew 26:64, KJV):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The word "you will see" is in Greek "ὄψεσθε" [opheste, from the infinitive optomai]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/NTpdf/mat26.pdf#page=13 Online Interlinear New Testament in Greek – Matthew 26]&lt;/ref&gt; which is plural. Jesus meant that the Jews, and not just the high priest, will see his coming.

*Jesus declared in [[Gospel]] accounts of Matthew, Luke and John that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] would deny him three times before cock-crow. Mark states that the [[rooster|cock]] crowed after the first denial as well as after the third denial. (First crow is not found in the NIV version)

Christians argue that the first cock-crow is simply missing from Matthew, Luke, and John. In Matthew ({{bibleref2|Matthew|26:34}}), Luke ({{bibleref2|Luke|22:34}}), and John ({{bibleref2|John|13:38}}), Jesus foretells three denials of Peter before cock-crow. {{bibleref2|Matthew|26:69–75}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|22:54–62}}, {{bibleref2|John|18:15–27}} report the fulfillment of this prophecy. In {{bibleref2|Mark|14:30}}, Jesus speaks of two cock-crows, which is mentioned in {{bibleref2|Mark|14:66–72}} as having taken place. Christians argue that Matthew, Luke, and John removed the first cock-crow and diminished (Luke even eliminated) the partial exit by Peter after the first denial (which Mark reports).&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Mark 14:68&lt;/ref&gt; If Mark was the "interpreter of Peter",&lt;ref&gt;Papias, quoted in Eusebius, ''History of the Church'', trans. G.A. Williamson (London: Penguin Books Ltd., 1965). 3.39.15 / pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; he would have gotten his information directly and thus would be considered the more reliable source.

* Matthew 24:1,2 states (cf Luke 21:6):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. "Do you see all these things?" he asked. "I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Preterists claim these verses are metaphorical.&lt;ref&gt;John A.T., Robinson, ''Redating the New Testament'', London, 1976, page 20, "it was the temple that perished by fire while the walls of the city were thrown down"&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70&lt;ref&gt;Jos Wars vii. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilled this despite the existence of the [[wailing wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962). ''The Wycliffe Bible commentary: New Testament'' (Mt 24:2). Chicago: Moody Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, D. A. (1994). ''New Bible commentary'' : 21st century edition. Rev. ed. of: ''The New Bible Commentary''. 3rd ed. / edited by D. Guthrie, J.A. Motyer.  1970. (4th ed.) (Mt 24:2). Leicester, England;  Downers Grove, Ill., USA: Inter-Varsity Press. "But Jesus’ prophecy of not one stone left on another was to be literally fulfilled; all that survived the Roman assault was part of the platform on which they were built (including the ‘Wailing Wall’)."&lt;/ref&gt; The IVP Bible Background Commentary states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some stones were left on others (e.g., part of one wall still stands), but this fact does not weaken the force of the hyperbole: the temple was almost entirely demolished in A.D. 70.&lt;ref&gt;Keener, C. S., &amp; InterVarsity Press. (1993). The IVP Bible background commentary : New Testament (Mt 24:2). Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The parts of the wall Jesus refers to in the verse may not have included the wailing wall. Recent archaeological evidence suggest that the wailing wall part of the temple complex was not completed until an uncertain date in or after 16 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/uk-israel-archaeology-idUSLNE7AM01J20111123 | work=Reuters | first=Maayan | last=Lubell | title=Old coins force re-think on Jerusalem's Western Wall | date=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Matthew 24:7–8 is part of Jesus response to the disciples in verse 5 asking, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" It states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The famines part of this verse has often been associated with the third seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:5–6), and the pestilences and earthquakes aspect has often been associated with the fourth seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:7–8).&lt;ref name="Wycliffe 24:7-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiersbe"/&gt; The presence of the term birthpains could be representative of better times ahead.&lt;ref name="Wycliffe 24:7-8"&gt;Pfeiffer, C. F., &amp; Harrison, E. F. (1962). ''The Wycliffe Bible commentary: New Testament'' (Mt 24:7–8). Chicago: Moody Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars point out that these events have always been on earth, so the verse must refer to a significant increase in the intensity of them.&lt;ref name="Wiersbe"&gt;Wiersbe, W. W. (1997, c1992). ''Wiersbe's Expository Outlines on the New Testament'' (88). Wheaton, Ill.: Victor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also instances of erroneous, or untraceable, quotations from the prophets cited by the early Christians:
*Matthew 27:9 paraphrases Zechariah 11:12 and 13 in relation to buying a field for [[30 pieces of silver]], but attributes it as a saying of Jeremiah. Jeremiah is described as buying a field (Jeremiah 32:6–9) but for seventeen [[shekel]]s of silver rather than 30.

Christian writers have given several responses. First is that the use of Jeremiah is meant to refer to all the books of prophecy. Second is that although Jeremiah said this, any record has not survived. Third is this was the result of a scribal error because of the single letter difference in the abridged versions of the names.

*Matthew 2:23 refers to a prophecy being fulfilled by Jesus living in [[Nazareth]] which is not found in the Old Testament.

Christians have given several responses. First is that this prophecy has not survived to the present day. Second is the Greek word ''nazaret'' does not mean Nazarene but is related to the Hebrew word ''netzer'' which can be translated as 'branch'. Third is that the verse is not a prophetic saying but simply reflects an Old Testament requirement for the Messiah to be held in contempt, (Psalm 22:6–8; 69:9–11, 19–21; Isaiah 53:2–4, 7–9) which they argue Nazarenes were (John 1:46; John 7:52).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Answering The Atheist|date=January 18, 2004|volume=4|issue=3|url=http://www.lookinguntojesus.net/ata20040118.htm|publisher=Limestone Church of Christ|location=Kingston, Ontario, Canada|title=Where is the OT prophecy for Matthew 2:23?|accessdate=August 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725113534/http://www.lookinguntojesus.net/ata20040118.htm|archivedate=25 July 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars respond that this is because the Malachi reference was just an introduction,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yEKfTSCESyMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=mark+1:2+quotation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zv_kN5KzCH&amp;sig=EAShA_5MsxlpGEZnneOLAWkKVk0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pmMSSvf5A9GBkQXHwd2EDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=23#PPA37,M1 Steve Moyise, M.J.J.Menken, ''Isaiah in the New Testament'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, page 37]&lt;/ref&gt; which made it significantly less important than Isaiah 40:3, leading to the whole being attributed to the prophet Isaiah. Other reasons given are Isaiah's authority was considered higher than Malachi and the Isaiah text was better known.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0MjWS_4La_EC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=mark+1:2+quotation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jj2-ZkRORJ&amp;sig=ocYLEdV4rLKZ6_O-f1KK8130LVk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pmMSSvf5A9GBkQXHwd2EDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=26#PPA27,M1 James R.

===Letters of Paul===
*Paul the apostle prophesied about the [[Second Coming]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. (1 Thessalonians 4:15–17)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Christians argue that Paul speaks about his own presence at the last day only hypothetically.&lt;ref&gt;''New Jerusalem Bible'', Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in ''La Bible de Jerusalem'' – revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to 1 Thessalonians 4:15: "Paul includes himself among those who will be present at the parousia: more by aspiration, however, than by conviction."&lt;/ref&gt; They point out Paul later states the Day of the Lord comes like a thief ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:1–2|31}}) which is a word Jesus uses himself ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:43–44|31}}) expressing the impossibility of predicting His second coming ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:36|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VPO4POTRD44C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=romans+13:11Ben Witherington, III, ''The Paul Quest'', InterVarsity Press, 2001, pages 141–142]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Paul prophesied in 1 Thessalonians 5:2–11: "For you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, Peace and safety, destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape."
*In {{bibleref2|2Thess|2:3–4||2 Thessalonians 2:3–4}}, Paul prophesied that the [[Man of sin]] would sit in the temple of God declaring himself as God. The [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was destroyed in 70 AD.
There are different attempts to explain the term "to take his seat in the temple of God". Some understand it as a divine attribute which the [[Man of Lawlessness|man of lawlessness]] arrogates to himself and hence no conclusion can be drawn for time and place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W_OJNyhn8kgC&amp;pg=PA520&amp;dq=2+thessalonians+2:3+temple&amp;lr= Herman N.

Eerdmans Publishing, 1997, pages 520–521]&lt;/ref&gt; Many in the early Church, such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome, Origen and Cyril of Jerusalem, believed a [[Third Temple|literal Temple would be rebuilt]] by the [[Antichrist]] before the Lord's Second Coming whereas Jerome and John Chrysostom referred the Temple to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aogf2fT9UhoC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=2+thessalonians+2:3+temple&amp;lr= T. L. Frazier, ''A Second Look at the Second Coming, Conciliar Press Ministries, Inc., 2005, pages 141–142]&lt;/ref&gt; Also some today's scholars refer the phrase "God's temple" to the Church pointing out that Paul used this term five other times outside 2 Thessalonians and does not refer it to a literal temple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zlyPH_3Pvl4C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=2+thessalonians+2:3+temple Gregory K.

*1 Timothy 4:1–3 says "in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth".
The [[Church fathers]] such as [[John Chrysostom]] who lived at the time of [[Gnostics]], the [[Marcionites]], the [[Encratites]], the [[Manicheans]]—who rejected Christian marriage and the eating of because they believed that all flesh was from an evil principle—asserted this text referred to such sects and that they were therefore "in the latter times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.newadvent.org/fathers/230612.htm|title=Church Fathers: Homily 12 on First Timothy (Chrysostom)|last=|first=|date=|work=newadvent.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ti004.htm|title=New Advent Bible: 1 Timothy 4|last=|first=|date=|work=newadvent.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant theologian [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]]&lt;ref&gt;''Exposition of the Entire Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; believed that this refers to the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], particularly [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|priestly celibacy]] and [[Lent]] as promulgated by the medieval church. (see [[Great Apostasy]])
*Paul wrote in Romans 13:11,12: "...our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here."
Some Christian scholars believe the verses 11–14 refer to the era of salvation beginning with Christ's resurrection&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8WvWqGSiL2AC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=romans+13:11 J.

===Other New Testament books===
* The [[Epistle of Jude]] quotes a prophecy from the [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphical]] [[Book of Enoch]]. ({{bibleverse||Jude|14–15|31}}) Christians have argued that a canonical book quoting from a noncanonical source does not elevate the source to the same level; doing so simply addresses a point made by the other author. They point out the Old Testament quotes books never used in the canon, such as {{bibleverse||Joshua|10:13|31}} and {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|1:18|31}} quoting from the [[Book of Jashar]], and in the New Testament, Paul quotes pagan writers [[Aratus]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|17:28|31}}), [[Menander]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:33|31}}), and [[Epimenides]] ({{bibleverse||Titus|1:12|31}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervin |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that the author of Jude might have been aware that the text of 1 Enoch 1:9 which he was quoting is in fact a form of [[midrash]] of Deuteronomy 33:2,&lt;ref&gt;cf. comparison of texts in Charles, R.H. ''Book of Enoch with the Greek Fragments'', London 1904&lt;/ref&gt; so the prophecy is originally that of Moses, not "Enoch the Seventh from Adam" (itself a section heading from 1En.60:8)&lt;ref&gt;Nickelsburg, George W.E., ''1 Enoch'', Hermeneia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revelation===
*In this first-century text, Jesus is spoken of as telling the [[Seven churches of Asia|Seven churches of Asia Minor]] ({{bibleverse||Revelation|1:3|31}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|1:7|31}}) that he will come "soon". ({{bibleverse||Revelation|22:7|31}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|22:10|31}})&lt;br /&gt;(''see also'' [[Seven seals]], [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], [[two witnesses]], [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], [[The Beast (Bible)|The Beast]], [[Whore of Babylon]], [[Millennialism]])
The word "soon" (other translations use "shortly" or "quickly") does not have to be understood in the sense of close future. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] scholar Thorleif Boman explained that the Israelites, unlike [[Europeans]] or people in the West, did not understand time as something measurable or calculable according to Hebrew thinking but as something qualitative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have examined the ideas underlying the expression of calculable time and more than once have found that the Israelites understood time as something qualitative, because for them time is determined by its content.'' &lt;ref&gt;Thorleif Boman, ''Hebrew Thought compared with Greek'', W.W.Norton &amp; Company, New York – London, 1970, page 137&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the Semitic concept of time is closely coincident with that of its content without which time would be quite impossible. The quantity of duration completely recedes behind the characteristic feature that enters with time or advances in it. Johannes Pedersen comes to the same conclusion when he distinguishes sharply between the Semitic understanding of time and ours. According to him, time is for us an abstraction since we distinguish time from the events that occur in time. The ancient Semites did not do this; for them time is determined by its content.&lt;ref&gt;Thorleif Boman, ''Hebrew Thought compared with Greek'', W.W.Norton &amp; Company, New York – London, 1970, page 139&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Messianic prophecies in Judaism==
{{Main article|Jewish messianism}}
The following are the scriptural requirements in Judaism concerning the Messiah, his actions, and his reign. Jewish sources insist that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright. Some Christians maintain that some of these prophecies are associated with a putative [[second coming]] while Jewish scholars state there is no concept of a second coming in the Hebrew Bible.

===Jesus===
While Christian biblical scholars have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.
*Deuteronomy 18:18
*[[Isaiah 7:14]] – Matthew 1:22,23 states "The ''virgin'' will be with child and will give birth to a son, and ''they'' will call him Immanuel" — which means, "God with us". However the Jewish translation of that passage reads "Behold, the ''young woman'' is with child and will bear a son and ''she'' will call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism"&gt;http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/EnglishHandbook.pdf English Handbook Page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah chapter 7 speaks of a prophecy made to the Jewish King [[Ahaz]] to allay his fears of two invading kings (those of Damascus and of Samaria) who were preparing to invade Jerusalem, about 600 years before Jesus’ birth. Isaiah 7:16: "For before the boy will know enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose ''two kings'' you dread will be forsaken."
*[[Isaiah 53]] – According to many Christians, the suffering servant mentioned in this chapter is actually a reference to the crucifixion and suffering of Jesus on the cross to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the sins of mankind. However, according to the classical Jewish comentators, the suffering servant described in Isaiah chapter 53 is actually the Jewish people; sometimes Isaiah mentions groups of people as if they were one person.
*[[Ministry of Jesus#Capernaum as prophecy|Isaiah 9:1,2]] – In Isaiah, the passage describes how Assyrian invaders are increasingly aggressive as they progress toward the sea, while Matthew 4:13–15 has re-interpreted the description as a prophecy stating that Jesus would progress (without any hint of becoming more aggressive) toward Galilee. While Matthew uses the [[Septuagint]] rendering of Isaiah, in the [[Masoretic text]] it refers to the region of the gentiles rather than Galilee of the nations.
*[[Prophecy of seventy weeks|Daniel 9:24–27]] – King James Version puts a definite article before "Messiah the Prince". (Daniel 9:25) The original Hebrew text does not read "the Messiah the Prince", but, having no article, it is to be rendered "a mashiach, a prince". The word [[mashiach]]["anointed one", "messiah"] is nowhere used in the Jewish Scriptures as a proper name, but as a title of authority of a king or a high priest. Therefore, a correct rendering of the original Hebrew should be: "an anointed one, a prince." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/faq/faq043.html Jews for Judaism FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Flight into Egypt#Prophecy of Hosea|Hosea 11:1]] –  Matthew 2:14 states, "So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'" However, that passage reads, "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."
*[[Psalm 22:16]] – The [[New International Version|NIV]] renders this verse as "they have pierced my hands and my feet", based on the [[Septuagint]]. However, there is some [[they have pierced my hands and my feet|controversy]] over this translation, since the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]] reads כארי ידי ורגלי ("like a lion my hands and my feet").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psalm 22:16 (New International Version)|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2022:16&amp;version=NIV|work=biblegateway.com|accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the NIV translation is correct, however, then it would also be a prophecy of crucifixion since the original text was written before the [[Persian people|Persians]] had invented the first early stages of crucifixition.
*Psalm 16:10
*Psalm 34:20 - States that none of the messiah's bones will be broken. In John 19:31-33, during the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the Jews asked the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] to break the legs of those who were being crucified because it was the [[Sabbath day]]. When breaking the legs of the two who were crucified with Jesus, they had come to Jesus and they had found that he was already dead and did not break his legs. Thus many Christians believe that this event  is the fulfillment of this prophecy.
*Psalm 69:21
*Isaiah 9:6 – The verse reads: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called ''Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace''."
*Psalm 110:1 – Matthew 22:44 states "The Lord said to my ''Lord'': Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." Although Hebrew has no capital letters, the Hebrew translation of that passage reads "The Lord said to my ''lord''" indicating that it is not speaking of God.
*Micah 5:2 – Matthew 2:6 quotes this prophecy as fulfillment of the prophecy: "But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel." The verse in the Old Testament reads "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." It describes the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife, Ephrathah. (1 Chr. 2:18, 2:50–52, 4:4)
*Zechariah 12:10 – According to many Christians this passage predicts the people looking on the Messiah whom they have pierced, while God's grace is being poured out on the House of David (Israel) and the city of Jerusalem.
*Zechariah 9:9 – The [[Gospel of Matthew]] describes Jesus' triumphant entry on [[Palm Sunday]] as a fulfillment of this verse in [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]]. Matthew describes the prophecy in terms of a [[colt (horse)|colt]] and a separate donkey, whereas the original only mentions the colt. Matthew 21:1–5 reads: {{cquote|Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, ''and'' a colt with her: loose ''them'', and bring ''them'' unto me. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, ''and'' a colt the foal of an ass}}. The Hebrew translation of the prophecy reads: {{cquote|Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!/Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem/See, your king comes to you/righteous and having salvation/gentle and riding on a donkey/on a colt, the foal of a donkey.}}
The gospels of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]] state Jesus sent his disciples after only one animal. (Mark 11:1–7, Luke 19:30–35, John 12: 14,15) Critics claim this is a contradiction with some mocking the idea of Jesus riding two animals at the same time. A response is that the text allows for Jesus to have ridden on a colt that was accompanied by a donkey, perhaps its mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Promise and the Blessing |last=Harbin |first=Michael A. |year=2005 |publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-310-24037-9 |pages=415 &amp; 636}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Matthew 2:17,18 gives the killing of innocents by Herod as the fulfillment of a prophecy in Jeremiah 31:15–23:  "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more. (The phrase "because her children are no more" refers to the [[Assyrian captivity|captivity]] of Rachel's children. The subsequent verses describe their return to Israel.)
* II Samuel 7:14 – Hebrews 1:5 quotes this verse as, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.".

==Rabbi Rashi==
[[Rashi]], a 10th century French rabbi, gave the following commentaries regarding Bible prophecies:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm Chabad.Org Tanakh With Rashi's Commentary]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genesis 15:18 " '''To your seed I have given''' The word of the Holy One, blessed be He, is like an accomplished fact."
* Genesis 17:8 " '''for an everlasting possession''' And there I will be to you for a God (Gen. Rabbah 46:9), but if one dwells outside the Holy Land, it is as though he has no God (Keth. 110b)."
* Exodus 34:11 " '''the Amorites...''' Six nations are [enumerated] here [not the proverbial seven], because the Girgashites [i.e., the seventh nation] got up and emigrated because of them [the Israelites]. -[from Lev. Rabbah 17:6, Yerushalmi Shevi ith 6:1.]"
* Deuteronomy 7:1 " '''He will cast away''' Heb. וְנָשַׁל. This is an expression meaning casting away, and causing to fly. Similarly is (Deut. 19:5),“and the iron [axe blade] will cause to fly [from the tree].”
* Joshua 15:63 " '''the children of Judah could not drive them out''' We learned in Sifrei : Rabbi Joshua the son of Korha says: They really could, but they were not permitted, because of the oath which Abraham had sworn to Abimelech. Now these Jebusites were not of the Jebusite nation, but the Tower of David which was in Jerusalem, was called Jebus, and the inhabitants of that section were of the Philistines. And when the children of Judah conquered Jerusalem, they did not drive out the inhabitants of that section."
* Judges 1:19 " '''but they could not drive out''' Targum Jonathan paraphrases: But after they had sinned, they were unable to drive out the inhabitants of the plain." 
* Judges 1:21 " '''the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem''' There was a section in Jerusalem called Jebuse, which was populated by the descendants of Abimelech who were not driven out because of the oath [which Abraham had sworn], until the coming of David. This was because his grandson was still alive and Abraham had sworn [Gen. 21:23] to him, his son, and grandson."
* 2 Samuel 5:6 " '''to the Jebusites''' Mezudath Zion is called Jebus. Now they (the inhabitants of the area) were of the seed of Abimelech, and they were in possession of two statues, one blind and the other lame, symbolizing Isaac (who was blind in his latter years. See Gen. 22:1) and Jacob (who turned lame as a result of his bout with the angel. See Gen. 32:26), and in their mouths was the oath that Abraham had sworn to Abimelech (Gen. 22:23). For this reason they (the Israelites who had conquered the land) did not drive them out, for when they took Jerusalem they failed to take the stronghold, as it is stated: “And the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the people of Judah were unable, etc.” (Josh. 15:63) - it was learned: R. Joshua b. Levi said: They were indeed able but were not permitted."
* 2 Chronicles 13:5 " '''a covenant of salt''' with endurance and permanence."
* 2 Chronicles 35:22 " '''and he did not hearken to the words of Neco from the mouth of God''' who said to him from the mouth of God, for so said Isaiah, (19:2): 'And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians.' This is what the Kallir composed: 'He withheld his troops from marching to Aram Naharaim, in order that no single sword should pass through Ephraim; and he did not hearken to the prophet to turn back, for it was decreed that Egyptian be set against Egyptian.'"
* 1 Kings 9:7 " '''and this house which I have made sacrosanct for My Name''' There is a condition between Me and You, “If you heed not…” What is stated there? “I shall make desolate your sanctuaries” (Lev. 26:31)."
* 1 Kings 11:36 " '''a kingdom''' Heb. ניר, a kingdom. ניר is an expression of a yoke."
* Daniel 2:38-45 " '''You are the head of gold''' You are the golden head of the image that you saw, for your kingdom is strong, and now it is in existence and is very prominent. '''And after you will arise another kingdom lower than you''' And after you, after the reign of your son, Belshazzar, will arise a kingdom that will take the ruling power from your seed, lower and humbler than your kingdom. '''lower''' Aram. אֶרַע, lower, as silver is lower and humbler than gold, and you saw that the breast, which is after the head, was of silver; so will the kingdom of Media and Persia, which will follow the kingdom of Babylon, be humbler than the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar. '''it will crumble and shatter''' It will crumble and shatter all the nations. '''it will be a divided kingdom''' It will be a divided kingdom; two kings will rise from it at once, strong and weak, as explained below (verse 42): “part of the kingdom will be strong.” '''that they will mingle with the seed of men''' They will intermarry with the other nations but they will not be at peace and truly cleave to them wholeheartedly, and their laws will differ from the laws of the other nations. '''And in the days of these kings''' in the days of these kings, when the kingdom of Rome is still in existence. '''the God of heaven will set up a kingdom''' The kingdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, which will never be destroyed, is the kingdom of the Messiah. 
* Daniel 7:4-8 " '''The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle''' It was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle; that is the kingdom of Babylon, which was ruling at that time, and so did Jeremiah see it (4:7): “A lion has come up from its thicket,” and he says also (48:40): “like an eagle he shall soar.” '''until its wings were plucked''' Its wings were plucked, which is an allusion to its downfall. '''resembling a bear''' This represents the kingdom of Persia, which will reign after Babylon, who eats and drinks like a bear and is enwrapped in flesh like a bear. '''and it stood to one side''' and it stood to one side, indicating that when the kingdom of Babylon terminates, Persia will wait one year, when Media will reign. '''and there were three ribs in its mouth''' Aram. וּתְלָת עִלָעִין בְּפֻמַּהּ, three ribs. Our Sages explained that three provinces were constantly rebelling against it [i.e., Persia] and making peace with it; sometimes it would swallow them and sometimes spit them out. That is the meaning of “in its mouth between its teeth,” sometimes outside its teeth, sometimes inside (Kid. 72a), but I say that the three עִלָעִין are three kings who will rise from Persia: Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius who built the Temple. '''four wings… four heads''' They are the four rulers to whom Alexander of Macedon allotted his kingdom at his death, as is written in the book of Joseph ben Gurion (Book 3, ch. 14), for this third beast is the kingdom of Antiochus, and it is called נָמֵר because it issued decrees upon Israel [which were] spotted (מְנֻמָּרוֹת) and varied one from the other. '''and… ten horns''' Aram. וְקַרְנַיִן עֲשַׂר. The angel explained to him that these are the ten kings who would ascend [the throne] of Rome before Vespasian, who would destroy the Temple.	'''speaking arrogantly''' words of arrogance. That is Titus, about whom the Rabbis, of blessed memory, said (Gittin 56b) that he blasphemed and berated and entered the Heichal with brazenness."
* Daniel 7:25 " '''until a time, two times, and half a time''' This is an obscure end, as was said to Daniel (12:4): “And you, Daniel, close up the words and seal,” and the early commentators expounded on it, each one according to his view, and the ends have passed. We can still interpret it as I saw written in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon, that they are the 1,335 years stated at the end of the Book (12:12): “Fortunate is he who waits [and reaches the days one thousand three hundred and thirty-five],” and he explains the appointed time as until the time of two times and a half time, and he [Rav Saadia Gaon] said that the times are 480 [years], which is the time from the Exodus from Egypt until the Temple was built, and 410 [years], [which are] the days of the First Temple, totaling 890, and another half of this time, 445, totaling 1,335. Figure these from the time the daily sacrifice was discontinued until the daily sacrifice will be restored to its place; it was discontinued six years prior to the destruction, and there is somewhat of a proof in this Book. [See Rashi to 8:14.] Others bring further proof to this computation, namely that (Deut. 31: 18): “And I, will hide My face” [the words] הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר add up in gematria to 1,335." 
* Daniel 8:14 " '''Until evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred''' I saw an interpretation in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon for this matter, but it has already passed, and he interpreted further “until evening and morning,” that evening about which it says (Zech. 14:7): “and it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light,” and we are confident that our God’s word will stand forever; it will not be nullified. I say, however, that the עֶרֶב and בֹּקֶר stated here are a gematria, and there is support for this matter from two reasons: 1) that this computation should coincide with the other computation at the end of the Book, and 2) that Gabriel said to Daniel later on in this chapter (verse 26): “And the vision of the evening and the morning is true.” Now, if he had not hinted that the computation was doubtful, why did he repeat it to say that it was true? And the seer was commanded to close up and to seal the matter, and to him, too, the matter was revealed in a closed and sealed expression, but we will hope for the promise of our king for end after end, and when the end passes, it will be known that the expounder has erred in his interpretation, and the one who comes after him will search and expound in another manner. This can be interpreted [as follows]: namely, that עֶרֶב בֹּקֶר has the numerical value of 574, ע = 70; ר = 200; ב = 2; ב = 2; ק = 100; ר = 200. Added together, this equals 574; plus 2,300, we have 2,874. '''and the holy ones shall be exonerated''' The iniquity of Israel shall be expiated to bring an end to the decrees of their being trodden upon and crumbled since they were exiled in their first exile to Egypt, until they will be redeemed and saved with a perpetual salvation by our king Messiah, and this computation terminates at the end of 1, 290 years from the day the daily sacrifice was removed, and that is what is stated at the end of the Book (12:11): “And from the time the daily sacrifice is removed, and the silent abomination placed, will be 1,290 years,” and no more, for our king Messiah will come and remove the silent abomination. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction of the Second Temple, and an image was set up in the Heichal. Now that was the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when Apostomos burned the Torah, put an end to the daily sacrifice, and set up an image in the Heichal, as we learned in Tractate Ta’anith (26b), but for the six years that I mentioned, I have no explicit proof, but there is proof that the daily sacrifice was abolished less than a complete shemittah cycle before the destruction, for so did Daniel prophesy about Titus (9:27): “… and half the week of years [shemittah cycle] he will curtail sacrifice and meal-offering,” meaning that a part of the week of years before the destruction, sacrifices will be abolished. So it is explained below in this section. Let us return to the earlier matters, how the computation of “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred,” fits exactly with the time commencing from the descent to Egypt to terminate at the end of 1,290 years until the day that the daily sacrifice was abolished: 210 years they were in Egypt. 480 years transpired from the Exodus until the building of the Temple. 410 years the Temple existed. 70 years was the Babylonian exile. 420 years the Second Temple stood. 1,290 should be added until the end of days, totaling: 2,880. Subtract six years that the daily sacrifice was removed before the destruction, for Scripture counted 1,290 years only from the time that the daily sacrifice was removed. Here you have the computation of “evening and morning, and 2,300” added to the computation. Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the end of days 45 years over 1,290 [years]. We may say that the king Messiah will come according to the first computation, and he will subsequently be concealed from them for forty-five years. Rabbi Elazar HaKalir established (in the concluding poem of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): in the foundation of his song: six weeks of years, totaling 42. We may say that the three years that did not total a week of years he did not count. And I found it so in Midrash Ruth that the king Messiah is destined to be concealed for forty-five years after he reveals himself, and proof is brought from these verses."
* Daniel 12:11-12 " '''And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed''' in order to place a silent abomination in its stead, are days of one thousand two hundred and ninety years since the daily sacrifice was removed until it will be restored in the days of our King Messiah, and this calculation coincides with the calculation of (8:14): “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred” from the day of their exile to Egypt until the final redemption: Egyptian exile 210; From their Exodus until the First Temple 480; First Temple 410; Babylonian exile 70; Second Temple 420; Totaling 1590. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction, which equals 1584. Add 1290, and the total sum is 2874; like the numerical value of בֹּקֶר עֶרֶב [574] plus 2300 [2874]." '''Fortunate is he who waits etc.''' Forty five years are added to the above number, for our King Messiah is destined to be hidden after he is revealed and to be revealed again. So we find in Midrash Ruth, and so did Rabbi Eleazar HaKalir establish (in the concluding poem of the morning service of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): “and he will be concealed from them six weeks of years.”
* Ezekiel 29:11 " '''neither shall it be inhabited for forty years''' Forty-two years of famine were decreed in Pharaoh’s dream, corresponding to the three times the dream is written. He saw seven bad cows and seven bad ears of grain (Gen. 41) and he told it to Joseph; hence we have [it mentioned] twice, and Joseph said to him, “The seven thin and bad cows and the seven empty ears,” totaling forty-two for the famine. But they had only two, as it is stated (ibid. 45:6): “For it is two years now that the famine has been on earth,” and when Jacob came down to Egypt, the famine ceased, for behold in the third year they sowed, as it is stated (ibid. 47:19): “and then you give us seed that we may live etc.,” and the forty years were paid to them now: “neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.” תֵּשֵּׁב means sera asijiee in Old French. will be settled, peopled."
* Ezekiel 29:21 " '''On that day will I cause the horn of the House of Israel to blossom out''' I have neither heard nor found the explanation of this verse. What is the blossoming of the horn of Israel in the downfall of Egypt? Was not Israel exiled eight years before the downfall of Egypt? [Therefore,] I say that “On that day” refers back to the above section, (verse 13): “At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians.” That count ends in the year that Belshazzar assumed the throne, and we find in Daniel that in that year the kings of Persia began to gain strength, and downfall was decreed upon Babylon, as it is said (Dan. 7:1): “In the first year of Belshazzar,… Daniel saw a dream, etc.” ; (verse 4) “The first one was like a lion” - that is Babylon. And it is written (ad loc.): “I saw until its wings were plucked off, etc. (verse 5) And behold another, second beast, resembling a bear” that is Persia. And it is written (ad loc.) “And thus it was said to it, ‘Devour much flesh.’” i.e., seize the kingdom. And the kingdom of Persia was the blossoming of the horn of Israel, as it is said regarding Cyrus (Isa. 45:13): “He shall build My city and free My exiles.” Now, how do we know that the forty years of Egypt ended at that time? [The proof is that] Egypt was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the twenty-seventh [year] of Nebuchadnezzar, in the year that this prophecy was said to Ezekiel. Add forty years, and you have sixty-seven. Deduct from them forty-five for Nebuchadnezzar and twenty-three for Evil-Merodach, as we say in Megillah (11b), one of these years counting for both [kings], as we say there: “they were incomplete years.”
* Ezekiel 30:4 " '''and there will be quaking in Cush''' [Heb. חַלְחָלָה,] expression of trembling. When they hear of Egypt’s downfall, they will fear for their lives: perhaps the king of Babylon will rise up against them."
* Ezekiel 30:18 " '''a cloud will cover her''' Trouble will come upon her and cover her, and it will become dark [for her] like a day covered with clouds."
* Ezekiel 30:21 " '''I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt''' already another time, for I placed his army in the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as it is said in the Book of Jeremiah (46:2): “Concerning Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, the king of Egypt, which was on the Euphrates in Carcemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar king smote, etc.” '''and behold, it was not bound''' from that day on, as it is said at the end of the Book of Kings (II 24:7): “And the king of Egypt no longer went out of his land, for the king of Babylonia had taken from the river of Egypt,” and with this expression Jeremiah, too, prophesied concerning that blow, using the language “it has no cure,” as it is said (Jer. 46:11): “Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain you have increased medicines, you have no cure.” חֻבָּשָּׁה is an expression of binding, for they bind the broken bone."
* Jeremiah 12:14-15 " '''My wicked neighbors''' Egypt, Ammon and Moab, Tyre and Sidon, who were neighbors of Eretz Israel and were inflicting harm upon them. '''I will return and have pity on them''' They all suffered close to the destruction of the Temple, and concerning each one it is stated in this Book, “I will return the exile of…” 
* Jeremiah 33:18 " '''for all time''' There shall not be cut off from them seed fit to offer up a burnt-offering or to burn a meal-offering."
* Jeremiah 34:5 " '''You shall die in peace''' Our Sages stated that Nebuchadnezzar died during his lifetime (Moed Katan 28b), for all the days of Nebuchadnezzar his prisoners were not freed from their imprisonment, and when Nebuchadnezzar died, Zedekiah emerged from the prison. He died the next day and was buried with pomp."
* Isaiah 7:9 " '''if you do not believe''' My prophecy, you, Ahaz, and his people, for I know that you are wicked. 
* Isaiah 7:14 " '''the young woman''' My wife will conceive this year. This was the fourth year of Ahaz. '''Immanuel''' [lit. God is with us. That is] to say that our Rock shall be with us, and this is the sign, for she is a young girl, and she never prophesied, yet in this instance, Divine inspiration shall rest upon her. This is what is stated below (8:3): “And I was intimate with the prophetess, etc.,” and we do not find a prophet’s wife called a prophetess unless she prophesied. Some interpret this as being said about Hezekiah, but it is impossible, because, when you count his years, you find that Hezekiah was born nine years before his father’s reign. And some interpret that this is the sign, that she was a young girl and incapable of giving birth."
* Isaiah 13:17 " '''Behold I stir up Media against them''' Darius the Mede assassinated Belshazzar. So Scripture states (Dan. 5:30): “On that very night, Belshazzar… was slain” ; (ibid. 6:1) “And Darius the Mede acquired the kingdom.”
* Isaiah 13:22 " '''and her days''' The days of her flourishing shall not be extended, for Israel was promised (Jer. 29: 10): “When seventy years of Babylon are over, I will remember you.” And that remembering will be through Cyrus king of Persia, who will take the kingdom from Babylon after Darius the Mede, for they both, Media and Persia, joined over it, [i.e., over Babylon,] and stipulated between themselves, if the kings are from us, the governors are from you."
* Isaiah 17:2 " '''The cities of Aroer are abandoned''' Jonathan renders this as an expression of destruction. Comp. (Jer. 51:58) “shall be destroyed (עַרְעֵר תִּתְעַרְעַר) , and he explained it in reference to the cities of Aram, i.e., Jonathan renders it: Their cities are abandoned, they are destroyed. The Midrash Aggadah (introduction to Lam. Rabbah 10 [with variations], Yalkut Machin) asks in amazement, since Aroer was [part] of Eretz Israel, as it is said (Num. 32:34): ” and Aroer.“ He is dealing with Damascus and he announces matters concerning Aroer? But, since in Damascus there were streets as numerous as the days of the solar year, and in each one was a pagan deity, which they would worship one day in the year, and the Israelites made them all into one group and worshipped all of them every day, he, therefore, mentioned the downfall of Aroer juxtaposed to Damascus. I explain it, however, according to the simple meaning of the verse, as follows: Since Rezin and Pekah son of Remaliah joined together, and the prophet prophesying about the downfall of Damascus, and saying, ” Behold, Damascus shall be removed from [being] a city," and the cities of Aroer which belonged to Pekah were already abandoned, for the Reubenites and the Gadites had already been exiled, and they were always given to the flocks of sheep, and the sheep of Moab would lie there undisturbed, he continues to say that the kingdom of Pekah shall continue to be gradually terminated, and that Samaria, too, shall be captured in the days of Hoshea, and then (v. 3) And a fortress shall cease from Ephraim and a kingdom from Damascusfor Rezin shall be killed."
* Isaiah 19:5 " '''And water from the sea shall dry up''' And the sea shall not return the Nile to its source, but the Nile will descend into it and will not ascend to water Egypt."
* Isaiah 19:17 " '''And the land of Judah shall be to Egypt for a dread''' When those remaining in Egypt from the captivity of Sennacherib hear of his downfall, that he will fall in the land of Judah without any physical warfare, they will know that the Divine Presence is manifest in Israel and that their Savior is mighty, and they will fear and be frightened of the land of Judah."
* Isaiah 19:18 " '''On that day there shall be five cities, etc.''' We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 23): Following Sennacherib’s defeat, Hezekiah stood up and released the armies he had brought with him from Egypt and from Cush in chains before Jerusalem, and they imposed upon themselves the kingdom of heaven, and returned to their place, and it is said: “On that day there shall be five cities, etc.” They went and built an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt and they would sacrifice on it to heaven, to fulfill what was said: On that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt. Some of our Sages expounded it in the tractate Menahoth (109b) as referring to the altar of the temple of Onias the son of Simon the Just, who fled to Egypt and built an altar there."
* Isaiah 19:23-25 " '''there shall be a highway''' And there shall be a paved road by which they will always go from Egypt to Assyria. '''and Assyria shall come upon Egypt''' Jonathan renders: And the Assyrians shall wage war with the Egyptians. '''Israel shall be a third to Egypt and to Assyria''' for a blessing, since there was no prominent nation in the world at that time like Egypt and like Assyria, and the Jews were humble in the days of Ahaz and in the days of Hoshea the son of Elah. And the prophet states that, through the miracle that will be performed for Hezekiah, Israel’s name will be greatly magnified, and they will be as prominent as one of these kingdoms in regards to blessing and greatness. '''Which...blessed them''' [lit. him,] i.e., Israel. '''Blessed is My people''' Israel, whom I chose for Myself as a people when they were in Egypt. '''and the work of My hands''' I showed them with the mighty deeds I performed wondrously against Assyria, and through those miracles they will repent and be as though I just made them anew, and they will be My heritage, Israel. Jonathan paraphrased this in a similar manner."
* Zechariah 10:11 " '''the waves of the sea''' to sink Tyre."
* Obadiah 1:18 " '''for the Lord has spoken''' Now where did He speak? (Num. 24:19) “Out of Jacob shall come a ruler, and he shall destroy him that remains in the city.” [from Mechilta Bo 12:16, Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer ch.37]"
* Haggai 2:6 " '''and I will shake up''' with the miracles performed for the Hasmoneans. '''the heaven, etc.''' And they will understand that My Shechinah rests in this House, and they will bring gifts of silver and gold, as is written in the book of Joseph ben Gurion."

==Book of Mormon==
[[Mormons]] believe that the following biblical passages prophesy or otherwise support the provenance of the [[Book of Mormon]]:

*(Gold plates to come out of the earth) – Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. (Psalm 85:11)
*(Book of Mormon = Stick of Joseph; the Bible = Stick of Judah) – The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.(Ezekiel 37: 15–20)
*(Moroni thought to be the angel bringing the gospel in the form of the Book of Mormon) – "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." (Revelations 14:6,7)

==Use by conservative Christians==
Biblical prophecy is believed to be [[biblical literalism|literally true]] by a number of conservative Christians, such as [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Young Earth Creationists]]. Interpreters uphold this principle by providing details of prophecies that have been fulfilled.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Interpreters also dispute the legitimacy of non-biblical prophets and [[psychic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year =1999|title =Nostradamus (from Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics, Baker Book House, 1999)|publisher =John Ankerberg|url =http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/theological-dictionary/TD1001W4.htm|accessdate =2007-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060526/http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/theological-dictionary/TD1001W4.htm| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Peter Stoner]] and Dr. Hawley O. Taylor, for example, believed the Bible prophecies were too remarkable and detailed to occur by chance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} [[Arthur C. Custance]] maintained that the Ezekiel Tyre prophecy (Ezek. 26: 1–11; 29:17–20) was remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://custance.org/old/hidden/3ch3.html |title=Prophetic Fulfillments that are Indisputable: or A Tale of Two Cities |first=Arthur C. |last=Custance |authorlink=Arthur Custance |work=custance.org |accessdate=August 14, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095745/http://custance.org/old/hidden/3ch3.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These interpretive issues are related to the more general idea of how passages should be read or interpreted—a concept known as [[Biblical hermeneutics]]. Bible prophecy is an area which is often discussed in regard to [[Christian apologetics]]. Traditional Jewish readings of the Bible do not generally reflect the same attention to the details of prophecies. [[Maimonides]] stated that [[Moses]] was the greatest of the prophets and only he experienced direct revelation.&lt;ref&gt;"Moses was superior to all prophets, whether they preceded him or arose afterwards. Moses attained the highest possible human level. He perceived God to a degree surpassing every human that ever existed....God spoke to all other prophets through an intermediary. Moses alone did not need this; this is what the Torah means when God says "Mouth to mouth, I will speak to him." "Maimonides' Principles: The Fundamentals of Jewish Faith", in ''The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology, Volume I'', Mesorah Publications 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Concern with Moses' revelation involves law and ethical [[Torah|teaching]] more than predictive prophecy. According to Maimonides'  [[Guide for the Perplexed]] the prophets used metaphors and analogies and, except for Moses, their words are not to be taken literally.

According to the [[Talmud]], prophecy ceased in Israel following the rebuilding of the second temple. Nonetheless [[Maimonides]] held that a prophet can be identified if his or her predictions come true.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Multiple fulfillments==
Many scholarly and popular interpreters have argued that a prophecy may have a dual fulfillment; others have argued for the possibility of multiple fulfillments. In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an '''apotelesmatic''' interpretation of specific prophecies.

In [[Christian eschatology]], the idea of at least a dual fulfillment is usually applied to passages in the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] books of Daniel or Revelation, and to the [[Olivet Discourse|apocalyptic discourse of Jesus]] in the synoptic gospels (Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21), especially in interpretations that predict a future [[Great Tribulation|tribulation]] and a future [[Antichrist]] figure. [[Christian eschatology#Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Christian eschatology#Historicism|Historicists]] usually hold to variations of this view, while [[Christian eschatology#Preterism|Preterists]] see the same passages as applying only to events and persecutions from the time of Daniel through the first century CE.  Some who believe in multiple fulfillment tend to restrict the idea to a view of history where ancient events reflecting Israel and first-century Judaism and Christianity are predictors of larger future events to happen on a global scale at a point in time, while others tend to include symbolic applications of prophecies to multiple entities and events throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., "...the seven heads would mean all the oppressive, tyrannical civil governments during all human history from the days of Nimrod to the very end of time. This would be the larger view of the subject, what theologians call the apotelesmatic meaning of the prophecy, ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]''—the way the heavenly intelligences see it." {{Cite book|title=The Time of the End|last=Price|first=George McCready|publisher=Southern Publishing Association|year=1967|location=Nashville, TN|page=38|author-link=George McCready Price}} PDF copy retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://gospel-herald.com/price_gm/toe_index.htm|title=The Time of the End|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=7 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305205247/http://gospel-herald.com/price_gm/toe_index.htm|archivedate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Kett]] suggested multiple fulfillments in his 1799 book ''History the Interpreter of Prophecy'', in which he outlined numerous fulfillments for Antichrist prophecies, with chapters on the "Papal power", "Mahometanism" and "Infidelity" as parts of a long series of fulfillments of the prophecies.

[[Samuel Horsley]] (1733-1806) stated "The application of the prophecy to any one of these events bears all the characteristics of a true interpretation".&lt;ref name="Inspiration and Interpretation"&gt;As quoted by J. W. Burgon, in Appendix A of [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31090: ''Inspiration and Interpretation''](1861, reproduced online at Project Gutenberg).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Stuart]] (1780–1852) differentiated the idea that a prophetic passage has an inherent dual sense or double meaning from the idea of a later application of the prophecy in subsequent events, separate from the original prophecy: "In these principles there is no double sense; no ὑπόνοια ''[huponoia or "suspicion"]'', in the sense in which that word is usually employed and understood.  But there may be an apotelesmatic view or sense of a passage in the ancient Scriptures; and this is the case whenever a proceeding or a principle is reillustrated or reconfirmed.  This makes out no double sense, but a fuller and more complete exhibition of the one and simple meaning of the original.  Well may it be named a πλήρωσις ''[plerosis or "fulfillment / fulfilling"]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stuart|first=Moses|date=1852|title=Observations on Matthew 24:29–31, and the Parallel Passages in Mark and Luke, With Remarks on the Double Sense of Scripture|url=|journal=Bibliotheca Sacra|volume=IX|issue=July, 1852|pages=462, 463|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stuart noted prior usage of the term "apotelesmatic" by European interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Moses|title=A Commentary on the Book of Daniel|date=1850|pages=192, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other interpreters have referred to an apotelesmatic meaning of prophecy as a collapsing of perspective of "near" and "far" or "inaugurated" and "consummated" fulfillments, where from the viewpoint of the ancient Israelite prophet local events affecting Israel are merged with end-time cosmic events relating to the kingdom of God.

[[Carl Friedrich Keil|C. F. Keil]] (1807–1888) suggested in an influential commentary "this uniting together of the two events is not to be explained only from the perspective and apotelesmatic character of the prophecy, but has its foundation in the very nature of the thing itself.  The prophetic perspective, by virtue of which the inward eye of the seer beholds only the elevated summits of historical events as they unfold themselves, and not the valleys of the common incidents of history which lie between these heights, is indeed peculiar to prophecy in general, and accounts for the circumstance that the prophecies as a rule give no fixed dates, and apotelesmatically bind together the points of history which open the way to the end, with the end itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of the Prophet Daniel|last=Keil|first=C. F.|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|others=Translated by The Rev. M. G. Easton, D.D.|year=1884|isbn=|series=Clark's Foreign Theological Library, Fourth Series, Vol. XXXIV|location=|pages=9, 10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventh-day Adventist theologian [[Desmond Ford]] (Historicist) termed this belief the '''apotelesmatic principle''' and stated "The ultimate fulfillment is the most comprehensive in scope, though details of the original forecast may be limited to the first fulfillment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/DesmondFordDaniel814TheDayOfAtonementAndTheInvestigativeJudgment|title=Daniel 8:14, the Day of Atonement, and the Investigative Judgment|last=Ford|first=Desmond|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=485|via=}} Ford's application of this principle to the Adventist understanding of the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 created a [[Sanctuary Review Committee|controversy]] that caused his termination of employment with that denomination.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Dispensationalism|Dispensational]] Futurist theologian [[J. Randall Price|Randall Price]] applies the term "apotelesmatic" primarily to the sense of "prophetic postponement" or "an interruption in fulfillment" that dispensationalists hold occurs between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks of the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|seventy weeks prophecy of Daniel 9:24–27]]: "The technical expression for this delay in the fulfillment of the messianic program for Israel is derived from the Greek verb ''apotelo'' meaning, 'to bring to completion, finish.' The usual sense of ''telos'' as 'end' or 'goal' may here have the more technical idea of 'the consummation that comes to prophecies when they are fulfilled' (Luke 22:37). With the prefix ''apo'', which basically has the connotation of 'separation from something,' the idea is of a delay or interruption in the completion of the prophetic program. Therefore, ''apotelesmatic'' interpretation recognizes that in Old Testament texts that present the messianic program as a single event, a near and far historical fulfillment is intended, separated by an indeterminate period of time. Dispensational writers have referred to this as an 'intercalation' or a 'gap.' However, prophetic postponement better expresses this concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Randall|title=Prophetic Postponement|url=http://www.worldofthebible.com/Bible%20Studies/Prophetic%20Postponement.pdf|website=World of the Bible Ministries|accessdate=7 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414044854/http://www.worldofthebible.com/Bible%20Studies/Prophetic%20Postponement.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Halley's Bible Handbook'', the ''Scofield Reference Bible'' and many other Bible commentaries hold that the "little horn" of Daniel 8 is fulfilled both with [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] (reigned 175-164 BC) and with a future Antichrist. Henry Kett, taking the writings of Sir Isaac Newton, advanced to identifying three fulfillments: Antiochus Epiphanes, the Romans, and a future Antichrist. Several [[Historicist]] interpreters (Faber, Bickersteth, Keith, Elliott, etc.) proposed the same, but noted that the Roman Empire is classified in two forms, the Pagan and the Papal, and that the Roman Empire was also split (East and West), and that in the East [[Mohammed]] or his religion were also meant, and more particularly the Turks, and that the final form (particularly according to authors writing after the [[Crimean War]] of 1853-1856) was Russia.&lt;ref name="Daniel-by-Neser"&gt;[http://israelmusthear.co.za/Books/The_Book_of_Daniel.pdf: Daniel by F.W.C. Neser]&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodist theologian [[Adam Clarke]] (ca 1761-1832) concurred with Anglican bishop [[Thomas Newton]] (1704-1782) that the [[abomination of desolation]] as a proverbial phrase could include multiple events “substituted in the place of, or set up in opposition to, the ordinances of God, his worship, his truth, etc.”&lt;ref name="sacred-texts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/clarke/dan012.htm|title=Commentary on the Bible by Adam Clarke: Daniel: Daniel Chapter 12|work=sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for viewing some, or all of the following events as partial fulfillments of this prophecy simultaneously:

*  the re-dedication of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem to [[Zeus]] by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in 167 BC
*  the worship of the Roman standards on the [[Temple Mount]] under [[Titus]] in 70 AD
*  the building of the [[Dome of the Rock]] by the [[Umayyad Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] in circa 690 AD

The [[British Israelism|British Israelist]] [[Howard Rand]] (1963) wrote, “because men have been able to see one—and only one—fulfillment, they have missed the greater scope of this prophecy and their understanding of the full message has been thwarted. ... Too, because of the double, triple and quadruple applications of this prophecy to world events, an enormous amount of history is involved in the cryptogrammic language of the vision.”&lt;ref name="Daniel-by-Rand"&gt;Rand, H. B. (1963) ''Study in Daniel'', (Merrimac: Destiny Publishers) pp. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==

===End times===
{{Main article|End time}}
Among most [[Christian denomination]]s, the prophecy that [[Second Coming|Jesus will return to Earth]] is a major doctrine, which can be seen by its inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]]. Many specific timeframes for this prediction have been declared by individuals and groups, although many of these dates have expired without the occurrences predicted.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Timeline of unfulfilled Christian Prophecy]]&lt;/ref&gt;  An official statement of [[Holy See|the Vatican]], issued in 1993, asserted, "''we are already in the last hour''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1993 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Christ already reigns through the Church, statement 670) |publisher=The Vatican |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm |accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152621/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical references claimed to prophesy the end times include:{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
*{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:2–3}} The Old Testament prophet Isaiah prophesied that in the end times the [[Kingdom of God]] would be established in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], as chief among the nations. This prophecy was also asserted by [[Micah (prophet)|Micah of Moreseth]].

A '''bishop''' (English derivation{{efn|Etymology from en.wiktionary.org:&lt;br&gt;Bishop. From Proto-Germanic *''biskopas'', *''biskupaz'' ("bishop"), from Vulgar Latiin *''biscopus'', from Latin ''episcopus'' ("overseer, supervisor"), from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|επίσκοπος}} (''epískopos'', "overseer"), from {{lang|grc|επί}} (''epí'', "over") + {{lang|grc|σκοπέω}} (''skopeō'', "I examine").}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)pi/skopos1|ἐπίσκοπος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|episcopus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bishop}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]] [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|επίσκοπος}}, ''epískopos'', "overseer", "guardian") is an [[ordination|ordained]], [[consecration|consecrated]], or appointed member of the [[Clergy#Christian clergy|Christian clergy]] who is generally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight.

Within the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]], [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Old Catholic]] and [[Independent Catholic churches]] and in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], bishops claim [[apostolic succession]], a direct historical [[Lineage (genetic)|lineage]] dating back to the original [[Twelve Apostles]]. Within these churches, bishops are seen as those who possess the full priesthood and can ordain clergy – including another bishop. Some [[Protestant]] churches including the [[Lutheran]] and [[Methodist]] churches have bishops serving similar functions as well, though not always understood to be within [[apostolic succession]] in the same way.  One who has been ordained [[deacon]], [[priest]], and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the (ministerial) priesthood, given responsibility by Christ to govern, teach and sanctify the [[Body of Christ]], members of the Faithful. Priests, deacons and [[Lay Ministers|lay ministers]] cooperate and assist their bishops in shepherding a flock.

== Term ==

The term ''epískopos'' ({{lang-grc|ἐπίσκοπος}}), meaning "overseer" in Greek, the early language of the Christian Church, was not from the earliest times clearly distinguished from the term [[presbyter|presbýteros]] (literally: "elder" or "senior", origin of the modern English word [[priest]]), but the term was already clearly used in the sense of the order or office of bishop, distinct from that of [[priest|presbyter]] in the writings attributed to [[Ignatius of Antioch]].&lt;ref name="ccel_Earl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Early Christian Fathers | author =  | work = Christian Classics Ethereal Library | date =  | accessdate = 2015-08-25 | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/richardson/fathers.vi.ii.iii.i.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (died c. 110).

== History ==

The earliest organization of the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Church in Jerusalem]] was, according to most scholars, similar to that of [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s, but it had a council or college of ordained [[presbyters]] ({{lang-grc|πρεσβύτεροι}} ''elders''). In Acts 11:30 and Acts 15:22, we see a collegiate system of government in Jerusalem chaired by [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], according to tradition the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Jewish Bishops of Jerusalem|first bishop of the city]]. In Acts 14:23, the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] ordains presbyters in [[Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|churches in Anatolia]].{{sfn|Hill|2007|p=}}

Often, the word ''[[presbyter]]'' was not yet distinguished from ''overseer'' ({{lang-grc|ἐπίσκοπος}} ''episkopos'', later used exclusively to mean ''bishop''), as in Acts 20:17, Titus 1:5–7 and 1 Peter 5:1.{{efn|"It seems that at first the terms 'episcopos' and 'presbyter' were used interchangeably ..."{{sfn|Cross &amp; Livingstone|2005|p=211}} }}{{efn|"The general consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the first and second centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable."{{sfn|Mitchell, Young &amp; Scott Bowie|2006|p=417}} }} The earliest writings of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], the [[Didache]] and the [[First Epistle of Clement]], for example, show the church used two terms for local church offices—presbyters (seen by many as an interchangeable term with ''episcopos'' or overseer) and [[deacon]].

In [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] and [[Titus (Biblical)|Titus]] in the New Testament a more clearly defined episcopate can be seen. We are told that Paul had left Timothy in [[Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|Ephesus]] and Titus in [[Early centers of Christianity#Greece|Crete]] to oversee the [[local church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1Tim|1:3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Titus|1:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul commands Titus to ordain presbyters/bishops and to exercise general oversight.

Early sources are unclear but various groups of Christian communities may have had the bishop surrounded by a group or college functioning as leaders of the local churches.{{sfn|O'Grady|1997|p=140}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handl|first=András|date=2016-01-01|title=Viktor I.

Eventually, as [[Christendom]] grew, bishops no longer directly served individual congregations. Instead, the Metropolitan bishop (the bishop in a large city) appointed priests to minister each congregation, acting as the bishop's delegate.

=== Apostolic Fathers ===
{{Original research|section|date=March 2013}}

Around the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]], the church's organization became clearer in historical documents. In the works of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] in particular, the role of the episkopos, or bishop, became more important or, rather, already was very important and being clearly defined. While Ignatius of Antioch offers the earliest clear description of monarchial bishops (a single bishop over all [[house church]]es in a city) he is an advocate of monepiscopal structure rather than describing an accepted reality. To the bishops and house churches to which he writes, he offers strategies on how to pressure house churches who don't recognize the bishop into compliance. Other contemporary Christian writers do not describe monarchial bishops, either continuing to equate them with the presbyters or speaking of episkopoi (bishops, plural) in a city.

[[File:Byzantine - Saint Ignatius of Antioch - Walters 4820867.jpg|thumb|[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, student of [[John the Apostle]]]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Plainly therefore we ought to regard the bishop as the Lord Himself" &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians 6:1.&lt;br /&gt;
"your godly bishop" &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 2:1.&lt;br /&gt;
"the bishop presiding after the likeness of God and the presbyters after the likeness of the council of the Apostles, with the deacons also who are most dear to me, having been entrusted with the diaconate of Jesus Christ" &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 6:1.&lt;br /&gt;
"Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him], either by Himself or by the Apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and the presbyters." &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 7:1.&lt;br /&gt;
"Be obedient to the bishop and to one another, as Jesus Christ was to the Father [according to the flesh], and as the Apostles were to Christ and to the Father, that there may be union both of flesh and of spirit." &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 13:2.&lt;br /&gt;
"In like manner let all men respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles. Apart from these there is not even the name of a church." &amp;mdash; [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallesians]] 3:1.&lt;br /&gt;
"follow your bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the Father, and the presbytery as the Apostles; and to the deacons pay respect, as to God's commandment" &amp;mdash; [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans]] 8:1.&lt;br /&gt;
"He that honoureth the bishop is honoured of God; he that doeth aught without the knowledge of the bishop rendereth service to the devil" &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 9:1.
&lt;div style="text-align:right"&gt;&amp;mdash; Lightfoot translation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Church continued to expand, new churches in important cities gained their own bishop. Churches in the regions outside an important city were served by [[Chorbishop]], an official rank of bishops. However, soon, presbyters and deacons were sent from bishop of a city church. Gradually priests replaced the chorbishops. Thus, in time, the bishop changed from being the leader of a single church confined to an urban area to being the leader of the churches of a given geographical area.

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (end of the 2nd century) writes about the ordination of a certain Zachæus as bishop by the imposition of [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter Bar-Jonah's]] hands. The words bishop and ordination are used in their technical meaning by the same Clement of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Clement, "Hom.", III, lxxii; cfr. ''[[Stromata]]'', VI, xiii, cvi; cf. "Const. Apost.", II, viii, 36&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops in the 2nd century are defined also as the only clergy to whom the ordination to [[priest]]hood ([[presbyterate]]) and diaconate is entrusted: "a priest (presbyter) [[Laying on of hands|lays on hands]], but does not [[ordain]]." (''cheirothetei ou cheirotonei''&lt;ref&gt;"Didascalia Syr.", IV; III, 10, 11, 20; Cornelius, "Ad Fabianum" in Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', VI, xliii.&lt;/ref&gt;)

At the beginning of the 3rd century, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] describes another feature of the ministry of a bishop, which is that of the ''"Spiritum primatus sacerdotii habere potestatem dimittere peccata"'': the primate of sacrificial priesthood and the power to forgive sins.&lt;ref name="web._Whyt"&gt;{{Cite web

== Bishops and civil government ==
{{see also|State church of the Roman Empire}}

The efficient organization of the [[Roman Empire]] became the template for the organisation of the church in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], particularly after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine's]] [[Edict of Milan]]. As the church moved from the shadows of privacy into the public forum it acquired land for churches, burials and [[clergy]]. In 391, [[Theodosius I]] decreed that any land that had been confiscated from the church by Roman authorities be returned.

[[File:Husaby Church 2013 people on 11th Century gravestone.jpg|thumb|A bishop with other officials on an 11th-century grave in [[Sweden]].]]

The most usual term for the geographic area of a bishop's authority and ministry, the [[diocese]], began as part of the structure of the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Diocletian]]. As [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Roman authority began to fail in the western portion of the empire]], the church took over much of the civil administration. This can be clearly seen in the ministry of two [[pope]]s: [[Pope Leo I]] in the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], and [[Pope Gregory I]] in the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]]. Both of these men were statesmen and public administrators in addition to their role as Christian pastors, teachers and leaders. In the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern churches]], [[latifundia]] entailed to a bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]] were much less common, the state power did not collapse the way it did in the West, and thus the tendency of bishops acquiring secular power was much weaker than in the West. However, the role of Western bishops as civil authorities, often called [[Prince-Bishop|prince bishops]], continued throughout much of the [[Middle Ages]].

=== Bishops holding political office ===

[[File:Johann Otto von Gemmingen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Otto von Gemmingen]], [[Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg|Prince-Bishop of Augsburg]]]]

As well as being archchancellors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the 9th century, bishops generally served as [[chancellor]]s to medieval monarchs, acting as head of the ''justiciary'' and chief [[chaplain]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]] of [[England]] was almost always a bishop up until the dismissal of Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Similarly, the position of [[Kanclerz]] in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish kingdom]] was always held by a bishop until the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th century]]. And today, the principality of [[Andorra]] is headed by two co-princes, one of whom is a Catholic bishop (and the other, the President of France).

In [[France]] before the [[French Revolution]], representatives of the clergy &amp;mdash; in practice, bishops and [[abbot]]s of the largest [[monastery|monasteries]] &amp;mdash; comprised the [[Estates of the realm#First Estate|First Estate]] of the [[French States-General|Estates-General]], until their role was abolished during the [[French Revolution]].

In the 21st century, the more senior bishops of the [[Church of England]] continue to sit in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], as representatives of the [[established church]], and are known as [[Lords Spiritual]]. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], whose [[diocese]] lies outside the [[United Kingdom]], is an [[ex officio member|''ex officio'' member]] of the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man]]. In the past, the [[Bishop of Durham]], known as a prince bishop, had extensive viceregal powers within his northern diocese &amp;mdash; the power to mint money, collect taxes and raise an army to defend against the [[Scottish people|Scots]].

[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] bishops, along with all other members of the clergy, are [[canon law|canonically]] forbidden to hold political office. Occasional exceptions to this rule are tolerated when the alternative is political chaos. In the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], for example, had de facto administrative, fiscal, cultural and legal jurisdiction, as well as spiritual, over all the Christians of the empire. More recently, Archbishop [[Makarios III]] of [[Cyprus]], served as President of the Republic of Cyprus from 1960 to 1977.

In 2001, [[Peter Hollingworth]], [[List of Companions of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] – then the Anglican Archbishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Brisbane|Brisbane]] – was controversially appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]]. Although Hollingworth gave up his episcopal position to accept the appointment, it still attracted considerable opposition in a country which maintains a formal [[Separation of church and state|separation between Church and State]].

=== Episcopacy during the English Civil War ===
{{main|English Civil War#Episcopacy during the English Civil War}}

During the period of the [[English Civil War]], the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the [[established church]] became a matter of heated political controversy. Indeed, [[Presbyterianism]] was the polity of most [[Reformed Churches]] in Europe, and had been favored by many in England since the English Reformation.  Since in the [[Apostolic Age|primitive church]] the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' were identical, many [[Puritans]] held that this was the only form of government the church should have. The Anglican divine, [[Richard Hooker]], objected to this claim in his famous work ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastic Polity]]'' while, at the same time, defending Presbyterian ordination as valid (in particular [[John Calvin|Calvin's]] ordination of [[Theodore Beza|Beza]]). This was the official stance of the English Church until the Commonwealth, during which time, the views of Presbyterians and Independents ([[Congregationalists]]) were more freely expressed and practiced.

=== Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican churches ===

{{further|Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop (Eastern Orthodox Church)}}

[[File:Mitre (plain).svg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|A [[mitre]] is used as a symbol of the bishop's ministry in Western Christianity.]]
[[File:External Ornaments of a Bishop.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|One form for the [[coat of arms]] of a Catholic bishop]]

Bishops form the leadership in the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the Anglican Communion, the [[Lutheran]] Church, the [[Independent Catholic Churches]], the [[Continuing Anglican movement|Independent Anglican Churches]], and certain other, smaller, denominations.

The traditional role of a bishop is as pastor of a [[diocese]] (also called a bishopric, [[synod]], [[eparchy]] or [[episcopal see|see]]), and so to serve as a "diocesan bishop," or "eparch" as it is called in many Eastern Christian churches. Dioceses vary considerably in size, geographically and population-wise. Some dioceses around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] which were Christianised early are rather compact, whereas dioceses in areas of rapid modern growth in Christian commitment—as in some parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[South America]] and the [[Far East]]—are much larger and more populous.

As well as traditional diocesan bishops, many churches have a well-developed structure of church leadership that involves a number of layers of authority and responsibility.

; [[Patriarch]]:Patriarchs are the bishops who head certain ancient [[autocephalous]] or [[sui iuris]] churches, which are a collection of metropolitan [[Episcopal see|sees]] or [[province]]s. After the First Ecumenical Council at Nicea, the church structure was patterned after the administrative divisions of the Roman Empire wherein a metropolitan or bishop of a metropolis came to be the ecclesiastical head of a civil capital of a province or a metropolis. Whereas, the bishop of the larger administrative district, diocese, came to be called an exarch. In a few cases, a bishop came to preside over a number of dioceses, i.e., Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria. At the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451, Constantinople was given jurisdiction over three dioceses for the reason that the city was "the residence of the emperor and senate". Additionally, Jerusalem was recognized at the Council of Chalcedon as one of the major sees. In 692, the Quinisext Council formally recognized and ranked the sees of the Pentarchy in order of preeminence, at that time Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. In the Catholic Church, Patriarchs sometimes call their leaders ''Catholicos''; the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Egypt, is called ''Pope'', meaning 'Father'. While most patriarchs in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] have jurisdiction over a "ritual church" (a group or diocese of a particular Eastern tradition), all [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] patriarchs, except for the [[Pope]], have only honorary titles. In 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave up the title of [[Patriarch of the West]]. The first recorded use of the title by a Roman Pope was by [[Pope Theodore I|Theodore I]] in 620. However, early church documents, such as those of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) had always listed the Pope of Rome first among the [[Pentarchy (Christianity)|Ancient Patriarchs]] (first four, and later five: [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]—collectively referred to as the ''Pentarchy''). Later, the heads of various national churches became Patriarchs, but they are ranked below the Pentarchy.
; [[Catholicos]]: [[File:Mitra5.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Mitre]] worn by an Eastern bishop with [[icon]]s of Christ, the [[Theotokos]] (Mary, Mother of God) and [[John the Baptist|Forerunner]] (John the Baptist)]] Catholicoi are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], and Eastern Rite Catholic [[sui iuris]] churches (notably the Armenian), roughly similar to a Patriarch (see above).
; [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]]:A primate is usually the bishop of the oldest church of a [[nation]]. Sometimes this carries jurisdiction over metropolitan bishops, but usually it is purely honorific. The primate of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] is chosen from among the diocesan bishops, and, while retaining diocesan responsibility, is called ''Primus''.
; [[Presiding bishop]] or president bishop: These titles are often used for the head of a national Anglican church, but the title is not usually associated with a particular [[episcopal see]] like the title of a primate.
; [[Major archbishop]]:Major archbishops are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Their authority within their ''sui juris'' church is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honors.
; [[Metropolitan bishop]]: A metropolitan bishop is an archbishop in charge of an [[ecclesiastical province]], or group of dioceses, and in addition to having immediate jurisdiction over his own archdiocese, also exercises some oversight over the other dioceses within that province. Sometimes a metropolitan may also be the head of an [[autocephalous]], ''[[sui iuris]]'', or [[autonomous area|autonomous]] church when the number of adherents of that tradition are small. In the Latin Rite, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churches, the title is "metropolitan," with some of these churches using "archbishop" as a separate office.
; [[Archbishop]]:[[File:Archbishop William Temple.jpg|thumb|[[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]]]] An archbishop is the bishop of an [[archdiocese]]. This is usually a prestigious diocese with an important place in local church history. In the Catholic Church, the title is purely honorific and carries no extra jurisdiction, though most archbishops are also metropolitan bishops, as above, and are always awarded a [[pallium]]. In most provinces of the Anglican Communion, however, an archbishop has metropolitical and primatial power.
; [[Suffragan bishop]]: A suffragan bishop is a bishop subordinate to a Metropolitan. In the [[Catholic Church]] this term is applied to all non-metropolitan bishops (that is, diocesan bishops of dioceses within a metropolitan's province, and [[auxiliary bishop]]s). In the Anglican Communion, the term applies to a bishop who is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop: the [[Bishop of Warwick]] is suffragan to the [[Bishop of Coventry]] (the diocesan), though both live in [[Coventry]].
; Area bishop: Some Anglican suffragans are given the responsibility for a geographical area within the diocese (for example, the [[Bishop of Stepney]] is an ''area bishop'' within the [[Diocese of London]]).
; [[Titular bishop]]: A titular bishop is a bishop without a diocese. Rather, the bishop is head of a [[titular see]], which is usually an ancient city that used to have a bishop, but, for some reason or other, does not have one now. Titular bishops often serve as [[auxiliary bishop]]s. In the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]], bishops of modern dioceses are often given a titular see alongside their modern one (for example, the Archbishop of [[Thyateira]] ''and'' [[Great Britain]]).
; [[Auxiliary bishop]]: An auxiliary bishop is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop (the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox equivalent of an Anglican suffragan bishop). An auxiliary bishop is a [[titular bishop]], and he is to be appointed as a [[vicar general]] or at least as an [[episcopal vicar]] of the diocese in which he serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM | title=Canon 406 | work=Code of Canon Law | year=1983 | accessdate=2009-06-15 | publisher=The [[Holy See]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Coadjutor bishop]]: A coadjutor bishop is an auxiliary bishop who is given almost equal authority in a diocese with the diocesan bishop, and the automatic right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is often seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.
; [[Assistant bishop]]: Honorary assistant bishop, assisting bishop, or bishop emeritus: these titles are usually applied to retired bishops who are given a general licence to minister as episcopal pastors under a diocesan's oversight. The titles, in this meaning, are not used by the Catholic Church.
; General bishop: a title and role in some churches, not associated with a diocese. In the Coptic Orthodox Church the episcopal ranks from highest to lowest are metropolitan archbishops, metropolitan bishops, diocesan bishops, bishops exarchs of the throne, suffragan bishops, auxiliary bishops, general bishops, and finally chorbishops. Bishops of the same category rank according to date of consecration.
; [[Chorbishop]]: A chorbishop is an official of a diocese in some Eastern Christian churches. Chorbishops are not generally ordained bishops – they are not given the sacrament of Holy Orders in that degree – but function as assistants to the diocesan bishop with certain honorary privileges.
; [[Supreme bishop]]: The [[obispo maximo]], or supreme bishop, of the [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] is elected by the General Assembly of the Church. He is the chief executive officer of the Church. He also holds an important pastoral role, being the spiritual head and chief pastor of the Church. He has precedence of honor and prominence of position among, and recognized to have primacy, over other bishops.
; [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]:In Catholicism, a cardinal, a title dating back to the 8th century, is a member of the clergy appointed by the pope to serve in the [[College of Cardinals]]. This body is empowered to elect a new pope in [[sede vacante]], but cardinals over the age of 80 may not be electors. Cardinals serve as advisors to the pope and hold positions of authority within the structure of the Catholic Church. Under modern canon law, a man who is not a bishop who is appointed a cardinal must accept ordination as a bishop, or seek special permission from the pope to decline ordination. Most cardinals are already bishops at the time of their appointment, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchs, and a substantial portion of the rest already titular archbishops serving in the Vatican. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them influential theologians, to the College of Cardinals without requiring them to be ordained as bishops; invariably, these men are near or over the age of 80, and consequently not eligible to take part in a conclave.

[[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|The Seven Sacraments]]'', 15th century.&lt;br /&gt;In the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] the administration of [[Confirmation]] is normally reserved to the local bishop.]]

In [[Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and [[Anglicanism]], only a bishop can ordain other bishops, [[priest]]s, and [[deacon]]s.

In the Eastern liturgical tradition, a priest can celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] only with the blessing of a bishop. In Byzantine usage, an [[antimins|antimension]] signed by the bishop is kept on the altar partly as a reminder of whose altar it is and under whose [[omophorion]] the priest at a local parish is serving. In Syriac Church usage, a consecrated wooden block called a [[thabilitho]] is kept for the same reasons.

The [[pope]], in addition to being the [[Bishop of Rome]] and spiritual head of the [[Catholic Church]], is also the Patriarch of the [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]]. Each bishop within the Latin Rite is answerable directly to the Pope and not any other bishop except to metropolitans in certain oversight instances. The pope previously used the title ''Patriarch of the West'', but this title was dropped from use in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601225.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2008 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060308013147/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601225.htm |archive-date=8 March 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a move which caused some concern within the Eastern Orthodox Communion as, to them, it implied wider papal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603382.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2008 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060613190031/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603382.htm |archive-date=13 June 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican [[cathedral]]s there is a special chair set aside for the exclusive use of the bishop. This is the bishop's ''[[cathedra]]'' and is often called the [[throne]]. In some Christian denominations, for example, the Anglican Communion, parish churches may maintain a chair for the use of the bishop when he visits; this is to signify the parish's union with the bishop.

The bishop is the ordinary minister of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[confirmation]] in the Latin Rite [[Catholic Church]], and in the Anglican and [[Old Catholic]] communion only a bishop may administer this sacrament. However, in the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] and other Eastern rites, whether Eastern or Oriental Orthodox or [[Eastern Catholic]], [[chrismation]] is done immediately after [[baptism]], and thus the priest is the one who confirms, using chrism blessed by a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3U.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1313] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014929/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3U.HTM |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ordination of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican bishops ====
{{Refimprove section
| date = June 2016
}}

Bishops in all of these communions are [[Holy Orders|ordained]] by other bishops through the [[laying on of hands]]. While traditional teaching maintains that any bishop with [[apostolic succession]] can validly perform the ordination of another bishop, some churches require two or three bishops participate, either to ensure sacramental validity or to conform with church law. [[Catholic]] doctrine holds that one bishop can validly ordain another (priest) as a bishop. Though a minimum of three bishops participating is desirable (there are usually several more) in order to demonstrate collegiality, canonically only one bishop is necessary. The practice of only one bishop ordaining was normal in countries where the Church was persecuted under [[Communist]] rule.
The title of archbishop or metropolitan may be granted to a senior bishop, usually one who is in charge of a large ecclesiastical jurisdiction. He may, or may not, have provincial oversight of suffragan bishops and may possibly have auxiliary bishops assisting him.
Ordination of a bishop, and thus continuation of apostolic succession, takes place through a ritual centred on the [[imposition of hands]] and [[prayer]].
Apart from the ordination, which is always done by other bishops, there are different methods as to the actual selection of a candidate for ordination as bishop. In the [[Catholic Church]] the [[Congregation for Bishops]] generally oversees the selection of new bishops with the approval of the [[pope]]. The papal nuncio usually solicits names from the bishops of a country, consults with priests and leading members of a laity, and then selects three to be forwarded to the [[Holy See]]. In Europe, some cathedral chapters have duties to elect bishops.  The Eastern Catholic churches generally elect their own bishops. Most Eastern Orthodox churches allow varying amounts of formalised laity or [[lower clergy]] influence on the choice of bishops. This also applies in those Eastern churches which are in union with the pope, though it is required that he give assent.

Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, Old Catholic and some Lutheran bishops claim to be part of the continuous sequence of ordained bishops since the days of the apostles referred to as [[apostolic succession]]. Since [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued the bull ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' in 1896, the Catholic Church has insisted that Anglican orders are invalid because of changes in the Anglican ordination rites of the 16th century and divergence in understanding of the theology of priesthood, episcopacy and Eucharist. However, since the 1930s, Utrecht Old Catholic bishops (recognised by the Holy See as validily ordained) have sometimes taken part in the ordination of Anglican bishops. According to the writer Timothy Dufort, by 1969, all Church of England bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of [[apostolic succession]] recognised by the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Dufort, ''The Tablet'', 29 May 1982, pp. 536–538.&lt;/ref&gt; This development has muddied the waters somewhat as it could be argued that the strain of apostolic succession has been re-introduced into Anglicanism, at least within the Church of England.

The Catholic Church does recognise as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Catholic, Old Catholic or Oriental bishops, and groups descended from them; it also regards as both valid and licit those ordinations done by bishops of the Eastern churches,{{efn|Section 16 of the Second Vatican Council's Decree on Ecumenism, [[Unitatis Redintegratio]] states: "To remove, then, all shadow of doubt, this holy Council solemnly declares that the Churches of the East, while remembering the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to govern themselves according to the disciplines proper to them, since these are better suited to the character of their faithful, and more for the good of their souls."}} so long as those receiving the ordination conform to other canonical requirements (for example, is an adult male) and an eastern orthodox rite of episcopal ordination, expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop, is used; this has given rise to the phenomenon of ''[[episcopi vagantes]]'' (for example, clergy of the Independent Catholic groups which claim apostolic succession, though this claim is rejected by both Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy).

The Eastern Orthodox Churches would not accept the validity of any ordinations performed by the Independent Catholic groups, as Eastern Orthodoxy considers to be spurious any consecration outside the Church as a whole. Eastern Orthodoxy considers [[apostolic succession]] to exist only within the Universal Church, and not through any authority held by individual bishops; thus, if a bishop ordains someone to serve outside the (Eastern Orthodox) Church, the ceremony is ineffectual, and no ordination has taken place regardless of the ritual used or the ordaining prelate's position within the Eastern Orthodox Churches.

The position of the Catholic Church is slightly different. Whilst it does recognise the validity of the orders of certain groups which separated from communion with Holy See. The Holy See accepts as valid the ordinations of the [[Old Catholic]]s in communion with Utrecht, as well as the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] (which received its orders directly from Utrecht, and was—until recently—part of that communion); but Catholicism does not recognise the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with what they consider the core tenets of Christianity; this is the case even though the clergy of the Independent Catholic groups may use the proper ordination ritual. There are also other reasons why the Holy See does not recognise the validity of the orders of the Independent clergy:

* They hold that the continuing practice among many Independent clergy of one person receiving multiple ordinations in order to secure apostolic succession, betrays an incorrect and mechanistic theology of ordination.
* They hold that the practice within Independent groups of ordaining women demonstrates an understanding of Priesthood that they vindicate is totally unacceptable to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches as they believe that the Universal Church does not possess such authority; thus, they uphold that any ceremonies performed by these women should be considered being sacramentally invalid.
* The theology of male clergy within the Independent movement is also suspect according to the Catholics, as they presumably approve of the ordination of females, and may have even undergone an (invalid) ordination ceremony conducted by a woman.

Whilst members of the [[Independent Catholic]] movement take seriously the issue of valid orders, it is highly significant that the relevant Vatican Congregations tend not to respond to petitions from Independent Catholic bishops and clergy who seek to be received into communion with the Holy See, hoping to continue in some sacramental role. In those instances where the pope does grant reconciliation, those deemed to be clerics within the Independent Old Catholic movement are invariably admitted as laity and not priests or bishops.

There is a mutual recognition of the validity of orders amongst Catholic, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Old Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=Ronald|date=Spring 2010|title=The Dialogues of the Catholic Church with the Separated Eastern Churches|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40731267?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=28|pages=135-152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Ecclesiastical province|provinces]] of the Anglican Communion have begun [[ordination of women|ordaining women]] as bishops in recent decades for example, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Cuba. The first woman to be consecrated a bishop within Anglicanism was [[Barbara Harris (bishop)|Barbara Harris]], who was ordained in the United States in 1989. In 2006, [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]], the Episcopal [[Episcopal Diocese of Nevada|Bishop of Nevada]], became the first woman to become the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.

=== Lutheranism ===

In the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] (ELCIC), the largest Lutheran Church bodies in the United States and Canada respectively and roughly based on the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] Lutheran state churches (similar to that of the Church of England), bishops are elected by Synod Assemblies, consisting of both lay members and clergy, for a term of 6 years, which can be renewed, depending upon the local synod's "constitution" (which is mirrored on either the ELCA or ELCIC's national constitution). Since the implementation of concordats between the ELCA and the [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] and the ELCIC and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], all bishops, including the presiding bishop (ELCA) or the national bishop (ELCIC), have been consecrated using the historic succession, with at least one Anglican bishop serving as co-consecrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/fullcommunion/episcopal/ccmresources/text.html|title=A Lutheran Proposal for a Revision of the Concordat of Agreement |archivedate=2011-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514195302/http://www2.elca.org/ecumenical/fullcommunion/Episcopal/CCMresources/text.html|date=19 August 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/lutheranpartners/archives/histepi.html|last= Wright, |first=J.

Since going into ecumenical communion with their respective Anglican body, bishops in the ELCA or the ELCIC not only approve the "rostering" of all ordained pastors, diaconal ministers, and associates in ministry, but they serve as the principal celebrant of all pastoral ordination and installation ceremonies, diaconal consecration ceremonies, as well as serving as the "chief pastor" of the local synod, upholding the teachings of [[Martin Luther]] as well as the documentations of the Ninety-Five Theses and the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Unlike their counterparts in the [[United Methodist Church]], ELCA and ELCIC synod bishops do not appoint pastors to local congregations (pastors, like their counterparts in the Episcopal Church, are called by local congregations). The presiding bishop of the ELCA and the national bishop of the ELCIC, the national bishops of their respective bodies, are elected for a single 6-year term and may be elected to an additional term.

Although ELCA agreed with the Episcopal Church to limit ordination to the bishop "ordinarily", ELCA pastor-''ordinators'' are given permission to perform the rites in "extraordinary" circumstance. In practice, "extraordinary" circumstance have included disagreeing with Episcopalian views of the episcopate, and as a result, ELCA pastors ordained by other pastors are not permitted to be deployed to Episcopal Churches (they can, however, serve in [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[United Methodist Church]], [[Reformed Church in America]], and [[Moravian Church]] congregations, as the ELCA is in full communion with these denominations). The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States and the two largest [[Confessional Lutheran]] bodies in North America, do not follow an episcopal form of governance, settling instead on a form of quasi-congregationalism patterned off what they believe to be the practice of the early church. It should be noted that the second largest of the three predecessor bodies of the ELCA, the [[American Lutheran Church]], was a congregationalist body, with national and synod presidents before they were re-titled as bishops (borrowing from the Lutheran churches in Germany) in the 1980s. It must also be noted that with regard to ecclesial discipline and oversight, national and synod presidents typically function similarly to bishops in episcopal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kencollins.com/explanations/why-12.htm|title=The Function of Bishops in the Ancient Church|work=kencollins.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====African Methodist Episcopal Church====
In the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], "Bishops are the Chief Officers of the Connectional Organization. They are elected for life by a majority vote of the General Conference which meets every four years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ame-church.com/leadership/bishops-of-the-church/|title=Bishops of the Church|year=2014|publisher=African Methodist Episcopal Church|language=English|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christian Methodist Episcopal Church ====

In the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]] in the United States, bishops are administrative superintendents of the church; they are elected by "delegate" votes for as many years deemed until the age of 74, then he/she must retire. Among their duties, are responsibility for appointing clergy to serve local churches as pastor, for performing ordinations, and for safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. The General Conference, a meeting every four years, has an equal number of clergy and lay delegates. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four-year terms. CME Church bishops may be male or female.

==== United Methodist Church ====
[[File:UMEpiscopalShield.jpg|thumb|right|United Methodist Episcopal Shield]]

In the [[United Methodist Church]] (the largest branch of Methodism in the world) bishops serve as administrative and pastoral superintendents of the church. They are elected for life from among the [[Elder (Methodism)|ordained elders]] (presbyters) by vote of the delegates in regional (called jurisdictional) conferences, and are consecrated by the other bishops present at the conference through the laying on of hands. In the United Methodist Church bishops remain members of the "[[Elder (Methodism)|Order of Elders]]" while being consecrated to the "[[Episcopal polity|Office of the Episcopacy]]". Within the United Methodist Church only bishops are empowered to consecrate bishops and ordain clergy. Among their most critical duties is the ordination and appointment of clergy to serve local churches as pastor, presiding at sessions of the Annual, Jurisdictional, and General Conferences, providing pastoral ministry for the clergy under their charge, and safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. Furthermore, individual bishops, or the Council of Bishops as a whole, often serve a prophetic role, making statements on important social issues and setting forth a vision for the denomination, though they have no legislative authority of their own. In all of these areas, bishops of the United Methodist Church function very much in the historic meaning of the term. According to the ''[[Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'', a bishop's responsibilities are {{quote|
''Leadership.—Spiritual and Temporal''—

# To lead and oversee the spiritual and temporal affairs of The United Methodist Church, which confesses Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and particularly to lead the Church in its mission of witness and service in the world.
# To travel through the connection at large as the Council of Bishops (¶ 526) to implement strategy for the concern of the Church.
# To provide liaison and leadership in the quest for Christian unity in ministry, mission, and structure and in the search for strengthened relationships with other living faith communities.
# To organize such Missions as shall have been authorized by the [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]].
# To promote and support the evangelistic vision of the whole Church.
# To discharge such other duties as the Discipline may direct.

''Presidential Duties.''—1. To preside in the General, Jurisdictional, Central, and Annual Conferences. 2. To form the districts after consultation with the district superintendents and after the number of the same has been determined by vote of the Annual Conference. 3. To appoint the [[District Superintendent (United Methodist Church)|district superintendents]] annually (¶¶ 517–518). 4. To consecrate bishops, to ordain elders and deacons, to consecrate diaconal ministers, to commission [[deaconess]]es and home missionaries, and to see that the names of the persons commissioned and consecrated are entered on the journals of the conference and that proper credentials are funised to these persons.

''Working with Ministers.''—1. To make and fix the appointments in the Annual Conferences, Provisional Annual Conferences, and Missions as the Discipline may direct (¶¶ 529–533).
2. To divide or to unite a circuit(s), stations(s), or mission(s) as judged necessary for missionary strategy and then to make appropriate appointments. 3. To read the appointments of deaconesses, diaconal ministers, lay persons in service under the World Division of the General Board of Global Ministries, and home missionaries. 4. To fix the Charge Conference membership of all ordained ministers appointed to ministries other than the local church in keeping with ¶443.3. 5. To transfer, upon the request of the receiving bishop, ministerial member(s) of one Annual Conference to another, ''provided'' said member(s) agrees to transfer; and to send immediately to the secretaries of both conferences involved, to the conference Boards of Ordained Ministry, and to the clearing house of the General Board of Pensions written notices of the transfer of members and of their standing in the course of study if they are undergraduates.{{sfn|Anon|1980|p=}} }}

In each Annual Conference, United Methodist bishops serve for four-year terms, and may serve up to three terms before either retirement or appointment to a new Conference. United Methodist bishops may be male or female, with [[Marjorie Matthews]] being the first woman to be consecrated a bishop in 1980.

The collegial expression of episcopal leadership in the [[United Methodist Church]] is known as the [[United Methodist Council of Bishops|Council of Bishops]]. The Council of Bishops speaks to the Church and through the Church into the world and gives leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships.{{sfn|Anon|1980|p=}} The Conference of Methodist Bishops includes the United Methodist ''Council of Bishops'' plus bishops from affiliated autonomous [[Methodist]] or [[United and uniting churches|United]] Churches.

[[John Wesley]] consecrated [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] a "General Superintendent," and directed that [[Francis Asbury]] also be consecrated for the United States of America in 1784, where the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] first became a separate [[religious denomination|denomination]] apart from the Church of England. Coke soon returned to England, but Asbury was the primary builder of the new church. At first he did not call himself bishop, but eventually submitted to the usage by the denomination.

Notable bishops in United Methodist history include [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Coke]], [[Francis Asbury|Asbury]], [[Richard Whatcoat]], [[Philip William Otterbein]], [[Martin Boehm]], [[Jacob Albright]], [[John Seybert]], [[Matthew Simpson]], [[John S.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
{{Main|Bishop (Latter Day Saints)}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishop]] is the leader of a local congregation, called a [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]]. As with most LDS priesthood holders, the bishop is a part-time lay minister and earns a living through other employment; in all cases, he is a married man. As such, it is his duty to preside at services, call local leaders, and judge the worthiness of members for service. The bishop does not deliver sermons at every service (generally asking members to do so), but is expected to be a spiritual guide for his congregation. It is therefore believed that he has both the right and ability to receive divine inspiration (through the [[Holy Spirit]]) for the [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]] under his direction. Because it is a part-time position, all able members are expected to assist in the management of the ward by holding delegated lay positions (for example, women's and youth leaders, teachers) referred to as 'callings.' Although members are asked to confess serious sins to him, unlike the [[Catholic Church]], he is not the instrument of divine forgiveness, merely a guide through the repentance process (and a judge in case transgressions warrant excommunication or other official discipline). The bishop is also responsible for the physical welfare of the ward, and thus collects [[Tithe|tithing]] and [[fast offering]]s and distributes financial assistance where needed.

A bishop is the president of the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] in his ward (and is thus a form of Mormon [[Kohen]]; in fact, a literal descendant of Aaron has "legal right" to act as a bishop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.76?lang=eng#75 Doctrine and Covenants 107:76]&lt;/ref&gt; after being found worthy and ordained by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]&lt;ref name="Doctrine and Covenants 68:20"&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.20?lang=eng#19 Doctrine and Covenants 68:20]&lt;/ref&gt;). In the absence of a literal descendant of Aaron, a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|High priest]] in the [[Melchizedek priesthood]] is called to be a bishop.&lt;ref name="Doctrine and Covenants 68:20"/&gt; Each bishop is selected from resident members of the ward by the [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake presidency]] with approval of the First Presidency, and chooses two ''counselors'' to form a ''bishopric''. In special circumstances (such as a ward consisting entirely of young university students), a bishop may be chosen from outside the ward. A bishop is typically released after about five years and a new bishop is called to the position. Although the former bishop is released from his duties, he continues to hold the Aaronic priesthood office of bishop. Church members frequently refer to a former bishop as "Bishop" as a sign of respect and affection.

Latter-day Saint bishops do not wear any special clothing or insignia the way clergy in many other churches do, but are expected to dress and groom themselves neatly and conservatively per their local culture, especially when performing official duties. Bishops (as well as other members of the priesthood) can trace their line of authority back to [[Joseph Smith]], who, according to church doctrine, was ordained to lead the Church in modern times by the ancient [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], who were ordained to lead the Church by Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Joseph|title=Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith|year=2007|page=101|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-8?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the global level, the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|presiding bishop]] oversees the temporal affairs (buildings, properties, commercial corporations, and so on) of the worldwide Church, including the Church's massive global humanitarian aid and social welfare programs. The presiding bishop has two counselors; the three together form the presiding bishopric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMullin|first=Keith B.|title=The Presiding Bishopric|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/07/the-presiding-bishopric?lang=eng|work=Ensign|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to ward bishoprics, where the counselors do not hold the office of bishop, all three men in the presiding bishopric hold the office of bishop, and thus the counselors, as with the presiding bishop, are formally referred to as "Bishop".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/presiding-bishopric|title=Learn More About the Church's Presiding Bishopric|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Apostolic Church ===

The [[New Apostolic Church]] (NAC) knows three classes of ministries: Deacons, Priests and Apostles. The [[New Apostolic Church#Ministries|Apostles]], who are all included in the apostolate with the [[Chief Apostle]] as head, are the highest ministries.

Of the several kinds of priest....ministries, the bishop is the highest. Nearly all bishops are set in line directly from the chief apostle. They support and help their superior apostle.

=== Church of God in Christ ===
In the [[Church of God in Christ|Church of God in Christ (COGIC)]], the ecclesiastical structure is composed of large dioceses that are called "jurisdictions" within COGIC, each under the authority of a bishop, sometimes called "state bishops". They can either be made up of large geographical regions of churches or churches that are grouped and organized together as their own separate jurisdictions because of similar affiliations, regardless of geographical location or dispersion. Each state in the U.S. has at least one jurisdiction while others may have several more, and each jurisdiction is usually composed of between 30 and 100 churches. Each jurisdiction is then broken down into several districts, which are smaller groups of churches (either grouped by geographical situation or by similar affiliations) which are each under the authority of District Superintendents who answer to the authority of their jurisdictional/state bishop. There are currently over 170 jurisdictions in the United States, and over 30 jurisdictions in other countries. The bishops of each jurisdiction, according to the COGIC Manual, are considered to be the modern day equivalent in the church of the early apostles and overseers of the New Testament church, and as the highest ranking clergymen in the COGIC, they are tasked with the responsibilities of being the head overseers of all religious, civil, and economic ministries and protocol for the church denomination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=COGIC Manual|last=|first=|publisher=Church of God in Christ Publishing House|year=1973|isbn=978-1940378428|location=Memphis, Tennessee|pages=133–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have the authority to appoint and [[Ordination|ordain]] local [[pastor]]s, [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]], [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]], and [[The Reverend|reverends]] within the denomination. The bishops of the COGIC denomination are all collectively called "The Board of Bishops."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cogic.org/about-company/the-judicial-branch/board-of-bishops/|title=Board of Bishops|work=Church Of God In Christ|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Board of Bishops, and the General Assembly of the COGIC, the body of the church composed of clergy and lay delegates that are responsible for making and enforcing the bylaws of the denomination, every four years, twelve bishops from the COGIC are elected as "The General Board" of the church, who work alongside the delegates of the General Assembly and Board of Bishops to provide administration over the denomination as the church's head executive leaders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cogic.org/about-company/the-executive-branch/general-board/|title=The General Board|work=Church Of God In Christ|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of twelve bishops of the General Board is also elected the "[[Presiding bishop|presiding bishop]]" of the church, and two others are appointed by the presiding bishop himself, as his first and second assistant presiding bishops.

Bishops in the Church of God in Christ usually wear black clergy suits which consist of a black suit blazer, black pants, a purple or scarlet clergy shirt and a white clerical collar, which is usually referred to as "Class B Civic attire." Bishops in COGIC also typically wear the Anglican Choir Dress style vestments of a long purple or scarlet chimere, cuffs, and tippet worn over a long white rochet, and a gold pectoral cross worn around the neck with the tippet. This is usually referred to as "Class A Ceremonial attire". The bishops of COGIC alternate between Class A Ceremonial attire and Class B Civic attire depending on the protocol of the religious services and other events they have to attend.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) ===

In the polity of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)]], the international leader is the presiding bishop, and the members of the executive committee are executive bishops. Collectively, they supervise and appoint national and state leaders across the world. Leaders of individual states and regions are administrative bishops, who have jurisdiction over local churches in their respective states and are vested with appointment authority for local pastorates. All ministers are credentialed at one of three levels of licensure, the most senior of which is the rank of ordained bishop. To be eligible to serve in state, national, or international positions of authority, a minister must hold the rank of ordained bishop.

=== Pentecostal Church of God ===

In 2002, the general convention of the [[Pentecostal Church of God]] came to a consensus to change the title of their overseer from general superintendent to bishop. The change was brought on because internationally, the term ''bishop'' is more commonly related to religious leaders than the previous title.

The title ''bishop'' is used for both the general (international leader) and the district (state) leaders. The title is sometimes used in conjunction with the previous, thus becoming general (district) superintendent/bishop.

=== Seventh-day Adventists ===

According to the Seventh-day Adventist understanding of the doctrine of the Church:

"The "elders" (Greek, presbuteros) or "bishops" (episkopos) were the most important officers of the church. The term elder means older one, implying dignity and respect. His position was similar to that of the one who had supervision of the synagogue. The term bishop means "overseer." Paul used these terms interchangeably, equating elders with overseers or bishops (Acts 20:17,[[Acts 20:28|28]]; Titus 1:5, 7).

"Those who held this position supervised the newly formed churches. Elder referred to the status or rank of the office, while bishop denoted the duty or responsibility of the office—"overseer." Since the apostles also called themselves elders (1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1; 3 John 1), it is apparent that there were both local elders and itinerant elders, or elders at large. But both kinds of elder functioned as shepherds of the congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe|date=1988|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association|location=Hagarstown, Maryland|pages=146, 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The above understanding is part of the basis of Adventist organizational structure. The world wide Seventh-day Adventist church is organized into local districts, conferences or missions, union conferences or union missions, divisions, and finally at the top is the general conference.  At each level (with exception to the local districts), there is an elder who is elected president and a group of elders who serve on the executive committee with the elected president.  Those who have been elected president would in effect be the "bishop" while never actually carrying the title or ordained as such because the term is usually associated with the episcopal style of church governance most often found in Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and some Pentecostal/Charismatic circles.

=== Others ===
Some Baptists also have begun taking on the title of ''bishop''.&lt;ref name="bost_More"&gt;{{Cite news

In some smaller Protestant denominations and independent churches, the term ''bishop'' is used in the same way as ''pastor'', to refer to the leader of the local congregation, and may be male or female. This usage is especially common in African-American churches in the US.

In the [[Church of Scotland]], which has a Presbyterian church structure, the word "bishop" refers to an ordained person, usually a normal parish minister, who has temporary oversight of a trainee minister. In the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the term bishop is an expressive name for a Minister of Word and Sacrament who serves a congregation and exercises "the oversight of the flock of Christ."&lt;ref name="presby"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)

While not considered orthodox Christian, the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]] uses roles and titles derived from Christianity for its clerical hierarchy, including bishops who have much the same authority and responsibilities as in Catholicism.

The Salvation Army does not have bishops but has appointed leaders of geographical areas, known as Divisional Commanders. Larger geographical areas, called Territories, are led by a Territorial Commander, who is the highest-ranking officer in that Territory.

Jehovah’s Witnesses do not use the title ‘Bishop’ within their organizational structure, but appoint elders to be overseers (to fulfill the role of oversight) within their congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Refs: [[Acts 20:28]], {{bibleref|Phil|1:1}}, {{bibleref|1Tim|3:1–7}}, {{bibleref|Titus|1:7}}, {{bibleref|1Peter|5:1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/congregations-organized/ |title= JW.org/FAQ: How Are Congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses Organised? |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HKBP]] of [[Indonesia]], the most prominent [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] [[Protestantism in Indonesia|in Indonesia]], uses the term [[Ephorus]] instead of Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iksynod.org/hkbp/ |title= Global Missions in the Indiana-Kentucky Synod: Indonesia: the Huria Kristen Batak Protestan Church on the island of Sumatra|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Vietnamese syncretist religion of [[Caodaism]], bishops (''giao su'') comprise the fifth of nine hierarchical levels, and are responsible for spiritual and temporal education as well as record-keeping and ceremonies in their parishes. At any one time there are seventy-two bishops. Their authority is described in Section I of the text ''Tan Luat'' (revealed through seances in December 1926). Caodai bishops wear robes and headgear of embroidered silk depicting the Divine Eye and the Eight Trigrams. (The color varies according to branch.) This is the full ceremonial dress; the simple version consists of a seven-layered turban.

== Dress and insignia ==
{{Main|Pontifical vestments}}

Traditionally, a number of items are associated with the office of a bishop, most notably the [[mitre]], [[crosier]], and [[ecclesiastical ring]]. Other vestments and insignia vary between Eastern and Western Christianity.

In the Latin Rite of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[choir dress]] of a bishop includes the purple [[cassock]] with amaranth trim, [[rochet]], purple [[zucchetto]] (skull cap), purple [[biretta]], and [[pectoral cross]]. The [[cappa magna]] may be worn, but only within the bishop's own diocese and on especially solemn occasions.{{sfn|Stehle|1914|p=}} The [[mitre]], [[zuchetto]], and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] the bishop typically wears the [[cope]]. Within his own [[diocese]] and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]], he also uses the [[crosier]].{{sfn|Stehle|1914|p=}} When celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a bishop, like a [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], wears the [[chasuble]]. The [[Caeremoniale Episcoporum]] recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a [[dalmatic]], which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of [[holy orders]], blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar.{{sfn|Stehle|1914|p=}} The Caeremoniale Episcoporum no longer makes mention of [[episcopal gloves]], [[episcopal sandals]], [[liturgical stockings]] (also known as [[buskins]]), or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop's horse. The coat of arms of a Latin Rite Catholic bishop usually displays a [[galero]] with a cross and crosier behind the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]; the specifics differ by location and ecclesiastical rank (see [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]]).

Anglican bishops generally make use of the [[mitre]], [[crosier]], [[ecclesiastical ring]], purple [[cassock]], purple [[zucchetto]], and [[pectoral cross]]. However, the traditional [[choir dress]] of Anglican bishops retains its late mediaeval form, and looks quite different from that of their Catholic counterparts; it consists of a long [[rochet]] which is worn with a [[chimere]].

In the [[Eastern Churches]] ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Eastern Rite Catholic]]) a bishop will wear the [[mandyas]], [[panagia]] (and perhaps an [[enkolpion]]), [[sakkos]], [[omophorion]] and an Eastern-style [[mitre]]. Eastern bishops do not normally wear an episcopal ring; the faithful kiss (or, alternatively, touch their forehead to) the bishop's hand. To seal official documents, he will usually use an inked stamp. An Eastern bishop's coat of arms will normally display an Eastern-style mitre, cross, eastern style crosier and a red and white (or red and gold) [[Ecclesiastical heraldry#Mantle|mantle]]. The arms of [[Oriental Orthodox]] bishops will display the episcopal insignia (mitre or turban) specific to their own liturgical traditions. Variations occur based upon jurisdiction and national customs.

'''Brahminism''' refers to the domination of Indian society by the priestly class of [[Brahmins]] and their Hindu-ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/hindutva-is-nothing-but-brahminism/215089 'Hindutva Is Nothing But Brahminism'], Outlook, 5 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Those who work or aspire for a social order based on equality use the words 'Brahmanism' and 'Brahminism' interchangeably. Dr B R Ambedkar,&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar&lt;/ref&gt; who later chaired the drafting Committee of Indian Constitution, in a speech in February, 1938 explained the word to mean "negation of the spirit of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity".&lt;ref&gt;http://velivada.com/2017/06/03/dr-ambedkars-speech-depressed-class-workmens-conference-nashik/&lt;/ref&gt; He also clarified that the word does not mean the power, privileges and interests of Brahmins as a community.  The term ''[[Brahmanism]]'' refers to the ''[[historical Vedic religion]]'', and formed one of the constituents of the complex of Indian religions called Hinduism. It is derived basically from the quest for Brahma,or Brahman or the Supreme Creator, as per ancient Indian thought. The spirit of this line of thought can be seen from the book titled "Man's eternal quest for God" by Paramahansa Yogananda, Publisher: Yogoda Satsanga Society of India; Third edition (19 August 2003). The [[Srauta]] tradition still preserves elements of Brahminism. Thus, there are two distinct contexts by which the term 'Brahminism' or 'Brahmanism' is used. One is in the context of ancient Indian thought and the quest for God. The other is in the context of an ongoing work for bringing in a social order based on liberty,equality and fraternity. In neither of these contexts does the word mean anything particularly significant about the Brahmin caste.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin&lt;/ref&gt;

Different religions have varying stances on the use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], historically and presently. In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an [[entheogenic]], particularly in the [[Indian subcontinent]] where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.

In the modern era, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of [[medicinal cannabis]].

==Bahá'í==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], use of alcohol and other drugs for intoxication, as opposed to medical prescription, is prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khali Akhtar Khavari|author2=Teresa McCray Harmon|title=The Relationship between the Degree of Professed Religious Belief and Use of Drugs|journal=International Journal of the Addictions|volume=17|issue=5|pages=847–857|date=1982|doi=10.3109/10826088209056331}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Bahá'í laws]]. But Bahá'í practice is such laws should be applied with "tact and wisdom".&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= law |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tobacco is an individual decision, it is yet strongly frowned on and not explicitly forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Udo Schaefer|title=In a blue haze, smoking and Bahá'í ethics|publisher=Zero Palm Press|edition=Translated from the original German language edition: Ethische Aspekte des Rauchens.

{{quote|Regarding [[hashish]] you have pointed out that some Persians have become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the All-Merciful? Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-187.html Notes #170.

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the [[Five Precepts|Fifth Precept]] is frequently interpreted to mean "refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to heedlessness", although in some direct translations, the Fifth Precept refers specifically to alcohol.&lt;ref name="yinshun"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yin-Shun | first = Venerable | editor = Wing H.

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===
Prior to assuming his position as leader of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Pope Francis]] had spoken against recreational cannabis. He stated in 2013 in Buenos Aires: "A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bindrim|first=Kira|title=Pope Francis Speaks Out Against Legalization of Marijuana and Other Drugs|url=http://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-says-he-opposes-marijuana-legalization-255708|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The catechism of the Catholic Church states that "The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P80.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date= |accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{main|Cannabis and Latter-day Saints}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], there is general prohibition against intoxicating substances. In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members. In 2016, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] urged members to oppose legalization of recreational cannabis use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Camille|title=First Presidency Asks Members to Oppose Recreational Marijuana, Assisted Suicide|url=https://www.lds.org/church/news/first-presidency-asks-members-to-oppose-recreational-marijuana-assisted-suicide?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=LDS.org|date=October 14, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church says it has "raised no objection to SB 89" (non-psychoactive medical marijuana in Utah).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Church Urges 'Cautious Approach' on Medical Marijuana Issue in Utah|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-urges-cautious-approach-medical-marijuana-issue-utah|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wells|first=David|title=LDS Church issues new statement on medical marijuana|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/02/12/lds-church-clarifies-stance-on-medical-marijuana/|publisher=[[KSTU]]|website=Fox13Now.com|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodoxy===
The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] has resisted legalization of cannabis in that country.&lt;ref&gt;http://neweasterneurope.eu/articles-and-commentary/2276-fighting-georgia-s-draconian-anti-drug-law&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
The [[Arkansas Baptist State Convention]] voted to discourage medical marijuana in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Strode |url=http://www.bpnews.net/47842/marijuana-legalization-on-9-state-ballots |title=Marijuana legalization on 9 state ballots |publisher=Bpnews.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the executive director of the [[Florida Baptist Convention]], Tommy Green, also said that congregations should be encouraged to vote against [[Florida Amendment 2 (2016)|expanded legalization of medical marijuana in Florida]]. The 
National Evangelical Association of Belize opposed the 2017 decriminalization of [[cannabis in Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.bz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14372:churches-complain-about-marijuana-law&amp;catid=40:politics&amp;Itemid=90&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assemblies of God USA]], as well as other [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Holiness Movement|holiness churches]], have historically advocated abstinence from all alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. Supporters of this view generally cite biblical passages enjoining respect for one's body as well as forbidding intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/topics/charctr_08_drugs.cfm | title = Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Drugs | last = | first = | date = | website = ag.org | publisher = Assemblies of God USA | access-date = April 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Protestant churches have endorsed the legality of medical marijuana, including the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[United Methodist Church]], [[United Church of Christ]], and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosch |first=Torie |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/03/what_would_jesus_smoke.html |title=What do Christian groups think about marijuana? |work=Slate |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Cannabis in India}}
[[File:Ganja Smoking - Gangasagar Fair Transit Camp - Kolkata 2013-01-12 2646.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Hindu]] man smoking cannabis in [[Kolkata, India]].]]
During the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Holi]], people consume ''bhang'' which contains cannabis flowers.&lt;ref name="commission"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission|year=1894|location=Simla, India|publisher=Government Central Printing House|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/Library/studies/inhemp/4chapt9.htm}} Chapter IX: Social and Religious Customs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |title=The History of the Intoxicant Use of Marijuana |publisher=National Commission of Marijuana and Drug Abuse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813080240/http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |archivedate=2005-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one description, when the ''[[amrita]]'' (elixir of life) was produced from the [[Samudra manthan|churning of the ocean]] by the devas and the asuras, [[Shiva]] created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir (whence, for cannabis, the epithet ''angaja'' or "body-born"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by [[rishi|sages]] due to association with elixir and [[Shiva]]. 

[[File:Bhang eaters before two huts (6124556163).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Bhang]] eaters from India c. 1790.  Bhang is  an [[cannabis edible|edible preparation]] of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] native to the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It has been used in food and drink as early as 1000 BCE by [[Hindu]]s in [[ancient India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/kbx94a/httpmunchies-vice-comarticlesthe-bhang-lassi-is-how-hindus-drink-themselves-high-for-shiva |title=The Bhang Lassi Is How Hindus Drink Themselves High for Shiva |author=Staelens, Stefanie |website=Vice.com |accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Hinduism, wise drinking of ''bhang'' (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with [[Shiva]] and avoid the miseries of [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] in the [[Saṃsāra|future life]]. It is also believed to have medicinal benefits. In contrast, foolish drinking of ''bhang'' without rites is considered a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/Inhemp/7relhemp.htm|title=Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report - Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Halal|Islamic dietary laws}}
The [[Quran]] does not directly forbid cannabis; however, cannabis is deemed to be ''[[khamr (intoxicant)|khamr]]'' (an intoxicant) by many religious scholars and therefore generally believed to be ''[[haraam]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Muhammad Saed|title=Islam: Questions and Answers - Pedagogy Education and Upbringing|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|year=2003|page=123| isbn= 978-1-86179-296-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pakistan Narcotics Control Board, Colombo Plan Bureau|title=First National Workshop on Prevention and Control of Drug Abuse in Pakistan 25–30 August 1975|location=Rawalpindi|publisher=Workshop Report|year=1975|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] by the prophet Mohammed states: "If much intoxicates, then even a little is haraam."&lt;ref&gt;AD 25;5&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these prohibitions, cannabis is consumed in many parts of the Islamic world, even sometimes in a religious context particularly within the [[Sufi]] mystic movement.&lt;ref name="Ferrara2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark S.

The Sufi tradition attributes the discovery of cannabis to [[Jafar Sharazi]] (Sheikh Haydar), a Sufi leader in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Jones2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jones|title=Spliffs: A Celebration of Cannibis Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abK_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|date=29 July 2013|publisher=Pavilion Books|isbn=978-1-909396-32-6|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sufis attribute its origin to the apocryphal [[Khidr]] ("Green Man").&lt;ref name="Knight2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Muhammad Knight|title=Journey to the End of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XM4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=10 December 2009|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=978-1-59376-552-1|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern Islamic leaders state that medical cannabis, but not recreational, is permissible in Islam. Imam Mohammad Elahi in [[Dearborn Heights]], Michigan (United States), declared: "Obviously, smoking marijuana for fun is wrong... It should be permissible only if that is the only option in a medical condition prescribed by medical experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hijazi |first=Samer |url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_12118/Marijuana-in-Islam:-Smokers-and-scholars-weigh-in.html |title=Marijuana: Arab Smokers, religious scholars weigh in |publisher=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Cannabis and Judaism}}

Though the argument has not been accepted by mainstream scholars, some writers have theorized that cannabis may have been used ritually in early Judaism, though these claims "have been widely dismissed as erroneous".&lt;ref&gt;(Merlin, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sula Benet]] (1967) claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, Orthodox rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] stated in 1973 that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Jacobs1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian G. Jacobs|title=Judaism looks at modern issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVIRAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Aviva Press|isbn=978-0-9511560-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earleywine2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitch Earleywine|title=Pot Politics: Marijuana and the Costs of Prohibition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgASDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-518802-8|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosner2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Rosner|title=Biomedical Ethics and Jewish Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7w2oAmohpEC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2001|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-701-4|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Orthodox rabbis [[Efraim Zalmanovich]] (2013) and [[Chaim Kanievsky]] (2016) stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elsa Vulliamy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/marijuana-is-kosher-for-passover-leading-rabbi-rules-a6995761.html |title=Marijuana is kosher for Passover, leading rabbi rules |publisher=The Independent |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari==
It is not known when [[Rastafari]] first claimed cannabis to be sacred, but it is clear that by the late 1940s Rastafari was associated with cannabis smoking at the Pinnacle community of [[Leonard Howell]]. Rastafari see cannabis as a sacramental and deeply beneficial plant that is the [[Tree of Life]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. [[Peter Tosh]], among many others, has quoted {{bibleref2|Revelation|22:2}}, "... the herb is the healing of the nations."  The use of cannabis, and particularly of long-stemmed water-pipes called [[chalice (pipe)|chalices]], is an integral part of what Rastafari call "reasoning sessions" where members join together to discuss life according to the Rasta perspective. They see the use of cannabis as bringing them closer to [[God]] ([[Jah]]), allowing the user to penetrate the truth of things more clearly.

While it is not necessary to use cannabis to be a Rastafari, many use it regularly as a part of their faith, and pipes of cannabis are dedicated to His Imperial Majesty [[Haile Selassie I]] before being smoked. According to the [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult group]] the [[Watchman Fellowship]] "The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and God. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.watchman.org/profile/rastapro.htm |title= Rastafarianism |work= Profiles |publisher= [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]] |first= Rick |last= Branch |year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to burn the corruption out of the human heart. Rubbing the ashes into the skin from smoked cannabis is also considered a healthy practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joseph Owens (Jesuit)|title=Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica|year=1974|isbn=0-435-98650-3|first=Joseph|last=Owens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Rastafari movement, elders of the 20th-century religious movement known as the [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]], consider cannabis to be the "eucharist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepenthes.lycaeum.org/Drugs/THC/bible.html|title=Marijuana and the Bible|publisher=[[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming it as an oral tradition from [[Ethiopia]] dating back to the time of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit2.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis Vault : Spiritual Use #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology==
[[Scientology]] opposes the use of cannabis, and made "Truth About Marijuana" the focus of their 2016 [[World Health Day]] presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologynews.org/press-releases/activity/church-hosts-truth-about-marijuana-event.html |title=Church Hosts "Truth About Marijuana" Event |publisher=Scientologynews.org |date=2016-04-18 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{main|Cannabis and Sikhism}}
[[File:Process of making bhang in Punjab, India.jpg|thumb|Process of making bhang in a Sikh village in Punjab, India.&lt;br&gt;Photos taken by Marcus Prasad]]

In [[Sikhism]], the First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]], stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction to keeping the mind clean of the name of God.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} According to the ''[[Sikh Rehat Maryada]]'', "A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, in short any intoxicant. His only routine intake should be food and water".&lt;ref name="amritworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritworld.com/main/?p=82#sthash.agD98t5F.dpbs|title=The ‘Sukhnidhaan’ or ‘Bhang’ (cannabis)|work=Amrit World|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there exists a tradition of Sikhs using edible cannabis, often in the form of the beverage [[bhang]], particularly among the Sikh community known as [[Nihang]].&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA378|date=March 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=378–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghHawley2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Michael Hawley|title=Re-imagining South Asian Religions: Essays in Honour of Professors Harold G.

==Taoism==

Beginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in [[censer]]s. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia ''Wushang Biyao'' 無上秘要 ("Supreme Secret Essentials") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with "hallucinogenic smokes".&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 150]. From ancient Chinese fumigation techniques with "toxic smokes" for pests and "holy smokes" for demons, "what started as a 'smoking out' of undesirable things, changed now to a 'smoking in' of heavenly things into oneself."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji'' 元始上真眾仙記 ("Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals"), which is attributed to [[Ge Hong]] (283-343), says:

:For those who begin practicing the Tao it is not necessary to go into the mountains. … Some with purifying incense and sprinkling and sweeping are also able to call down the Perfected Immortals. The followers of the Lady Wei and of Hsu are of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady [[Wei Huacun]] 魏華存 (252-334) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376) founded the Taoist [[Shangqing School]]. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to [[Yang Xi]] 楊羲 (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from [[Xian (Taoism)|immortals]], and Needham proposed Yang was "aided almost certainly by cannabis". The ''Mingyi bielu'' 名醫別錄 ("Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, "Hemp-seeds (麻勃) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (''shujia'' 術家) say that if one consumes them with [[ginseng]] it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Rudgley|url=http://cannabis.net/hist/index.html|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the ''Wuzangjing'' 五臟經 ("Five Viscera Classic") says, "If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, Ho Ping-Yu, and Lu Gwei-djen (1980). ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 4, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention''. Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvLroG7r2MYC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 213].&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Needham connected myths about [[Magu (deity)|Magu]], "the Hemp Damsel", with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis, pointing out that Magu was goddess of [[Shandong]]'s [[Sacred Mountains of China|sacred]] [[Mount Tai]], where cannabis "was supposed to be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month, a day of seance banquets in the Taoist communities."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. 1974. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality'']. Cambridge University Press, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cannabis-using religious movements==

Other religions have been founded in the past century that treat cannabis as a sacrament. They include the [[Santo Daime]] church, the [[THC Ministry]], Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly, the Church of Cognitive Therapy (COCT Ministry), Temple 420, Green Faith Ministries, the [[Church of Cognizance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n848/a01.html|last=Innes|first=Stephanie|title=Pot-Deifying Duo Guilty, Confident They'll Avoid Prison|date=2008-09-05|work=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of the Universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n1046/a05.html|last=Jackson|first=Hayes|title=Appeal Date Set For Pot Priests|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Torstar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamm.com|title=Church of the Universe|publisher=[[Church of the Universe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu, the First Cannabis Church of Florida World Wide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabischurchfl.com/ First Cannabis Church of Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Life Ministry Church of Canthe, the Church of Higher Consciousness, and the federally tax-exempt inFormer Ministry Collective of Palms Springs, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org|title=InFormer Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org/9900001.jpg|title=Rev.

Modern spiritual figures like [[Ram Dass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |title=Ram Dass: Longtime Spiritual Leader, Opponent of the 'War on Drugs' |date=2004-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920210640/http://drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; openly acknowledge that the use of cannabis has allowed them to gain a more spiritual perspective and use the herb frequently for both its medicinal and mind-altering properties.

In Mexico, followers of the growing cult of [[Santa Muerte]] regularly use marijuana smoke in purification ceremonies, with marijuana often taking the place of incense used in mainstream Catholic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktsm.com/news/only-9-the-dark-religion-santa-muerte |title=Only on 9: The Dark Religion of the Santa Muerte &amp;#124; KTSM News Channel 9 |publisher=Ktsm.com |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christa Gail Pike''' (born March 10, 1976) is the youngest woman to be [[death penalty|sentenced]] to death in the [[United States]] during the post-[[Furman vs. Georgia|Furman]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2016/3/11/319852/Chattanooga-Federal-Judge-Upholds.aspx|title=Chattanooga Federal Judge Upholds Conviction of Christa Pike, Who Carried out Torture Murder Of Romantic Rival|access-date=June 6, 2017|newspaper=The Chattanoogan|date=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 20 when convicted of the [[torture murder]] of a classmate she committed at age 18.

Pike lived a troubled life and dropped out of high school. She joined the [[Job Corps]], a government program aimed at helping low-income youth by offering vocational training and career skills, and attended the now-closed Job Corps center in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]]. Pike fell for a young man named Tadaryl Shipp, one year her junior. Together they "dabbled" in the [[occult]] and [[devil worship]].&lt;ref name="Newspaper clip of Pike"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.willkern.com/pike.html|title=Angel's Face, Devil's Heart|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=April 22, 2001|author=Will Kern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
Pike became jealous of 19-year-old fellow student Colleen Slemmer, who she thought was trying to "steal" her boyfriend from her; friends of Slemmer deny the accusations. Along with friend Shadolla Peterson, 18, Pike planned to lure Slemmer to an isolated, abandoned steam plant close by on the [[University of Tennessee]] campus.&lt;ref name="Newspaper clip of Pike"/&gt;
 
On January 12, 1995, Pike, Shipp, Peterson, and Slemmer signed out of the [[dormitory]] and proceeded to the woods, where Slemmer was told they wanted to make peace by offering her some [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name="Newspaper clip of Pike"/&gt; Upon arrival at the secluded location, Slemmer was attacked by Pike and Shipp while Peterson acted as lookout. Per later court testimony, for the next thirty minutes Slemmer was taunted, beaten, and slashed, and a [[pentagram]] was carved in her chest.&lt;ref name=rja&gt;[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/dec/21/rejected-appeal-for-pike-revealing Rejected Appeal], Knoxville News Dec 21 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hfc&gt;[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/apr/07/hearing-convicted-job-corps-killer-pike-resumes Hearing Resumes], Knoxville News April 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Pike smashed Slemmer's skull with a large chunk of [[asphalt]], killing her. Pike kept a piece of her victim's skull.&lt;ref name="Newspaper clip of Pike"/&gt;

Pike began to show off the piece of skull around the school, and within thirty-six hours the three were arrested. The log book showed that the four of them left together and only three returned. They also found the piece of skull in Pike's jacket pocket. The girls' rooms were searched and a copy of the ''[[Satanic Bible]]'' was found in Shipp's. Pike insisted they were merely trying to scare her and it got out of control.&lt;ref name="Newspaper clip of Pike"/&gt;

== Trial ==
There was evidence and a confession. Pike was charged with [[murder]] and conspiracy to commit murder. On March 22, 1996 after only a few hours of [[deliberation]], Pike was found guilty on both counts. On March 30, 1996, Pike was sentenced to death by electrocution for the murder charge and 25 years in [[prison]] for the conspiracy charge. Shipp received a life sentence with the possibility of [[parole]] in 2028.&lt;ref name="Newspaper clip of Pike"/&gt; Peterson, who had turned [[informant]], received probation for pleading guilty to being an accessory.&lt;ref name=hfc/&gt;

== Appeal of conviction ==
Following the guilty verdict, Pike "launched, cancelled and then re-launched" an appeal of her conviction in the Tennessee state courts.&lt;ref name=jda&gt;[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/dec/11/judge-denies-pikes-appeal Judge Denies Appeal], Knoxville News Dec 11 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2001, then again in June 2002, against the advice of her lawyers, Pike asked the courts to drop her appeal and sought to be executed via electrocution. Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz granted the request and an execution date of August 19, 2002, was set.&lt;ref name=eds&gt;[http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/062702/met_9772184.html Execution Date Set], Florida Times Union June 27, 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; Pike soon thereafter changed her mind and on July 8, 2002, defense lawyers filed a motion to allow the appeal process to continue. This motion was denied. However, on August 2, 2002 a three judge state appeals court panel ruled that the proceedings should be continued and the execution was not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcask.org/news/christa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202090922/http://www.tcask.org/news/christa.htm |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Pike's latest request for a new trial was turned down and she was returned to death row.&lt;ref name=jda/&gt; This denied request is believed to be the final allowed under the appeals procedures in the State of Tennessee.&lt;ref name=pfa&gt;[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/dec/04/final-death-row-appeal-christa-gail-pike-delayed-a Pike's Final Appeal], Knoxville News Dec 4 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 2014, no execution date has been set and her case has now entered the federal court system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2013/feb/13/killer-christa-gail-pike-asks-fed-court-to-block/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608070933/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2013/feb/13/killer-christa-gail-pike-asks-fed-court-to-block/ |archivedate=2014-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal court has denied a request to release and overturn the death penalty conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Donila: [http://www.wbir.com/news/local/federal-court-denies-pikes-request-to-overturn-death-penalty/77588963 Federal court denies Pike's request to overturn death penalty], [[WBIR-TV]], 11 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempted murder conviction ==
On August 24, 2001, Pike (with alleged assistance from inmate [[Natasha Cornett]]) attacked and attempted to strangle fellow inmate Patricia Jones with a shoe string, and nearly succeeded in choking her to death. She was convicted of attempted first degree murder on August 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.tn.us/correction/media/womendeathrow.html ''Women on Death Row''], Tennessee Department of Correction.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is the position of the Tennessee Department of Corrections that Natasha assisted in this crime, their investigators concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge her with helping Pike attack Jones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-18901.html Love and Hate on Death Row, The Tennessean July 6 2003], Available on Prison Talk Online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempted prison break ==
In March 2012, it was revealed that Pike had made escape plans involving corrections officer Justin Heflin and a New Jersey man named Donald Kohut. Kohut had visited Pike in prison, but complete details of his relationship to Pike were not immediately known. The attempted prison break was thwarted by a joint investigation involving the Tennessee Department of Corrections, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey State Police.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Christianity by country}}
{{Azerbaijanis}}
'''Christianity in [[Azerbaijan]]''' is a minority religion. [[Christian]]s who estimated between 280,000-450,000 (3.1%-4.8%)&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.pewforum.org/global-christianity/map.php#/Azerbaijan,ALL Global Christianity An Interactive Feature]&lt;/ref&gt; are mostly [[Russian Orthodox Church in Azerbaijan|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] (almost all [[Armenians]] live in the break-away unrecognized [[Republic of Artsakh|Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh]]). There is also a small [[Protestant]] Christian community most of them came from Muslim backgrounds.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.day.az/society/85160.html|title=5,000 Azerbaijanis adopted Christianity|publisher=Day.az|date=7 July 2007|language=Russian|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azeri.irib.ir/tehliller/item/148029-xristian-missioner-t%C9%99riq%C9%99tl%C9%99r-ar-da-aktivl%C9%99sir?tmpl=component&amp;print=1|title=Christian Missionaries Becoming Active in Azerbaijan|publisher=Tehran Radio|date=19 June 2011|language=Azerbaijani|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Christianity spread to territory of Azerbaijan in the first years of the new era. The first stage of this period is called the period of Apostles [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] and [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] (same ones who Christianized [[Armenia]]), who spread the new religion by the benediction of the first patriarch of Jerusalem Yegub. The first church was erected in the village Kish. This church was constructed before the first Armenian Christian church.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Saint Mary Protector of Caucasus.JPG|right|200px|thumb|St. Mary Protector of Caucasus icon in Archangel Michael church, [[Baku]].]]

==Eastern Orthodoxy==
{{main|Eastern Orthodoxy in Azerbaijan}}
Adherents of [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] in Azerbaijan are mainly ethnic [[Russians in Azerbaijan|Russians]] and [[Georgians in Azerbaijan|Georgians]]. Russan Orthodox communities belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church in Azerbaijan]]. Entire territory of Azerbaijan is under ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the ''Russian Orthodox Eparchy of Baku and Azerbaijan'', centered in the [[Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral]] in [[Baku]].&lt;ref name="pravoslavie1"&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/put/070126150112.htm Православие в Азербайджане / Православие.Ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124934/http://www.pravoslavie.ru/put/070126150112.htm |date=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oriental Orthodoxy==
Adherents of [[Oriental Orthodox Christianity]] in Azerbaijan are mainly ethnic [[Armenians in Azerbaijan|Armenians]]. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] currently has no community outside the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]. Before the outbreak of the war, Armenians formed the largest Christian population in the country. Today, Armenian churches in Azerbaijan remain closed, because of the large outmigration of Armenians and fear of Azerbaijani attacks.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1992 (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, February 1993), p. 708&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], despite the constitutional guarantees against religious discrimination, numerous acts of vandalism against the Armenian Apostolic Church have been reported throughout Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights to John D. Evans, Resource Information Center, 13 June 1993, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the [[Baku pogrom]] in 1990, the Armenian [[St. Gregory the Illuminator's Church, Baku|Church of St. Gregory Illuminator]] in was set on fire,&lt;ref&gt;Implementation of the Helsinki Accords: Human Rights and Democratization in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union" (Washington, DC: U.S. Congress, Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, January 1993), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; but was restored in 2004 and is not used anymore.

==Other denominations==
There is only one congregation in the [[Catholic Church in Azerbaijan]]: a church in [[Baku]] was opened in 2007.

There are eleven [[Molokan]] communities. The Molokans are a Christian minority which, much like [[Protestant]]s in Western Europe, center their beliefs on the Bible and reject church hierarchy. 2.5% of the population belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (1998). The [[Russian Orthodox Church in Azerbaijan]] has the Eparchy of Baku and the Caspian region with a seat in Azerbaijan. Among the famous landmark Russian churches are [[Church of Michael Archangel, Baku|Church of Michael Archangel]], [[Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral]] and [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Baku|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]] destroyed by the communists at the beginning of the 20th century.

The [[Albanian-Udi Church]] is of the [[Udi people]] minority in Azerbaijan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

There is a German Lutheran community, likely to number less than 7,000 [[Protestants]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} There is also a [[Georgian Orthodox]] community and churches.

'''Daniel Edwin Carey''' (born May 10, 1961) is an American drummer and instrumentalist best known for his work in American Grammy Award-winning [[progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]. He has also contributed to albums by artists such as [[Zaum (band)|Zaum]], [[Green Jellÿ|Green Jellö]], [[Pigface]], [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Adrian Belew]] of [[King Crimson]], [[Carole King]], [[Collide (band)|Collide]], [[Free Mars|Lusk]], and the [[The Melvins|Melvins]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], Carey's first encounter with the drums began at the age of ten by joining the school band and taking private lessons on the [[snare drum]].&lt;ref name="tdn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/bio/dannybio.php | title = The Tool Page: Danny Carey Biography | first = Joel | last=Mahaffey | work= The Tool Page (t.d.n) | date = August 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Carey began to practice on a [[drum set]]. In his senior year of high school in [[Paola, Kansas]], Carey joined the high school jazz band. Jazz would later play a huge role in his signature approach to the drum set in a rock setting. As Carey progressed through high school and later college at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]], he began expanding his studies in percussion with theory into the principles of geometry, science, and metaphysics as well as delving into [[Sacred Geometry]] and certain hidden aspects of life and the [[occult]]. Carey also played jazz while attending college and got to experience the jazz scene in [[Kansas City Jazz|Kansas City]].

After college, a friend and bandmate convinced Carey to leave Kansas for [[Portland, Oregon]], where he played briefly in various bands before moving to [[Los Angeles]], where he was able to perform as a studio drummer with [[Carole King]] and perform live sets with [[Pigmy Love Circus]]. He also played in Green Jellö as Danny Longlegs and recorded the album ''Cereal Killer''. He would later find his way to [[Tool (band)|Tool]] after coming to know singer [[Maynard James Keenan]] and guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] and practicing with them in place of drummers the two had requested but had never shown up. Besides Tool, Carey also finds time for other projects new and old such as Legend of the Seagullmen, Pigmy Love Circus, [[Volto!]], and [[Zaum (band)|Zaum]].

==Religion and the occult==
Although Carey has not officially aligned himself with any particular school of philosophy or religion, he has projected a deep interest in and understanding for the [[Magick (Thelema)|magickal]] arts – among them various occult teachings. [[Enochian]] symbols, geometric designs, and special symbolic percussive devices are featured on and in his drum kit. He is also a collector of First Edition [[Aleister Crowley]] books as well as books by one of Crowley's more innovative students, [[Kenneth Grant]].

===Geometric designs===
Carey has laid claim to various drumming techniques that use sacred geometric figures such as the [[unicursal hexagram]]. The final product is very recognizable, fluent drumming, although to him it is much more: the official Tool website claims that Danny uses drumming as a ritual similar to occult rituals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toolband.com/identity/danny/main.html |title=Official Tool website – Danny Carey's personal profile |publisher=Toolband.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003172448/http://www.toolband.com/identity/danny/main.html |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with purposes varying from spiritual exploration to "a gateway [which] summoned a daemon he has contained...that has been delivering short parables similar to passages within ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]''". Another geometric reference from the website was the inclusion of ''Nothing in This Book Is True...'' by Bob Frissell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobfrissell.com |title=Bob Frissell's home page |publisher=Bobfrissell.com |date=October 1, 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the band's recommended reading list, a book that deals with sacred geometry and the evolution of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toolshed.down.net/community/newsletter/letter.fall.94.html |title=Fall 1994 newsletter |publisher=Toolshed.down.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side projects and other musical endeavors==
In his time away from Tool, Carey has contributed (and still regularly does) to a vast number of projects:
*Fusion band [[Volto!]], which regularly plays shows in the Los Angeles area, consisting of both covers and original material.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
*[[Pigmy Love Circus]], which has recorded several albums
*[[Electronica]]-oriented project [[Zaum (band)|Zaum]]
*[[Green Jellÿ|Green Jellö]]
*[[Pigface]]
*Drums on the track "Use Less" from the album ''[[The Greater Wrong of the Right]]'' by [[Skinny Puppy]]
*Contributed to [[Adrian Belew]]'s ''[[Side One]]'' and ''[[Side Three]]'' projects with bassist [[Les Claypool]]
*Drums on certain tracks of the Carole King album ''[[Colour of Your Dreams]]'' (as a session drummer) with [[Velvet Revolver]] guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] playing on select tracks
*Drums on the track "Somewhere" from the [[Collide (band)|Collide]] album ''[[Some Kind of Strange]]'' and several tracks from [[Two Headed Monster (album)|Two Headed Monster]]
*Made an appearance on the 1997 album ''[[Free Mars]]'' by former Tool bassist [[Paul D'Amour]]'s band [[Lusk (band)|Lusk]]
*Drums on the track "The Fourth" on the self-titled album from Feersum Ennjin, the band of former Tool Bassist [[Paul D'Amour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/exclusive-feersum-ennjin-premiere-the-fourth-featuring-tools-danny-carey.html|title=Exclusive: Feersum Ennjin Premiere "The Fourth," Featuring Tool’s Danny Carey|author=Geist|first=Brandon|date=November 17, 2011|website=|publisher=Revolver Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224305/http://www.revolvermag.com/news/exclusive-feersum-ennjin-premiere-the-fourth-featuring-tools-danny-carey.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Drums with psychedelic rock supergroup Legend of the Seagullmen along with [[Brent Hinds]] of [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] and others, their eponymous debut album is set to be released on February 9, 2018 on Dine Alone Records.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuQtN3vk-q8&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=November 2018}}

==Equipment==
Carey uses the wood tip version of his own signature model of drumstick made by [[Vic Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.vicfirth.com/products/signatureseries1.php |title=vicfirth.com |publisher=vicfirth.com |date= |accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously had endorsed a signature model with Trueline Drumsticks (now Trueline's Tribal Assault model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truelinedrumsticks.com |title=truelinedrumsticks.com |publisher=truelinedrumsticks.com |date= |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

At Winter [[NAMM Show|NAMM]] 2009 [[Sonor]] released a Danny Carey signature snare drum, which is a 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick bronze 14x8" snare with laser etched talisman symbols and his signature engraved around the vent hole.

Carey also uses [[Paiste]] cymbals, [[Evans Drumheads]], Hammerax Percussion, and [[Korg]] and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] electronics.

==Drumming techniques==
Carey's popularity among drummers and non-drummers alike stems from the diversity of his sound and dynamics through his years of learning jazz music, his technical ability, frequent use of odd time signatures, [[polyrhythm]]s and polymeters. He has stated in interviews that he effectively treats his feet as he does his hands: he practices [[rudiments]] (used for sticking techniques) and even snare drum solos with his feet to improve his [[bass drum|double bass]] drumming, hi-hat control and foot independence.

In search of new techniques, Carey has studied [[tabla]] with [[Aloke Dutta]], who can be heard playing on the live version of the song "Pushit" (from ''[[Salival]]''). This is especially apparent on tracks such as "Disposition" (''[[Lateralus]]'') or "Right in Two" (''10,000 Days''), for which Carey has recorded the tabla parts himself in the studio. The tabla (and other percussive instruments) used in Tool's music are replicated live using the [[Mandala pad]]s (in fact the pads are also used when recording in the studio, a notable example being the tabla solo of "Right in Two" from ''10,000 Days'').

He has also stated that when he is playing to an odd time signature, he tries to drum to the "feel" of the song and establish general "inner pulse" for the given time signature instead of fully counting it out.

Carey has been featured in many drum and music magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/updatefull/200001157/Danny%20Carey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913101941/http://www.moderndrummer.com/updatefull/200001157/Danny%20Carey |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 13, 2009 |title=Danny Carey: Artists: Modern Drummer Magazine |publisher=Moderndrummer.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2303">'''Garbhodakaśāyī Vishnu''' is an expansion of [[Mahavishnu|Mahā Vishnu]]. In [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudīya Vaishnavism]] the Sātvata-tantra describes three different forms of Vishnu as: [[Maha Vishnu|Mahā Vishnu]], Garbhodakaśāyī Vishnu and [[Ksirodakasayi Vishnu|Ksirodakaśāyī Vishnu]] ([[Paramatma|Paramātmā]]). Each form has a different role in the maintenance of the Universe and its inhabitants.

"For material creation, Lord [[Krishna]]'s plenary expansion assumes three Vishnus. The first, [[Mahavishnu|Mahā Viṣhṇu]], creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, enters into all the [[universes]] to create diversities and the third, [[Ksirodakasayi Vishnu|Kṣīrodakaśāyī Vishnu]], is diffused as the all-pervading super soul in all the universes; in the heart of every living being, is known as Paramātmā. He is present even within the [[atom]]s.The real objective of [[meditation]] in [[Yoga]] is attaining a state of Paramātmā. Anyone who realises them can be liberated from material entanglement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/4/en1 Quoted from the Sātvata-tantra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311062325/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/4/en1 |date=2007-03-11 }} translation by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda&lt;/ref&gt;

Garbhodhakaśāyī Viṣṇu is an expansion or overload of [[Mahavishnu|Mahā Viṣṇu]] (expansion of [[Sankarshana|Saṃkarṣaṇa]] of second caturvyūha, which expands from [[Narayana|Nārāyaṇa]] in [[Vaikunta|Vaikuṇṭhaloka]]).
Garbhodhakaśāyī Vishnu is realized as the form of [[Pradyumna]] within the material universe . He is the father of Brahmā who appeared from His navel and hence Garbhodakashayi Vishnu is also called Hiraņyagarbha.

The 2017 date for this observance is October 20.

==Origins of Govardhan Puja and Annakut==
[[File:Krishna Holding Mount Govardhan - Crop.jpg|thumb|Krishna holding Mount Govardhan]]
Krishna spent most of his childhood in [[Braj]], a place devotees associate with many of Krishna’s divine and heroic exploits with his childhood friends.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyC4o7i9tnEC|title=India: A Sacred Geography|last=Eck|first=Diana L.|date=2013-03-26|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=9780385531924|page=361|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant incidents, described in the [[Bhagavata Purana]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; involves Krishna lifting Mount Govardhan (Govardhan Hill), a low hill situated in the middle of Braj.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the Bhagavata Purana, forest-dwelling [[gopi|cowherds]] living close to [[Govardhan]] used to celebrate the autumn season by paying respect to [[Indra]], the God of rain and storm. Krishna did not approve of this since he desired that the villagers worship Mount Govardhan with the reason that Mount Govardhan is the one that provides natural resources to the villagers for their livelihood. Trees provided oxygen, the grass provided food for the cattle and provided natural beauty. The mountain was responsible for the natural phenomena that occur in the city of Gokul. Indra got angry with this advice. Shri Krishna, though being younger than almost everyone in the city, was respected by everyone due to his knowledge and immense power. So, the people of Gokul agreed with Shri Krishna's advice. Indra was angered upon seeing the villagers' devotion diverted away from him and toward Krishna. Indra decided to initiate thunderstorms and heavy rains in the city in reflex of his egoistic anger. To protect the people from the storms, Shri Krishna lifted the Govardhan mount on his little finger and provided shelter to all the people and cattle of the city. After 7–8 days of continuous storms, seeing the people of Gokul being unaffected, Indra accepted defeat and stopped the storms. This day is therefore celebrated as a festival that paid respect to Mount Govardhan by preparing a 'giriyajna' - a "great offering of foods and delicacies to the mountain" Krishna then assumed the form of a mountain himself and accepted the villagers' offerings. .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://basr.ac.uk/diskus_old/diskus11/wood.htm|title=DISKUS: The journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions (BASR)|website=basr.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra, after causing torrential rains for seven days, ultimately gave up and bowed to Krishna’s superiority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This story is one of the most recognizable in the Bhagavata Purana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Govardhan has since become a major pilgrimage site in Braj for devotees of Krishna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the day of Annakut, devotees circumambulate the hill and offer food to the mountain—one of the oldest rituals in Braj.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The circumambulation consists of an eleven-mile trek dotted along the way with several shrines, before which devotees place flowers and other offerings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Families create an image of Giriraj Govardhan (the mountain) from cow dung, adorning it with miniature cow figures as well as grass as twigs, representing trees and greenery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the days leading up to Annakut, fifty-six food items (chappan bhog) are typically prepared and offered in the evening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Someone from a cow-herding caste officiates the ritual, circling the hill with a cow and a bull, followed by families in the village. They partake in the sanctified food after offering the food to the hill. The festival often draws a  large crowd, including the [[Chaube]] [[brahmin]]s of [[Mathura]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Rituals Of Annakut ==
Annakut is celebrated on the fourth day of Diwali. The fourth day of Diwali is also the first day of the new year in the Vikram Samvat calendar. Therefore, the rituals surrounding Annakut are closely linked with the rituals of the five days of Diwali. While the first three days of Diwali are days of prayer to sanctify wealth and invite greater wealth into the devotee’s life, the annakut day is a day of offering gratitude for Krishna beneficence

=== Goverdhan Puja ===
Govardhan Puja is a principal ritual performed during Annakut.  Although some texts treat Govardhan Puja and Annakut as synonymous, the Govardhan Puja is one segment of the day-long Annakut festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KcEotmV2MAC|title=Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares|last=Pintchman|first=Tracy|date=2005-08-25|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791465950|pages=212, 66|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variants of how Govardhan Puja is performed. One ritual is performed in which a god is (Lord Krishna)makes from cow dung in horizontal position.After, completing the structure it is decorated by earthernlamps(deepak or diya),the seenkh(a material which is same as the broom's chaff),candles and after worshiping,the structure of lord is feed by the bhaktas or worshipersand the ladies do fasts&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://festivals.iloveindia.com/diwali/govardhan-puja.html|title=Govardhan Puja - Govardhan Puja Legends, Govardhan Pooja      Celebrations|website=festivals.iloveindia.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prayers are also made to Lord Govardhan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;[[File:Govardhan -1.JPG|thumb|Govardhan -1]]

As described in the Bhagavata Purana , Govardhan Puja is chiefly identified with Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill on his finger to protect those who sought his refuge from Indra’s torrential rage.&lt;ref name="basr.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://basr.ac.uk/diskus_old/diskus11/wood.htm|title=DISKUS: The journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions (BASR)|website=basr.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KcEotmV2MAC|title=Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares|last=Pintchman|first=Tracy|date=2005-08-25|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791465950|page=212|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Main Annkut Festival ===
Vast array of vegetarian foods is traditionally arranged in tiers or steps in front of the deities.&lt;ref name="basr.ac.uk" /&gt; Usually, the sweets are placed nearest to the Deities. As the tiers descend, other foods such as '[[dal]]', vegetables, pulses and fried savory foods are arranged. A mound of cooked grains, symbolic of Mount Govardhan, is placed in the center. In Swaminarayan shikharbaddh mandirs, sadhus begin to arrange the Annakut in the morning and finish before noon.&lt;ref name="swaminarayan.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/festivals/diwali/index2.htm|title=Nutan Varsh - Annakut (New Year's Day)|website=www.swaminarayan.org|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thaal ===
In all [[Swaminarayan]] mandirs, sadhus and devotees then sing 'Thaal' - [[kirtan]]s or devotional hymns composed by the poet paramhansas of Swaminarayan. These kirtans describe the food items, and are about praying to the Deities to accept the food. The singing lasts for about an hour, and is followed by a grand arti.&lt;ref name="swaminarayan.org"/&gt; Afterwards, devotees do puja and circumambulate the Deities and offered food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9D40mqdvgMC|title=The Power of the Dharma: An Introduction to Hinduism and Vedic Culture|last=Knapp|first=Stephen|date=2006-06-05|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595837489|language=en}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some mandirs, Arti is performed several times in the day as long as the Annakut offerings remain before the Deities. In the evening, devotees take portions of the Annakut as prasad, sanctified food, that has been offered to God and is received as his mercy.&lt;ref name="swaminarayan.org"/&gt;

In certain mandirs, especially in Mathura and Nathadwara, the murtis are also given a [[milk bath]] before being and dressed in elegant clothes and ornaments.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuVG8PxKq_0C|title=Essential Hinduism|last=Rosen|first=Steven|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275990060|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vishvakarma Puja ===
Some craftsmen pay reverence to their tools and machinery on the day of Annakut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4TtrdejbTEC|title=Festivals of India|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|isbn=9788124108697|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annkut Celebrations Today==
Hindus throughout the world actively celebrate Annakut as a part of Diwali and, most frequently, pair the Annakut celebration with the Govardhan Puja performed on fourth day of Diwali celebrations.&lt;ref name="Livingston"/&gt; Hindus also view Annakut as a time to transmit religious and cultural values to children, ask for forgiveness from God and express devotion towards God. Annakut is celebrated with [[Diya (lamp)|diya]]s (small oil lamps) and [[rangoli]], decorative art on the ground made from colored rice, colored sand, and/or flower petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bapsgermany1.blogspot.com/2014/10/annakut-at-baps.html|title=BAPS Germany: Annakut at BAPS|last=Germany|first=Baps|website=BAPS Germany|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many distinct food items, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or thousands, are offered to deities during Annakut.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, 250 kilograms of food were offered to Lord Krishna at the [[ISKCON]] temple in Mysore, India in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govardhan-puja-at-iskcon-temple/article163949.ece|title=Govardhan puja at ISKCON temple|date=2009-10-19|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Annakut is most often associated with Lord Krishna, other deities are also focal points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9680810/Diwali-2012-London-temple-welcomes-Hindu-New-Year-with-a-mountain-of-food.html|title=Diwali 2012: London temple welcomes Hindu New Year with a mountain of food|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mahalakshmi-temple.com/festival.asp|title=Shri  Mahalaksmi Temple Charities -   Festivals and special arrangements|last=Designs|first=Enlighten|website=mahalakshmi-temple.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Shree Mahalakshmi Mandir in Mumbai, India, 56 sweets and food items are offered to Mataji and then distributed as Prasad to more than 500 devotees.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Annakut festival is also celebrated annually at approximately 3,850 [[BAPS]] Mandirs and centers throughout the world in a day-long event. During the festival, Swaminarayan devotees prepare and offer a large variety of vegetarian food to Hindu deities including Swaminarayan and Krishna, among others.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; The Annakut festival at BAPS mandirs is often the largest festival of the year.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/News/2013/Annakut-Celebrations-2013-5407.aspx|title=Annakut Celebrations 2013|website=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baps.org/News/2014/New-Year---Annakut-Celebrations-with-Pramukh-Swami-Maharaj-6936.aspx|title=New Year - Annakut Celebrations with Pramukh Swami Maharaj|website=BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-hundreds-people-marked-hindu-8014681|title=In Birmingham hundreds of people marked Hindu New Year and Diwali|last=Fulford|first=Paul|website=birminghammail|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parsippanyfocus.com/2014/10/28/diwali-celebrations-baps-parsippany/|title=Diwali Celebrations at BAPS Parsippany|last=Staff|first=Parsippany Focus|website=Parsippany Focus|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors learn about Hindu spirituality, offer prayers for the new year, partake in the prasad, or sanctified food, and engage in other devotional activities.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt; A devotee at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in [[Leicester]], England, which organizes the Annakut festival every year, describes Annakut as being a forum where spiritual aspirants can reaffirm their appreciation for the role God plays in their lives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2007/11/13/annakut_diwali_feature.shtml|title=Annakut Celebration!|last=BBC|language=en-gb|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gatherings also represent an opportunity to reaffirm a sense of community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; At the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden, England in 2004, 1247 vegetarian dishes were assembled and offered to the deities during the Annakut celebrations in 2000 at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden, England.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://londonmandir.baps.org/the-mandir/|title=– BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, London|website=londonmandir.baps.org|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guillermo Gómez Rivera''' ({{IPA-es|ɡiˈʎeɾmo ˈɣomes riˈβeɾa|lang}}; born 12 September 1936) is a [[Spanish Filipino]] multilingual author, historian, educator and linguistic scholar whose lifelong work has been devoted to the movement to preserve Spanish culture as an important element of the Filipino identity.&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallo|first1=Andrea|title=La pérdida del español para el filipino ha comportado el desarraigo de su propia cultura|url=http://www.letralia.com/195/entrevistas01.htm|website=www.letralia.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Academia&gt;{{cite web|title=Asociacion de Academias de la Lengua Española: Academicos|url=http://www.asale.org/academicos/guillermo-gomez-rivera|website=www.asale.or|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hispanic&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hede|first1=Marcela|title=Are Filipinos Hispanic?|url=http://hispanic-culture-online.com/are-filipinos-hispanic.html|website=www.hispanic-culture-online.com|publisher=Hispanic Culture Online|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the most senior academic director of the [[Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española]] of the [[Real Academia Española]].&lt;ref name=Academia /&gt; In 1975, he was awarded the [[:es:Premio Zóbel|Premio Zóbel]], the Philippines' highest literary honor bestowed on the best works in Spanish.&lt;ref name=Zobel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Picornell|first1=Jaime|title=81 Years of Premio Zobel–The Book|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20061227-40374/81_years_of_Premio_Zobel_-_The_Book|website=www.globalnation.inquirer.net|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his expertise in the Spanish language as well as his knowledge of various Philippine languages, including [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]/[[Filipino language|Filipino]], and [[Chavacano]], he was appointed secretary of the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|Commission on the Filipino Language Committee]] of the [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Philippine Constitutional Convention]] (1971–73).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emanila.com/pilipino/various/ggr_thomasites.htm |title=The Thomasites, Before and After |first=Guillermo |last=Gómez Rivera |publisher=Emanila Community (emanila.com) |location=Philippines |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rE2SuzKP?url=http://emanila.com/pilipino/various/ggr_thomasites.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Spanish professor at [[Adamson University]] he authored textbooks on Spanish grammar, speech and composition while working for [[San Miguel Corporation]], a food conglomerate. He used his academic position to try to influence national debates on the question of whether or not Spanish should be retained as a compulsory subject in Philippine high schools and universities, a battle that many pro-Spanish advocates believe they had lost with the passage of the 1987 Constitution but which some Hispanists say started with the 1973 Constitution.&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Constitution Killed Spanish in the Philippines?|url=http://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/which-constitution-killed-the-spanish-language-in-the-philippines-a-clarification/|website=www.filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having done extensive research on [[List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances sorted by origin|Spanish dances]], including [[flamenco]] and [[Sevillanas]], he formed a dance school to teach students of all ages an appreciation of Spanish culture through the dance art. He traveled to Spain to improve his skills, learning from Spanish masters of these dance forms. He is considered a [[maestro]] de [[flamenco]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=ManilaStandard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Red|first1=Isah V.|title=Hiyas ng Pilipinas|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2014/05/15/hiyas-ng-pilipinas/"|website=www.manilastandardtoday.com|publisher=MST Management Inc.

In an hour-long broadcast devoted to Asia on September 24, 2013, [[RTVE|Spanish Radio and Television Corp.

He speaks and writes fluently in his native [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] as well as in [[English language|English]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Aside from being an acclaimed master of the [[Spanish language in the Philippines]], he is also conversant in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Kinaray-a]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], and has made an extensive study of the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] and [[Chavacano]] languages.

==Biography==

Guillermo Gómez Rivera was born in [[Dingle, Iloilo]] on the southeast portion of [[Panay Island]] and graduated from the [[University of San Agustin]] in [[Iloilo City]] with degrees in commerce and in education. In 1967, he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran|Colegio de San Juan de Letrán]]. Shortly afterwards, he obtained a doctorate in Philippine Literature under the tutelage of a Jesuit academic.&lt;ref name=Academia /&gt;

He has been a lifelong advocate of [[Spanish in the Philippines|the Spanish language in the Philippines]]. Most of his written works argue in favor of the preservation of the Philippine-Hispanic identity of the country,&lt;ref name=Fundeu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallo|first1=Andrea|title=Entrevista a Guillermo Gómez Rivera, de la Academia Filipina|url=http://www.fundeu.es/noticia/entrevista-a-guillermo-gomez-rivera-de-la-academia-filipina-4698|website=www.fundeu.es|publisher=Fundéu BBVA|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the Spanish language, which was used by the founding fathers of Philippine independence in their struggle against Spain. These revolutionaries and writers included [[Jose Rizal]].

As secretary of the National Language Committee of the [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Philippine Constitutional Convention]] (1971–1973) during the presidency of [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]], he favored [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] to become the basis of the country's national language. In the same convention, he joined forces with other nationalists to preserve Spanish as one of the country's official languages. Spanish, however, was later made an optional language (together with [[Arabic]]) under the Constitution of 1987 which was promulgated under the presidency of [[Corazon Aquino|Corazón Aquino]] who abolished the 1973 constitution under [[Ferdinand E. Marcos|Marcos]].&lt;ref name=Constitution /&gt;&lt;ref name=Entrevista&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallo|first1=Andrea|title=Entrevista a Guillermo Gómez Rivera|url=https://www.um.es/tonosdigital/znum16/secciones/entrevistas-1-Entrevista%20a%20Guillermo%20Gomez%20Rivera.htm|website=www.um.es|publisher=Tonos Digital|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a grandnephew of [[Guillermo Gómez Windham]], a famous Filipino writer during the American colonial period. Of British descent who served as Philippine bureau of customs commissioner during the [[History of the Philippines#United States Colony|American Occupation]], Gómez Windham was the first Premio Zóbel medal recipient when the award was launched in 1922. Gómez has two children: the late Marién, also an accomplished flamenco dancer, and Guillermo Gómez Ordóñez. He currently resides in Makati City. He has practically transformed his home into a Spanish dance studio and library of [[Filipiniana]] materials.

==Literature, history and culture==

Although literary critics regard Gómez Rivera's writing style as combative,&lt;ref name=PDF&gt;{{cite web|title=Filipino literature in Spanish|url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:9000/rpc/cat/finders/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v4/v5.pdf|accessdate=30 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502215338/http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:9000/rpc/cat/finders/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v4/v5.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2014|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it hews to the works in English of his friend [[Nick Joaquin]],arguably the most accomplished Filipino writer in English. Joaquín's body of written works were subtly about the "[[Hispanic culture|Hispanic soul]]" of the Philippines brought about by three centuries of Spanish rule. Joaquín's stories in particular were sentimental, reminiscing about the Philippines' Spanish past as well as lamenting its decline. Gómez has been writing on the same theme, more thoroughly about the decadence of the country's "Hispanic soul," but his style is often combative and tends to lay blame for the near demise of the Spanish language in his country on what he calls [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] "domination" of the country's educational and economic life. He identifies this strangle hold as "the cause of the moral and economic impoverishment of the Philippines, and the loss of the Spanish language." Gómez Rivera has articulated this theme in fiery essays, short stories and poems written in various Filipino languages as well as in English and Spanish.

Organizers of the Premio Zóbel, in awarding him the prize in 1975, cited "his efforts to preserve the Spanish language and culture in our country," although some literary historians mistakenly believe he won the award solely for his play "El caseron." Prior to winning the Premio Zóbel, Gómez won second place in the [[Premio Manuel Bernabé]] for an essay on the historical and nationalistic value and importance of the Spanish language.&lt;ref name="Entrevista"/&gt;

Gómez Rivera, as editor of ''Nueva era'', a weekly and only remaining Spanish language newspaper in the Philippines,&lt;ref name="Entrevista"/&gt; has used his editorials to attack government officials whom he accuses as "vile puppets of [[United States|U.S.]] WASP neocolonialism," claiming proofs to bolster his accusations. Through his body of literary works, he has urged Filipino readers to "rediscover" their Spanish past in order for them to gain knowledge of their true national identity.&lt;ref name=Speak&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valdivia|first1=Juan Arellano|title=They don't (sic) speak Spanish in the Philippines? (translated from the original Spanish ¿En Filipinas no hablaban castellano? )|url=http://globalvoices.org/2014/12/14/they-dont-speak-spanish-in-the-philippines/|website=globalvoices.org|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He views cultural dissemination as a tool to accomplish his advocacy, particularly through dance. His research on Philippine songs and dances, especially those of Hispanic influence, was used by the internationally acclaimed [[Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company]]&lt;ref name=Academia /&gt; to choreograph some of its performances with him acting as adviser for the group.&lt;ref name=Bayanihan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gómez Rivera|first1=Guillermo|title=Bayanihan beyond folklore|url=http://www.bayanihannationaldanceco.ph/mestizajearticle.html|website=www.bayanihannationaldanceco.ph/|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gómez Rivera is also a recording artist who has cut an album of Filipino songs that were originally in Spanish as well as in [[Chavacano]]. He is credited for reintroducing to the modern local film industry the now forgotten film ''[[Secreto de confesión (Philippine film)|Secreto de confesión]],'' the first locally produced film spoken and sung in Spanish (''la primera película hablada y cantada en español producida en Filipinas'').

His efforts to bring back the Filipino national identity based on Spanish have led some critics, such as poet-academician [[Edmundo Farolán]] and poet-novelist [[Gilbert Luis R. Centina III]], to call him  ''El Don Quixote Filipino.''&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centina III|first1=Gilbert Luis R.|title=Guillermo Gómez Rivera|url=http://gilbertluisrcentinaiii.tumblr.com/post/62025762905/guillermo-gomez-rivera|website=www.gilbertluisrcentinaiii.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farolan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farolan, |first1=Edmundo|title=Homenaje a Guillermo Gómez Rivera|url=http://vcn.bc.ca/~edfar/revista/pri00.htm|website=www.vcn.bc.ca|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Gómez Rivera published his first novel, ''Quis ut Deus'' (Who Is Like God), the first Spanish-language novel published in the Philippines in the last 55 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gomez’s "quis ut deus" and the aswang|url=https://withonespast.wordpress.com/tag/guillermo-gomez-rivera/|website=De AnDA|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flamenco==

Gómez Rivera honed his dancing skills in short courses conducted by Spanish international dancers such as ''[[Los Chavales de España]],'' [[Antonio Ruiz (dancer)|Antonio Ruiz]] and [[José Greco]] who visited Manila in the 1970s and the 1980s. But his introduction to flamenco came much earlier at the age of four when he learned it, along with many other Spanish dances, from Rosa Jiménez. She was a flamenco dancer from [[Sevilla]], [[Spain]] and the second wife of his maternal grandfather, José Rivera Franco.&lt;ref name="Entrevista"/&gt;

Over the years he compiled a repertoire of more than a hundred choreographed dances, mostly for the [[Roma music|Gypsy]] and [[Music of Andalusia|Andalusian]] schools. Flamenco has six schools, namely: ''Escuela Andaluza'' (Andalusian), ''Escuela Bolera'', ''Escuela Creativa'' (or ''de Fusión''), ''Escuela Folklórica'', ''Escuela Gitana'' (Gypsy) and ''Escuela Popular.''He has developed a five-level flamenco course called "choreographic immersion" with preliminary drills in footwork and hand and body movements, including the ''compás'' of fours and twelves. His students learn many of these dances with or without castanettes. Gómez Rivera's dance students include some of Manila's most well-known socialites such as Marissa Aboitiz, Marités Cancio-Suplico,&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodis|first1=Girlie|title=Tess Suplico: A woman of dance &amp;amp; substance|url=http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/142996/tess-suplico-woman-dance-substance|website=www.philstar.com|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; María Emma Estrada, Cecile de Joya, actress [[Maggie dela Riva|Maggie de la Riva]], former [[Philippine Basketball Association]] coach [[Dante Silverio]], Perla Primicias (daughter of former Philippine Senator Cipriano Primicias), and his own now deceased daughter Marién Gómez de Lizares.&lt;ref name=Flamenco&gt;{{cite web|title=Professors|url=http://www.centroflamencophil.com|website=www.centroflamencophil.com|publisher=Fundacion Centro Flamenco|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educator==

Gómez Rivera spent several years teaching Spanish [[grammar]], Philippine history and [[philosophy]] at [[Adamson University]]. For a time, he served as the head of Adamson's Spanish department. He retired from the university in 2001, but he continues to teach flamenco in his home and in Steps Dance Studio in [[Makati]]. He occasionally offers Spanish language tutorial and has served as the official interpreter of President [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno S. Aquino III]] such as when he hosted the first lady of Mexico during the early years of his presidency.

During his teaching stint, he was president of ''Corporación Nacional de Profesores en Español'' (CONAPE), an organization of Filipino educators who teach the Spanish language.&lt;ref name="Gallo"/&gt;

==Media==

Gómez Rivera's journalism career started with the magazine ''El maestro'' during the 1960s. Its goal was to aid Filipino teachers in Spanish in the practice of their profession. Aside from being the current editor of ''Nueva era'', he also edits two other weeklies: ''The Listening Post'' and ''The Tagalog Chronicle.'' In 1997, he worked on television as a segment host of [[ABS-CBN]]'s now defunct early morning program [[List of shows previously aired by ABS-CBN|Alas Singko y Medya]], presenting a five-minute Spanish lesson. Gómez Rivera released an LP back in 1960 when he was producing ''La voz hispanofilipina'', a radio program on [[DZRH]]. It was a product of his research on a number of "lost" Filipino songs sung in Spanish during the Spanish colonial era. He reintroduced the songs through the LP entitled ''Nostalgia filipina'', where his vocal interpretation is accompanied by a [[rondalla]].&lt;ref name="Gallo"/&gt;
Digitally remastered with funding from the  [[Spanish Program for Cultural Cooperation]], the LP was reissued and launched at [[Instituto Cervantes de Manila]] on August 14, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5463">The {{nihongo|'''Humanity Declaration'''|人間宣言|Ningen-sengen}} is an [[monarchy of Japan|imperial]] [[rescript]] issued by the [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito)]] as part of a [[Japanese New Year|New Year's]] statement on 1 January 1946 at the request of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]]. In the rescript, which follows the [[Five Charter Oath]] of 1868, the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] denied the concept of his being a living god, which would eventually lead to the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Japan|new Constitution]], under which the Emperor is "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people".&lt;ref name="National Diet Library"&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/03/056shoshi.html], ''[[National Diet Library]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The rescript is not officially titled, but apart from its popular name, "Humanity Declaration" or "'''Ningen-sengen'''", it is also known as {{nihongo|'''''Imperial Rescript on the Construction of a New Japan'''''|新日本建設に関する詔書|Shin Nippon Kensetsu ni Kan suru Shōsho}} and {{nihongo|'''''Imperial Rescript on National Revitalization'''''|年頭、国運振興の詔書|Nentō, Kokuun Shinkō no Shōsho}}.

==The Declaration==
Delivery of this [[rescript]] was to be one of Hirohito's last acts as the imperial Sovereign. The Supreme Commander Allied Powers and the Western world in general gave great attention to the following passage towards the end of the rescript:

{{quote| {{lang|ja|朕ト爾等國民トノ間ノ紐帯ハ、終始相互ノ信頼ト敬愛トニ依リテ結バレ、單ナル神話ト傳説トニ依リテ生ゼルモノニ非ズ。天皇ヲ以テ現御神トシ、且日本國民ヲ以テ他ノ民族ニ優越セル民族ニシテ、延テ世界ヲ支配スベキ運命ヲ有ストノ架空ナル觀念ニ基クモノニモ非ズ。}}

The ties between Us and Our people have always stood upon mutual trust and affection. They do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the false conception that the Emperor is divine, and that the Japanese people are superior to other races and fated to rule the world. &lt;small&gt;(official translation)&lt;/small&gt;}}

==Interpretation==
According to the popular Western view, promoted by the [[Douglas MacArthur|Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]], this challenged the centuries-old claim that the Japanese emperor and his predecessors were descendants of the [[solar deity|sun goddess]] [[Amaterasu]], and thus the Emperor had now publicly admitted that he was not a living [[deity|god]]. Thus, the same day as the rescript was issued, [[General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] announced that he was very much pleased with Hirohito's statement, which he saw as his commitment to lead his people in the [[democratisation of Japan]].&lt;ref name="National Diet Library" /&gt;

Hirohito was persistent in the idea that the emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand chamberlain [[Michio Kinoshita]]: "It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call chimerical the idea that the emperor is a descendant of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wetzler | first = Peter | title = Hirohito and War | publisher = University of Hawai'i Press | location = Honolulu | year = 1998 | page = 3| isbn = 978-0-8248-1925-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the Western interpretation, including the Emperor himself,&lt;ref name = Dower&gt;{{cite book | last = Dower | first = John | authorlink = John W. Dower| title = [[Embracing Defeat]] | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 314–317 | isbn = 978-0-393-32027-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the repudiation of divinity was not the point of the rescript. Since this rescript starts with a full quote from the [[Five Charter Oath]] of 1868 by the [[Meiji Emperor]], the Emperor's true intention was that Japan had already been democratic since the [[Meiji Era]] and was not democratised by the occupiers. As was clarified at a press interview of 23 August 1977, the Emperor wanted the Japanese people not to forget pride in Japan. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the imperial rescript was published with a commentary by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Kijūrō Shidehara]] that dwelt exclusively on the prior existence of democracy in the Meiji Era and did not make even passing reference to the emperor's "renunciation of divinity".&lt;ref name = Dower/&gt;

This rescript is said to have been drafted by [[Reginald Horace Blyth]] and [[Harold Gould Henderson]],&lt;ref&gt;Dower, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; who also contributed to the popularisation of [[Zen]] and the poetic form of [[haiku]] outside [[Japan]].

'''Inamullah Khan''' (1912–1997) was a Muslim activist who symbolised the [[World Muslim Congress]], Al-Motamar al-Alam al-Islami, for almost four and half decades. He was awarded the [[Templeton Prize]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

== Early years ==
Inamullah Khan was born in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]], in 1912. His family originally hailed from [[Zamania]], India, and he migrated to Pakistan in 1948.

== Contributions ==
Inamullah Khan was the founder and former secretary-general of the Modern World Muslim Congress in Karachi, Pakistan. He devoted his life to working tirelessly to advance peace among Muslims, Christians, and Jews. He also desired to promote Islamic unity and concern to help end the oppression and subjugation of Muslims in the world. 

He organised a worldwide signature campaign on the question of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and, in 1950 presented to the UN secretary general, a mile long scroll signed by one million people in support of the people of Kashmir. {{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

He also played a major role in helping to settle the war between Iran and Iraq.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

== Awards ==
Inamullah Khan received several awards for his work. He was awarded the Japanese award in 1987, [[Niwano Peace Prize]] and the [[Templeton Prize]] for progress in Religion in 1988.

==Allegations of antisemitism==
The [[Anti-Defamation League]] opposed awarding of [[Templeton Prize]] to Khan claiming that Khan had supported [[antisemitism]], and that the World Muslim Congress' newsletter had supported antisemitic propaganda such as the [[Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]] and [[The International Jew]]. Khan denied being anti-semitic. The ADL also noted Khan's longstanding links to the anti-communist [[World League for Freedom and Democracy]]. Khan said he participated in their conferences because "as a religious person, I am opposed to all atheistic creeds."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', 19 April 1988, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/19/us/anti-semitism-charges-lead-to-delay-on-religion-prize.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Anti-Semitism Charges Lead To Delay on Religion Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] says that Khan supports [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2002/spring/the-swastika-and-the-crescent/deniers|title=Holocaust Deniers Unite|date=Spring 2002|author=Martin A.

[[File:Baba Jai Lal Ji Gurdwara.jpg|thumb|Baba Jai Lal Ji Gurdwara, at Jalandhar Cantonment, Punjab, India]]
'''Baba Jai Lal Ji Ubhi''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਬਾਬਾ ਜੇ ਲਾਲ ਜੀ ਊਭੀ) (June 1561 - 1641) is a [[Sikh]] religious figure who is venerated for his religious devotion and service to the fifth [[Sikh Guru]], [[Guru Arjan Dev]] Ji.

==Early life==
Jai Lal Ubhi was born in the village of Patara (near the city of [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[India]]) to a [[Sikh]] family. His father's name was Bhagtoo and his mother's name was Nihalo. Both his parents died when he was 12 or 13 years old.

==Career==
Jai Lal was an expert craftsman who selflessly donated his services to the construction of Thum Sahib, a [[Gurdwara]] commissioned by Guru Arjan Dev Ji, near [[Kartarpur, India|Kartarpur]]. Baba Jai Lal Ubhi's work can be found in Gurdwara Thum Sahib, which still stands today.&lt;ref name="Reference 1"&gt;"Kirtan da upashak Baba Jai Lal ji Ubhi" by Balbir Singh Parwana, Patara, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting Jai Lal's altruistic contributions and his faith, Guru Arjan Dev Ji blessed Jai Lal.  It is believed that, in addition to Guru Arjan Dev Ji, [[Baba Budha Ji]] also blessed Jai Lal, and that Baba Dasa Ji from the nearby village of Slampur, although a few years his senior, considered Jai Lal to be his spiritual teacher.&lt;ref name="Reference 1"/&gt;

Baba Jai Lal Ji maintained a hut for prayers outside the village of Patara, and devotees visited this hut to seek his spiritual advice and blessings. To honor his memory, a Gurdwara named after Baba Jai Lal Ji was erected at Jalandhar Cantonment at the original location of this hut.

[[File:Maneki-neko-ja.jpg|thumb|A ''maneki-neko'']]
The {{nihongo|'''''maneki-neko'''''|招き猫||literally "&lt;nowiki /&gt;'''beckoning cat'''&lt;nowiki /&gt;"|lead=y}} is a common [[Japan]]ese figurine (lucky charm, talisman)  which is often believed to bring [[good luck]] to the owner. In modern times, they are usually made of [[ceramic]] or plastic. The figurine depicts a [[cat]] (traditionally a [[calico cat|calico]] [[Japanese Bobtail]]) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed in—often at the entrance of—shops, restaurants, [[pachinko]] parlors, and other businesses. Some of the sculptures are electric or battery-powered and have a slow-moving paw beckoning. 

''Maneki-neko'' comes in different colors, styles and degrees of ornateness. Common colors are white, black, gold and sometimes red. In addition to ceramic figurines, ''maneki-neko'' can be found as [[keychain]]s, [[piggy bank]]s, [[air freshener]]s, house-plant pots, and miscellaneous ornaments, as well as large statues.  It is also sometimes incorrectly called the "Chinese lucky cat" because of its popularity among [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants.

==Common features==

===Gesture===

To some [[Western world|Westerners]] ([[Italians]] and [[Spaniards]] are notable exceptions) it may seem as if the ''maneki-neko'' is waving rather than beckoning.&lt;ref name=Calero2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry H. Calero|title=The Power of Nonverbal Communication: How You Act is More Important Than what You Say |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plCVYnnUhjoC&amp;pg=PA116|year=2005|publisher=Silver Lake Publishing|isbn=978-1-56343-788-5|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=E. S. Wibbeke |title=Gestures around the World |url=http://www.globalbusinessleadership.com/gestures_overview.asp |website=Globalbusinessleadership.com |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the difference in gestures and body language recognized by some Westerners and the Japanese. The Japanese beckoning gesture is made by holding up the hand, palm down, and repeatedly folding the fingers down and back, thus the cat's appearance. Some ''maneki-neko'' made specifically for some Western markets will have the cat's paw facing upwards, in a beckoning gesture that is more familiar to most Westerners.&lt;ref name="Shizuko"&gt;{{cite web |author=Shizuko Mishima |title=Manekineko: Japanese Lucky Cats |url=http://gojapan.about.com/cs/traditionculture/a/luckycats.htm |website=Japan Travel |publisher=About.com |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67mEC7L7K?url=http://gojapan.about.com/cs/traditionculture/a/luckycats.htm |archivedate=19 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Maneki-neko'' can be found with either the right or left paw raised (and sometimes both). The significance of the right and left raised paw differs with time and place.&lt;ref name="Daruma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |title=Maneki Neko: Feline Fact &amp; Fiction |author=Alan Pate |website=[[Daruma Magazine]] |publisher=Takeguchi Momoko |location=Amagasaki, Japan |year=2008 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DIDy4b8G?url=http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |archivedate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a general [[rule of thumb]], statue with the left paw raised is meant to be displayed in drinking establishments, while the one with the right paw for all other places of business; another interpretation is that right is for home and left for business.&lt;ref name="Daruma" /&gt;

Some ''maneki-neko'' feature battery- or solar-powered moving arms endlessly engaged in the beckoning gesture.

[[File:Manekineko1003.jpg|thumb|left|''Maneki-neko'' with motorized arm beckons customers to buy lottery tickets in Tokyo, Japan]]

===Composition===
Antique examples of ''maneki-neko'' may be made of carved wood, stone and metal, handmade porcelain or cast iron.&lt;ref name="Daruma"  /&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Maneki-Neko and Okiagari-Koboshi Daruma Edo Period.jpg|left|thumb|A wooden mold for a Maneki-Neko and Okiagari-Koboshi Daruma figure from the Edo Period, 18th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]

===History===
[[File:Fushimi-Tonpuppe 1 makffm.jpg|thumb|[[Fushimi, Kyoto|Fushimi]] clay doll by Tanka]]
[[File:Characters from Plays as Merchants and Customers, from the series Flourishing Business in Balladtown 02.jpg|thumb|"Joruri-machi Hanka no zu" by [[Utagawa Hiroshige]], 1852]]
It is commonly believed that ''Maneki-neko'' originated in [[Tokyo]] (then named Edo), while some insist it was [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name="Daruma" /&gt; ''Maneki-neko'' first appeared during the later part of the [[Edo period]] in Japan.&lt;ref name="Daruma" /&gt;  The earliest records of ''Maneki-neko'' appear in the Bukō nenpyō's (a chronology of [[Edo]]) entry dated 1852. [[Utagawa Hiroshige]]'s ukiyo-e "Joruri-machi Hanka no zu," painted also in 1852, depicts the Marushime-neko, a variation of ''Maneki-neko'', being sold at [[Sensō-ji|Senso]] temple, [[Tokyo]]. In 1876, during the Meiji era, it was mentioned in a newspaper article, and there is evidence that [[kimono]]-clad ''maneki-neko'' were distributed at a shrine in [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]] during this time. A 1902 advertisement for ''maneki-neko'' indicates that by the turn of the century they were popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Schumacher |title=Maneki Neko: The Lucky Beckoning Cat |url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/maneki-neko.shtml |website =A to Z Photo Dictionary of Japanese Buddhist Statuary |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this the exact origins of ''maneki-neko'' are uncertain, though several folktales offer explanations.

Others have noted the similarities between the ''maneki-neko''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s gesture and that of a cat washing its face. There is a Japanese belief that a cat washing its face means a visitor will soon arrive. This belief may in turn be related to an even older [[Chengyu|Chinese proverb]] that states that if a cat washes its face, it will rain. Thus, it is possible a belief arose that a figure of a cat washing its face would bring in customers. In his ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'', China's [[Tang Dynasty]] author Duan Chengshi (803?–863) wrote: "If a cat raises its paw over the ears and washes its face, then patrons will come".

===Folktales===
''Maneki-neko'' is the subject of a number of [[Folklore|folktale]]s. Here are some of the most popular, explaining the cat's origins:

'''The stray cat and the shop:''' The operator of an impoverished shop (or inn, tavern, temple, etc.) takes in a starving, stray cat despite barely having enough to feed himself.  In gratitude, the cat sits in the front of the store beckoning customers, thus bringing prosperity as a reward to the charitable proprietor.  Ever after, the "beckoning cat" has been a symbol of good luck for small business owners.&lt;ref name="Daruma" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Fortune Cat.jpg|thumb|Chinese maneki-neko with a moving arm, which is electrically-powered by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].]]
Modern Japanese [[Superstition|folklore]] suggests that keeping a [[talisman]] of good fortune, such as the ''maneki-neko'', in bedrooms and places of study will bring about favorable results and life successes.

Because of its popularity in Chinese communities (including [[Chinatown]]s in the United States)&lt;ref name="Daruma" /&gt; the ''maneki-neko'' is frequently mistaken for being Chinese in origin rather than Japanese, and is incorrectly referred to as a "Chinese lucky cat" &lt;ref name="Daruma" /&gt; or ''jīnmāo'' ("golden cat"). This cat is also prevalent in [[China]] domestically, and is usually referred to as the followings: {{lang-zh|t=招財貓|s=招财猫|hp=zhāocáimāo}}.

The [[Pokémon]] named [[Meowth]] is based upon the ''maneki-neko''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species:_Meowth | title=On the Origin of Species: Meowth - Bulbanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Meowth source is dubious|date=April 2018}} Unlike traditional Maneki-neko who hold the Koban coin, Meowth has the coin projected from its forehead. Meowth can fire this coin as a projectile weapon with its signature move Payday.

[[Netta Barzilai|Netta]] performed her song "[[Toy (song)|Toy]]" in front of two walls full of maneki-neko at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]. She won the competition after collecting 529 points at the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=- |first1=- |title=Eurovision Song Contest 2018 |url=http://www.eurovisionsongcontest.info/english/eurovision_song_contest_2018.htm |website=Eurovision Song Contest |publisher=- |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In 1979, Rales left his father's real estate firm to found Equity Group Holdings, with his brother, [[Steven M. Rales]].  Using [[junk bonds]], they bought a diversified line of businesses.  In 1978, they changed the name to Diversified Mortgage Investors, and then to Danaher, in 1984.

In the 1980s, the AM side of radio station WGMS was sold off to Washington, D.C., [[venture capital]]ists Steven and Mitchell Rales, who converted the music station into the first frequency for [[WTEM]], a sports-talk station, in [[1992 in radio|1992]].  In 1988, he made a hostile takeover bid for Interco, Inc, which was, at the time, the nation's largest manufacturer of furniture and men's shoes (owning both [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse shoes]] and the [[Ethan Allen (furniture company)|Ethan Allen furniture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1274918.html| title= The Rales Brothers Play for Big Stakes; Little-Known Area Family Builds an Industrial Empire | work= The Washington Post| author=David A.

In 1995, Rales and his brother founded [[Colfax Corp.|Colfax]], a [[Richmond, Virginia]] industrial pumps manufacturer, which had an initial public offering in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/06/AR2008070601875.html| title= The Quiet Dynamism of the Brothers Rales| work= The Washington Post| date=July 7, 2008| author=Thomas Heath }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Rales has expressed a strong desire to spend his money philanthropy, saying to the Washington Post in 2018, "When we go, there's not going to be money bestowed on children and grandchildren in any meaningful way. This is about reallocating the money we had the good fortune of making to other causes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rales is on the board of the [[National Gallery of Art]] and is a former board member of the [[Hirshhorn Museum]]. 

==Glenstone==
{{Main|Glenstone}}
Rales and his wife, Emily Wei Rales, developed and financed Glenstone, a contemporary art museum in Potomac, Maryland. The museum first opened in 2006 and displays the Rales's collection of post-World War II art, including paintings, sculptures, and both indoor and outdoor installations. A major $219 million expansion to Glenstone was opened in 2018 that increased both the gallery space and the wooded land surrounding the galleries. The museum is free and open to the public via online booking.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/arts/design/glenstone-expansion-mitchell-rales.html|title=Glenstone, a Private Art Xanadu, Invests $200 Million in a Public Vision|last=Pogrebin|first=Robert|date=2018-09-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002070547/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/arts/design/glenstone-expansion-mitchell-rales.html|archive-date=2018-10-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/lifestyle/glenstone-museum/|title=Glenstone: See inside (and outside) D.C.’s newest museum experience|last=Smee|first=Sebastian|last2=Higgins|first2=Adrian|date=|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064647/https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/lifestyle/glenstone-museum/|archive-date=2018-10-02|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/article/21024414/the-new-glenstone-is-an-art-retreat-in-the-wilds-of-montgomery-county|title=The New Glenstone is a Contemporary Art Retreat in the Wilds of Montgomery County|last=Capps|first=Kriston|date=2018-09-27|work=Washington City Paper|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7137">The '''Monita Secreta''' (also known as: '''Secret Instructions of the Jesuits''', or the '''Secret Instructions of the Society of Jesus''') is an alleged code of instructions from [[Claudio Acquaviva]], the fifth general of the [[Society of Jesus]], to its various superiors which claims to lay down methods to expand the power and influence of the Jesuit Order.  Scholars regard the document as an anti-Jesuit forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Healy  | first = Roisin  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=om6MiDM8sNQC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Monita+Secreta+forgery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0EqrfpTENw&amp;sig=jZlH2lzseJvgIHX6D2xc8oDhhd0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MXrCUKyyH82U0QXBhICwCA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Monita%20Secreta%20forgery&amp;f=false | title =The Jesuit Specter in Imperial Germany | publication-date = 1969  | publisher = Brill Press  | page = 182  | isbn = 0-391-04194-0}} As part of the ''Studies in Central European Histories'' series edited by Thomas A.

== Summary of Contents ==
According to the Monita, Jesuits are to use every means at their disposal to acquire wealth for the order. For instance, Jesuits are encouraged to entice promising young men to enter the order and endow it with their estates; rich widows are to be cajoled and dissuaded from remarriage. Every means is to be used for the advancement of [[Jesuit]]s to [[Diocese|bishopric]]s or other ecclesiastical dignities and to discredit the members of other orders, while the world is to be persuaded that the Society is animated by the purest and least interested motives: the reputation of those who quit it is to be assailed and maligned in every way.&lt;ref name=Gerard&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10487a.htm Gerard, John. "Monita Secreta." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 10 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Scholars consider the Monita to be the work of one Jerome Zahorowski, a Pole, who, having been a member of the Society, had been expelled for disciplinary matters in 1613. They were first published in [[Krakow]] in 1615,&lt;ref name=Bernauer&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/research_sites/cjl/pdf/Bernauer_FromEuropeanAntiJesuitism.pdf Bernauer, James. "From European Anti-Jesuitism to German Anti-Jewishness: A Tale of Two Texts" presented at the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland (March 5, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; purporting to be a translation from the Spanish, and were printed in the same city in 1614. Various stories were told regarding their discovery; they were most often associated with [[Christian the Younger|Duke Christian of Brunswick]], despite the fact that he would have been only 15 years old at the time of their initial publication. The place where they were found was variously set down as [[Paderborn]], [[Prague]], [[Liège]], [[Antwerp]], [[Kłodzko|Glatz]], and on board a captured [[East Indiaman]].&lt;ref name=Gerard/&gt;

Attempts were likewise made at various times, as late even as 1783, to excite interest in the work as the result of a new discovery; there was also an undated edition, in the early nineteenth century, which professes to issue from the Propaganda Press, and to be authenticated by the testimonies of various Jesuit authorities. However, they are attributed to a general, "Felix Aconiti", who is completely unknown in the Annals of the Society of Jesus. The censor who purportedly approves the publication bears the name "Pasquinelli", while the titles which, it is alleged, should ensure the esteem of men in general for the Society, include all the crimes and abominations of every kind—immoralities, conspiracies, murders, and regicides—which the Jesuits' bitterest enemies have attributed to it.

== Debate about Authenticity ==
Amongst those who have argued that the ''Monita'' are a hoax are Bishop Lipski of Cracow (1616), Father Bernard Duhr in his ''Jesuiten Fablen'', Fra [[Paolo Sarpi]], the historian of the [[Council of Trent]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]] and the "Nouvelles Ecclesiastiques"; plus anti-Jesuits such as the [[Jansenists]] [[Henri de Saint-Ignace]] and [[Blaise Pascal]], von Lang, [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger]], Friedrich (the author of Janus), Huber, and Reusch, as well as the Protestant historian [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]]. In the [[British House of Commons]], during the debates on [[Catholic Emancipation]], the fraudulent character of the ''Monita'' was acknowledged by more than one speaker, while the authorities of the [[British Museum]] and likewise the French bibliographer M. Barbier, agree in describing the work as "apocryphal".

Anglican Bishop of London [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]] was strongly opposed to Roman Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macaulay |first=Thomas Babington |title=The History of England from the Accession of James II |location=Philadelphia |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |year=1878 |volume=II |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1669 published an English translation of ''The Secret Instructions''.

A defense was offered by [[Richard Frederick Littledale]], opponent to Roman Catholicism,  in his article "Jesuits", in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] of 1881.  He claimed that the work is "both caricature and libel", but pleaded nevertheless that it was substantially true, since its author, "a shrewd and keen observer", having noticed how Jesuits actually worked, deduced from his observations the rules by which they were guided.

As against this case, [[John Gerard]], writing in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' denies the authorship arguing that the official rules and constitutions of the Jesuits contradict these supposed instructions, for they expressly prohibit the acceptance of ecclesiastical dignities by its subjects, unless compelled by papal authority, and from the days of the founder, [[St. Ignatius Loyola]], the Society has impeded such promotion. Gerard also argues that in many cases, genuine private instructions from the Jesuit general to subordinate superiors have fallen into hostile hands, which in many cases are found to give instructions directly contrary to those in the ''Monita''.&lt;ref name=Gerard/&gt;

James Bernauer draws comparisons between the ''Monita Secreta'' to the later no less libelous, discredited anti-Semitic [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref name=Bernauer/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15459">'''New Church Education''' is a philosophy of education developed and practiced by the [[General Church of the New Jerusalem]], one of the [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|New Church]] or [[Swedenborgian]] sects. This philosophy is based on some of works of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], whose theological writings are considered by members of this church to be the revealed Word of God, equal in authority to the Old Testament and the New Testament.

Early in its history, the General Church of the New Jerusalem adopted distinctiveness as one of its central principles. Its members worked to clearly identify those things found in [[Emanuel Swedenborg#Scriptural commentary and writings|Swedenborg's theological writings]] that differentiated the New Church, as described there, from other churches and then to incorporate those distinctions into their institutions and actions.

Developing a distinctive theory and practice of education became important as [[compulsory education]] spread across the United States. Looking into [[Systematic theology#Other|their revelation]], members of the General Church of the New Jerusalem pieced together a new idea of how a child's mind develops from birth into adulthood. This developmental process formed the basis of a distinctive educational philosophy designed to give children in formal educational settings the experiences and knowledge believed to provide a solid foundation for the lifelong process of spiritual [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and growth.

==Overview==
The main purpose of New Church education is to help students learn, love, and live the teachings of the Lord God Jesus Christ as revealed in the Old and New Testaments and the Heavenly Doctrines of the New Jerusalem. Base on the ideas revealed through [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] about the growth and development of a child's mind, New Church Education provides for the spiritual development of each student, focusing on the essential areas described in the Ten Religious Goals of New Church Education.

==Key Ideas==

===The State of the Human Mind at Birth===
According to the New Church, everyone is born with inherited tendencies to do evil. Unlike the doctrine of [[original sin]], however, a child inherits only the tendencies to committing the same sins committed by their parents and grandparents, etc. and not the sins themselves. This means that while the newborn's [[Volition (psychology)|will]] (or motivation| motivational faculty) is totally corrupt and their interests are completely self-centered, they are not condemned by that corruption because they remain innocent of any sin.

The implication is that without proper [[Intrinsic motivation#Early programming|education in childhood]], children will naturally tend towards destructive decisions and attitudes, behaviors that will become sins once the child becomes an adult and is responsible for his or her own actions. A proper education, then, includes learning to think clearly, to look at the world from a spiritual point of view, to understand the difference between right and wrong, and to practice good spiritual habits.

===Childhood Innocence===
One of the primary goals of New Church education is to maintain the [[innocence]] belonging to childhood for as long as possible (See [[New Church Education#The State of the Human Mind at Birth|"State of mind at birth"]] above). Different than naiveté, the New Church idea of "innocence" refers to a state of mind free from sin because of a willingness to be led by the Lord. One can be quite knowledgeable about the world and still be willing to be led. Specifically, childhood is a time of "innocence of ignorance," that is, children are free from sin because they do not yet fully understand the difference between good and evil and cannot accurately see the future consequence of their choices. Even though children do things that would be considered evil and sinful if done by an adult, they are not yet held accountable because they cannot yet knowingly commit sin—not fully understanding what sin is.

Because children are innocent and thus willing to be led, they are most open to learning the difference between right and wrong and practicing that understanding into lifelong habits. New Church education, then, intends to provide formal instruction in academic subjects in a way that also explains, demonstrates, and provides and opportunity to practice those differences between right and wrong.

===School as Extension of the Home===
Proponents of New Church Education believe that consistent messages from home, church, and school—three of the most influentional institutions in a child's life—as to what constitutes good and evil is the most effective way to reduce the impact of conflicting messages from other sources. This consistency of message is to support the establishment of good habits that provide a solid foundation for the work of [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] in adulthood, when the [[New Church Education#Innocence of Childhood|innocence of ignorance]] necessarily fades into spiritual struggles to do what is good and shun what is evil.

The school is said to "extend" the home because the values taught at school and upon which the school is founded should duplicate the values held and taught by the families who send their children to become students. Schools should not impose values on the home, but should reinforce the values taught at home.

===The Ten Religious Goals===
New Church Educational philosophy is organized around the following 10 topics.&lt;ref&gt;1998 General Church Religion Curriculum&lt;/ref&gt; Each topic is associated with a religious goal for the educational environment based on a passage from the Writings for the New Church:
;The Lord Jesus Christ : To assist students in building an ongoing and developmentally appropriate affection and understanding of who the Lord Jesus Christ is in their own lives.&lt;blockquote&gt;"[A]n acknowledgment of God produces a conjunction of God with a person and of the person with God."''Divine Providence 325''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
;The Lord's Word : To foster in students an affection for, a knowledge of, and a belief in, the Lord's Word and an ability to read it with understanding and delight.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Word must be taught mediately through parents, teachers, books and especially through the reading of it. Nevertheless, it is not taught by these, but by the Lord through them." ''Divine Providence 172.6''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
;Heaven and Hell : To foster in students a delight in and a knowledge of the reality of the spiritual world and its divisions.&lt;blockquote&gt;"That there is a hell and a heaven, and that the life after death is eternal." ''Arcana Caelestia 5135.3''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
;Marriage : To foster in students an affection for and a knowledge of true marriage.&lt;blockquote&gt;"[I]nternal conjunction, which is that of souls and constitutes marriage itself, can be provided on earth...in the case of those who from early youth had loved and desired and asked of the Lord a legitimate and lovely companionship with one." ''Married Love 49''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
;Charity : To foster in students a developing knowledge of how to live a life of charity and morality and to give them opportunities to practice it.&lt;blockquote&gt;"These truths, that relate to charity toward the neighbor and to love to the Lord, must be learned before it is possible for a person to be regenerated. They are first implanted through parents and teachers; next from the Word of the Lord: and afterwards through the person's own reflection of them."

==History==
New Church people in Great Britain started the first schools to offer education which looked to the Lord in the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Heavenly Doctrine. Some of these were day schools and others were a variation of Sunday School but they all gave children instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic as well as religion. During the 1800s over thirty day schools were operating in England, offering a basic education but most of these closed in the early 1900s. Yet even as these schools were closing, there was a rededication to New Church education among those sympathetic with the goals of the Academy of the New Church. Schools opened in London and Colchester which continued to offer education in the light of New Church teachings for many years. Why did they carry on with New Church education? The answer lies in what was happening in the United States and Canada.

As New Church ideas spread to North America, many congregations in the United States and in Canada started day schools as well as Sunday Schools. But as the quality of public education improved and it became more accessible, most congregations decided to focus on their Sunday School programs as a way to teach children about the Lord and His Word. There were others who felt strongly about the importance of New Church education in the home, in school, and on Sundays. They felt that one of the most effective ways to help the church was to give children their academic education in the light of New Church teachings. They wanted children to hear or read stories from the Lord’s Word each day and have a supportive environment to help them apply these teachings in their lives. Those believing that New Church education plays an essential role in the life of the church rallied around the Academy of the New Church when it was established in 1876. Many congregations opened elementary schools in support of Academy ideals. These schools are affiliated with the General Church of the New Jerusalem, which works closely with the Academy.

The Academy has been a center for New Church education since its founding in 1876, looking to the Lord in the light of the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Heavenly Doctrine. It is composed of four private, accredited schools located in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. The Academy offers education for high school and college students as well as those wanting a post-graduate degree in New Church theology.

'''''Oh, Brother!''''' is a British [[situation comedy]] show on [[BBC]] television starring [[Derek Nimmo]], which was broadcast between 1968 and 1970.

==Synopsis==
The series was set in a monastery, with Nimmo cast as the well-meaning but inept novice Brother Dominic.  It was basically a successor to ''[[All Gas and Gaiters]]'', where Nimmo had played a very similar role, the main difference being that Brother Dominic was working-class, whereas Nimmo's previous character, Rev. Mervyn Noote, had been upper-class.

==Reception==
''Oh, Brother!'' was not quite as successful or as affectionately remembered as the earlier programme, although it did last three series containing 19 episodes, only eight of which exist in the BBC archives.  The comic potential in a monastery may have been rather limited, although it did benefit from a cast which included some experienced actors, particularly Nimmo himself and [[Felix Aylmer]] as Father Prior.

{{nihongo||おなり神|'''Onarigami'''|also written as をなり神}} is the ancient belief of the [[Ryūkyūan people]] that spiritual power is the domain of women. The roles of women in Okinawan society and the ritual traditions of the [[Ryūkyūan religion]] are related to this belief. Women with exceptionally high spiritual power are called {{nihongo||神人|kaminchu|also read as "''kamigutsu''"}} and many have specific jobs in society. Though the role of priestesses has changed over time, they are still celebrated in [[Okinawa prefecture|Okinawa]] today.

== Ryukyuan Religion ==
{{Main|Ryukyuan religion}}
Ryukyuan religion is the indigenous belief system of the [[Ryūkyū Islands]]. It is largely based on [[ancestor worship|ancestor veneration]] and concerned with relationships with the supernatural world. It is similar to Shinto but is also influenced by [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] religious beliefs and practices.

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Ryukyu Islands}}
Over time, Ryūkyūan religious practice has been influenced by [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Shinto]].

=== Ryūkyū Kingdom ===
In the late fifteenth century, King [[Shō Shin]] established a formal hierarchy of religious officials that corresponded closely to the hierarchy of male government officials. He appointed his sister as the [[high priest]]ess, known as the ''kikoe-ōgimi''. By the sixteenth century, the traditional Ryūkyūan beliefs were part of a well-structured state religion in the [[Ryūkyūan Kingdom]]. The hierarchy of priestesses were an important factor in keeping the Ryūkyūan Kingdom unified. The royal authority of kings was closely interwoven with the power of female religious officials to confer spiritual power (''seji'' or ''shiji'') (Smits, 55). However, the king was not originally a large part in most important rites of the state. His role was passive compared to the [[Buddhist monasticism|Buddhist monks]], high priestess and other leading female religious officials (Smits, 101).

=== Satsuma domination (1609–1871) and Confucianism ===
Near the end of the sixteenth century, the [[Shimazu clan]] of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]] invaded the Ryūkyūan Kingdom with the approval of the Japanese rulers in [[Edo]]. As many of Satsuma’s elite viewed the Ryūkyūans as culturally inferior, a number of contemporary politicians attempted to reform the kingdom in order to be more acceptable to both the Japanese rulers and to [[China]]. During this time, it is thought that the brother-sister relationship became more important than ties to wives and mothers largely as a result of the influence of state formation and the introduction of a patrilineal form of kinship.

Satsuma slowly attempted to strip power from women. In 1611, the Fifteen Articles Decree included an article that stated women were no longer eligible for state offices. Links between the court and the outlying islands that had been affected by state priestesses were transferred into the male sphere. In 1667, regional priestess had to be represented by a male official instead of being able to travel to [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] themselves for important occasions. By 1768, they could no longer receive gifts from the king in local offices, but had to instead deliver them to their homes. The king became the major actor in rites of state, and supplanted the ''nūru'' as the central link with “Heaven.” New Ryūkyūan rites prevented women from participating in key roles.

Many of these changes were met with the resistance of the Ryūkyūan people. [[Shō Shōken]] initially gained little support from other officials in taking steps against ''yuta''. [[Confucianism]] never became popular with the common people, and traditional religious practices continued in the countryside. It is likely that the royal government had more control over the lives of peasants near major urban areas of Okinawa. Critical voices of the government in this time included the female poet [[Onna Nabe]], whose writings indicated a strong personal connection to ''onarigami''.
The failure of the formal prohibition against ''yuta'' was acknowledged by government, but the government’s stated ideals would not permit repealing it. Gregory Smits writes that this exemplified the “widening gap between an increasingly Confucianized central government and a peasantry that continued steadfast in its traditional religious beliefs and practices - with local officials caught in the middle,” (116).

=== Okinawa Prefecture, 1879–1945 ===
In 1879, the [[Ryūkyū Domain]] was renamed [[Okinawa Prefecture]] by the [[Meiji period|Meiji government]] and the monarchy was abolished. The land reforms of 1903 made land property of patrilineally organized families, which deprived village priestesses of their income, and, incidentally, some of their influence. However, they still retained some power, especially in out-of-the way places.

=== After World War II === 
The huge loss of life in [[World War II]] affected Ryūkyūan religion. There were no longer as many women available for spiritual positions, and the number of priestesses diminished dramatically. Other women were drawn away from the traditional religion by [[Christianity in Japan|Christian]] and [[Missionary#Buddhist missions|Buddhist missionaries]]. In terms of the government, the trends that began under Satsuma rule were continued through [[Occupation of Japan|American occupation]] and Japanese rule.

== Onarigami and the Family ==
=== Okinawan Kinship ===
One of the key features of the Okinawan society is an [[Ambilineality|ambilineal]] kin group called ''weka''. This kin group consists of the couple and their produced offspring as well as the first and second cousins. For women, the status of these kinship group remains with her from when she was born to her death, which is different than [[Japanese family|kinship]] in the rest of Japan. Marriage does not replace a woman’s original family but instead adds a new lineage. Women have a double membership with her biological family and her husband’s family. The wife is accepted in the husband’s kin group when she becomes a mother. If the mother marries someone of different clan outside of the group, she is able to return to her ancestral land for all rituals.

=== Matriarchal Interpretations ===
While some of the earliest accounts of the [[Ryukyuan people]] by Westerners suggested that it was a [[matriarchy|matriarchal society]], there has not been sufficient evidence to support this. However, supporters of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|goddess hypothesis]] and matriarchal studies scholars such as [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]] still view ancient Okinawa as matriarchal. Göttner-Abendroth cites ''onarigami'' as evidence that the “ancient Japanese matriarchal culture” came from the south (147).

=== Women ===
According to the [[Omoro Sōshi]], Shiji is sought from the other world in the skies or over the sea (Monica, 346). This enables women to protect the kind men, and men at war. In addition to the high status of being a wife, there is also the sister-brother alliances. All of the women of the Ryukyu islands were worshipped by their brothers as Onarigami. When the brother is away at sea they always take pieces of hair from his sister’s head, it holds a fundamental value of priestesses and goddesses in which the sister possessed to ensure protection of the voyage. The women in the Okinanawan society are thought to have the power to bless or curse a male’s kin. Although they practice a patrilineal descent, the women in the household still have the spiritual power as practiced by the Onarigami. The roles of these women in the household are to maintain the family structure as well as continuing on the ritual, such as praying on ancestral shrine. It is usually the eldest women in the household which oftentimes are the wife or mother that performed the ritual. Whereas the monthly rituals performed within the agrarian cycle are from the sisters of the household. These duties are to be fulfilled until death and then the roles are transferred to the next available female of the household (Monica, 353).

== Kaminchu ==
In Ryūkyūan religion, a ''kaminchu'' is a person with spiritual power (''seji''), the ability to sense, communicate with, and direct the power of ''[[kami]]''. They also have obligations to ''kami''. According to W.P. Lebra, a person is appointed ''kaminchu'' once it is clear that the person has spirit of high value. Additionally, these people typically come from families of already established ''kaminchu'' and are usually the first son or first daughter of that family. Although both men and women can have spiritual power, most ''kaminchu'' are women, in accordance with the ''onarigami'' emphasis on women’s spiritual superiority. ''Kaminchu'' can be further broken down into other religious specialist subgroups, specifically ''nūru'' and ''yuta''.

=== Noro priestesses ===
{{main|Noro (priestess)}}
Noro (or Nūru in the Okinawan language) refers to a chief priestess of a community. They are widely thought of as the embodiment of a particular kami and therefore hold a semi-divine status. Noro are thought, in old Ryukyu, to communicate directly with “Heaven” and that heaven communicated through her (Smits, 101). The noro are government officials and possibly could have helped in tax collection in some localities and were in charge of officiating all ceremonial affairs in the community (Smits, 115). Additionally, the noro may also be in charge of officiating ceremonial affairs in neighboring villages. Noro are, however, mainly in charge of garnering the favor of kami. These priestesses exclusively wear white [[kimono]] as a sign of their close relationship with kami, and no other villagers are allowed to wear this color kimono. The role was largely confined to women from certain families, and was passed on from generation to generation with the paraphernalia of sacred objects (Newman and Eng, 396).
According to Newman and Eng, at one time noro were required to be celibate. However, these days, it is not a stringent requirement as some noro priestesses are married. Still, these married priestesses choose to abstain from sexual relationships with their husbands during the time of important events and rituals.

=== Yuta === 
''Yuta'', female [[Shamanism|shamans]] or [[Mediumship|mediums]], are ''kaminchu'' with the ability to see, hear, and be possessed by ''kami'' or spirits. Because of this, they are called upon when any mysterious or unfortunate events arise and are asked to provide the cause for such events. ''Yuta'' are not thought of as being the embodiment of a particular ''kami'' or spirit as they are ones who can see and communicate with all ''kami'' and spirits. With regards to ''kami'' and spirits, ''yuta'' are able to do spirit mediumship, curing, [[exorcism]], prayer, [[retrocognition]] or discerning past events, prayer, and other rituals. As with ''nuru'', ''yuta'' are chosen by ''kami''. However, they will have no prior knowledge of their position as ''yuta'' before the ''kami'' sends them signs of their position. Also like the ''nuru'', ''yuta'' are more often than not women. There are some male ''yuta'' but they are not particularly trusted. This further places emphasis on the role of women in the community.
Outside of the Ryukyuan islands, there has been a negative perception of all ''yuta''. Some American scholars have interpreted them as being malevolent magical practitioners or compared them to fortune tellers, and Japanese administrators even outlawed their operations at one point. The cause of this, in part, stemmed from the ''yuta'' undermining the authority of the ''nuru''. However, this prohibition proved to be unsuccessful as most common people that had supported ''yuta'' before prior to the prohibition continued to support them after.

== Religious Activities ==
=== Festivals ===
{{Main|Ryukyuan festivals and observances}}
The Tanetori Festival, is a celebration of ''onarigami'' in which the sister’s prayers and the brother’s gifts is an important part. The four days festival takes place in the tenth month of the Lunar calendar.

== Contemporary Interpretations of ''Onarigami'' == 
The religion is kept alive in varying degrees depending on the village and its inhabitants. Monica Wacker suggests in her article on ''onarigami'' that the ''nuru'', ''niigan'', and ''chikasa'' will continue to fulfill their religious duties, and that particularly colorful festivals like the Tanetori Festival will survive even if more serious aspects of the religion die out.
Towards the end of the last century, there has been a revival of sorts of the idea of ''onarigami'' and its relation to the identity of women in Okinawa. Many modern women are deeply immersed in traditional religious activities. They know about their important historical roles as important religious figures and that through this, early Ryukyuan women were involved in the politics of men. Of note is the Unai Festival that has developed recently. The power of ''Unai'' has been used for political gains today, including electing a female representative into the city council of Naha in 1987.

'''Pancha Tattva''' ([[Devanagari]]: पञ्चतत्त्व; [[IAST]]: ''pañca-tattva'', from [[Sanskrit]] ''pañca'' meaning "five" and ''[[tattva]]'' "truth" or "reality") in the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] or Krishnaist tradition refers specifically to the Five aspects of [[God]] or Absolute Truth.

==Background==
In Gaudiya Vaishnavism or Gaudiya Krishnaism these five features of God ([[Krishna]]) are believed to have incarnated on [[Earth]] as five people in the late 15th century, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Nityananda]]  Prabhu, [[Advaita Acharya]], [[Gadadhara Pandita]] and [[Srivasa Thakura]]. They famously spread the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]] mantra, and the practice of devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Krishna throughout [[India]].

==The Five Features==
* [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitnya Mahaprabhu]] is Krishna Himself, The Supreme Person ([[Svayam Bhagavan]]).
* [[Nitai|Nityananda]] is [[Krishna|Krishna's]] first personal expansion with a combined power of [[Balarama]]
* [[Advaita Acharya|Advaita]] Acharya is a combined incarnation of Lord [[Vishnu]] &amp; Lord [[Shiva]] ([[Harihara]]).
* Gadadhara is a combined incarnation of [[Radha]], [[Lalita (gopi)]] and Krishna's internal energy.
* Srivasa is Krishna's pure devotee and symbolizes devotion.

"I bow down to Lord [[Krishna]], who appears as a supreme devotee (Lord Chaitanya), as His personal expansion (Sri Nityananda), His incarnation (Sri Advaita), His devotee (Sri Srivasa), and His energy (Sri Gadadhara), and who is the source of strength for the devotees." ([[Chaitanya Charitamrita]] [http://vedabase.com/cc/adi/1/14/en Adi 1.14][http://vedabase.com/cc/adi/7/6/en 7.6])

==Pancha Tattva mantra==
Within the Gaudiya tradition a [[mantra]] formed from the names of the five members of the Pancha Tattva is often spoken or sung as a means of devotional worship or meditation (''[[japa]]''). Often this mantra is sung or chanted prior to the Hare Krishna mantra. It is believed by followers to be the most merciful mantra available in this [[Kali Yuga|age of Kali]].

'''Pedro Miguel Aráoz''' (20 June 1759 &amp;ndash; 18 June 1832) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] statesman and priest. He was a representative to the [[Congress of Tucumán]] which on 9 July 1816 [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared the Independence of Argentina]].

Aráoz was born in [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]] to Pedro Antonio Aráoz and Francisca Nuñez de Herrera. He studied in Tucumán, then was educated in [[theology]] in [[Buenos Aires]] at the [[Real Colegio de San Carlos]]. He received his doctorate in 1782 at the [[National University of Córdoba|University of Córdoba]], and was ordained in Tucumán. He became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Tucumán Cathedral, serving until his death.

Aráoz assisted [[Manuel Belgrano]] in the [[Army of the North]].
He was elected by Tucumán to the Congress and served in 1816 for the declaration. After the Congress moved to Buenos Aires, he resigned his mandate and returned to his hometown. He collaborated in local politics with his close relative, [[Bernabé Aráoz]], assisting in the 1820 formation of the [[Republic of Tucumán]] and serving as a legislator in the provincial assembly. He wrote the Republic's constitution and was the editor of the first provincial newspaper. After the death of Bernabé and the collapse of the Tucumán Republic, Aráoz played no further part in politics.

'''''Psilocybe atlantis''''' is a rare [[psychedelic mushroom]] that contains [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as main active compounds. It is a close relative of ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' and has been recorded only from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guzmán | first1 = G | last2 = Hanlin | first2 = RT | last3 = White | first3 = C. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2003 | title = Another new bluing species of ''Psilocybe'' from Georgia, U.S.A. | url = | journal = Mycotaxon | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 179–183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a pleasant taste and smell. 

While naturally rare it is often cultivated for its psychedelic properties.

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 2.5–4&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, [[conic]] to [[wiktionary:convex|convex]], and smooth to slightly striate, sometimes with a small [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The cap surface is pale brown to reddish brown in color, [[hygrophanous]], and bruises blue where damaged.&lt;br&gt;
Its gills are [[wikt:adnate|subadnate]], thin, and brown.&lt;br&gt;
The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 5&amp;nbsp;cm by .3&amp;nbsp;cm. It has an equal structure and is brownish with small brown scales, especially towards the base. The stipe also bruises blue where damaged.&lt;br&gt;
''Psilocybe atlantis'' [[spore]]s are 9 x 6 x 5.5 [[µm]] with a broad [[germ pore]].

==Distribution and habitat==
''Psilocybe atlantis'' has been found in grassy lawns and vacant lots in [[Fulton County, Georgia]].

The original find was made in Fulton County Georgia, growing in a patch of moss beside a 5 year old home whose lot bordered a wooded area within 50 meters of a tributary of the Chattahoochee river.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38581">The '''Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great''' was an [[imperial cult]] in [[ancient Egypt]] in the [[Hellenistic period]] (323–31 BC), promoted by the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. The core of the cult was the worship of the [[apotheosis|deified]] conqueror-king [[Alexander the Great]], which eventually formed the basis for the [[Hellenistic religion#Ruler cults|ruler cult]] of the Ptolemies themselves. The head priest of the cult was the chief priest in the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], and years were dated after the incumbents ([[eponym]]ous priests).

== Background ==
Following the [[death of Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, his [[Macedonian empire|empire]] fell apart in the [[wars of the Diadochi]] (his generals, the [[Diadochi]] or "Successors"). One of them, Ptolemy, son of Lagos, secured rule of Egypt and made it the base for his own imperial ambitions. To legitimize his rule as [[Ptolemy I Soter]] ({{reign|323|282}} BC), he relied, like the other Diadochi, not only on the [[right of conquest]], but also on the supposed legitimate succession of Alexander. Not only did Ptolemy I portray himself as Alexander's closest friend in his historical work, but in 321 BC, he seized his body while Alexander's funeral [[procession]] was on its way to Macedon from [[Babylon]], and brought it to the Egyptian capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. This claim was particularly useful in Egypt, where Alexander had been greeted as liberator from the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (the so-called "[[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-seventh Dynasty]]") and had been enthroned as [[Pharaoh]] and son of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Ammon-Ra]], receiving divine honours. During his stay in Egypt, Alexander had also laid the foundations for the city of [[Alexandria]], which became the main Greek colony and capital of the country.

In the new Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Hellenic element ([[ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] and people from Greek [[polis|city-states]]), to which the Ptolemaic dynasty itself belonged, formed the ruling class which succeeded the native Egyptian Pharaohs. While [[sacred king]]ship had long been practised in Egypt and other eastern nations, it was almost unheard-of in the Greek world. Driven by his unprecedented conquests, in the last year of his life Alexander had demanded even from his Greek subjects to be treated as a living god (''[[apotheosis|apotheōsis]]''). This was accepted only reluctantly, and often rejected outright, by the Greek cities, but Alexander's prolific founding of cities alone secured for him a divine status there, since Greek cities traditionally rendered their founder ({{lang-gr|κτίστης|ktistēs}}) divine honours. When Ptolemy took over Egypt, he incorporated the heritage of Alexander into his own propaganda to support the claims of his own dynasty. As part of this effort, Alexander was elevated from a simple patron god of Alexandria to the status of a state god for the Greek populations of the entire Ptolemaic empire, even beyond the confines of Egypt.

== Alexander as the chief god of the Ptolemies ==
During the early Ptolemaic dynasty ({{circa|290 BC}}), Ptolemy I began the construction of the [[Tomb of Alexander the Great]] in Alexandria (the {{lang|grc|σῆμα}}, ''sēma'', ), and appointed a priest ({{lang|grc|ἱερεύς}}, ''hiereus'') to conduct religious rites there. This office quickly advanced to become the highest priesthood in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its prominence underscored by its eponymous character, i.e., each [[regnal year]] was named after the incumbent priest, and documents, whether in [[Koine Greek]] or [[Egyptian language#Demotic and Coptic|Demotic Egyptian]], where dated after him. The first priest of Alexander was no less a figure than Ptolemy I's brother [[Menelaus (son of Lagus)|Menelaos]]. The tenure lasted one year, but under Ptolemy I, the priests apparently held the post for longer tenures, while under his successors, with few exceptions, the tenures were reduced to a single year.

Under [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ({{reign|282|246}} BC), Alexander's body was brought to the ''sēma'', and, in contrast to the usual Greek custom of [[cremation]], was entombed in a magnificent golden [[sarcophagus]], which was eventually replaced by a transparent glass coffin to display his preserved body. Not only did the presence of Alexander's body in the Ptolemaic capital enhance the dynasty's prestige, but it also became one of the main attractions and pilgrimage sites in the ancient Mediterranean. Even [[Roman emperors]] made the journey to Alexandria to visit the great conqueror's tomb. 

The Ptolemies assigned the deified Alexander a prominent place in the [[Greek pantheon]], associating him with the [[Twelve Olympians]] like [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Accordingly, in documents Alexander was referred to simply by his name, as the epithet ''theos'' ("god") was regarded as superfluous.

== The Ptolemies as temple-sharing gods ==
While Ptolemy I Soter founded the imperial cult of Alexander, his son and successor Ptolemy II completed its connection to the ruler cult around the reigning dynasty itself. The cult of the Ptolemies began in 283/2 BC, when the deceased parents of Ptolemy II were deified as the "Saviour Gods" (θεοὶ σωτῆρες, ''theoi sōtēres''). Statues of the deified couple were installed in the Temple of Alexander, and the priest of the Alexander cult took over the rites for the deified Ptolemies as well. With this gesture, the Ptolemies underlined the superior position of Alexander, and their own subordination to him as "temple-sharing gods" ({{lang|grc|σύνναοι θεοί}}, ''synnanoi theoi''). Alexander remained the main recipient of rituals and sacrifices, with the Ptolemies only partaking in them.

The elevation of Alexander over the Ptolemies, and their connection to him, was further deepened through the expansion of the cult. Thus in 269 BC, the female priestly office of "basket bearer" (''[[kanephoros|kanēphóros]]'') for the "Sibling Goddess" (''thea adelphos'') [[Arsinoe II]] was established, followed in 211 BC by the "prize-bearer" priestess (''athlophoros'') in honour of the "Benefactor Goddess" (''thea euergetis''), [[Berenice II of Egypt|Berenice II]], and in 199 BC by a priestess for the "Father-Loving Goddess" (''thea philopatōr''), [[Arsinoe III of Egypt|Arsinoe III]]. All these priesthoods were subordinate to the priest of Alexander.

[[Cleopatra III of Egypt|Cleopatra III]] added three further female priesthoods for her own personal cult as "Benefactor and Mother-Loving Goddess" (''thea euergetis philometōr''): the "sacred foal" (''hieros pōlos''), the "crown bearer" (''stephanēphoros''), and the "light bearer" (''phōsphoros'').

The concept of "temple-sharing gods" was underlined under [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] ({{reign|221|204}} BC), who translated the remains of the Ptolemies and their consorts—unlike Alexander, they had been cremated and kept in urns—to the ''sēma''.

== Union of the priesthood to the royal title ==
Ptolemy, son of Castor, is the last priest of Alexander known by name, before the position was merged into the royal office. Since the priesthood of Alexander is first attested in the royal titulature in the second year of the joint reign of [[Ptolemy IX]] and [[Cleopatra III]] (116/115 BC), it is unclear whether the merge of the offices took place in the last two years of [[Ptolemy VII]]'s rule, or with the accession of his successors. It is possible that the merger was done at the initiative of Ptolemy IX, as part of an effort to emphasize his precedence over his co-ruling mother, Cleopatra III. As such, the office changed its role and character, from an eponymous priesthood to a propaganda tool: unlike the royal office, which was increasingly shared among siblings or other family members from the early 2nd century BC on, the priesthood of Alexander was indivisible. This must have appealed to Ptolemy IX, eager to set himself apart from his mother, who he hated and who had begun her own priestly cult around her own person.

This new role of the priesthood of Alexander can be traced in later reigns as well. In the first months of 112/111 BC, an ordinary citizen, Artemidorus, occupied the office. He was probably a partisan of Cleopatra III, who had succeeded to temporarily evict her son from Alexandria. As women could not occupy a supreme priesthood in the Greek world, she had to content herself with placing one of her supporters in the post, as a public sign of her new dominance. After Artemidorus, however, the name of Ptolemy IX was subsequently added in the papyrus, which means that he managed to return to Alexandria in the same year.

In 107 BC, Cleopatra III managed to expel Ptolemy IX for good from Alexandria, and raised her second son, [[Ptolemy X]], to the throne as her co-ruler and priest of Alexander. As the inter-dynastic rivalry continued, however, in 105 BC she finally decided to assume the priesthood herself, to underline her precedence. Cleopatra probably intended this arrangement to be permanent, but her blatant violation of Greek norms in assuming the priesthood must have damaged her image among the Greeks. The last years of her reign were taken up with her persistent conflict with Ptolemy IX, until she died in 101 BC, probably following an assassination attempt by Ptolemy IX, whereupon Ptolemy X became sole ruler. The priestly and royal offices remained united under Ptolemy X and his successors, although the priestly title was rarely mentioned in the papyri, as the loss of its eponymous character rendered it irrelevant for dating purposes.

The '''Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Palestrina''', (Lat:''Diocesis Praenestina''), is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[suburbicarian diocese]] centered on the [[comune]] of [[Palestrina]] in Italy.

The current Bishop of Palestrina is [[Domenico Sigalini]], who from 3 November 2010, until 5 April 2014, was also appointed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to be the general ecclesiastical assistant of Italian [[Catholic Action]].

==History==
{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

Palestrina was looted in 1473.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Gregorovius, ''A History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages''  [https://archive.org/details/p1historyofcityofr07greg Volume VII. part 1] (London: Bell 1900), pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, the comune of Palestrina was the family territory of a number of Italian noble families including the [[Barberini]], [[Colonna]] and [[d'Este]] families (which regularly intermarried). Members of these families are represented throughout the list of diocese [[Bishop]]s, especially between 1600 and 1800. Barberini [[Pope Urban VIII]] appointed a number of relatives and close supporters to the Palestrina diocese and governmental positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Sailaifengye''' ({{zh|s=赛莱菲耶}}) mean Salafiyah (Salafi) in [[China]]. The sect is part of the [[Salafi Movement]] which was founded a few hundred years ago.

== History ==

The importer Ma Debao (1867–1977), when he undertook the [[Hajj]], was influenced by the [[Salafi movement]] in [[Mecca]]. Upon his return to [[China]] he began to preach the Salafi ideology. The movement criticizes innovative Islam. It opposes new movements which it believes are against the Sunnah.It opposes the influence of no-sunna Chinese culture on [[Islam]]. The sect was firstly import in Hezhou of Gansu province but now spread in many places notably Ningxia, Qinghai, Yunnan, Tianjing with support of Saudi religious organizations.&lt;ref name=MIC&gt;[http://www.islamichina.com/sects-a-legal-schools.html Sects And Legal Schools Represented By Muslims In China]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HC&gt;{{cite book|url={{google book|plainurl=y|id=hUEswLE4SWUC|page=72}} |title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|p=72|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing promoted Salafism as the main form of Islam. But it was opposed by a number of [[Hui people|Hui]] [[Islam in China|Muslim sects]] such as the [[Gedimu]], Sufi [[Ma Laichi|Khafiya]] and [[Jahriyya]], to the extent that even the fundamentalist [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan) Chinese sect, founded by [[Ma Wanfu]] after Salafi inspiration, condemned Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing as heretics. They were branded traitors and Wahhabi teachings were deemed as heresy by the [[Yihewani]] leaders.&lt;ref name=HC/&gt;

The [[Kuomintang]] Sufi Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]], who backed the Yihewani (Ikhwan) Muslims, persecuted the Salafis and forced them into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalists; they considered the Salafiyya to be "heterodox" (''xie jiao'') and people who followed foreigners' teachings (''waidao''). After the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] took power, Salafis were allowed to worship openly again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Barry M. |last=Rubin |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=wEih57-GWQQC|page=79}} |p=79|title=Guide to Islamist Movements|year=2000|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=0-7656-1747-1|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among Hui Salafis and Uyghur Salafis, there is little coordination or cooperation and the two take totally different political agendas, with the Hui Salafists content to carry out their own teachings and remain politically neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mouqawamahmusic.net/chinese-salafism-and-the-saudi-connection/|title=Chinese Salafism and the Saudi Connection|last1=al-Sudairi|first1=Mohammed|last2=|first2=|date=October 28, 2014|website=Mouqawamah Music|publisher=|access-date=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022162112/http://mouqawamahmusic.net/chinese-salafism-and-the-saudi-connection/|archivedate=October 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/10/chinese-salafism-and-the-saudi-connection/ |title=Chinese Salafism and the Saudi Connection |last1=al-Sudairi |first1=Mohammed  |last2= |first2= |date=October 23, 2014|newspaper=

There are two sets of Buddhist caves in two different places taking the name of Shana (or Sana) caves. 

The Shana Dungar Buddhist Caves or simply called as Sana Buddhist Caves are located in Shana Vankiya in Una Taluk, [[Gir Somnath district]] of [[Gujarat]], (which was recently carved out of Junagadh district), bordering with Rajula Taluk of Amreli district.  Vankiya is located which is located 28 km far, north-easterly to [[Una, Gujarat|Una]] town, about 38km south-easterly to [[Tulsishyam]] and 35km west of [[Rajula]].&lt;ref name=Sagar&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagar|first=Krishna Chandra|title=Foreign influence on ancient India|year=1992|publisher=Northern Book Centre|location=New Delhi|isbn=8172110286|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=%22sana+caves+near+una%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3bHCVLWneh&amp;sig=Uvse6vBTAYxTvVIRWFTQqYQDK3Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1S-jUvHHGYWQrQeR6YDIAg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sana%20caves%20near%20una%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another set of Sana Buddhist Caves in Veraval - Somnath region, which is also located in the newly former Gir Somnath district. These caves are simply called as ancient Buddhist caves of Prabhas Patan, and not so much as Sana caves. Nonetheless, information about these caves has gotten mixed up in the media. Sana Caves of [[Prabhas Patan]]are located about 7 km south-east of Vearval and 2km north-east of Somnath Mahadev mandir. Do not confuse the caves in Prabhas Patan with the majestic Shana Dungar Buddhist Caves at Vankiya, which are located about 105 km far, easterly from this place. 

==Architecture of Shana Dungar Buddhist Caves, Una Taluk==
The rock cut carving includes 62 caves spread over the hill consisting [[stupa]]s, [[chaitya]]s, pillows and benches. The halls of few caves are dome-shaped and pillared. According to historians, the construction of caves had started by the 2nd century BC in Western India.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Limited"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited|title=Sana Caves|url=http://www.gujarattourism.com/destination/details/6/267|publisher=Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have claimed that the architecture was constructed around the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name=Brancaccio&gt;{{cite book|last=Brancaccio|first=Pia|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|year=2010|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=9004185259|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=sana+caves+gujarat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DyLeJ82Xf7&amp;sig=Jyu5Po7EPPmMZqpF_SVREjG484I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4uyYUuO_BoWNrQe7kYDwDg&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sana%20caves%20gujarat&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few historians have claimed that it is hard to trace the date of the caves' architecture.

Sana Caves of Junagadh is a group of about 62 rock shelters which were carved out of soft rock. These caves were created in the period ranging between 1st century BC and 1st century AD and provided shelter to monks looking for refuge during the monsoons. Sana Caves are undoubtedly the oldest Buddhist caves in western India and boasts of rock cut pillars, stupas, benches, chaityas, viharas, a pillared hall and various domes. The shelters have been carved at various levels on and around a hillock. Some of the best archaeological symbols representing the preaching Buddhism can be seen at Sana Caves.

The largest cave, Cave 2, is named Bhima-ni-Cori and is considered to be similar to Ebhala- Mandapa, which is located at Talaja. This cave is approximately 21 meters in depth and has a width of 18.3 meters. The ceiling is 5.3 meters high and provides ample space to tourists wishing to walk through them. It also has six pillars which are located between the pilasters in front. One of the pillars depicts unique features of a concave neck between the drum and the dome.

Cave 26 and Cave 13 are different from the others. They have long verandahs with simple pillars resting on raised basements. These function as a support system for the beams above. The monasteries are also exquisitely designed with pillared verandahs which usually contain up to 4 cells at the back. The presence of benches around the hall is also an important feature of these caves.

The layout of Cave 48 is very different from the rest. It contains two halls of different dimensions. These halls contain benches around their perimeter. Most of the caves were carved at different heights and levels in the spur and could be approached by simple stairs cut into the rock. The presence of multiple tanks in this group of caves bears evidence to the importance given to water harvesting. With rock cut walls present on three sides and an oblong mouth on the other, these tanks were perfect for retaining water during the bleaker seasons. This architectural design has also been noticed in the Kanheri caves near Mumbai in Maharashtra.

These caves are distinctive in nature and are marked by their austere and simplistic designs. Most tourists notice a complete absence of engravings and ornate carvings—which are present in most of the other Buddhist caves in Gujarat. The caves also contain three chaitya grihas, which possess apsidal walls and flat ceilings. These caves are oft visited by tourists looking for deeper insights into the art forms and architectural designs of the Buddhist period. The caves are a focal point of interest for scholars, researchers and students too. A walk through Sana Caves takes you to exciting viharas, which refers to pillared verandahs containing one or two cells. These cells have rock cut benches inside them that were probably used for resting, sitting or taking shelter during the rains. Sana Caves is also known for its scenic beauty and provides a retreat to tourists wishing to enjoy the beauty and charm of the topographical landscapes beyond.

==History==

Footprints of Buddhism in Gujarat can be traced back to 270 BC. This was the period when Ashoka the Great ruled Saurashtra and was striving to spread the teachings and philosophy of Gautam Buddha across his empire. The ideology of Buddhism started gaining roots in various places in Gujarat, including Junagadh, Somnath, Velavar and the mouth of the River Indus—along with a host of other far flung areas in the state. The accounts written by Chinese scholars and travelers of the likes of Hiuen Tsiang and I-Tsing bear testimony to the spread of Buddhism in these parts of the world.

Buddhism started spreading across the nation and Gujarat in particular between the periods 27 B.C. to 470 A.D. Various archaeological remains and historical facts point to the development of embellishments and shelters in and around the areas of Somnath and Vadnagar. Sana Caves was the most prominent amongst them. These caves were located in the precincts of the Sana Hill, which is located 25&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Una and witnessed the rise and fall of a once flourishing monastery. With several water tanks and shelters to their credit, Sana Caves were constructed on the three slopes of an elevated plateau sloping down to the waters of River Rupen on the western face of the elevation.

==Architecture of Shana Buddhist caves of Prabhas Patan==
Buddhist caves of Prabhas Patan are simple in design and only two in number. These two caves are believed to a part of Buddhist vihara from the 3rd and 4th century AD. Each is about 8.7 m x 9.45 m, and 2.5 m high with four square pillars. An opening connects them at the rear. The eastern cave has an antechamber. Except for a row of niches on the outside there is no ornamentation. Buddhism, under Kshatrapa patronage was prevalent in the region during the early centuries of the Christian era.

'''Shaunaka''' ({{lang-sa|शौनक}} ''{{IAST|śaunaka}}'') is the name applied to teachers, and to a [[Shakha]] of the [[Atharvaveda]]. It is especially the name of a celebrated [[Sanskrit]] grammarian, author of the {{IAST|[[Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya]]}}, the {{IAST|[[Bṛhaddevatā]]}}, the {{IAST|Caraṇa-vyūha}} and six [[Anukramaṇī]]s (indices) to the [[Rigveda]]. He is claimed as the teacher of [[Katyayana]] and especially of [[Ashvalayana]], and is said to have united the Bashkala and Shakala Shakhas of the [[Rigveda]]. In legend, he is sometimes identified with [[Gritsamada]], a Vedic Rishi. According to the [[Vishnu Purana]], Shaunaka was the son of Gritsamada, and invented the system of the four levels of human life. Sootha mahaamuni narrated mythological stories to a group of sages headed by Shounaka mahaamuni.

{{IAST|[[Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya]]}} is attributed to Shaunaka who taught it to others in a satra-yajna (a 12-day very large scale collective yajna) held in [[Naimisha Forest|Naimisha]] according to Vishnumitra of Champa town, the commentator of {{IAST|Uvaṭa}}'s commentary of {{IAST|Ṛgveda-Prātiśākhya}}&lt;ref&gt;(English)Mangaldeva Śāstri, The Rgveda-prātiśākhya with the commentary of {{IAST|Uvaṭa}} by Śaunaka.; Vaidika Svādhyāya Mandira, Varanasi Cantt.,1959 ,OCLC: 28723321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Hindi)Virendrakumar Verma, Rgveda-prātiśākhya of Śaunaka Along with {{IAST|Uvaṭabhāshya}}; Chaukhambha Sanskrit Pratishthan,38 U.A., Jawaharnagar, Bungalow Road, Delhi-110007, Reprint-1999; (also published by Saujanya Books,Delhi, and by Benaras Hindu University)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaunaka had a prominent role in the epic [[Mahābhārata]]. The epic Mahābhārata was narrated to Shaunaka by a story teller named [[Ugrasrava Sauti]] during a conclave of sages headed by Shaunaka in a forest named [[Naimisha Forest|Naimisha]].

'''Shlomo ha-Levi Alkabetz''', also spelt Alqabitz, Alqabes; ([[Hebrew]]: שלמה אלקבץ) ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1500 – 1576) was a [[rabbi]], [[kabbalist]] and [[poet]] perhaps best known for his composition of the song ''[[Lecha Dodi]]''.

== Biography ==
Alkabetz studied [[Torah]] under [[Rabbi Yosef Taitatzak]]. In 1529, he married the daughter of Yitzhak Cohen, a wealthy householder living in [[Salonica]]. Alkabetz gave his father-in-law a copy of his newly completed work ''Manot ha-Levi''.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Manot HaLevi&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in [[Edirne|Adrianople]] where he wrote ''Beit Hashem'', ''Avotot Ahava'', ''Ayelet Ahavim'' and ''Brit HaLevi''. This latter work he dedicated to his admirers in Adrianople. His students included Rabbi Shmuel Ozida, author of ''Midrash Shmuel'' on [[Pirkei Avot|Avot]], and Rabbi [[Avraham Galante]], author of ''Yareach Yakar'' on ''[[Zohar]]''. His circle included [[Moshe Alsheich]] and [[Yosef Karo]], as well as his famous brother-in-law [[Moshe Cordovero]].

== Move to Safed ==
Following the practice described in the Zohar of reciting biblical passages known as the ''Tikūn'' on the night of [[Shavuot]], Rabbi Shlomo and Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]] stayed awake all that night reading. During the recitation of the required texts, Rabbi Karo had a mystical experience: The [[Shekhinah]] appeared as a [[maggid]], praising the circle and telling them to move to the [[Land of Israel]]. When they stayed up again the second night of Shavuot, the Shekhinah was adamant about their moving to the land of Israel. The account was recorded by Alkabetz.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to book, ''Magid Mesharim''&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in Safed in 1535.

== Thought ==
His works written in [[Adrianople]] center on the holiness of the people Israel, the Land of [[Israel]], and the specialness of the [[mitzvot]].  Alkabetz accepts the tradition that [[Esther]] was married to [[Mordechai]] before being taken to the king's palace and becoming queen, and even continued her relationship with Mordechai after taking up her royal post. The view of [[midrash]] articulated by Alkabetz and other members of the school of Joseph Taitatsak represents an extension of the view of the authority of the oral law and [[halachic midrash]] to [[aggadic midrash]] and thus leads to the sanctification and near canonization of aggadic expansions of biblical narrative &lt;ref&gt;Barry Walfish, ''Kosher Adultery? The Mordecai-Esther-Ahasuerus Triangle'', Prooftexts, Volume 22, Number 3, Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Among his printed works:
* ''[[Lecha Dodi]]'' (1579), a mystical hymn to inaugurate the [[Shabbat]]
* ''Manot HaLevi'' (completed 1529, published 1585) on the [[Book of Esther]]

'''Solomon Molcho''' ({{lang-he|שלמה מולכו}} '''Shelomo Molkho'''), or '''Molko''', originally '''Diogo Pires''', (1500 – 13 December 1532) was a Portuguese mystic and [[false messiah|pseudomessiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Eisen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7lsVajEtaQ0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22yosef%20eisen%22&amp;pg=PA216#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Miraculous journey: a complete history of the Jewish people from Creation to the present]'', [[Targum Press]], Southfield, MI, 2004, p216.&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[New Christian]]" who converted to [[Judaism]], Molcho declared himself the [[Messiah]], was convicted of [[apostasy]] by the [[Inquisition]] and was ordered [[burned at the stake]].

==Early life==
Molcho was born a [[Christian]] to [[Marrano]] parents in Portugal about 1500. His [[baptismal]] name probably was Diogo Pires. He held the post of secretary in one of the higher [[courts]] of his native country. When the [[Jew]]ish adventurer [[David Reubeni]] came ostensibly on a political mission from [[Khaybar|Khaibar]] ([[Peshawar]]) to Portugal, Molcho wished to join him, but was rejected. He then [[circumcise]]d himself, though without thereby gaining Reubeni's favor, and emigrated to [[Turkey]].

==Occult studies==
Molcho was a believer in [[dream interpretation]] who studied the [[Kabbalah]] with [[Joseph Taitazak]] and became acquainted with [[Joseph Caro]]. He then wandered as a [[preacher]] through Italy, Turkey and [[Ottoman Syria]], where he achieved a great reputation&lt;ref&gt;[[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''] Jerusalem 1962, p. 112 in PDF (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; and announced that the Messianic kingdom would come in 1540. In 1529 Molcho published a portion of his [[sermon]]s under the title ''Derashot'', or ''Sefer ha-Mefo'ar''. Going to Italy, he was opposed by prominent Jews including [[Jacob Mantino ben Samuel]], who feared that he might mislead other Jews.  He was given an audience before [[Pope Clement VII]], having gained his favor, as well as that of some Judeophile [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s at Rome. He was said to have predicted a certain flood which inundated Rome and various other places. After his many cabalistic and other strange experiments, Molcho felt justified in proclaiming himself the Messiah, or his precursor.

==Travels and execution==
In company with [[David Reubeni]], his mentor, he went in 1532 to [[Ratisbon]], where the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was holding a ''[[diet (assembly)|diet]]''. On this occasion, Molcho carried a flag with the Hebrew word ''Maccabi'', the four letters מכבי which also signify an abbreviation for Exodus 15:11 "Who among the mighty is like unto God?".&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Isidore; Bloch, Phillipp. "Molko, Solomon" in ''Jewish Encyclopedia''. Funk and Wagnalls, New York. 1901-1906.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor had both Molcho and Reubeni arrested and took them back to Italy. In [[Mantua]] an ecclesiastical court sentenced Molcho to death by fire. At the stake, it is claimed the emperor offered to [[pardon]] him on condition that he return to the [[Catholic Church]], but Molcho refused, asking for a [[martyr]]'s death (5th of [[Tevet]] 5290 [[anno mundi]], or what was ''anno'' 1530 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph]], [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6618 ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah''] Jerusalem 1962, p. 112 in PDF (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; His mentor, David Reubeni, was exiled to Spain, where later he died.

'''Stephen Samuel Wise''' (1874–1949) was an early 20th-century American, [[Progressive Era]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[rabbi]], and [[Zionism|Zionist]] leader.

== Early life ==

Wise was born on March 17, 1874, in [[Budapest]] in the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the son and grandson of [[rabbi]]s. His grandfather, [[Joseph Hirsch Weiss]], was Chief Rabbi of a small town near Budapest. His father, [[Aaron Wise]], earned a PhD and ordination in Europe, and emigrated to the United States to serve as rabbi of [[Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York. Wise's maternal grandfather, [[Móric Fischer de Farkasházy]], created the Herend Porcelain Company. When Wise's father sought to unionize the company, Moric gave the family one-way tickets to New York.

Wise immigrated to New York as an infant with his family. His father became rabbi of Rodeph Sholom, a Manhattan [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] congregation of wealthy German Jews.

=== Education ===

Wise studied at the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]], [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] (B.A. 1892), and [[Columbia University]] (PhD 1901), and later pursued rabbinical studies under rabbis [[Richard James Horatio Gottheil|Richard J. H. Gottheil]], Kohut, Gersoni, Joffe, and Margolis.  In 1933, Wise received an [[Doctor of humane letters|L.H.D.]] from [[Bates College]].

== Career ==
In 1893, Wise was appointed assistant rabbi of Congregation [[B'nai Jeshurun (Manhattan, New York)|B'nai Jeshurun]], New York City, whose senior rabbi was Henry S. Jacobs. Later in the same year, Wise became the senior rabbi of the same congregation. In 1900, he launched his career as the rabbi of [[Congregation Beth Israel (Portland, Oregon)|Congregation Beth Israel]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].  Typical of the activists of the [[Progressive Era]], he attacked "many of the social and political ills of contemporary America."&lt;ref name="maccoll"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacColl|first=E. Kimbark|title=The Shaping of a City: Business and politics in Portland, Oregon 1885 to 1915|publisher=The Georgian Press Company|location=Portland, Oregon|date=November 1976|oclc=2645815}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, concerning another rabbinical appointment, Wise made a major break with the established Reform movement over the "question whether the pulpit shall be free or whether the pulpit shall not be free, and, by reason of its loss of freedom, reft of its power for good";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E0DE103EE733A25754C0A9679C946797D6CF |title=Rev. Dr. Wise Surprises Emanu-El Trustees |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 7, 1906 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1907 he established his [[Stephen Wise Free Synagogue|Free Synagogue]], starting the "free Synagogue" movement.

Wise was an early supporter of Zionism, and his support for, and commitment to [[Political Zionism]] was very atypical of [[Reform Judaism]], which was historically and decidedly non-Zionist since the [[Pittsburgh Platform]] in 1885. He was a founder of the New York Federation of Zionist Societies in 1897, which led in the formation of the national [[Federation of American Zionists]] (FAZ), a forerunner of the [[Zionist Organization of America]]. At the [[World Zionist Organization|Second Zionist Congress]] ([[Basel]], 1898), he was a delegate and secretary for the English language. Wise served as honorary secretary of FAZ, in close cooperation with [[Theodor Herzl]] until the latter's death in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/SWise.htm |title=American Jewish Archives |publisher=American Jewish Archives |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise, joining U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], and others laid the groundwork for a democratically elected nationwide organization of 'ardently Zionist' Jews, 'to represent Jews as a group and not as individuals'.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788721,00.html Religion: Jews v. Jews], ''Time'' Magazine, June 20, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, following national elections, this Jewish community convened the first [[American Jewish Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]'s historic [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]].

In 1938, as president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise stated that adoption of the Alaska proposal in the [[Slattery Report]] would deliver "a wrong and hurtful impression ... that Jews are taking over some part of the country for settlement."&lt;ref name=Medoff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jstandard.com/index.php/content/item/A_Thanksgiving_plan_to_save_Europes_Jews/3377 |title=A Thanksgiving plan to save Europe’s Jews |accessdate=2009-02-24 |author=Raphael Medoff |date=November 15, 2007 |work=[[Jewish Standard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendship with Einstein===
[[Einstein]] found Wise's mixture of enlightened views and committed Zionism most agreeable, and this sealed their friendship when Einstein moved to the US. In a tribute to Wise on his 60th birthday, Einstein said "Above all, what I admire in him is his bold activity toward building the self-respect of the Jewish people, combined with profound tolerance and penetrating understanding of everything human."&lt;ref&gt;''An Einstein Encyclopedia'', Alice Calaprice, Daniel Kennefick, Robert Schulmann, p.77, Princeton University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Jerome Davis===
During the trial of sociologist Dr. [[Jerome Davis (sociologist)|Jerome Davis]], Wise stated, based on more than 30 years of acquaintance, that Davis had "never, never" been sympathetic to communism.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate = 16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public and charitable offices ===
In 1902 Wise officiated as first vice-president of the [[Oregon State Conference of Charities and Correction]].  In 1903 he was appointed Commissioner of Child Labor for the State of Oregon, and founded the [[Peoples' Forum of Oregon]]. These activities initiated a lifelong commitment to social justice, stemming from his embrace of a Jewish equivalent of the [[Social Gospel]] movement in Christianity.

In 1914 Wise co-founded the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). In ''A History of Jews in America'' historian [[Howard Sachar]] wrote, "In 1914, Professor Emeritus [[Joel Elias Spingarn|Joel Spingarn]] of Columbia University became chairman of the NAACP and recruited for its board such Jewish leaders as Jacob Schiff, [[Jacob Billikopf]], and Rabbi Stephen Wise."&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish co-founders included [[Julius Rosenwald]], [[Lillian Wald]], and Rabbi [[Emil G. Hirsch]].

In 1922 Wise founded the [[Jewish Institute of Religion]], an educational center in New York City to train rabbis in [[Reform Judaism]]. It was merged into the [[Hebrew Union College]] a year after his death.&lt;ref name="Preliminary Guide to the Stephen S. Wise Papers, 1905-1977"&gt;[http://library.gwu.edu/ead/k0002.xml Preliminary Guide to the Stephen S. Wise Papers, 1905–1977], Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Wise was one of the founding trustees of the Palestine Endowment Funds, Inc., along with [[Julian Mack]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rn0rAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=wise 66 years of benevolence: The story of PEF Israel Endowment Funds  1989 by Philip Goodman]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Federation of American Zionists]] (FAZ) was originally established, Wise was appointed the position secretary. After the organization transformed into the [[Zionist Organization of America]], Rabbi Wise fulfilled positions as both president and vice president during his lifetime.

Wise was a close friend of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who turned to Wise for advice on issues concerning the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, Wise had also acted a liaison to previous President Wilson.

At the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]], he was a delegate from New York; at the opening of the sixth session on June 28, 1924, he offered the [[invocation]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Report of the Proceedings of the Democratic National Convention, published by the Democratic National Committee (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Wise became chairman of [[Keren Hayesod]], while continuing efforts to bring the Reform movement around to a pro-Zionist stance. With the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s regime, Wise took the position that public opinion in the United States and elsewhere should be rallied against the Nazis. He used his influence with President Roosevelt both in this area as well as on the Zionist question.

In 1933 while acting as honorary president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise led efforts for a [[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933|Jewish Boycott of Germany]]. He stated "The time for prudence and caution is past. We must speak up like men. How can we ask our Christian friends to lift their voices in protest against the wrongs suffered by Jews if we keep silent? What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless it is challenged and rebuked. It is not the German Jews who are being attacked. It is the Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.ajhs.org/publications/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=230 The Anti-Nazi Boycott of 1933] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228012059/http://beta.ajhs.org/publications/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=230 |date=December 28, 2013 }}, Chapters in American Jewish History, [[American Jewish Historical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Urged by Wise to protest to the German government, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull issued a mild statement to the American ambassador to Berlin complaining that "unfortunate incidents have indeed occurred and the whole world joins in regretting them."

Wise, along with [[Leo Motzkin]] and [[Nahum Goldmann]], encouraged the creation in August 1936 of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in order to create a broader representative body to fight Nazism. Wise served as founding president of the World Jewish Congress president until his death in 1949. He was succeeded by his friend [[Nahum Goldmann]].

On November 24, 1942, after being informed by U.S. Under-secretary of State [[Sumner Welles]], Wise held a press conference in Washington, D.C. and announced that the Nazis had a plan for the extermination of all European Jews, and had already killed 2 million; it didn't make front-page news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southerninstitute.info/holocaust_education/ds10.html |title=Southern Institute |publisher=Southerninstitute.info |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190302/http://www.southerninstitute.info/holocaust_education/ds10.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|accessdate=March 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information was based on the [[Riegner Telegram]], a message sent to Wise in August 1942 by [[Gerhart M Riegner]], then representative of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Geneva, informing the Allies about the so-called "[[Final Solution]] of the [[Jewish question]]", the [[The Holocaust|German plan to exterminate the European Jews]], for the first time. Together with Nahum Goldmann, Wise spread the information about the ongoing genocide to Sweden and other countries by telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/972901368|title=The Swedish Jews and the Holocaust|last=Pontus,|first=Rudberg,|isbn=9781138045880|location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=972901368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise was an ardent opponent of plans to create a Jewish community in [[Suriname]]. In a letter to [[Keren Hayesod]] emissary Ida Silverman he wrote, "I personally believe, that Steinberg needs to be lynched or hanged and quartered, if that would make his lamented demise more certain."  [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]] being the co-founder of the Freeland League, a territorialist organization that was leading negotiations with the Surinamese government.&lt;ref&gt;[אַסטור, מיכל. געשיכטע פֿון דער פֿרײַלאַנד־ליגע. ניו ־יאָרק: פֿרײַלאַנד־ליגע, ז' 718, 1967.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war years, Wise was elected co-chair of the [[American Zionist Emergency Council]], a forerunner of the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]].

== Works ==
Wise translated ''[[The Improvement of the Moral Qualities]]'', an ethical treatise of the eleventh century by [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (New York, 1902) from the original [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and wrote ''[[The Beth Israel Pulpit]]'', among other works.  He was invited to deliver the annual [[Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Lecture]] at [[Union College]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[https://users.math.yale.edu/~bbm3/web_docs/steinmetz.doc  DR. CHARLES PROTEUS STEINMETZ MEMORIAL LECTURE SERIES]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Wise ==
Wise has been criticized by Dr. [[David Kranzler]] for his alleged failure to recognize [[the Holocaust]] prior to American entry into [[World War II]], the allegation that he dismissed early reports of the [[Final Solution]] as propaganda and obstruction of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/publications/ja/5763/5763fall/ORTHODOX.PDF |title=Review Essay, Orthodox Union |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Holocaust Victims Accuse'', Moshe Shonfeld asserts that Wise prevented the shipment of food packages from American Jews to [[German-occupied Poland]] due to fear that it would be interpreted by the Allies as giving aid to the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=6udBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Holocaust+Victims+Accuse&amp;dq=Holocaust+Victims+Accuse&amp;pgis=1 |title=Google Books |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allegation is also made by historian [[Saul Friedländer]], who writes: "In the spring of 1941 Rabbi Wise had decided to impose a complete embargo on all aid sent to Jews in occupied countries, in compliance with the U.S. government's economic boycott of the Axis powers (whereby every food package was seen as direct or indirect assistance to the enemy)... Strict orders were given to World Jewish Congress representatives in Europe to halt forthwith any shipment of packages to the ghettos, despite the fact that these packages did usually reach their destination, the Jewish Self-Help Association in Warsaw. 'All these operations with and through Poland must cease at once,' Wise cabled to Congress delegates in London and Geneva, 'and at once in English means AT ONCE, not in the future.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedländer |first=Saul |title=[[The Years of Extermination|The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939–1945]] |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''A Race Against Death: [[Peter Bergson]], America, and the Holocaust'', authors [[David Wyman]] and [[Rafael Medoff]] make a further allegation that Wise displayed a lack of leadership that hindered the Holocaust rescue attempts of others (mainly the [[Bergson Group]]'s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&amp;task=view_title&amp;metaproductid=1197 New Press]&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to squelch showing and broadcast of the pageant "[[We Will Never Die]]", which sought to bring attention to the plight of Jews in Europe.

"'''Sun of Unclouded Righteousness'''" is a little-known 1758 Christian hymn written by [[Charles Wesley]], the brother of [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]].&lt;ref name=h /&gt; It was written as an [[intercessory hymn]] praying for the salvation of Muslims and calls for their conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name=j /&gt;  It had fallen out of use by around 1880.&lt;ref name=hymnary/&gt;

== History ==
[[Charles Wesley]] had a history of encouraging people to pray for the salvation of a variety of people.&lt;ref name=j&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles |last=Fenner |url=http://jenkins.sbts.edu/2017/02/27/charles-wesleys-hymn-of-intercession-for-arabs/ |title=Charles Wesley’s Hymn of Intercession for Arabs |publisher=Southern Baptist Theological Seminary |date=2017-02-27 |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote "Sun of Unclouded Righteousness" with the subtitle of "For the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]" or "For the Mahometans".&lt;ref name=imp&gt;{{cite book | first =Jeffrey | last =Richards  | title =Imperialism and Music: Britain 1876–1953 | publisher = Manchester University Press | edition =   | year = 2001 | isbn = 0719061431 |page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1758 in his ''Hymns of Intercession for All Mankind'' hymnal.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite paper|first=Michael A.G. |last=Haykin |url=https://swbts.edu/sites/default/files/images/content/docs/journal/49_2/49.2_Haykin.pdf |title=“For those who spurn the sprinkled blood!” Praying with Charles Wesley for Muslims |publisher=Southwestern Journal of Theology |format=pdf |date= |pages= 188&amp;ndash;198 |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended as a prayer for salvation of Muslims and reflected the prevalent negative view of Islam promoted by [[Humphrey Prideaux]] in Great Britain at the time.&lt;ref name=h /&gt; It was written to also accompany the [[Collect]] for [[Good Friday]] in the [[Church of England]]'s ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.&lt;ref name=h /&gt; The hymn's title was based upon [[Malachi 4]]:2 where the [[Messiah]], believed to be referring to [[Jesus]] by Christians, was called the "Sun of Righteousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Benjamin | last =Clark  | title =The Domestic Sanctuary: Being a Comment Upon a Portion of God's Word for Every Day in the Year, Etc | publisher =T. Allman | edition =   | year = 1847 | isbn = 1104577690 |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles and his brother [[John Wesley]] had read Prideaux's work on early Islam while in Paris, and John noted that no opponents of Christianity had hurt it as much as [[Muhammad]] during the [[Early Muslim conquests]]. The hymn refers to that conquest in the line, "The smoke of the infernal cave,/Which half the Christian world o’erspread"; the "cave" mentioned there is [[Jabal_al-Nour#Cave_of_Hira|Hira]], where Islam teaches that Mohammed received [[revelation]]. Muhammad is referred to in the hymn as "that Imposter" and "that Arab Thief".&lt;ref name=h /&gt;  Later versions of the third verse were changed to "E'en now the Moslem fiend expel, And chase his doctrine back to hell".&lt;ref name=mo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hymnary.org/hymn/CHPS1866/page/544 |title=A Collection of Hymns for Public, Social, and Domestic Worship page 544 |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hymn also engaged in polemics with regard to theological controversies of its day, namely the conflict between [[John Taylor (dissenting preacher)|John Taylor]]'s [[Unitarianism]] and Christians who held a [[trinitarian universalism]] perspective. The fourth stanza had always expressed the trinitarian universalism perspective; earlier versions of the third stanza ended with "The Unitarian fiend expel/And chase his doctrine back to hell" referring to Islam and its teaching, but also more explicitly to this controversy.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hymnary.org/hymn/CHUP1874/page/418 |title=A Collection of Hymns, for the Use of the People Called Methodists, with a Supplement page 418 |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hymn was, in the words of a commenter on it, "an implicit challenge" to send [[missionary|missions]] to those regions.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

== Later disfavour ==
"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness" largely stopped being published in hymnals around 1875.&lt;ref name=hymnary&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hymnary.org/text/sun_of_unclouded_righteousness |title=Sun of unclouded righteousness |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was still published in the 1879 ''[[Methodist Hymnal]]''.&lt;ref name=imp /&gt; Despite Wesley's intent for it as a prayer for unbelievers, the hymn characterizes Islam negatively and expresses the stereotype of [[Arabs]] as, in the words of one commenter on the hymn, "militaristic marauders"; these elements make the hymn an embarrassment to contemporary Christians interested in inter-religious dialogue.&lt;ref name=j /&gt;

== Lyrics ==

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sun of unclouded righteousness,
With healing in thy wings arise
A sad, benighted world to bless,
Which now in sin and error lies,
Wrapped in Egyptian night profound,
With chains of hellish darkness bound.

The smoke of the infernal cave,
Which half the Christian world o'erspread,
Disperse, thou heavenly Light, and save
The souls by that impostor led,
That Arab-thief, as Satan bold,
Who quite destroyed thine Asian fold.

O might the blood of sprinkling cry
For those who spurn the sprinkled blood!
Assert thy glorious Deity,
Stretch out thine arm, thou triune God,
The Unitarian fiend expel,
And chase his doctrine back to hell!

Come, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Thou Three in One, and One in Three,
Resume thine own for ages lost,
Finish the dire apostasy;
Thine universal claim maintain,
And Lord of the creation reign!&lt;/poem&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Tarutius''' or '''Tarrutius''' was a wealthy merchant married to [[Acca Larentia]]. According to [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of [[Romulus]]'', the keeper of  the [[Temple of Hercules]] challenged the hero to a game of dice with [[Hercules]] to receive a night with a beautiful woman and a fine spread and the god to provide the temple keeper with a valuable gift if the keeper was successful.

As Hercules won the contest, the keeper procured the services of Acca Larentia for the night and provided a fine supper. In the morning, Hercules suggested that she approach the first man she met on leaving the temple. Tarutius was the man whom she met and the couple ended up marrying. Tarutius was a wealthy, older man with a large estate and is often believed to be an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]].

Tarutius died shortly after their marriage, leaving no children. Acca Larentia inherited the estate and, when she disappeared, her will was found devoting the estate to Rome. This version is considered to be the basis for the full legal entitlement of areas claimed by Rome.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] referred to the legend in his book ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' as an example of how the pagan gods are supposed to have delighted in human sensual pleasures. In St. Augustine's version, Tarutius is held to be a younger man who Acca Larentia meets after spending the night with Hercules in a dream. Tarutius is held to have had kept Acca Larentia as his mistress for many years, leaving his estate to her on his death. She in turn leaves the estate to Rome in her will which is found when she mysteriously disappears.

'''"The God That Failed"''' is a song by American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]], from their 1991 [[Metallica (album)|self-titled album]]. The song was never released as a single, but was the first song of the album to be heard by the public. It was one of Metallica's first original releases to be tuned half a step down.

==Composition and recording==
Composer and lyricist [[James Hetfield]] described the song as "very nice... Slow, heavy and ugly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James|last=Hetfield|authorlink=James Hetfield|editor=Kitts, Jeff |editor2=Tolinski, Brad |editor3=Steinblatt, Harold|title=Guitar World Presents Metallica|pages=18–19|year=1997|publisher=Music Content Developers|location=Wayne, NJ|isbn=0-7935-8079-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] recalls the inception of his solo in the song: "I had this whole thing worked out, but it didn't fit because the lead was too bluesy for the song, which is characterized by real heavy riffing and chording."&lt;ref name="Kitts"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kirk|last=Hammett|authorlink=Kirk Hammett|editor=Kitts, Jeff |editor2=Tolinski, Brad |editor3=Steinblatt, Harold|title=Guitar World Presents Metallica|pages=18|year=1997|publisher=Music Content Developers|location=Wayne, NJ|isbn=0-7935-8079-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hammett, he and producer Bob Rock worked out his guitar solo on the song. Together they composed a melody to which Hammett wanted to add harmony. The producer suggested that this would make the song sound too "pretty", and instead recommended playing the melody an [[octave]] higher. The final guitar solo was put together from over a dozen performances by the guitarist during the recording of the album. Hammett calls the resulting work one of his favorite solos on the album.&lt;ref name="Kitts"/&gt;

==Meaning==
The central theme of the song is faith and human reliance on it, and of unrewarded belief in a God that fails to [[Healing|heal]]. The lyrics and song material were inspired by [[James Hetfield|Hetfield]]'s anguish on the circumstances surrounding his mother's death.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Sid|title=Metallica Metallica (The Black Album) Review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/8b8c|publisher=BBC Music|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died of cancer after refusing medical attention, solely relying on her belief in God to heal her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encycmet.com/songs/sbtgodtf.shtml "Song info - The God That Failed"], Encyclopedia Metallica.&lt;/ref&gt; Hetfield felt that had she not followed her [[Christian Science]] beliefs, she could have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ingham|last=Chris|title=Metallica: Nothing Else Matters: The Stories behind the Biggest Songs|pages=108|year=2003|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56025-536-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baylor University]] Assistant Professor of Religion, Paul Martens points out that the song has been admired by some [[anti-religious]] groups, such as the websites "Alabama Atheist" and "[[Internet Infidels|The Secular Web]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Martens|editor=Gilmour, Michael J.|chapter=Metallica and the God That Failed: An Unfinished Tragedy in Three Acts|title=Call Me the Seeker: Listening to Religion in Popular Music|pages=98|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|isbn=0-8264-1713-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martens notes, however, that Hetfield does not celebrate God's failure in the song, but instead blames God, through his mother's faith and death, for contributing to the meaninglessness of life.&lt;ref&gt;Martens (2005), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thuvaraiyam Pathi''' is described in [[Ayyavazhi mythology]]. The [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], the holy text of [[Ayyavazhi]], tells about a sunken land at about 152 miles either south or south-east to [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], with 16008 streets. 

This land also matches the sunken land, [[Kumarikkandam]] of ancient [[Tamil Nadu]].

'''Yosef Mizrachi''' ({{lang-he|יוסף מזרחי}}) is a [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]] [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[rabbi]] and founder of DivineInformation.com, an [[Orthodox Judaism outreach]] organization, based in [[Monsey, New York]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/about-rabbi-mizrachi/|title=DivineInformation.com – Torah and Science   –  Rabbi’s Bio|website=www.divineinformation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==

Yosef Mizrachi was born in 1968 in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After his mandatory military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] he worked in finance in New York City. In 1994, Mizrachi began dedicating himself to [[Orthodox Judaism outreach]], and in 1997, Mizrachi left his professional career and began learning and teaching [[Torah]] at Yeshivat Ohr Yisrael in Monsey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mizrachi discussed his [[Semikhah]] (rabbinical ordination) credentials in a January 9, 2016 radio interview with Zev Brenner. When asked if he has Semikhah, Mizrachi stated that he lacks such Semikhah which involves testing and is common among [[Synagogue]] rabbis. However, Mizrachi went on to explain that he has received certification in recognition of his Torah background by Rabbi [[Eliyahu Ben Haim]] qualifying him to be a rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Mizrachi |first=Yosef |interviewer=Zev Brenner |title=Talkline with Zev Brenner with Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi on Holocaust Denial |type=Radio interview, online audio.

But when I started to learn in Yeshivot, and I learn- taught 10 years Gemara in Yeshiva, I got a certificate after they saw my knowledge that I have more than 10 big rabbis including the Av Beit Din signed on it that not only I'm a rabbi I'm a very big one and I'm—. ZB: Which Av Beis Din, what's the name. YM: Rav Eliyahu ben Chaim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kiruv work==
Mizrachi founded a Kiruv organization in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/about/|title=DivineInformation.com – Torah and Science   –  About|website=www.divineinformation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides free [[DVD]]s, [[Compact disc|Audio CDs]], and [[MP3|MP3 CDs]], sponsored by donors. As of 2013, the organization has handed out thousands of these audio and video disks.&lt;ref name="RavMizrahiAbout"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Yosef|title=About|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/about/|work=Divine Information|publisher=DivineInformation.com 2013|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arutz Sheva About Rabbi Mizrahi"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Radio/Author.aspx/6260|work=Radio|publisher=Arutz Sheva, IsraelNationalNews.com|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZoomInfo Rav Mizrahi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yosef Mizrachi|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Yosef-Mizrachi/406585330|publisher=zoominfo.com|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizrachi offers an extended ethical audio and video lecture series, called "The Path of the Just",&lt;ref name="video-pathofthejust"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Rabbi Yosef|title=The Path Of The Just Series|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/category/the-path-of-the-just-series/|work=Divine Information|publisher=Irgun Kiruv - divineinformation.com|accessdate=2 June 2013}} (21 lectures á c. 1h30min each)&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[musar literature|musar]] text [[Mesillat Yesharim]] composed by [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]].

In 2001 Mizrachi opened a [[Kolel]] and a [[Yeshiva]] in [[Solomon Eliezer Alfandari|Alfandari]] Street, Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2002 a movie called ''Divine Information'' was produced by Mizrahi and Yuval Ovadia.&lt;ref name="mizrahiBio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mizrahi|first=Rabbi Yossef|title=Rabbi’s Bio|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/about-rabbi-mizrachi/|publisher=DivineInformation 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 2004, Mizrachi launched the "DivineInformation.com" website posting many of his video and audio lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Radio/Author.aspx/6260|title=About Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi - Radio - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In early 2014, before a lecture tour in [[London]], concern was expressed about statements by Mizrachi in his previous lectures relating to the behaviour of secular and religious Jews during [[the Holocaust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBSkWvVdnU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h41m23s | title=Manners - The Right Way To Behave (Section on non-religious Jews during the holocaust - at 1 hour 41minutes into talk) }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that [[Down's Syndrome]] and [[autism]] are "punishments for sins committed in a previous life" and among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/node/115021|title=Synagogue cancels talk by 'Down's Syndrome is a punishment' rabbi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jc"&gt;https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/synagogue-cancels-talk-by-down-s-syndrome-is-a-punishment-rabbi-1.52154&lt;/ref&gt; Mizrachi was criticized for his views while he explicitly maintains are "Torah sourced." His views also include lectures using [[Bible Code]]s to "explain" the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSxSBN_uJOc | title=Rabbi Mizrachi - Why Did The Holocaust Happen? Torah Codes, Having Faith in God No Matter What}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, at least one of his planned lectures in London was initially cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/115021/synagogue-cancels-talk-downs-syndrome-a-punishment-rabbi|title=Synagogue cancels talk by 'Down's Syndrome is a punishment' rabbi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jc"/&gt;

In December 2015, in one of his lectures, Mizrahi claimed that it is possible that only one million Jews died in [[The Holocaust]] as opposed to the well accepted figure of 6 million, since many of them were not Jewish according to Jewish law which requires a person's mother to be Jewish.&lt;ref name="JP2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rabbi apologizes for challenging number of Jews killed in Holocaust|url = http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Rabbi-apologizes-for-challenging-number-of-Jews-killed-in-Holocaust-439373|website = The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date = 2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizrahi was criticized by academics and Jewish leaders including [[Efraim Zuroff]], director of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], who said that he "made up history to suit an agenda."&lt;ref name="JP2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orthodox rabbi: Only one million Jews killed in Holocaust|url = http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Orthodox-rabbi-Only-one-million-Jews-killed-in-Holocaust-438890|website = The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also criticized by [[Berel Wein]] who stated that "It is too damaging a matter to be left unanswered and unrefuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbiwein.com/blog/post-1850.html|title=THE NEWEST HOLOCAUST DENIERS:  Rabbi Wein: Jewish Destiny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mizrahi issued an apology.&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHueaPhnA6g|title=Rabbi Mizrachi apologizes to Holocaust survivor|publisher=Yeshiva World News |format=Google [[YouTube]] |work=Official channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X55T2aD7IXA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1233|title=#1 Threat To Our Nation, Gossip, False Hate, The Media Murder Machine, 31 Violations Of Loshon Hara|publisher=Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi |format=Google [[YouTube]] |work=Official channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Times]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Times" -September 9, 2016, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Rabbi [[Ephraim Mirvis]] has spoken out against the travel plans of this "Jewish hate preacher"; and the UK [[Home Office]] has suggested that the [[Home Secretary]], [[Amber Rudd]], was considering banning Mizrahi should he apply to visit Britain.

A meeting with Dr. Katz and Rabbi Mizrachi concluded the controversy about the holocaust, when Rabbi Mizrachi met with the holocaust survivor. Rav Mizrachi publicly apologized to Dr. Katz, the other Jewish Nation survivors, and victims of the holocaust. Dr. katz told Rav Mizrachi that his apology was accepted chiefly because of the Rabbi's quick response to his invitation.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Mizrachi Apologizes To Holocaust Survivor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHueaPhnA6g&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, 16 prominent US rabbis issued an open letter about Mizrachi. They said that Mizrachi "reduce[s] complex issues to simplistic and misleading sound bites," and his assertions are "objectionable, and even dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-1.757552|title=U.S. Orthodox Leaders: Rabbi Who Said Fewer Than 1 Million Jews Died in Holocaust Is 'Dangerous'|first=Avital|last=Chizhik-Goldschmidt|date=8 December 2016|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter continued that institutions should be more "discerning" with the guests they invite.

'''Yugoslav Muslim Organization''' ({{lang-bs|Jugoslavenska muslimanska organizacija}}, ''JMO'') was a [[Bosniak]] [[political party]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. It was founded in [[Sarajevo]] on the 16 February 1919 and was led by [[Mehmed Spaho]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=L6ApcPGGyokC&amp;pg=PA97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lopasic, Alexander. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/194542 Bosnian Muslims: A Search for Identity]'', in ''Bulletin'' ([[British Society for Middle Eastern Studies]]), Vol. 8, No. 2, (1981), pp. 115-125&lt;/ref&gt; The party was a successor of Muslimanska Narodna Organizacija (Muslim National Organization), a conservative Bosniak party founded in 1906 during the Austro-Hungarian era. The Muslim National Organization was itself a successor of the conservative Bosniak "Movement for [[waqf]] and educational autonomy" (Pokret za vakufsko-mearifsku autonomiju) that goes back to 1887. In election campaigns the JMO did mobilize on religious slogans rather than Bosniak nationality, calling failure of Muslims to vote for the party as a sin. The party had considerable influence in Islamic religious institutions, and JMO came to dominate the political life in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].  The party appealed to Muslims throughout Yugoslavia, urging them not to migrate to [[Turkey]]'''.&lt;ref name="jmo"&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/soi/_Vol_5_1/_HTML/Sadkovich.html Sadkovich: Reconsidering Bosnia-Herzegovina&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

In 1921 JMO aligned itself with the governing Serbian parties. JMO wanted to achieve territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and demanded religious autonomy as well as right for the [[Sharia law]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Their demands were given to the Constitutional Assembly and as a compromise those demands were accepted and incorporated in the [[Vidovdan Constitution]] under the so-called "Turkish Paragraph".{{sfn|Zovko|2006|p=68-69}} The support of JMO was important to pass the new constitution. This alliance became short-lived though. In 1922 a new Muslim party, [[Yugoslav Muslim People's Organization]] (JMNO), was formed and overtook the role as the Muslim ally of the Serbian parties. JMNO did however fail to attract any major section of the JMO vote-bank. In 1923 the party founded the cultural organization ''Narodna Uzdanica''.&lt;ref name="jmo" /&gt;

JMO entered into a short-lived alliance with the [[Slovene People's Party (historical)|Slovenian People's Party]] and the [[Croatian Republican Peasant Party]]. After the alliance broke down in 1925, JMO found itself politically isolated and came under attack from Serbian paramilitaries. At one time the paramilitaries attempted to kill Spaho.&lt;ref name="jmo" /&gt;

In 1927 the party suffered some setback in the election. After the election JMO joined a Serbian-led government. At this time the profile of JMO shifted, as it began to stress that it was a Bosnian party, rather than Muslim or Yugoslav.&lt;ref name="jmo" /&gt;

JMO was banned by [[Alexander I Karađorđević|Alexander I]], along with other parties. [[Mehmed Spaho]] later rebuilt the JMO and joined [[Milan Stojadinović]]’s Serbian-dominated government in 1937. He resigned in 1939 to protest the creation of the [[banovina of Croatia]]:&lt;ref name="jmo" /&gt; he died a few months later and was succeeded as party chairman by [[Džafer Kulenović]]. The JMO dominated Bosnian politics until 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Donia, John Van Antwerp Fine, ''Bosnia-Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed'', C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers, 1994, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] by Axis powers, [[Ante Pavelić]]'s [[Independent State of Croatia|quisling Croatian regime]] received support from several JMO leaders, among whom Džafer Kulenović who served as vice-president.&lt;ref name="jmo" /&gt; Other JMO members supported the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] instead ; one JMO senator participated to the first [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] session in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Stevan K.

'''Ælthelfreda''' (also Ælthelthryth or Ælthelflæd) may have been the [[abbess]] of [[Shaftesbury]] at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium|second millennium]]. During her time as abbess, the relics of [[Edward the Martyr]], held in Shaftesbury, seem to have been translated from a place north of the principal altar to another spot within the sanctuary of the abbey's church. The translation was recorded to have occurred on 20 June 1001. This translation may have been done in response to Viking raids, which made the Anglo-Saxons believe that they needed to bestow greater honours on the relics of saints to gain God's favour; after the translation took place, the Vikings who were in [[Devon]] stayed where they were, and then returned to their base on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in the Early history of Shaftesbury Abbey, Dorset County Council, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaftesbury was one of several late Saxon churches established in Wessex around this time, along with Winchester Nunnaminster, Romsey, Wherwell, Amesbury and Wilton. In 1001 Ælthelred gave Bradford-on-Avon in wiltshire to the Shaftesbury nuns, to serve as a refuge for them and for the relics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=32| title=Gender and Material Culture: The Archaeology of Religious Women|author=Roberta Gilchrist|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1997|via=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/content?id=51T5dWbOREQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
