[[File:2007-Map-Avianflu-zones.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of the zones during the outbreak.]]
The '''2007 Bernard Matthews H5N1 outbreak''' was an occurrence of [[avian influenza]] in England caused by the [[H5N1]] subtype of [[Influenza virus A]] that began on 30 January 2007. The infection affected poultry at one of [[Bernard Matthews Farms|Bernard Matthews]]' farms in [[Holton, Suffolk|Holton]] in [[Suffolk]]. It was the third instance of H5N1-subtype detected in the [[United Kingdom]] and a range of precautions were instituted to prevent spread of the disease including a large cull of [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s, the imposition of segregation zones, and a disinfection programme for the plant.

The cause of the outbreak was not determined. However, it was considered significant that Bernard Matthews regularly transports turkeys and turkey products between the UK and its plant in [[Hungary]], and that the H5N1 strains previously found in Hungary, and those found at Suffolk, were effectively genetically identical.

==Background==

===H5N1===
{{H5N1}}
{{main article|H5N1}}
H5N1 is a subtype of the [[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]], the viruses responsible for [[influenza]] in humans and many other animal species.&lt;ref name=ICTV46.0.1&gt;{{cite web
| author=[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] | publisher= | year=2002 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/46010000.htm | title=46.0.1. Influenzavirus A | accessdate=2006-04-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called ''HPAI A(H5N1)'' for "highly [[pathogen]]ic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1", is the causative agent of [[transmission and infection of H5N1|H5N1 flu]].

HPAI A(H5N1) is considered an avian disease, although there is some evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ungchusak K, Auewarakul P, Dowell SF |title=Probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=352 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15668219 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa044021 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A risk factor for contracting the virus is handling of infected poultry, but transmission of the virus from infected birds to humans is inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ortiz JR, Katz MA, Mahmoud MN |title=Lack of evidence of avian-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among poultry workers, [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], 2006 |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=196 |issue=11 |pages=1685–91 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18008254 |doi=10.1086/522158 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poultry farming practices have changed due to H5N1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php|title=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=15 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013053617/http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php|archive-date=13 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down, due to fears from H5N1 driving demand below supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26238 |title=Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu |accessdate=29 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217215838/http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26238 |archivedate=17 December 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent outbreaks in the UK and rest of EU===
The outbreak was the third instance of H5N1 detected in the United Kingdom. The first outbreak occurred in October 2005 among exotic birds imported from Taiwan and South America at a privately owned quarantine facility in [[Essex, England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/pdf/ai-epidemrep111105.pdf "Epidemiology Report on Avian Influenza in Quarantine Premises Essex"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205044222/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/pdf/ai-epidemrep111105.pdf |date=5 February 2007 }}, DEFRA, 11 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aibs/bio/2006/00000056/00000003/art00002 "Bird flu outbreak in United Kingdom reveals global vulnerabilities"], JP Dudley BIOSCIENCE March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The second instance involved a dead [[whooper swan]] found to have the virus in [[Cellardyke]], Scotland in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4882946.stm "Swan tests confirm deadly virus"], BBC News, 6 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4898398.stm "Bird flu swan was from outside UK"], BBC News, 11 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A corresponding incidence on a farm in south-eastern Hungary was confirmed by the [[European Commission]] on 25 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n104242 "Bird flu approaching Romanian border"], FOCUS News Agency, 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==The outbreak==
Initial signs of the outbreak occurred on Tuesday, 30 January when 55 turkey poults died and 16 had to be killed because they were sick. At least 185 more died the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2007/2007-02-05-01.asp "Britain Culls 159,000 Turkeys in Outbreak of H5N1 Bird Flu"], Environment News Service, 5 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1 February that the deaths were reported to [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]]. The farm was sealed off while tests were carried out, on samples taken from the dead birds, at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]]. Another 1,500 birds died on 2 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23384160-details/Bernard%20Matthews%20took%2048%20hours%20to%20report%20turkey%20deaths/article.do|title=Bernard Matthews took 48 hours to report turkey deaths|date=2007-02-03|accessdate=2007-02-04|publisher=[[The Evening Standard]] (thisislondon.com)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524052223/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23384160-details/Bernard%20Matthews%20took%2048%20hours%20to%20report%20turkey%20deaths/article.do|archive-date=24 May 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 3 February 2007 the H5N1 causation was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vets work to contain bird flu (Video)|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_6320000/newsid_6328900?redirect=6328957.stm&amp;news=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;nbram=1|date=2007-02-04|accessdate=2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 3&amp;nbsp;km protection zone, 10&amp;nbsp;km surveillance zone and a restricted zone encompassing 2000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tests show bird flu is H5N1 virus|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6327193.stm|date=2007-02-03|accessdate=2007-02-03 | work=BBC News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070205042118/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6327193.stm| archivedate= 5 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the [[Culling|cull]] being completed on the evening of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=EDPOnline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=NOED05%20Feb%202007%2012%3A19%3A58%3A420 "Little risk for Bernard Matthews workers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602202528/http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=EDPOnline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=NOED05%20Feb%202007%2012%3A19%3A58%3A420 |date=2 June 2007 }}, Sarah Brealey, EDP 24, 5 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6337575.stm "Vet tests negative for bird flu"], BBC News, 7 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6334239.stm "Clean-up begins at bird flu farm"], BBC News, 6 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/12/nbflu612.xml "Farm hit by bird-flu to reopen"], Natalie Paris, Daily Telegraph, 12 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerged in a highly critical report from [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] that there was a series of biosecurity failings at the Holton plant, some of which were drawn to the company's attention in the past. These included "gulls were taking turkey waste to roosts on top of the turkey-house 500&amp;nbsp;m away" and "holes in the turkey houses could have allowed in birds or rodents".&lt;ref name=failings/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/birdflu/story/0,,2015217,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=11 "String of flaws found at Bernard Matthews plant"], John Vidal, The Guardian, 17 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] [[Minister (government)|minister]] [[Jeff Rooker, Baron Rooker|Jeff Rooker]] stated in a [[House of Lords]] debate on 22 February that the outbreak was "exclusively a Bernard Matthews Holton problem".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120904015254/http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2007/03/02/102056/avian-flu-outbreak-is-exclusively-a-bernard-matthews.html "Avian flu outbreak is "exclusively a Bernard Matthews" problem"], Farmers Weekly, 2 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hungarian connection==
The [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]], on 8 February, admitted that the outbreak may have been caused by semi-processed turkey meat imported directly from [[Hungary]], where the disease is prevalent, despite earlier in the week the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]], [[David Miliband]] assuring the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that there was "no Hungarian connection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=McCarthy |title=Bird flu may be linked to meat from Hungary, says Government |work=The Independent |date=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Matthews had been importing 38&amp;nbsp;tons of partly processed turkey meat on a weekly basis from their Saga Foods company, in [[Sárvár]], Hungary, to a processing plant next to the farm. Though Saga Foods lies {{convert|165|mi|km}} from where the recent Hungarian H5N1 outbreak had occurred, a [[Board of directors|company director]] admitted it was "possible" that some of the meat could have come from the exclusion zone. In response to this revelation, [[Her Majesty's Government|Whitehall]] expressed concern over [[biosecurity]] and whether any meat may have been distributed for human consumption in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=GUZPYQEQUVWB1QFIQMGSFF4AVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2007/02/09/nflu109.xml "Bird flu plant imported turkey from Hungary"], Charles Clover, The Daily Telegraph, 9 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2007 the Hungarian authorities started an investigation to try to establish whether there was a connection between the Suffolk and Hungarian outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L09621207.htm "Hungary investigates British bird flu link"], Reuters, 9 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February the investigation revealed that turkey products were still being transported, in both directions, between the plant and Hungary with [[European Union regulation|EU regulations]] being cited as the reason why a transport ban could not be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/12/nbflu12.xml " Britain is powerless to stop turkey imports"], David Derbyshire, Daily telegraph, 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungary link was dismissed by the [[European Commission]] on 12 February.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/12/nbflu512.xml "Bird flu at farm not linked to Hungary"], Natalie Paris, Daily Telegraph, 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the H5N1 bird flu strains found in Hungary and Britain were shown to be 99.96% genetically identical and, according to an analysis of the viruses by the [[Veterinary Laboratories Agency]] in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]], were almost certainly linked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,,2012525,00.html#article_continue "Tests confirm bird flu link to Hungary"], John Vidal, The Guardian, 14 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A leak from the Government's [[Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms|COBRA]] emergency committee indicated that the authorities were not aware of the Hungarian connection until an investigator found a Gallfoods delivery wrapper in a Bernard Matthews bin. This raised the possibility that the outbreak was due to a "third party [[abattoir]], Gallfoods in [[Hungary]], just outside the restricted zone". This abattoir might have been a middle man for contaminated poultry farming tools, feed, or product from within the restricted zone, such as a Bernard Matthews owned subsidiary in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23385313-details/Did+Matthews+try+to+hide+turkey+imports/article.do "Did Matthews try to hide turkey imports?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525021317/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23385313-details/Did+Matthews+try+to+hide+turkey+imports/article.do |date=25 May 2007 }}, Evening Standard, 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the incident and allegations of a cover-up, [[Bernard Trevor Matthews|Bernard Matthews]] himself stated on 14 February "I'm sorry - but this has not been of our making. There's been absolutely no cover up at our end. I've been upset about allegations that we may have withheld information. That is completely untrue."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=matthews%2D-not-my-fault%26method=full%26objectid=18623646%26siteid=89520-name_page.html "Matthews: Not my fault"], Victoria Ward, Daily Mirror, 15 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Matthews was given permission to resume its shipments of poultry between the UK and Hungary from 17 February even though Defra indicated that Hungarian turkey products remained the "most plausible" cause of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=failings&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1395903.ece "Bernard Matthews faces prosecution for failures at bird flu plant"], Philippe Naughton, Times Online, 16 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
By 8 February there was a lengthening list of countries that had banned the [[importation]] of [[poultry]] products from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] including South Africa, Russia, Japan, and many others but a spokesman for the [[European Commission]] condemned the bans as "totally disproportionate" and the British Poultry Council pointed out that exports were less than 9% of the level of domestic sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C02%5C09%5Cstory_9-2-2007_pg5_19 "UK poultry import bans"], Pakistan Daily Times, 9 February 2007 See also: [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1342148.ece "EU slams bans on British poultry"], Mark Bridge, Times Online, 6 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supermarket]] sales of Bernard Matthews branded turkeys halved after the onset of the outbreak as shoppers sought out alternatives. One of the biggest ongoing surveys of consumer confidence revealed that, by 13 February 2007, Bernard Matthews was the least respected and trusted brand in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/14/nbflu14.xml "Bernard Matthews loses sales"], Daily Telegraph, 14 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak the company confirmed, on 19 February 2007, that 130 workers would be [[Layoff|laid off]] for a period of twenty days due to a drop in product sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6376459.stm|title=Bernard Matthews staff 'laid off'|publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2007-02-19 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] then called for the government to provide compensation to the workers affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tgwu.org.uk/Templates/News.asp?NodeID=93155&amp;int1stParentNodeID=42438&amp;int2ndParentNodeID=89396&amp;Action=Display| title= Workers must be compensated for Bernard Matthews lay offs| publisher= Transport and General Workers' Union| accessdate= 19 February 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transport and General Workers' Union paid out hardship monies from union funds to union members, on top of any state benefits to which the laid-off workers were entitled and a one-off £100 payment from Bernard Matthews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Mike |date=April 2007 |title=T&amp;G union calls for more compensation for culled workforce after Bernard Matthews gets £600,000 for dead turkeys |journal=Personnel Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A row broke out on 1 March 2007 when it emerged that the Government were paying compensation to the company for the 159,000 culled turkeys while laid-off workers were receiving nothing. At £3.75 each for hens and £3.53 for toms, the payout was then estimated at between £537,000 and £570,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=edponline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=NOED02%20Mar%202007%2018%3A28%3A07%3A073 "Bernard Matthews to get £600,000 compensation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173234/http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=edponline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=NOED02%20Mar%202007%2018:28:07:073 |date=27 September 2007 }}, Sarah Brealey, Norfolk Eastern Daily Press, 2 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=anger-at-bernard-matthews---500-000-bird-flu-pay-out&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18695171&amp;siteid=89520-name_page.html "Anger at Bernard Matthews' £500,000 Bird Flu Pay-Out"], Louise Male, Daily Mirror, 2 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, though, the actual compensation bill came out at £589,356.89.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120802185714/http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2007/04/19/103117/bernard-matthews-gets-nearly-600000-in-bird-flu-compensation.html "Bernard Matthews gets nearly £600,000 in bird flu compensation"], Farmers Weekly, 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis cost Bernard Matthews at least £20&amp;nbsp;m in lost sales and costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=ENOnline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=NOED20%20Apr%202007%2008%3A54%3A57%3A410 "Fury over Bernard Matthews compensation"], Norwich Evening News, 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Antinoos-Agathodaimon Antikensammlung Berlin Sk361.jpg|thumb|upright|A Roman marble sculpture of Agathodaemon restored with an unrelated head, as "[[Antinous]] Agathodaemon", purchased in Rome ca. 1760, ([[Staatliche Museen]], Berlin)&lt;ref&gt;The torso of an [[Apollo]] was found in the [[Tiber]] at Rome and was restored as an [[Antinous]] with a head found separately; it was purchased through [[Giovanni Ludovico Bianconi]], about 1760; formerly exhibited in the [[Neues Palais]], Potsdam ([http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/dump/objekt/objekt_2181.html Arachne Projekt]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}); noted in [[Karl Otfried Müller]], ''Nouveau manuel complet d'archéologie ou traité sur les antiquités grecques...'' (1841:vol. I:298) and in Bouillon II:51.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''agathodaemon''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἀγαθοδαίμων}}, ''agathodaímōn'') or '''agathos daemon''' ({{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|ἀγαθός}} {{linktext|δαίμων}}}}, ''agathós daímōn'', {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"noble spirit") was a [[spiritual being|spirit]] (''[[daemon (mythology)|daemon]]'') of the [[vineyard]]s and [[cereal|grain]]fields in [[ancient Greek religion]]. They were personal companion spirits,&lt;ref&gt;Hor. Ep. ll, 2, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tibull. IV, 8&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to the Roman ''[[Genius (mythology)|genii]]'', who ensured good [[luck]], [[health]], and [[wisdom]].

==During the classical period==
Though little noted in [[Greek mythology]] ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] conjectured that the name was merely an epithet of [[Zeus]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', viii. 36. § 3&lt;/ref&gt; he was prominent in Greek folk religion;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Greek Folk Religion''. (Columbia University Press), 1981:33, 70, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; it was customary to [[Libation|drink or pour out a few drops]] of unmixed [[wine]] to honor him in every [[symposium]] or formal [[banquet]]. In [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', when War has trapped Peace (Εἰρήνη ''[[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]]'') in a deep pit, Hermes comes to give aid: "Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when, freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet ''Eirene'' and draw her out of this pit... This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the ''Agathos Daimon''."  A temple dedicated to him was situated on the road from [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] to [[Mainalo|Maenalus]] in [[Arcadia]].&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Citation

''Agathos Daimon'' was the spouse or companion of ''[[Tyche]] Agathe'' ({{lang|grc|Τύχη Ἀγαθή}}, "Good Fortune"; {{lang-la|Agatha}}). "Tyche we know at [[Livadeia|Lebadeia]] as the wife of the Agathos Daimon, the Good or Rich Spirit".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=371}}{{sfn|Harrison|1922|pp=355–ff, 543}}  His [[Numen|numinous presence]] could be represented in art as a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or more concretely as a young man bearing a [[cornucopia]] and a bowl in one hand, and a [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] and an ear of grain in the other.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=371}}  The agathodaemon was later adapted into a general [[Daemon (mythology)|daemon]] of ''[[fortuna]]'', particularly of the continued abundance of a family's good [[food]] and [[drink]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==During late antiquity==
In the [[syncretism|syncretic atmosphere]] of [[Late Antiquity]], agathodaemons could be bound up with Egyptian bringers of security and good fortune: a gem carved with magic emblems bears the images of [[Serapis]] with crocodile, sun-lion and [[Osiris]] mummy surrounded by the lion-headed snake Cnum–Agathodaemon–[[Aion (deity)|Aion]], with [[Harpocrates]] on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated in W. Fauth, ''Helios Megistos: zur synkretistischen Theologie der Spätantike'' (Leiden: Brill) 1995:85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Society for Nutrition''' (ASN) is an American society for professional researchers and practitioners in the field of [[nutrition]]. ASN publishes four journals in the field of nutrition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nutrition.org/publications/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been criticized for its financial ties to the food and beverage industry.&lt;ref name="EatDrink Politics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eng&gt;{{Cite web| last = Eng| first = Monica| title = Should Coke sponsor nutrition research?| work = WBEZ| accessdate = 2018-08-23| url = https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/do-big-food-companies-have-too-much-sway-over-nutrition-research/43df1b4d-259b-4d15-a85f-59b77232068d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1928 a group of United States biochemists and physiologists grouped together to form the first scientific society focused on nutrition, the American Institute for Nutrition. The Society held its first meeting at the [[Cornell Medical School]] in 1934.   The society was renamed the American Society for Nutritional Sciences in 1996.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/diglib/sc_diglib/americansociety/index.html | title=The Nutrition Society Celebrates Its 75th Anniversary | publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center | accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the American Society for Nutritional Sciences, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition (established 1961);  and the Society for International Nutrition (established 1996) merged to form The American Society for Nutrition (ASN).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

ASN currently (2015) has a membership of about 5,000.  It is one of the constituent societies comprising the  [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]], a non-profit organization that is the principal umbrella organization of U.S. societies in the field of biological and medical research.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center"/&gt;

In October 2010, the [[American College of Nutrition]] and American Society for Nutrition proposed to merge.&lt;sup&gt;[[American College of Nutrition#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2018}}

==="Smart Choices" program===
The ASN administered the "[[Nutritional rating systems#Smart Choices Program|Smart Choices"]] food labelling program,&lt;ref name"smart choice"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = MacVean| first = Mary| title = 'Smart Choice' food label: a sign of nutrition or marketing?| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was suspended in 2009 after criticism.&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Neuman| first = William| title = ‘Smart Choices’ Food Labeling Loses Support| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-24| date = 2009-10-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/24food.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate relationship concerns ==
The ASN has [[conflicts of interest|conflicting interests]] in taking funding from food industry marketing groups while providing unbiassed information on nutrition; these conflicting interests have caused criticism and concerns of bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = O’Connor| first = Anahad| title = Coca-Cola Funds Scientists Who Shift Blame for Obesity Away From Bad Diets| work = Well| accessdate = 2018-03-24| date = 2015-08-09| url = https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mustain_2015&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.nutres.2016.10.006| issn = 0271-5317| volume = 36| issue = 11| pages = 1183–1192| last1 = Rucker| first1 = Robert B.| last2 = Rucker| first2 = Michael R.| title = Nutrition: ethical issues and challenges| journal = Nutrition Research| accessdate = 2018-03-31|date=November 2016| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0271531716302081}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASN actions have also been criticized for being better-aligned with the nutritional advice of sponsors than the advice of the [[World Health Organization]] and other public health, public interest, and government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bellatti| first = Andy| title = OPINION: Industry-funded nutrition groups shouldn’t dictate health policy| accessdate = 2018-03-31| date = 2015-06-24| url = http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/6/industry-funded-nutrition-groups-shouldnt-dictate-health-policy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Mustain| first1 = Patrick| last2 = Mustain| first2 = Patrick| title = Science for Sale: Big Food's Influence on Top Nutrition Research Org| work = Scientific American Blog Network| date = June 15, 2015 |accessdate = 2018-03-31| url = https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/food-matters/science-for-sale-big-food-s-influence-on-top-nutrition-research-org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although human illness due to domoic acid has only been associated with shellfish, the toxin can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in many [[ocean|marine]] organisms that consume [[phytoplankton]], such as [[anchovy|anchovies]] and [[sardine]]s.  Intoxication by domoic acid in non-human organisms is frequently referred to as '''domoic acid poisoning''' or '''DAP'''.

== Symptoms and treatment ==
In the brain, domoic acid especially damages the [[hippocampus]] and [[amygdaloid nucleus]].&lt;ref name=uhm/&gt; It damages the [[neuron]]s by activating [[AMPA]] and [[kainate]] receptors, causing an influx of [[calcium]]. Although calcium flowing into cells is a normal event, the uncontrolled increase of calcium causes the cell to degenerate.

Gastrointestinal symptoms can appear 24 hours after ingestion of affected molluscs. They may include [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], abdominal cramps and haemorrhagic [[gastritis]]. In more severe cases, neurological symptoms can take several hours or up to three days to develop. These include [[headache]], [[dizziness]], [[disorientation]], vision disturbances, loss of short-term memory, motor weakness, [[seizure]]s, profuse respiratory secretions, [[hiccup]]s, unstable blood pressure, [[cardiac arrhythmia]] and [[coma]].

People poisoned with very high doses of the toxin or displaying risk factors such as old age and [[renal failure]] can die. Death has occurred in 4 of 107 confirmed cases. In a few cases, permanent [[sequela]]e included short-term memory loss and peripheral [[polyneuropathy]].

There is no known antidote available for domoic acid, so if symptoms fit the description, it is advised to go quickly to a hospital. Cooking or freezing affected fish or shellfish tissue does not lessen the toxicity.
New research has found that domoic acid is a heat-resistant and very stable toxin which can damage kidneys at concentrations that are 100 times lower than what causes neurological effects.

== Discovery==
ASP was first discovered in humans late in 1987, when a serious outbreak of food poisoning occurred in eastern [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=uhm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Bates, S.

Epidemiologists from [[Health Canada]] quickly linked the illnesses to restaurant meals of cultured mussels harvested from one area in [[Prince Edward Island]], a place never before affected by toxic algae. Mouse bioassays on aqueous extracts of the suspect mussels caused death with some unusual neurotoxic symptoms very different from those of [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] toxins and other known toxins. On December 12, 1987, a team of scientists was assembled at the [[National Research Council of Canada]] laboratory in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].  Integrating bioassay-directed fractionation with chemical analysis, the team identified the toxin on the afternoon of December 16, just 4 days after the start of the concerted investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Quilliam M.

== Possible animal effects ==
On June 22, 2006, a [[Brown Pelican|California brown pelican]], possibly under the influence of domoic acid,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13525699/ Possibly drunk bird hits windshield] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104110829/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13525699/ |date=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; flew through the windshield of a car on the [[Pacific Coast Highway (US)|Pacific Coast Highway]].  The [[phycotoxin]] is found in the local coastal waters.

Since March 2007, marine mammal and seabird strandings and deaths off the Southern California coast have increased markedly. These incidents have been linked to the recent and dramatic increase of a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Most of the animals found dead tested positive for domoic acid.

According to the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute (CIMWI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimwi.org/stranded_domoic.html Domic Acid Information and History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513065206/http://www.cimwi.org/stranded_domoic.html |date=May 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is generally accepted that the incidence of problems associated with toxic algae is increasing.  Possible reasons to explain this increase include natural mechanisms of species dispersal (currents and tides) to a host of human-related phenomena such as nutrient enrichment (agricultural run-off), climate shifts or transport of algae species via ship ballast water."

== In popular culture ==
In the TV series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' episode "The Red Team" (original air date January 31, 2013), a witness is intentionally poisoned with domoic acid.

In the "[[List of Get a Life episodes|Bad Fish]]" episode of ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'' (original air-date: February 2, 1992), Sharon and Gus get amnesia after eating bad shellfish, and Chris seizes the opportunity to convince them that they are his best friends.

Domoic acid poisoning may have caused an August 18, 1961 invasion of thousands of frantic seabirds in [[Capitola, California|Capitola]] and [[Santa Cruz, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Bargu, S. |author2=Silver, M.

'''CEN/CENELEC Guide 6: Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities''' is a document for participants in standardisation activities at [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] and [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|CENELEC]] that contains guidance for the creation and the revision of standards to ensure greater accessibility of products and services. The document is a "Guide", in other words, not a European Standard (EN).&lt;ref&gt;The abbreviation EN is derived from the German phrase {{lang|de|Europäische Norm}}. See the terminology used in [http://www.cen.eu/cenorm/aboutus/ar/ar07web.pdf Standards for a Better World. CEN Annual Report 2007] (in English, French and German), and the definitions in [http://www.cen.eu/boss/supporting/reference+documents/2008internalregulationpart2englishfinal.pdf CEN Internal Regulations Part 2: Common Rules for Standards Work].&lt;/ref&gt; The guide is identical to ISO/IEC Guide 71 and was adopted by both the CEN Technical Board and the CENELEC Technical Board, and published in January 2002. The adoption of CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 resulted from a European mandate to the European standardisation organisations, and the European Commission is funding projects to promote the use of the Guide.

A revised version was published in December 2014; it is identical to ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014. 

==Background==
In 2000 [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and IEC published the policy statement: "Addressing the needs of older persons and people with disabilities in standardization work".&lt;ref name="copolco"&gt;ISO/IEC: [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_iec_gen3_2000-en.pdf Policy Statement: Addressing the needs of older persons and people with disabilities in standardization work]. Consulted 2009-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A draft of this policy statement is available in an ANEC report: [http://www.anec.eu/attachments/Sn08-99.pdf Report from the COPOLCO WG on the Elderly and People with Disabilities]. March 1999. Accessed 2009-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy statement recognised the need to include the requirements of older persons and persons with disabilities during the development and revision of standards. The document stated that this could be achieved by following the basic principles of:
{{Quotation|
* Universal or Accessible Design
* consumer representation of older persons and people with disabilities; and
* relevant information exchange.&lt;ref name="copolco" /&gt;}}

The policy statement also recommended using ISO/IEC Guide 71, which would become available in 2001.&lt;ref name="copolco" /&gt; ISO/IEC Guide 71:2001: ''Guidelines for standardization to address the needs of older persons and people with disabilities''&lt;ref&gt;ISO &amp; IEC: [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33987 ISO/IEC Guide 71:2001]. [http://www.cettico.fi.upm.es/aenor/BTWG101-5(Sec)22.pdf Draft ISO/IEC Guide 71]. Accessed 2009-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2001 and has been widely accepted:&lt;ref name="ferguson"&gt;Anne Ferguson: "User Needs in Standards—Older People and People With Disabilities", in ''Handbook on Standards and Guidelines in Ergonomics and Human Factors'', edited by Waldemar Karwowski, Routledge/CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4129-9}}, p. 535.

ISO/IEC Guide 71 was also made available in Braille and was the first ISO publication that was made available in this format.&lt;ref name="ferguson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISO: "[http://www.iso.org/iso/fr/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref820 {{lang|fr|Le Guide pour répondre aux besoins des personnes âgées et des personnes handicapées est maintenant disponible en Braille}}]" / "[http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref820 Guide to address the needs of the elderly and disabled now available in Braille]", press release, 2002-04-29.

Accessed 2009-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Fair Trade Association|European Fee Trade Association (EFTA)]] gave to the three official European standardisation bodies [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|CENELEC]] and [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]]. The text of the Mandate pointed out that special needs were addressed in standards related to [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]], but that
{{Quotation|there is no formal structure or procedure ensuring that the needs of all consumers of all ages, with or without disabilities or special abilities, are catered for in the entire standardisation process. Individual standardisation committees do not spontaneously take into account safety and usability for people with disabilities and for elderly people, except if they draft specific standards for assistive products. If general standards for consumer products do not meet the requirements of these consumers with special needs, this means that many products and services cannot be used by a large part of the European population.
}}

Guide 6 is part of a wider framework that standardisation organisations can use to support the need for more [[Accessibility|accessible products and services]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/IEC Policy Statement 2000 "Addressing the Needs of Older Persons and People with Disabilities in Standardization Work" already provided principles and considerations for ensuring that the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities are addressed in the standardisation process.&lt;ref name="copolco" /&gt;

ETSI, the third European standardisation body to which Mandate M/283 was addressed, did not adopt CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 but continued using ISO/IEC Guide 71 as a reference document.&lt;ref name="ferguson" /&gt; Since 2008 ISO/IEC Guide 71 has a supporting document: ISO/TR 22411:2008: ''Ergonomics data and guidelines for the application of ISO/IEC Guide 71 to products and services to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40933 ISO/TR 22411:2008: Ergonomics data and guidelines for the application of ISO/IEC Guide 71 to products and services to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities]. Accessed 2009-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 CEN and CENELEC adopted the revised ISO/IEC Guide 71: 2014 as CEN-CENELEC Guide 6:2014. This new version of Guide 6 is freely available on the website of CEN and CENELEC.&lt;ref&gt;CEN; CENELEC: "[http://www.cencenelec.eu/news/brief_news/Pages/TN-2014-026.aspx NEW Guide for addressing accessibility in standards]", 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Committee for Standardization (CEN); European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC): [ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Guides/6_CENCLCGuide6.pdf CEN-CENELEC GUIDE 6: Guide for addressing accessibility in standards]. Edition 2, 2014-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 is a document for participants in CEN technical bodies: Technical Committees or TCs, Working Groups or WGs, Task Forces, Workshops etcetera. These technical bodies are responsible for addressing the needs of persons with disabilities and older people in the standards, specifications, reports or other documents that they produce.

CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 has three goals:
# to inform how human abilities (and disabilities) affect the usability of products, services and the built environment,
# to describe how requirements in standards relate to accessibility and usability of products and services,
# to raise awareness about the benefits of accessible design.

The Guide consists of a few introductory sections followed by 10 other chapters which are called "clauses". The most important chapters are described in the list below.
# Clause 6 briefly describes a process that allows technical committees to consider the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities. It divides the standardisation process into five steps; for each step, the Guide lists one or more issues that need to be addressed.
# Clause 7 and 8 provide tables that relate several types of clauses in a standard (for example, on packaging, the user interface and the built environment) to factors that need to be considered when addressing disabilities.
# Clause 9 provides descriptions of body functions or disabilities and their implications when using products and services.
# The last chapter is a bibliography that provides a list of resources for more specific guidance.

==Implementation and uptake==
In December 2001, CEN and CENELEC published CEN/CENELEC Guide 2: "CEN/CENELEC Guide 2: Consumer interests and the preparation of standards", which is a republication of CEN/CENELEC Memorandum 2 from 1977.&lt;ref&gt;CEN/CENELEC: [http://www.cen.eu/boss/supporting/reference+documents/cclcgd002.pdf CEN/CENELEC Guide 2: Consumer interests and the preparation of standards]. Accessed 2009-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This guide recommends member bodies of CEN and CENELEC to consult with [[Consumer organization|consumer organisations]] when developing standards that are relevant to consumer interests. CEN/CENELEC Guide 2 is older than Guide 6 and therefore does not reference it.

At the end of 2004, CEN adopted a "Mechanism on the use of the CEN/CENELEC Guide 6"&lt;ref name="Guide6Mechanism"&gt;CEN: [http://www.cen.eu/Boss/supporting/guidance+documents/gd+-+mechanism+on+the+use+of+guide+6/index.asp  Guidance - Mechanism on the use of the CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 'Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities']. Version 1 (January 2005). Accessed 2009-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CEN: [http://www.cen.eu/boss/supporting/reference+documents/bt+resolutions+taken+in+2004.asp#58_2004 Resolution BT 58/2004: CEN/CLC Guide 6 - Mechanism]. Resolution applicable as from 2004-12-14. Accessed 2009-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[ANEC (organization)|ANEC]] it took two years to develop this mechanism and its adoption followed after "intense lobbying by ANEC".&lt;ref&gt;Gottlobe Fabisch: "[http://www.iso.org/sites/ConsumersStandards/en/pdf/ISO%20Focus%20July-August%202005-2-%20Giving%20more%20to%20older%20and%20disabled%20people.pdf ISO/IEC Guide 71 - Progress in Europe]" in ''ISO Focus'' July–August 2005, p. 24. Accessed 2009-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation mechanism has several implications:&lt;ref name="Guide6Mechanism"/&gt;
# CEN technical bodies (such as Technical Committees and Working Groups) are responsible for addressing the needs of older persons and of persons with disabilities in their standards. They can do this by creating an optional working document that is not part of the standard. (Not every standard is affected by the mechanism.)
# When a standard is reviewed, the technical body can address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities if necessary. When creating a new standard, these needs can be addressed during the standardisation work.
# When appropriate, a technical body can add a statement in the foreword of a standard that states where the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities have been addressed.
# The primary reference document that technical bodies should use when addressing the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities in their work is CEN/CENELEC Guide 6.

CEN/CENELEC Guide 11: "Product information relevant to consumers - Guidelines for standard developers" was published in 2006 and refers to CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 for guidance on informational needs of people with disabilities and older people.&lt;ref&gt;CEN/CENELEC: [http://www.cen.eu/boss/supporting/reference+documents/cenclcguide11version1august2006.pdf CEN/CENELEC Guide 11: Product information relevant to consumers - Guidelines for standard developers]. Accessed 2009-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 CEN sent a questionnaire on the use of Guide 6 to its technical committees. The results showed that 3 out of 275 CEN committees used the Guide 6. ANEC decided to propose to CEN how to take an initiative to change the situation.&lt;ref&gt;ANEC: [http://doksenter.custompublish.com/getfile.php/545555.951.edspuwfqsc/15th+ANEC+Design+for+All+Working+group+meeting+18th+September+2007..doc 15th ANEC Design for All Working group meeting 18th September 2007]. Consulted 2009-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007-2008, NEN - the Dutch standardisation organisation - and Standard Norge carried out a feasibility study within the European Mandate M/371. One of the findings was that the implementation of Guide 6 faced some difficulties. For this reason, NEN and CEN started an action to promote the use of Guide 6, and in December 2007 NEN proposed the installation of an CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG Accessibility for All.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|nl|Nederlands Normalisatie-instituut}} (NEN), {{lang|no|Standard Norge}} (SN), {{lang|it|Ente nazional Italiano de Unificazione}} (UNI), {{lang|sl|Slovenski Institut za standardizacijo}} (SIST): [http://www.cen.eu/CENORM/sectors/business+development/value/project11smarthouseservices.pdf M/371 - Project 11: Smart House Services for Elderly and Disabled People - Final report 2008-09-30]. Accessed 2009-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ANEC (organization)|ANEC]] also supported the creation of such a working group.&lt;ref&gt;ANEC: [http://www.anec.org/anec.asp?rd=7747&amp;ref=02-01.01-01&amp;lang=en&amp;ID=226 Newsletter Number 94 – February 2008] (scroll down to "ANEC supports creation of CEN/BT Working Group ‘Accessibility for All’"). Accessed 2009-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of the CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG ''CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 Implementation Mechanism''. The working group held a preliminary meeting on 29 October 2008&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hodgkinson: [http://www.tiresias.org/research/standards/report_9.htm 9th Report on International ICT Accessibility Standards Proposed, Being Developed and Recently Published], 2 April 2009.

Accessed 2009-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and its first official meeting on 8 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;CEN: [http://www.cen.eu/CENORM/Sectors/news/archive/censectornews200903.pdf CEN Sector News], March 2009. The working group is here called: "CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG ''CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 Implementation Mechanism''". Accessed 2009-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CEN: [http://www.cen.eu/cenorm/sectors/news/archive/censectornews200904.pdf CEN Sector News], April 2009. The working group is here called: "CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG ''CEN/CENELEC Guide 6: Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities - Implementation Mechanism''". Accessed 2009-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the European Commission published a call for tenders on the subject of "Training of Stakeholders on consultations on standardisation"&lt;ref&gt;European Commission: Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities: [http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=626&amp;langId=en&amp;callId=173&amp;furtherCalls=yes Call for Tenders VT/ 2008/002: Training of Stakeholders on consultations on standardisation]. Published in Official Journal no. 2008/S 161-216866 on 21 August 2008. Accessed 2009-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of this call is promoting the use of Guide 6:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A guide for standardisers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities (CEN/CENELEC Guide 6), has been developed and is available since 2003 but its use is not widespread. The use of Guide 6 in a more systematic way can certainly help to address the needs of people with disabilities and older persons from a "design for all" perspective.&lt;ref name="callVT2008002Spec"&gt;European Commission: Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities: [http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=1331&amp;langId=en Call for Tenders VT/ 2008/002: Tender Specifications (PDF)].  Accessed 2009-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The use of the guide should be promoted by training two types of stakeholders in the standardisation process:&lt;ref name="callVT2008002Spec"/&gt;
# the traditional stakeholders in the standardisation process need training on accessibility matters and the use of Guide 6;
# representatives of older persons and persons with disabilities need training on the standardisation process (and CEN/CENELEC Guide 6).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1996">'''Cannabis in Saudi Arabia''' is illegal. 

==Enforcement==
Use and possession of [[cannabis]] is illegal in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Use and possession for personal use of any kind of recreational drugs is often punishable by imprisonment if caught. For Saudi citizens, there would generally be more leniency. Imprisonment for personal use of cannabis could go up to 1 to 6 months in prison with or without [[judicial corporal punishment|whippings]] for first time offenders. Imprisonment for drug dealing can range between 2 to 10 years in prison with whippings. Repeated dealing and or smuggling of high amounts of drugs usually result in harsher time in prison or even the death penalty, although recently executions are rare. Foreigners who use drugs might be deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1012.html |title = US Department of State – International Travel – Saudi Arabia |publisher = Travel.state.gov |date =  |accessdate = 2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[UNODC]] rated Saudi Arabia as third globally in its measures to fight drug abuse and trafficking.&lt;ref name="Maisel"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastian Maisel|title=Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab States Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Arab States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhJu2_8vMkMC&amp;pg=PA124|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-34442-8|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[Hashish]] in Saudi Arabia is largely trafficked by sea from [[Pakistan]]; a 2007 report notes that hashish sold for US$2,130 per kilogram.&lt;ref name="Leghari2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Faryal Leghari|title=Narcotics and Human Trafficking to the GCC States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_NWAAAAYAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Gulf Research Center|isbn=978-9948-434-27-6|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capital punishment]] is a legal penalty in the [[United Arab Emirates]], although it is rarely carried out. 

Under Emirati law, multiple crimes carry the death penalty, and the sole method of execution is firing squad. Current law theoretically allows the death penalty for [[treason]], [[espionage]], [[murder]], successfully inciting the [[suicide]] of a person "afflicted with total lack of free will or reason", [[arson]] resulting in death, acts of indecent [[assault]] resulting in death, importing nuclear substances/wastes in the environment of the State, [[adultery]], [[apostasy]], [[blasphemy]], [[perjury]] causing wrongful execution, [[rape]], [[aggravated robbery]], [[kidnapping]], [[terrorism]], [[sodomy]], [[homosexuality]], [[drug trafficking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=United+Arab+Emirates|title=The Death Penalty in United Arab Emirates|publisher=Death Penalty Worldwide|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joining the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/2/15/uae-sentences-four-to-death-for-joining-is|title=UAE sentences four to death for joining IS|publisher=The New Arab|date=15 February 2016|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/1/10/uae-sentences-jihadi-teenager-to-death-for-joining-is|title=UAE sentences 'jihadi teenager' to death for joining IS|publisher=The New Arab|date=10 January 2016|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although death sentences are frequently commuted to [[life sentence]]s. Overseas nationals and UAE nationals have both been executed for crimes.

==Notable cases==

In 1995, [[Sarah Balabagan]], a Filipino worker, caught the attention of many people living in the UAE. She was reported to have murdered her employer in his Al Ain house, although she has always maintained that she only killed him in self-defence after he tried to rape her. After the UAE president himself got involved, Balabagan was set free and had to pay compensation instead. However, she was deported back to her country and her right to remain in the country was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpun.com/aeju9510.htm|title=Judicial caning, Arab Emirates, Oct 1995 - CORPUN ARCHIVE aeju9510|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the [[Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates|Federal Supreme Court]] sentenced an Emirati [[terrorist]] woman, Alaa Bader al-Hashemi, to the death penalty for the [[murder of Ibolya Ryan]] and planting a "handmade bomb" in an Egyptian-American doctor's home in Abu Dhabi. The woman committed the crime in December 2014 and was executed at dawn on July 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/911760/uae-woman-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-us-teacher/|title=UAE woman sentenced to death for killing US teacher|work=Express Tribune|date=29 June 2015|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only time that a prisoner has been executed within such a short time frame and this is the one of the few cases of a woman being executed.

On 23 November 2017 Nidal Eisa Abdullah, the convict who raped and killed eight-year-old boy Obaida in May 2016, was executed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/courts/man-who-raped-killed-eight-year-old-boy-obaida-executed-1.2129225/|title=UAE man executed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scar has come to be seen as one of the most graphic demonstrations of the impact of the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

The term takes its name from the increased rate of thyroid cancer after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. 
The scar has also been referred as the '''[[Belarus]] necklace'''&lt;ref name=bulisova&gt;{{cite web|last=Bulisova |first=Gabriela |title=Chernobyl Revisited |url=http://gabrielabulisova.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Chernobyl-Revisited/G0000L1Q11Nk0tH0/I0000RsDOGWrwW9I |accessdate=16 September 2011 |location=Ukraine |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402125134/http://gabrielabulisova.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Chernobyl-Revisited/G0000L1Q11Nk0tH0/I0000RsDOGWrwW9I |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
or the '''Belarusian Necklace''',
in reference to the large number of thyroid cancer occurrences in the nation caused by the [[nuclear fallout]] from neighboring [[Ukraine]].
The use of the word [[necklace]] indicates its visual resemblance to the horizontal scar around the neck, but also contrasts the negative connotations of the scar with the beauty of an actual necklace.&lt;ref name=millar&gt;{{cite news|last=Millar|first=Sarah|title=A Chernobyl scientist recalls her years spent at the plant|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/961776--a-chernobyl-scientist-recalls-her-years-spent-at-the-plant|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
[[Iodine]] is required by higher animals to synthesize [[thyroid hormones]], which contain the element. Because of this function, [[radioisotopes]] of iodine are concentrated in the [[thyroid gland]] along with nonradioactive iodine. In the case of a nuclear accident, the radioactive [[iodine-131]] (I-131), which has a high [[fission product yield]], is released into the environment. I-131 concentrates in the thyroid, and may cause cancer.

Treatment of thyroid cancer may require [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alford|first=Erika Masuda|author2=Hu, Mimi I. |author3=Ahn, Peter |author4= Lamont, Jeffrey P.  |chapter=Thyroid and Parathyroid Cancers|title=Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach|date=25 March 2011|url=http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter05/article/10165/1402668|edition=13|editor=Pazdur, Richard |editor2=Wagman, Lawrence D. |editor3=Camphausen, Kevin A. |editor4=Hoskins, William J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The surgery may leave the patient with one or two horizontal scars at the base of the neck, dubbed the Chernobyl necklace.&lt;ref name=millar/&gt;

== Occurrences ==
After the Chernobyl disaster, incidents of thyroid cancer among civilians in [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Poland]] have risen sharply.&lt;ref name=bulisova/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nocera|first=Joe|title=Chernobyl’s Lingering Scars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/opinion/12nocera.html?_r=4&amp;emc=tnt&amp;tntemail0=y|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is estimated that many of those affected have the necklace, however, no statistical information of the affected population exists at this time. See the article on [[Chernobyl disaster effects]] for details.

After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], experts including Robert Alvarez and Natalia Manzurova believe that [[Japan]] faces a similar situation: its affected population may wear the Chernobyl necklace in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paschyn|first=Christina Maria|title=Will Women in Japan Wear the "Chernobyl Necklace"?|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2011/04/27/will-women-in-japan-wear-the-chernobyl-necklace/|work=Ms. Magazine Blog|date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:CHGA_logo.jpg|framed|]] --&gt;'''The Commission on HIV/AIDS and Governance in Africa (CHGA)''' was convened in 2003 by then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] under the leadership of Wilson Center Senior African Policy Scholar [[K. Y. Amoako]], then the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]](ECA).   

The Commission’s mandate was twofold: (i) clarify the data on the impact of HIV/AIDS on state structures and economic development; and (ii) assist governments in consolidating the design and implementation of policies and programs that can help to govern the epidemic.

==Commission Members==

Chairman K. Y. Amoako;
Patrons [[Kenneth Kaunda]], and [[Pascoal Mocumbi]]; and 
Commissioners Seyyid Abdulai, [[Abdoulaye Bathily]], Mary Chinery-Hesse, Awa Coll-Seck, [[Haile Debas]], Richard G.A. Feachem, [[Eveline Herfkens]], [[Omar Kabbaj]], Milly Katana, Madeleine Mukamabano, Benjamin Nzimbi, Joy Phumaphi, [[Peter Piot]], Paulo Teixeira, Bassary Touré, and [[Alan Whiteside]].

==CHGA Publications==

In collaboration with the ECA, CHGA has published a number of background documents on various thematic areas related to its work programme. Material in these publications may be freely quoted or reprinted. These are available on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070713012159/http://www.uneca.org/chga/res.htm CHGA website]

==The Final Report: ''Securing Our Future''==

The Final Report advances current scholarship in HIV/AIDS policy and governance and is the culmination of a unique consultation by CHGA Commissioners with a wide constituency in Africa and beyond. The findings and recommendations not only embody deep analytical insights derived from the Commission’s own research, but also reflect the views of the more than 1,000 Africans—including senior policymakers, advocacy groups, nongovernmental organizations, community-based organizations, people living with HIV/AIDS, research organizations, and UN agencies—who took part in the consultation process. 

The report contains two volumes. The first is a 50-page policy summary, and the second is a 230-page technical volume supporting the core recommendations and key findings.  The [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] will publish the final report and distribute it at no cost with the support of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].

The '''decidua''' is the [[uterus|uterine]] lining ([[endometrium]]) during a [[pregnancy]], which forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. It is formed under the influence of [[progesterone]] and forms highly characteristic cells.

==Structure==
The part of the decidua that interacts with the [[trophoblast]] is the ''decidua basalis'' (also called ''decidua placentalis''), while the ''decidua capsularis'' grows over the [[embryo]] on the luminal side, enclosing it into the endometrium. The remainder of the decidua is termed the ''decidua parietalis'' or ''decidua vera'', and it will fuse with the decidua capsularis by the fourth month of gestation.

Three morphologically distinct layers of the decidua basalis can then be described:
* Compact outer layer (''stratum compactum'')
* Intermediate layer (''stratum spongiosum'')
* Boundary layer adjacent to the [[myometrium]] (''stratum basalis'')
Within the decidua, occasional fibrinoid deposits form where the syncytiotrophoblast is damaged. The region of fibrinoid deposition where trophoblasts meet the compact portion of the decidua basalis is called ''Rohr's layer'', while the fibrinoid deposits that occur between the compact and spongy layer of the decidua basalis is termed Nitabuch's layer. This layer is absent in [[placenta accreta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Williams obstetrics|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2005|isbn=9780071413152|editor-last=Cunningham|editor-first=F. Gary|edition=22nd|location=New York ; Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Endometrium ocp use3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of decidualized [[endometrium]] due to [[exogenous]] [[progesterone]]. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
The decidua has a [[histology|histologically]]-distinct appearance, displaying large polygonal decidual cells in the stroma. These are enlarged endometrial stromal cells, which resemble [[epithelium]] (and are referred to as "epithelioid").

Decidualization includes the process of differentiation of the spindle-shape stromal fibroblasts into the plump secretory decidual cells, which create a pericellular extracellular matrix rich in [[fibronectin]] and [[laminin]] (similar to epithelial cells).

Vascularity, as well as vascular permeability, is enhanced in the decidualizing endometrium.

Its [[leukocyte]] population is distinct, with the presence of large endometrial granular leukocytes being predominant, while polynuclear leukocytes and [[B cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are scant.

The large granular lymphocytes (CD56 bright) are called "uterine [[NK cells]]" or "uNK cells" in mice, and "decidual NK cells" or "dNK cells" in humans.

==Development==
After [[ovulation]], in placental [[mammal]]s, the endometrial lining becomes hypertrophic and vascular under the influence of Estrogens and progesterone.

In animals exhibiting [[hemochorial placentation]], the endometrium undergoes [[decidualization]] following [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. If implantation does not occur, the secretory lining will be absorbed ([[estrous cycle]]) or shed ([[menstrual cycle]]).

The decidua is shed with the placenta during [[parturition]].

==Function==
As the maternal interface to the embryo the decidua participates in the exchanges of nutrition, gas, and waste with the gestation. It also protects the pregnancy from the maternal [[immune system]]. Further, the decidua has to allow a very controlled invasion of the trophoblast.

In invasive placental disorders like [[placenta accreta]] decidualization have been consistently found to be deficient.

===Hormone production===
The decidua secretes [[hormones]], [[growth factor]]s, and [[cytokine]]s. It has receptors for [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[growth hormone]], and others.

Among its products are hormones commonly associated with other organs such as [[cortisol]], [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRF]], [[GnRH]], [[prolactin]], and [[relaxin]]. Decidual prolactin is not under [[dopamine]]rgic control.

[[Pregnancy protein 14]] (PP-14), also called placental protein 12, and [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1]](IGFBP1) appear to be specific products of the secretory and decidual lining.

Other factors released include [[interleukin]]-15 and [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF). A reasonable understanding of the role and interplay of these hormones and factors has not been evolved.

===Other===

*In case of an [[extrauterine pregnancy]], the endometrium nevertheless becomes decidualized. A woman may shed the lining in the form of a decidual cast, which may be mistaken as a [[miscarriage]], when, in fact, the [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic]] pregnancy still persists.
*A [[decidual reaction]] can be observed in tissue of the [[peritoneum]] and [[ovary]] during a pregnancy, and represents a response of [[stromal]] tissue to [[progesterone]].

'''Early childhood trauma''' refers to adversity experienced in [[early childhood]]. Early childhood is defined as conception to age five, the most [[Critical period|critical developmental period]] in human life. Adversity that causes toxic stress and/or trauma experienced in early childhood can lead to a variety of problems in later life, in a critical developmental period in a child’s life spanning from conception to the age of five. Childhood experiences, both positive and negative, have a tremendous impact on future violence victimization and perpetration, and lifelong health and opportunity. As such, early experiences are an important public health issue. Much of the foundational research in this area has been referred to as Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
In recent years, there has been a surge of research into early brain development. Neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), provide increased insight about how the brain develops and how early experiences affect that development.
One area that has been receiving increasing research attention involves the effects of abuse and neglect on the developing brain,
especially during infancy and early childhood. Much of this research is providing biological explanations for what practitioners have long been describing in psychological, emotional, and behavioral terms. There is now scientific evidence of altered brain
functioning as a result of early abuse and neglect. This emerging body of knowledge has many implications for the prevention
and treatment of child abuse and neglect.
--&gt;
New research shows that even witnessing traumatic events can impact the physical development of a child’s brain — potentially leading to lifelong health and social issues.

Development of [[psychological resilience]] is believed to significantly reduce the effects of a childhood trauma on a child’s development.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/resilience/|title=Resilience|work=Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University|accessdate=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Emmy E.

The '''Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group''' ('''ECOG''') began in 1955 as one of the first [[National Cancer Institute|publicly funded]] cooperative groups to perform multi-center [[clinical trials]] for cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/ClinicalTrials/8878 | title=NCI-Sponsored Cancer Trials Offer Decent Clinical Return on Investment | work=MedPage Today | date=March 24, 2008 | accessdate=September 17, 2016 | author=Crystal Phend}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cooperative group in [[oncology]] constitutes a large network of private and public medical institutions developing   [[Medical guideline|protocols]] for cancer treatments. Institutional members include universities, medical centers, governments, and other cooperative groups. Research results are often provided through scientific publications, but the group also works closely with the [[pharmaceutical]] industry to test potential cancer drugs.

According to ECOG's website, there are "more than 90 active clinical trials in all types of adult malignancies. Annual accrual is 6,000 patients, with more than 20,000 patients in follow-up."&lt;ref name="Introduction to ECOG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecog.dfci.harvard.edu/general/intro.html|title=Introduction to ECOG|date=June 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520202454/http://ecog.dfci.harvard.edu/general/intro.html|archivedate=May 20, 2013|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ECOG's coordinating center is based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] while its Group Chair's office is located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

'''Ecosystem health''' is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=rapport1998&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Defining ecosystem health." Pages 18-33 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health.'' Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, [[flooding]], [[drought]], [[extinction]]s, [[invasive species]], [[climate change]], [[mining]], [[overexploitation]] in [[fishing]], [[farming]] or [[logging]], [[chemical spill]]s, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1992). "Evaluating ecosystem health." ''Journal of aquatic ecosystem health'' 1:15-24&lt;/ref&gt; rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. "Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Judy L. (1997). "Stream health: incorporating the human dimension to advance stream ecology." ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'' 16:439^447&lt;/ref&gt; Critics worry that ecosystem health, a "value-laden construct", is often "passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public."&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). "Science, scientists, and policy advocacy." ''Conservation Biology.'' 21(1): 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History of the concept ==

The health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1816). "Rural economy, agricultur
" ''[[Encyclopaedia Perthensis]]'' Volume 19, 391-497. Edinburgh: John Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1839). "On the culture of potatoes". ''Framer's Magazine, '' 2(5):337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great American conservationist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1946). "The land health concept and conservation." Pages 218-226 in Callicott, J. Baird, and Eric T.Freyfogle. (1999) ''For the Health of the Land. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem management" has been in use at least since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, H.J. (1957). "Applications of ecology in forest management." ''Ecology'' 38:46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem health" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good,&lt;ref name=Jax2010&gt;Jax, Kurt. (2010). ''Ecosystem Functioning.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P.E. et al. (2010). "The Sustainable Rivers Audit: assessing river ecosystem health in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia." ''Marine and Freshwater Research'' 61:764–777.&lt;/ref&gt; lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Xu, F, ZF Yang, B. Chen, and Y.W. Zhao. (2012). "Ecosystem Health Assessment of Baiyangdian Lake Based on Thermodynamic Indicators." ''Procedia Environmental Sciences'' 12: 2402–2413.&lt;/ref&gt; seas,&lt;ref&gt;HELCOM  (2010). ''Ecosystem health of the Baltic Sea 2003–2007'' HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment.Balt. Sea Environ.

''Journal of Forestry'' 95:23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramírez-Carrillo|first=Elvia|last2=López-Corona|first2=Oliver|last3=Toledo-Roy|first3=Juan C.|last4=Lovett|first4=Jon C.|last5=León-González|first5=Fernando de|last6=Osorio-Olvera|first6=Luis|last7=Equihua|first7=Julian|last8=Robredo|first8=Everardo|last9=Frank|first9=Alejandro|date=2018-07-16|title=Assessing sustainability in North America’s ecosystems using criticality and information theory|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200382|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roli|first=Andrea|last2=Villani|first2=Marco|last3=Filisetti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Serra|first4=Roberto|date=2017-11-17|title=Dynamical Criticality: Overview and Open Questions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=31|issue=3|pages=647–663|doi=10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|issn=1009-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references therein).

== Meaning ==

The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). "Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management." ''Environmental Management'' 22:483–493&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper&lt;ref name=grumbine1994&gt;Grumbine, R. Edward (1994). "What is ecosystem management?" ''Conservation Biology'' 8:27-38&lt;/ref&gt; "What is ecosystem management?" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:
* Conserving [[viable population]]s of [[native species]]
* Conserving [[ecosystem diversity]]
* Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes
* Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential
* Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints

Grumbine describes each of these goals as a "value statement" and stresses the role of human [[values]] in setting ecosystem management goals.

It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. "We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). "Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management." ''Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment'' 5:540-548.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for example, "For some, [[wolves]] are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. ''Scholar Works'', University of Montana, Oral Presentations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of [[Lake Superior]] was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for [[habitat protection|protection of habitat]] and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.&lt;ref name=horns2003&gt;Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). '' Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. '' Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], fish tissue contaminants, etc.&lt;ref name=Shear2003&gt;Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). "The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin." ''Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment'' 88:119–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state "prior to the onset of [[anthropocene|anthropogenic stress]]."&lt;ref name=rapport2011&gt;Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi  (2011). "Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability." ''Ecological Research'' 26:1039-1049&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, [[fossil record|fossil]] and [[pollen]] records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem [[ecologic succession|reshuffle]] through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or "healthy.".&lt;ref name=wicklum1995&gt;Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). "Ecosystem health and integrity?" ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 73:997-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:
# [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]],
# [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], and
# "organization" (including [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref name=rapport2011 /&gt;

While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Peter et al. (2011). "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness." ''Science'' 333:1750-1752.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the relationship between  [[System resilience|resilience]] and diversity is complex, and [[ecosystem stability]] may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). "Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems." ''Science'' 317:58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.&lt;ref&gt;Asanova, Umut (2002). "Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms." Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; Ecological [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] is a "capacity" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified.  Approaches to assessing it "face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time.  One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x [[system resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. 1992. "Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health." Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. ''Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ "nonsense units," the indices have "no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown."&lt;ref name=suter1993&gt;Suter, Glenn W. (1993). "A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes." ''Environmental toxicology and chemistry'' 12:1533-1539.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health indicators ==

Health [[Performance metric|metrics]] are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2007). "Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts." ''Acta Biotheor'' 55:341–355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneill2001&gt;O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). "Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)" ''Ecology'' 82:3275–3284&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of "health".

An [[Environmental indicator|indicator]] is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising [[mortality rate]] of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising [[carbon monoxide]] levels. Rising [[chlorophyll-a]] levels in a lake may signal [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) ''Environmental Toxicology''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. "Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose."&lt;ref name=heink2010&gt;Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) "What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning." ''Ecological Indicators'' 10:584–593&lt;/ref&gt;

Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural [[ecological succession|successional]] [[wetland]] might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the ''same'' indicator value may be judged unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza,  Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). "What is a healthy ecosystem?" ''Aquatic Ecology'' 33: 105–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael (2006). "The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:921–930&lt;/ref&gt; A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators "implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is [[bias]]ed by the observer's perspective&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2005). "Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?" ''Oikos'' 111:3&lt;/ref&gt; but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency:  "A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of "ecosystem health" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, "determining environmental status and assessing [[marine ecosystem]]s health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management"&lt;ref&gt;Borja A, et al. (2014). "Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status." ''Frontiers in Marine Science''. 1:72&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high [[Predictive value of tests|predictive value]], that is high [[sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]] (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. ''Science'', 336:1448-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; and "what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate."&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been [[correlation|correlative]] rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Philip S. et al. (2015). "Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology." ''Oikos'' 124:391-398.&lt;/ref&gt; and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in ''Ecological Indicators''." ''Ecological Indicator''s 60:223-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases no reliable indicators are known: "We found no examples of [[invertebrates]] successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species." And, "Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a few very similar species."&lt;ref&gt;Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L. Bunnell (2009). "Sustaining forest-dwelling species." Pages 173-218 in Bunnell, Fred L. and Glen B. Dunsworth (2009). ''Forestry and Biodiversity''. Learning how to Sustain Biodiversity in Managed Forests. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to human health: the health paradox ==

A trade-off between human health and the "health" of nature has been termed the "health paradox"&lt;ref&gt;C. Max Finlayson and Pierre Horwitz (2015). "Wetlands as settings for human health – the benefits and the paradox."  Pages 1-13 in Finlayson, C.M. et al. 2015. ''Wetlands and Human Health''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.

Human health has benefited by sacrificing the "health" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and [[dam]]ming of wild valleys, destruction of [[mosquito]]-bearing [[wetlands]], diversion of water for [[irrigation]], conversion of wilderness to [[farmland]], [[timber]] removal, and [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[tiger]]s, whales, ferrets, and [[wolves]].

There has been an acrimonious schism among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and resource managers&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Heather and  &amp; Jane Lubchenco  (2014) "Working together: A call for inclusive conservation." ''Nature'' 515, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudela, Sergi and Katherine Short (2005). "Paradigm shifts, gaps, inertia, and political agendas in ecosystem-based fisheries management." ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' 300:282-286.&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether to "ratchet back human domination of the biosphere" or whether to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, Redd et al. (2013). "Humanity's domination of nature is part of the problem: a response to Kareiva and Marvier." ''BioScience'' 63:241-242&lt;/ref&gt; These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Nijhius, Michelle (2014). "Bridging the conservation divide."  New Yorker, December 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[utilitarian]] view treats [[human health]] and [[well-being]] as criteria of ecosystem health.&lt;ref&gt;Su, Meirong et al. (2010)."Urban ecosystem health assessment: A review." ''Science of the Total Environment'' 408:2425–2434&lt;/ref&gt; For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes "resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health."&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1998). "Some distinctions worth making." ''Ecosystem Health'' 4:193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: "If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is ''Homo sapiens'',"&lt;ref name=Oneill2001 /&gt;

Proponents of the utilitarian view argue that "healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,"&lt;ref name=rapport1998 /&gt; and "healthy ecosystems must be economically viable," as it is "unhealthy" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in [[contamination]], [[infectious disease]]s, fires, floods, [[crop failure]]s and fishery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Dimensions of ecosystem health." Pages 34-40 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health''. Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protectionist]]s argue that privileging of human health is a [[conflict of interest]] as humans have [[ecosystem destruction|demolished]] massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and [[parasitism]] are historically normal in pre-industrial nature.&lt;ref name=wilkins1999&gt;Wilkins, D.A. (1999). "Assessing ecosystem health."  ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 14:70&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Peter J., Andrew P. Dobson and Kevin D. Lafferty (2006). "Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites?" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 21:381-385.&lt;/ref&gt; and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Kuris, Armand M. et al. (2008). "Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries." ''Nature'' 454:515-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very choice of the word "health" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: "Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). "Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication." ''BioScience'' 64(8): 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives ==

Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:
* Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.&lt;ref name=lancaster2000&gt;Lancaster, Jill (2000). "The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath."''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' 6: 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael S. (2006). "Science, Expertise, and the Democratization of the Decision-Making Process." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:661–668&lt;/ref&gt; "At the core of debates over the utility of ecosystem health is a struggle over which societal preferences will take precedence."&lt;ref name=lackey2003&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2003). "Appropriate use of ecosystem health and normative science in ecological policy" Pages. 175-186 in: Rapport, David J. et al. (2003)  ''Managing for Healthy Ecosystems ''  Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction. It implies "good", an optimum condition, but in nature ecosystems are ever-changing transitory assemblages with no identifiable optimum.&lt;ref name=wicklum1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calow, P. (1992)." Can ecosystems be healthy? Critical consideration of concepts." ''Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Health'' 1:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of human health and well-being as a criterion of ecosystem health introduces an arrogance and a conflict of interest into environmental assessment, as human population growth has caused much [[environmental damage]].&lt;ref name=wilkins1999 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Thomas R. Jr. (1995). "Ecosystem management and the arrogance of humanism." ''Conservation Biology'' 9:255-262&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ecosystem health masquerades as an operational goal because environmental managers "may be reluctant to define their goals clearly."&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt;
* It is a vague concept.&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Carlos M. et al. (2015). "Paradigms in the recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems."

"Values, Policy, and Ecosystem Health."

Alternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status,&lt;ref&gt;Link, Jason S. (2002) "What Does Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Mean?" ''Fisheries'' 27:18-21&lt;/ref&gt; ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker, Ted (1995) Synthesis of Discussion.pp 118-125 in  Hodge, Tony et al. ''Pathways to Sustainability: Assessing Our Progress''. Ottawa: National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy.&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is  to "express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems.&lt;ref name=suter1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; An example of a policy statement is "The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1995). ''Wildlife policy for Prince Edward Island. Government of Prince Edward Island'', 18 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a goal is "Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ."&lt;ref name=grumbine1994 /&gt; An example of a management objective is "Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99."&lt;ref name=horns2003 /&gt;

Kurt Jax&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.

The '''Emergency Medical Services for Children Reauthorization Act of 2014''' ({{USBill|113|s|2154}}) is a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the [[Emergency Medical Services for Children]] Program through FY2019.&lt;ref name="2154sum"/&gt; The bill would authorize [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] of about $20 million in 2015 and $101 million over the 2015-2019 period.&lt;ref name="cbo2154"/&gt;

The bill was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
{{main|Emergency Medical Services for Children}}

The Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) program is a [[United States of America|US federal government]] health initiative. It is administered by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]’ [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), and the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] (MCHB). Its aim is to reduce child and youth [[disability]] and death due to severe [[illness]] or [[injury]] by increasing awareness among health professionals, provider and planners and the general public of the special ([[physiology|physiological]] and [[psychology|psychological]]) needs of children receiving emergency medical care.

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=2154sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2154 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2154|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emergency Medical Services for Children Reauthorization Act of 2014 would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the [[Emergency Medical Services for Children]] Program through FY2019.&lt;ref name="2154sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on July 23, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo2154&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - S. 2154|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45598|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 2154 would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize activities intended to reduce child [[morbidity]] and mortality by improving [[emergency medical services]] for children. Those activities are supported by grants administered by the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA).&lt;ref name="cbo2154"/&gt;

The bill would authorize [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] of about $20 million in 2015 and $101 million over the 2015-2019 period. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing S. 2154 would cost $90 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts. [[PAYGO|Pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues.&lt;ref name="cbo2154"/&gt;

The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]].&lt;ref name="cbo2154"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Emergency Medical Services for Children Reauthorization Act of 2014 was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] on March 25, 2014 by [[Bob_Casey,_Jr.|Sen. Robert P. Casey, Jr. (D, PA)]].&lt;ref name=2154allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2154 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2154/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]].&lt;ref name="2154allactions"/&gt; On September 10, 2014, the Senate voted to pass the bill with [[unanimous consent]].&lt;ref name=CoxSenatePasses&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Ramsey|title=Senate passes bills to improve child health, fathers of veterans|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/217350-senate-passes-bills-to-improve-child-health-fathers-of-veterans|accessdate=11 September 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] supported the bill, saying that "the EMSC program is there for children during times when they are especially vulnerable and most in need of medical equipment, care and services designed especially for them."&lt;ref name=PerrinAAP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perrin|first1=James M.|title=AAP Statement on Emergency Medical Services for Children Program Reauthorization|url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/2014EMSCReauthorization.aspx|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|accessdate=11 September 2014|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Casey, who introduced the bill, argued that "this low-cost program has saved the lives of countless children and adolescents in the past 30 years, and I urge my colleagues to support this critically important program."&lt;ref name=CaseyPR&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey, Hatch Introduce Reauthorization of Emergency Medical Services for Children Program|url=http://www.casey.senate.gov/newsroom/releases/casey-hatch-introduce-reauthorization-of-emergency-medical-services-for-children-program|publisher=Office of Senator Robert P. Casey Jr.|accessdate=11 September 2014|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-UT), who co-sponsored the bill, argued that "children require specialized medical care, and that specialized care comes with unique challenges. The EMSC program helps ensure that some of our country's most vulnerable have access to the care they need, and I've been proud to support it all these years."&lt;ref name="CaseyPR"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Growth hormone deficiency''' ('''GHD''') is a medical condition due to not enough [[growth hormone]] (GH).&lt;ref name=GHR2012&gt;{{cite web|title=isolated growth hormone deficiency|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/isolated-growth-hormone-deficiency|website=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=12 December 2017|language=en|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the most noticeable symptom is a [[short height]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; In newborns there may be [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] or a [[micropenis|small penis]].&lt;ref name=NORD2016/&gt; In adults there may be decreased muscle mass, [[high cholesterol levels]], or [[osteoporosis|poor bone density]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
GHD can be [[congenital|present at birth]] or develop later in life.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Causes may include [[genetics]], trauma, infections, [[tumors]], or [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref name=NORD2016/&gt; [[Genes]] that may be involved include [[Growth hormone 1|GH1]], [[GHRHR]], or [[Bruton tyrosine kinase|BTK]].&lt;ref name=GHR2012/&gt; In a third of cases no cause is apparent.&lt;ref name=NORD2016/&gt; The underlying mechanism generally involves problems with the [[pituitary gland]].&lt;ref name=NORD2016/&gt; Some cases are associated with a lack of other [[pituitary hormone]]s, in which case it is known as [[combined pituitary hormone deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combined pituitary hormone deficiency|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/combined-pituitary-hormone-deficiency|website=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=13 December 2017|language=en|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure growth hormone levels.&lt;ref name=NORD2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment is by [[growth hormone treatment|growth hormone replacement]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; The frequency of the condition is unclear.&lt;ref name=NORD2016/&gt; Most cases are initially noticed in children.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; The genetic forms are estimated to affect about 1 in 7,000 people.&lt;ref name=GHR2012/&gt; Most types occur equally in males and females though males are more often diagnosed.&lt;ref name=NORD2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth Hormone Deficiency|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/growth-hormone-deficiency/|website=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

===Child===
Severe prenatal deficiency of GH, as occurs in [[congenital hypopituitarism]], has little effect on fetal growth. However, prenatal and congenital deficiency can reduce the size of a male's [[human penis|penis]], especially when gonadotropins are also deficient. Besides [[micropenis]] in males, additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include [[hypoglycemia]] and exaggerated [[jaundice]] (both direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia).

Even congenital GH deficiency does not usually impair length growth until after the first few months of life. From late in the first year until mid teens, poor growth and/or shortness is the hallmark of childhood GH deficiency. Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated [[hypothyroidism]], but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical. It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that [[bone age|bone maturation]] and [[puberty]] may be several years delayed. When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated, adult heights can be as short as 48-65&amp;nbsp;inches (122–165&amp;nbsp;cm).

Severe GH deficiency in early childhood also results in slower [[muscle|muscular]] development, so that gross motor milestones such as standing, walking, and jumping may be delayed. [[Body composition]] (i.e., the relative amounts of [[bone]], muscle, and [[adipose tissue|fat]]) is affected in many children with severe deficiency, so that mild to moderate chubbiness is common (though GH deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity). Some severely GH-deficient children have recognizable, cherubic facial features characterized by [[maxilla]]ry hypoplasia and forehead prominence (said to resemble a [[kewpie doll (toy)|kewpie doll]]).

Other side effects in children include sparse hair growth and frontal recession, and [[pili torti]] and [[trichorrhexis nodosa]] are also sometimes present.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. {{ISBN|0-7216-2921-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|501}}

* Increased levels of [[fibrinogen]] and plasminogen activator inhibitor
* [[Cardiac dysfunction]], including a [[Intima-media thickness|thickened intima media]]

==Causes==
Growth hormone deficiency in childhood commonly has no identifiable cause (idiopathic), and adult-onset GHD is commonly due to pituitary tumours and their treatment or to cranial [[radiotherapy|irradiation]].&lt;ref name="NICE"&gt;{{cite web | title=Human growth hormone (somatropin) in adults with growth hormone deficiency |publisher=[[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/TA64_HGHadults_fullguidance.pdf | date=2006-07-01 | accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more complete list of causes includes:
* [[mutation]]s of specific [[gene]]s (e.g., [[GHRHR]], GH1)
* congenital diseases such as [[Prader-Willi syndrome]], [[Turner syndrome]],&lt;ref name="NICE kids"/&gt; or [[short stature homeobox gene]] (SHOX) deficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rappold GA, Fukami M, Niesler B, etal |title=Deletions of the homeobox gene SHOX (short stature homeobox) are an important cause of growth failure in children with short stature |journal=J.

* [[congenital malformation]]s involving the pituitary (e.g., [[septo-optic dysplasia]], posterior pituitary ectopia)
* chronic renal insufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saborio P, Hahn S, Hisano S, Latta K, Scheinman JI, Chan JC |title=Chronic renal failure: an overview from a pediatric perspective |journal=Nephron |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=134–48 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9736810 |doi= 10.1159/000045157|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=nef80134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[brain tumor|intracranial tumors]] in or near the [[sella turcica]], especially [[craniopharyngioma]]
* damage to the pituitary from [[radiation therapy]] to the head (e.g. for [[leukemia]] or [[brain tumor]]s), from surgery, from trauma, or from intracranial disease (e.g. [[hydrocephalus]])
* [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] [[inflammation]] (hypophysitis)
* ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction from low blood pressure ([[Sheehan syndrome]]) or hemorrhage [[pituitary apoplexy]]

There are a variety of rare diseases which resemble GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low IGF levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that the problem is not due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed [[Laron dwarfism]], but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.

==Pathophysiology==
As an adult ages, it is normal for the pituitary to produce diminishing amounts of GH and many other hormones, particularly the [[sex steroid]]s. Physicians therefore distinguish between the natural reduction in GH levels which comes with age, and the much lower levels of "true" deficiency. Such deficiency almost always has an identifiable cause, with adult-onset GHD ''without'' a definable cause ("idiopathic GH deficiency") extremely rare.&lt;ref name="Molitch et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Molitch ME, Clemmons DR, Malozowski S, etal|date=May 2006|title=Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline|url=|journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1621–34|doi=10.1210/jc.2005-2227|pmid=16636129}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-07-23--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; GH does function in adulthood to maintain [[muscle]] and [[bone]] mass and strength, and has poorly understood effects on cognition and mood.

==Diagnosis==
Although GH can be readily measured in a blood sample, testing for GH deficiency is constrained by the fact that levels are nearly undetectable for most of the day. This makes simple measurement of GH in a single blood sample useless for detecting deficiency. Physicians therefore use a combination of indirect and direct criteria in assessing GHD, including:
* Auxologic criteria (defined by body measurements)
* Indirect hormonal criteria (IGF levels from a single blood sample)
* Direct hormonal criteria (measurement of GH in multiple blood samples to determine secretory patterns or responses to provocative testing), in particular:
** Subnormal frequency and amplitude of GH secretory peaks when sampled over several hours
** Subnormal GH secretion in response to at least two provocative stimuli
** Increased IGF1 levels after a few days of GH treatment
* Response to GH treatment
* Corroborative evidence of pituitary dysfunction

"Provocative tests" involve giving a dose of an agent that will normally provoke a pituitary to release a burst of growth hormone. An intravenous line is established, the agent is given, and small amounts of blood are drawn at 15 minute intervals over the next hour to determine if a rise of GH was provoked. Agents which have been used clinically to stimulate and assess GH secretion are [[arginine]],&lt;ref name="Aimaretti et al. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Aimaretti G, Corneli G, Razzore P, etal |title=Comparison between insulin-induced hypoglycemia and growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone + arginine as provocative tests for the diagnosis of GH deficiency in adults |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=1615–8 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9589665 |doi= 10.1210/jc.83.5.1615|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9589665 |accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[levodopa]], [[clonidine]], [[epinephrine]] and [[propranolol]], [[glucagon]] and [[insulin]]. An insulin tolerance test has been shown to be reproducible, age-independent, and able to distinguish between GHD and normal adults,&lt;ref name="Aimaretti et al. 1998"/&gt; and so is the test of choice.

Severe GH deficiency in childhood additionally has the following measurable characteristics:
* Proportional stature well below that expected for family heights, although this characteristic may not be present in the case of familial-linked GH deficiency
* Below-normal velocity of growth
* Delayed physical maturation
* Delayed bone age
* Low levels of [[IGF1]], IGF2, IGF binding protein 3
* Increased growth velocity after a few months of GH treatment

In childhood and adulthood, the diagnosing doctor will look for these features accompanied by corroboratory evidence of hypopituitarism such as deficiency of other pituitary hormones, a structurally abnormal pituitary, or a history of damage to the pituitary. This would confirm the diagnosis; in the absence of pituitary pathology, further testing would be required.
===Classification===
Growth hormone deficiency can be congenital or acquired in childhood or adult life. It can be partial or complete. It is usually permanent, but sometimes transient. It may be an isolated deficiency or occur in association with deficiencies of other [[pituitary]] hormones.

The term [[hypopituitarism]] is often used interchangeably with GH deficiency but more often denotes GH deficiency plus deficiency of at least one other anterior pituitary hormone. When GH deficiency (usually with other anterior pituitary deficiencies) is associated with posterior pituitary hormone deficiency (usually [[diabetes insipidus]]), the condition is termed [[panhypopituitarism]].

==Treatment==
{{main|Growth hormone treatment}}
GH deficiency is treated by replacing GH with daily injections under the skin or into muscle. Until 1985, growth hormone for treatment was obtained by extraction from human pituitary glands collected at [[autopsy]]. Since 1985, recombinant human growth hormone ([[rHGH]]) is a [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] form of human GH produced by [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered bacteria]], manufactured by [[recombinant DNA technology]]. In both children and adults, costs of treatment in terms of money, effort, and the impact on day-to-day life, are substantial.

===Child===
GH treatment is not recommended for children who are not growing despite having normal levels of growth hormone, and in the UK it is not licensed for this use.&lt;ref name="NICE kids2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/HGHinChild-42-ALS.pdf | title=Guidance on the use of human growth hormone (somatropin) in children with growth failure | publisher=National Institute for Clinical Excellence | date=2002-05-01 |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children requiring treatment usually receive daily injections of growth hormone. Most pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth and adjust dose every 3–6 months and many of these visits involve blood tests and x-rays. Treatment is usually extended as long as the child is growing, and lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient. Nearly painless insulin [[syringe]]s, [[pen injector]]s, or a needle-free delivery system reduce the discomfort. Injection sites include the biceps, thigh, buttocks, and stomach. Injection sites should be rotated daily to avoid lipoatrophy. Treatment is expensive, costing as much as US $10,000 to $40,000 a year in the USA.

===Adults===
GH supplementation is not recommended medically for the physiologic age-related decline in GH/IGF secretion.&lt;ref name="NICE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Molitch et al. 2006"/&gt; It may be appropriate in diagnosed adult-onset deficiency, where a weekly dose approximately 25% of that given to children is given. Lower doses again are called for in the elderly to reduce the incidence of side effects and maintain age-dependent normal levels of IGF-1.&lt;ref name="urlConsensus Guidelines for Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gghjournal.com/volume24/1/ab07.cfm |title=Consensus Guidelines for Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency 2007 |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, including the UK, the majority view among endocrinologists is that the failure of treatment to provide any demonstrable, measurable benefits in terms of outcomes means treatment is not recommended for all adults with severe GHD,&lt;ref name="SocietyEndo"/&gt; and national guidelines in the UK as set out by [[NICE]] suggest three criteria which all need to be met for treatment to be indicated:
#Severe GH deficiency, defined as a peak GH response of &lt;9mU/litre during an insulin tolerance test
#Perceived impairment of quality of life, as assessed by questionnaire
#They are already treated for other pituitary hormone disorders
Where treatment is indicated, duration is dependent upon indication.

Cost of adult treatment in the UK is 3000-4000 GBP annually.&lt;ref name="SocietyEndo"/&gt;

===Side effects===
*Headaches
*[[Arthralgia|Joint pain]] and [[myalgia|muscle pain]]
*[[Oedema|Fluid retention]], and [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]
*Mild [[hypertension]]
*Visual problems
*Nausea and vomiting
*[[Paraesthesiae]]
*Antibody formation
*Reactions at the injection site
*Rarely, [[benign intracranial hypertension]].&lt;ref name="NICE"/&gt;

==Prognosis==

===Child===
When treated with GH, a severely deficient child will begin to grow faster within months. In the first year of treatment, the rate of growth may increase from half as fast as other children are growing to twice as fast (e.g., from 1&amp;nbsp;inch a year to 4&amp;nbsp;inches, or 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm to 10). Growth typically slows in subsequent years, but usually remains above normal so that over several years a child who had fallen far behind in his height may grow into the normal height range. Excess adipose tissue may be reduced.

===Adults===
GH treatment can confer a number of measurable benefits to severely GH-deficient adults, such as enhanced energy and strength, and improved bone density. Muscle mass may increase at the expense of adipose tissue. Although adults with [[hypopituitarism]] have been shown to have a reduced life expectancy, and a cardiovascular mortality rate more than double controls,&lt;ref name="SocietyEndo"/&gt; treatment has not been shown to improve mortality, although blood lipid levels do improve. Similarly, although measurements of bone density improve with treatment, rates of [[fracture]]s have not been shown to improve.&lt;ref name="SocietyEndo"/&gt;

Effects on quality of life are unproven, with a number of studies finding that adults with GHD had near-normal indicators of QoL at baseline (giving little scope for improvement), and many using outdated dosing strategies. However, it may be that those adults with poor QoL at the start of treatment do benefit.&lt;ref name="NICE"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of [[idiopathic]] GHD in infants is about 1 in every 3800 live births,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = UK Child Growth Foundation | title=Growth Hormone Deficiency |url=http://www.childgrowthfoundation.org/Default.aspx?page=ConditionsGHD | accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rates in older children are rising as more children survive childhood cancers which are treated with radiotherapy, although exact rates are hard to obtain.&lt;ref name="NICE kids"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/HGHFinalProtocol.pdf | title=Growth failure (in children) - human growth hormone (HGH) | publisher=National Institute for Clinical Excellence | format=pdf | accessdate=2009-01-16 | date=2008-09-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026170932/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/HGHFinalProtocol.pdf | archivedate=2011-10-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of genuine adult-onset GHD, normally due to pituitary tumours, is estimated at 10 per million.&lt;ref name="SocietyEndo"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=The Society for Endocrinology | date=2000-10-01 | title=The Use of Growth Hormone Replacement in Adult Patients with Severe Growth Hormone Deficiency | url=http://www.endocrinology.org/policy/docs/_gh.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like many other 19th century medical terms which lost precise meaning as they gained wider currency, "[[midget]]" as a term for someone with severe proportional shortness acquired pejorative connotations and is no longer used in a medical context.

Notable modern pop cultural figures with growth hormone deficiency include actor and comedian [[Andy Milonakis]], who has the appearance and voice of an adolescent boy despite being in his early 40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/people/andy-milonakis/ |title=Andy Milonakis |website=TV.com |date=1976-01-30 |accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maureen Ryan |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-31/news/0507310043_1_andy-milonakis-show-mtv-lycos |title=Andy Milonakis, 12 going on ageless |website=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2005-07-31 |accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hammaspeikko''', [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "tooth [[troll]]", is a metaphorical device for explaining tooth decay ([[caries]]) to children. Eating candy lures tooth trolls, which drill holes into teeth and look scary. Brushing the teeth scares them away. It is not clear whether the tooth troll is a single entity, or if there are many.

The fictional character Hammaspeikko is an adaptation from the Norwegian book [[Karius and Bactus|Karius og Baktus]] written by [[Thorbjørn Egner]] published in 1949. The book introduces two characters related to dental health, Karius (standing for [[caries]]) and Bactus (standing for [[bacteria]]). The book was translated in Finnish as ''Satu hammaspeikoista'' ("A Tale about Tooth Trolls") and published in 1961.

Similar spirits were believed to cause toothache in the old Finnish religion.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17149">'''Health Disparities Centers''' refer to institutions that cover a broad range of needs and focus areas to decrease currently disproportionate illness and disease rates that lead to [[Health equity|health disparities]], as well as promote the engagement, empowerment and recruitment of underrepresented populations in health professions. Furthermore, many programs devote significant resources to developing cultural competency training to promote the deliverance of culturally sensitive healthcare by faculty, staff, as well as current and future healthcare providers. These services are usually tailored to meeting specific goals or missions of the individual components common in most of the operating Health Disparities Centers.  The overall mission of Health Disparities Centers is to eradicate health disparities and improve health care.

==History==

The Minority Health and Health Disparities Act of 2000, Public Law 106-525 led the way for an innovative program established by the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCHMD). This program, originally entitled the Project EXPORT, now bears the title of the NCMHD Centers of Excellence (COE) Program. The mission of this program is to develop centers of research, training, partnership and community outreach in the field and study of health disparities. Through grant support from the NCHMD, these centers contribute to scientific advancements and community programs with the aim of eliminating health disparities. Successful centers are currently operating in 31 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Many of these centers are made in partnerships with research-intensive universities, medical colleges and institutions, historically black colleges and universities, universities that serve Hispanic populations, tribal colleges and liberal arts schools. As of 2007, the NCMHD COE program had supported the development of 37 centers.&lt;ref&gt;"NCMHD centers of excellence program." NCMHD. Retrieved November 16, 2009. &lt;http://ncmhd.nih.gov/our_programs/centerOfExcellence.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target populations==

It is a common misconception that Health Disparities Centers are tailored primarily for minorities, but in actuality their mission extends to a wide range of groups. These include age, gender, ethnicity, geographical location, or any other differences related to socioeconomic status or environmental factors. However, the largest disparities are most prominent in [[minority group]]s.

According to the [[Healthy People 2010]] Objectives list of ten largest Racial and Ethnic disparities:&lt;ref&gt;Keppel, Kenneth G. "Ten Largest Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities in the United States based on Healthy People 2010 Objectives." American Journal of Epidemiology (2007) 4&lt;/ref&gt;

*New cases of [[gonorrhea]] rank number 1 for Black non-Hispanics
*[[Congenital syphilis]] ranks number 1 for Hispanics
*[[Fetal alcohol syndrome]] ranks number 1 for American Indian/Alaska Native
*Smoking by pregnant women ranks number 1 for Whites

==Organizational components==

===Research component===
The focus and importance of addressing growing national health disparities represents a relatively new shift in health research. Both the NCMHD Research Endowment Program and the Community-Based Participatory Research Program are initiatives to promote awareness and research incentives for those interested in studying specific health disparities and the effectiveness of current outreach programs. Major research concentrations currently being studied include, but are not limited to, conditions such as [[HIV/AIDS]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], specific types of [[cancer]]s, [[cardiovascular disease]]s, and child health promotion.

A few examples of specific research studies that have been conducted through a partnership of Health Disparities Centers are as follows:

*"Developing Measures of Parental Knowledge in Physical Activity", a study led by principal investigator Kitty Chan, PhD, was conducted through the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions. This study examined the parental knowledge of physical activity for health promotion in an effort to increase awareness in target populations where this knowledge may be lacking.&lt;ref&gt;"Our research initiatives."

===Education and mentoring component===
As disproportionate burdens of certain diseases and health conditions among specific populations are a growing concern, so is the need for widespread education and training for both the public and health professionals alike to be able to cope with, and prevent the occurrence of growing disparities in their communities. Health Disparities Centers across the nation are active in implementing educational resources that range from undergraduate and graduate coursework, [[postdoctoral]] training opportunities, conference or seminar series, and diversity and cultural competency training programs. Additionally, these centers are devoted to the recruitment and retention of research scientists and healthcare practitioners from racial/ethnic minority groups, people with disabilities and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. Many institutions support faulty mentoring of underrepresented students who are interested in completing community-based participatory research on health disparities.

===Community outreach component===
The community outreach component of Health Disparities Centers provides the essential link between advancements in research and implementing significant findings directly into the communities being studied. Emphasis has also been placed on giving target populations affected by health disparities access to health information in a community setting where they feel comfortable to have sensitive health queries addressed. A major goal of Health Disparities Centers is to give the public the knowledge and encouragement necessary to empower them to promote a healthy lifestyle in their homes and communities and be proponents for their own healthcare. Health Disparities Centers also may partner with [[grassroots]] and community-based organizations that can serve mediums to disburse educational materials and provide valuable information about the needs of the community to the centers. 
Examples of successful community outreach programs established by national Health Disparities Centers are provided below.

*Annual Health Fairs provided at [[Voorhees College]] for community residents allow attendees to receive health services and information. At these fairs, people can receive free information about nutrition, physical activities and general health-care. They can also receive [[blood pressure]] and [[blood sugar]] checks and learn about maintaining their [[body mass index]].&lt;ref&gt;"Outreach core."

Hopkins center for health disparities solutions. Retrieved November 18, 2009. &lt;http://www.jhsph.edu/healthdisparities/Community_Outreach&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration component===
The administration component of numerous Health Disparities Centers is responsible for the oversight and management of all center initiatives and programs and ensures the fiscal responsibility of the institution. It is also common for the governing body of a health disparities center to manage grants and [[collaborative partnerships]] between the center and various university, hospital or community entities.&lt;ref&gt;"Administrative core.

Connecticut center for eliminating health disparities among Latinos. Retrieved November 18, 2009. &lt;http://www.cehdl.uconn.edu/admin.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social justice implications==

Health Disparities Centers promote the concept of [[social justice]] which is a key facet of [[sustainability]]. The process of eliminating health disparities involves breaking language barriers, improving access to health-care, stamping out violence, and alleviating poor health conditions associated with a life of poverty. An example:
*The VCU Center for Health Disparities will be holding "The First International Conference on Culture, Ethnicity, and Brain Injury Rehabilitation." There is a communication problem between survivors and rehabilitation providers who speak different languages. The conference brings together experts from different countries to find an effective plan of action for better communication.&lt;ref&gt;"The First International Conference on Culture, Ethnicity, and Brain Injury Rehabilitation." VCU: Center on Health Disparities. http://www.healthdisparities.vcu.edu/news/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental justice implications==

Environment factors contribute to health disparities. [[Environmental justice]] refers to the burden that certain groups experience due to the physical environment that encompasses there day-to-day lives. People in different geographical locations may experience health disparities due to [[pollutants]] in the food or air, stress factors caused by their physical environment, and availability of different resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1253653 | pmid=15579407 | volume=112 | title=Environmental health disparities: a framework integrating psychosocial and environmental concepts | year=2004 | journal=Environ.

A few examples:
*Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities: In 2005, the CRCHD started the Community Networks Program, which "aims to reduce cancer health disparities through community-based participatory education, training, and research among racial/ethnic minorities and underserved populations." The CRCHD will implement this plan through training and educating  individuals of communities where a cancer disparity is prevalent. They also plan to provide "evidence-based information" to local, state, and Federal lawmakers to inspire policy changes that reduce cancer disparities.&lt;ref&gt;"Community Networks Program."

*Hopkins Center for Health Disparity Solution – The Hopkins center teamed up with Operation Reach Out SouthWest to hold a nutrition workshop. At the workshop, licensed nutritionist provide information on eating healthily by presenting alternative recipes and encouraging portion control.&lt;ref&gt;"Nutrition Workshop in the Community."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">'''Health indicators''' are [[quantifiable]] characteristics of a population which researchers use as supporting evidence for describing the [[population health|health of a population]]. Typically, researchers will use a [[survey methodology]] to gather information about certain people, use [[statistics]] in an attempt to generalize the information collected to the entire population, then use the statistical analysis to make a statement about the health of the population.

Health indicators are often used by governments to guide [[health care policy]].

==Example==
A common example of a health indicator is [[life expectancy]]. A government might have a system for collecting information on each citizen's age at the time of death. This data about age at death can be used to support statements about the national life expectancy, in which case life expectancy would be a "health indicator". Life expectancy may be one of many "health indicators" which collectively researchers would use to describe the health of the population of the country.

==Applications==
Health indicators are commonly used to guide [[public health]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flowers | first1 = J. | last2 = Hall | first2 = P. | last3 = Pencheon | first3 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.puhe.2005.01.003 | title = Mini-symposium — Public Health Observatories | journal = Public Health | volume = 119 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–245 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15733682 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A health indicator which will be used internationally to describe [[global health]] should have the following characteristics:
#It should be defined in such a way that it can be measured uniformly internationally.&lt;ref name="Larson and Mercer"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = C. | last2 = Mercer | first2 = A. | title = Global health indicators: An overview | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.1021409 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 171 | issue = 10 | pages = 1199–1200 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15534313| pmc =524951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#It must have [[Validity (statistics)|statistical validity]].&lt;ref name="Larson and Mercer"/&gt;
#The indicator must be data which can feasibly be collected.&lt;ref name="Larson and Mercer"/&gt;
#The analysis of the data must result in a recommendation on which people can make changes to improve health&lt;ref name="Larson and Mercer"/&gt;

The '''history of [[pizza]]''' begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.

The precursor of pizza was probably the [[focaccia]], a flat bread known to the Romans as ''panis focacius'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiantourism.com/pane.html "panis focacius denoted a flat bread cooked in the ashes ("focus" meant hearth)" - ENIT North America]&lt;/ref&gt; to which toppings were then added.&lt;ref name=Treasures&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Burtan|title=Treasures of the Italian Table|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow and Company|isbn=978-0688115579|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern pizza developed in [[Naples]], when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late 18th century.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The word ''pizza'' was first documented in 997 AD&amp;nbsp;in [[Gaeta]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica&lt;/ref&gt; and successively in different parts of [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Pizza was mainly eaten in the country of Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.

==Origins==
Foods similar to pizza have been made since the [[neolithic age]]. Records of people adding other ingredients to [[bread]] to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history.

* In [[Sardinia]], French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over 7,000 years ago. According to Professor Philippe Marinval, the local islanders leavened this bread.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/documenti/1_39_20060829130058.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Ancient Greeks]] made a flat bread called ''plakous'' (''πλακοῦς'', gen. ''πλακοῦντος''—''plakountos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383459 Plakous], Liddell and Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which was flavored with toppings like herbs, onion, cheese and garlic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crompton|first1=Dan|title=A Classical Primer: Ancient Knowledge for Modern Minds|date=2016|publisher=Michael O'Mara|isbn=1782435115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 6th century BC, the soldiers in the armies of the ancient [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] King, [[Darius I]] baked flatbreads with [[cheese]] and [[date (fruit)|date]]s on top of their battle shields.&lt;ref&gt;"Pizza, A Slice of American History" Liz Barrett (2014), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Science of Bakery Products" W. P. Edwards (2007), p.199&lt;/ref&gt;
* An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the [[Aeneid]] (ca. 19 BC), when Celaeno, queen of the [[Harpies]], foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, [[Aeneas]] and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy Aeneas and Trojans fulfill Anchises' prophecy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to ''pizzarelle'', which were [[Kashrut|kosher]] for [[Passover]] cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the [[synagogue]] on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nissan |first1=Ephraim |last2=Alinei |first2=Mario |date=2013 |title=Onomastics in Contemporary Public Space |chapter=The Pizza and the Pitta: The Thing and Its Names, Antecedents and Relatives, Ushering Into Globalization |editor1-last=Felecan |editor1-first=Oliviu |editor2-last=Bughesiu |editor2-first=Alina |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pvcwBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA328 |location= |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=1443852171}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abba Eban]] has suggested that modern pizza "was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to [[Matzo|matzah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bamberger |first1=David |last2=Eban |first2=Abba Solomon |date=1979 |title=My People: Abba Eban's History of the Jews, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCBtWDabYwkC&amp;pg=PA228 |location= |publisher=Behrman House |page=228 |isbn=0874412803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are [[focaccia]] (which may date back as far as the ancient [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]); [[Manakish]] in Lebanon, [[Coca (pastry)|coca]] (which has sweet and savory varieties) from [[Catalonia]]; [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]; the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Pita]]; [[Lepinja]] in the [[Balkans]]; or [[Piadina]] in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitit.co.uk/foodrink/pide.html |title=Food and Drink - Pide - HiTiT Turkey guide |publisher=Hitit.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese [[Bing (bread)|bing]] (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian [[paratha]] (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian [[naan]] (leavened) and [[roti]] (unleavened); the Sardinian [[Pane Carasau|carasau]], [[spianata]], [[guttiau]], [[pistoccu]]; and Finnish [[Breads of Finland#Rieska|rieska]]. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian [[flammkuchen]], German [[zwiebelkuchen]], and French [[quiche]].

In 16th-century [[Naples]], a [[galette]] flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobetravelagent.com/history-of-pizza-margherita-recipe/ |title=History of Pizza Margherita|publisher=tobetravelagent.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later replaced by oil, tomatoes (after Europeans came into contact with the Americas) or fish. In 1843, [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], described the diversity of pizza toppings.&lt;ref name=dumas&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexandre |last=Dumas |authorlink=Alexandre Dumas |title=Le Corricolo |year=1843 |edition=Oeuvres Complètes (1851) |page=91 |url=http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/bibliotheque/chapitre.php?lid=v4&amp;cid=9 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An often recounted story holds that on 11 June 1889, to honour the Queen consort of [[Italy]], [[Margherita of Savoy]], the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] pizzamaker [[Raffaele Esposito]] created the "Pizza Margherita", a pizza garnished with tomatoes, [[mozzarella]], and basil, to represent the [[national colours of Italy]] as on the [[Italian flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Vegetarian Times|title=Beyond Pizza|last=Danford|first=Natalie|number=109|date=October 1994|publisher=Active Interest Media|issn=0164-8497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{sfn|Danford|p=38}} --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rallying to protect 'real' pizza|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=5 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p=E08 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pizza purists out to protect patriotic pie|newspaper=[[Lakeland Ledger]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p=12A --&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: American Heritage article by Hanna Miller is not a reliable citation for this claim --&gt;

Pizza is now a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat breads now known as [[schiacciata]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Grigorieva,  "Naming Authenticity and Regional Italian Cuisine [https://books.google.com/books?lr=lang_en&amp;id=HflTVd898PAC&amp;dq=Pellegrino+Artusi&amp;q=pizza#v=snippet&amp;q=pizza&amp;f=false]," in Richard Hosking, ed., ''Authenticity in the Kitchen: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2005'' (Prospect Books, 2006): 211-216.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pellegrino Artusi]]'s classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, ''La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet.&lt;ref&gt;Pellegrino Artusi, ''La scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' (1911; rpr. Torino: Einaudi, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; After the dispute of some readers, Artusi will add in a copy of 1911 edition (founded by food historian Alberto Capatti) a typed sheet, bound with the volume, with the recipe of "pizza alla napoletana": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms. &lt;ref&gt;Mattozzi, Antonio e Donatella (2016)  "Pizze, pizzerie e pizzaiuoli a Napoli tra Sette e Ottocento" p.35, in ''Pizza. Una grande tradizione italiana''. Bra: Slow Food Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1927, Ada Boni's collection of regional cooking includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorieva, Naming Authenticity," p. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation==
The innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of [[tomato]] as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to [[Europe]] from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous (as some other fruits of the [[nightshade]] family are). However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around [[Naples]] to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.

[[Image:Pizzeria Port Alba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples]]

According to documents founded by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses. &lt;ref&gt;Mattozzi, Antonio (2015) ''Inventing the'' ''Pizzeria: a History of Pizza Making in Naples'', Bloomsbury Academic, pp.16-17 &lt;/ref&gt;  In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased to 120.&lt;ref&gt;Mattozzi, Antonio  ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', Distribution Maps, p.xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

In Naples two others figures existed, connected to the trade: the pizza hawker (''pizzaiuolo ambulante
''), ''who sold pizza but he did not make it, and the seller of pizza " a oggi a otto", who made pizzas but sold them in return for a payment for seven days''. &lt;ref&gt; Mattozzi, Antonio  ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Purists, like the famous pizzeria "Da Michele" in Via C. Sersale, consider there to be only two true pizzas—the [[Marinara sauce|marinara]] and the margherita—and that is all they serve. These two "pure" pizzas are the ones preferred by many Italians today.

The marinara is the older of the two and has a topping of tomato, [[oregano]], [[garlic]], and [[extra virgin olive oil]]. It is named “marinara” because it was traditionally the food prepared by "la marinara", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]].

The margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker [[Raffaele Esposito]], who worked at "Pizzeria di Pietro", established in 1880. Though recent research casts doubt on this legend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King [[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto I]] and Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]]. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian flag—green ([[basil]] leaves), white ([[mozzarella]]), and red ([[tomato]]es).&lt;ref name=amherit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=American Pie |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml |quote=Cheese, the crowning ingredient, was not added until 1889, when the Royal Palace commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three contenders he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). |work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=April–May 2006 |accessdate=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712030514/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml |archivedate=2009-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor. Although those were the most preferred, today there are many variations of pizzas.

"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana"&lt;ref name="pizzanapoletana1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/index_eng.php |title=Avpn - Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana |publisher=Pizzanapoletana.org |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("True Neapolitan Pizza Association"), which was founded in 1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (''i pizzaioli''—the pizza makers—make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.

There are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto (founded: 1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umberto.it/ |title=Benvenuti su umberto.it |publisher=Umberto.it |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias will go even further than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.

The pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is "[[pizza al taglio]]", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.

In 1962, the "Hawaiian" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted [[Protected Geographical Status|Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] status by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Hooper |title=Pizza napoletana awarded special status by EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/italian-pizza-wins-protected-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome, and was measured to be 1261.65 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-pizza|title=Largest pizza|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, robotics company [[BeeHex]], widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza.&lt;ref name = digitaltrends&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/beehex-3d-printed-pizza/ | title = NASA wants astronauts to have 3D printed pizza, and this startup is building a printer to make it happen | publisher = [[Digital Trends]] | accessdate = 16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Naples' pizza twirling wins Unesco ‘intangible’ status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/naples-pizza-twirling-wins-unesco-intangible-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=7 December 2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pizza in Canada==
[[Canada]] was first introduced to pizza in the late 1950s, with the first pizza ovens entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1 |title=Bringing the first pizza ovens to Canada in the 1950s|publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318171146/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1|archivedate=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small [[pizzerias]]. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzones]]. [[Pizza Pops]] are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.

The most distinct pizza in Canada is the "Canadian" pizza. A "Canadian" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with "[[Canadian bacon]]", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.

In Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer’s choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.

In the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese

Some of Canada's successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli’s. Boston Pizza, also known as BP’s in Canada, and "Boston's—the Gourmet Pizza" in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canada’s largest franchising restaurants.&lt;ref name="Boston Pizza Company History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bostonpizza.com/assets/mediacentre/documents/pdf/Boston_Pizza_-_Company_History.pdf |title=Boston Pizza Company History |publisher=bostonpizza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204163437/https://bostonpizza.com/assets/mediacentre/documents/pdf/Boston_Pizza_-_Company_History.pdf | archivedate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US.&lt;ref name="Boston Pizza Company History"/&gt; The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name "Boston Pizza &amp; Spaghetti House", with locations still opening across the nation. It is the first Canadian restaurant to introduce the heart-shaped pizza on Valentine’s Day, a 22-year tradition, where a dollar from each pizza ordered supports Boston Pizza Foundation Future Prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.leaderpost.com/2014/02/05/boston-pizza-once-again-offering-heart-shaped-pizzas-for-valentines-day/

Vanelli’s is an international pizza chain that is based in [[Mississauga, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="lAbout Us Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanellisrestaurants.com/en/about-us |title=lAbout Us Us|publisher=vanellisrestaurant.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chain first opened in 1981, serving both pizza and other fresh Italian cuisine, such as pasta and Italian sandwiches.&lt;ref name="lAbout Us Us"/&gt;  In 1995, the brand opened its first international location in [[Bahrain]] and became an international success. The brand continued to open additional locations across the Middle East, with chains now opened in the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanellisrestaurants.com/en/locations |title=locations|publisher=vanellisrestaurant.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 110 locations worldwide; making Vanelli’s the first pizza brand in Canada to open locations internationally.

With pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as [[Pizza Hut]], [[Domino’s Pizza]] and [[Little Caesars]] have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada. Pizzas that have been made exclusively for Canada by the American chain Pizza Hut for a limited time, included the following:

* Hot Dog [[Stuffed crust pizza|Stuffed Crust Pizza]]: an angus beef hot dog, placed inside a stuffed crust, served in a medium or large pizza, with toppings of the customer’s choice.&lt;ref name="New Pizza Hut Pizzas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/06/11/new-pizza-hut-pizzas_n_3423659.html |title=New Pizza Hut Pizzas |publisher=huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grilled Chicken Club: a spin on Canada's popular sandwich that is served with an alfredo sauce, grilled chicken strips, bacon, diced tomatoes, lettuce, mozzarella cheese and a pepper mayo sauce.&lt;ref name="New Pizza Hut Pizzas"/&gt;
* Smokey Maple Bacon Pizza: a pizza served with Alfredo sauce, maple bacon strips, bacon crumble, sliced mushrooms, shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese.&lt;ref name="New Pizza Hut Pizzas"/&gt;

==Pizza in the United States==
{{Main|Pizza in the United States}}
[[File:My Tomato Pie Pizza and Calzone.jpg|thumb|A pizza pie. In the background is a [[calzone]]]]
[[File:Pizza with roast chicken.jpg|thumb|Pizza with roast chicken]]
Pizza first made its appearance in the [[United States]] with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was very popular among large Italian populations in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[St. Louis|Saint Louis]]. In the late 19th century, pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and down the streets with a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their [[Italian American]] communities.

The first printed reference to "pizza" served in the US is a 1904 article in ''[[The Boston Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Kuban |url=http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/01/dear-slice-boston-may-have-had-the-first-pizza-in-the-us.html |title=Dear Slice: Boston May Have Had the First Pizza in America |department=Dear Slice (blog) |publisher=Serious Eats |date=January 5, 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy in 1903 to introduce the Neapolitan Pizza.{{clarify|date=July 2014|reason=Did they immigrate, or was it a business trip?}} Vincent (Jimmy) Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in [[Chicago Loop|The Loop]] in Chicago at 421 S. Wabash Avenue, the Yacht Club. Gennaro Lombardi opened a grocery store in 1897 which was later established as the "said" first pizzeria in America in 1905 with New York's issuance of the mercantile license. An employee of his, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza for the store to sell that same year. The price for a pizza was five cents, but since many people could not afford the cost of a whole pie, they would instead say how much they could pay and they were given a slice corresponding to the amount offered. In 1924, Totonno left [[Lombardi's]] to open his own pizzeria on [[Coney Island]] called [[Totonno's]]. While the original Lombardi's closed its doors in 1984, it was reopened in 1994 just down the street and is run by Lombardi's grandson.

Pizza was brought to the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area of [[New Jersey]] with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by [[Papa's Tomato Pies]] in 1912. In 1936, [[De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies]] was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20–25 years) and is famous for its New Haven–style Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, [[Sally's Apizza]], on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939.

Before the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants. The international breakthrough came after World War II. Allied troops occupying Italy, weary of their rations, were constantly on the lookout for good food. They discovered the pizzeria and local bakers were hard-pressed to satisfy the demand from the soldiers. The American troops involved in the Italian campaign took their appreciation for the dish back home, touted by "veterans ranging from the lowliest private to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}} By the 1960s, it was popular enough to be featured in an episode of ''[[Popeye the Sailor (1960s TV series)|Popeye the Sailor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon-story/52506-Popeyes-Pizza-Palace Popeye's Pizza Palace], The Big Cartoon Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Two entrepreneurs, Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, in 1943. They opened their own restaurant on the corner of Wabash and Ohio, [[Uno Chicago Grill|Pizzeria Uno]].

Chain restaurants sprang up with pizza's popularity rising. Leading early pizza chains were [[Shakey's Pizza]], founded in 1954 in [[Sacramento]], California; [[Pizza Hut]], founded in 1958 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]; and Josey's Pizza founded in [[Newnan]], Georgia, in 1943. Later entrant restaurant chains to the dine-in pizza market were [[Bertucci's]], [[Happy Joe's]], [[Monical's Pizza]], [[California Pizza Kitchen]], [[Godfather's Pizza]], and [[Round Table Pizza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlhU8-nAw2k |title=CBC Archives: New 50's Food - Pizza! 1957 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] Iovantucarus''' was a [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic god]] who was associated with the [[Treveri|Treveran]] healer-god [[Lenus|Lenus Mars]] at his sanctuary at [[Trier]]. The name reflects the deity's function as a protector of youth, and the temple was visited by pilgrims who often brought with them images of children, often depicting as holding pet birds as offerings to the god. At [[Tholey]], also in Treveran territory, ‘Iovantucarus’ was also used as an epithet of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;Edith Mary Wightman (1970). ''Roman Trier and the Treveri.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4050">'''Katharine Georgina Lloyd-Williams''' (14 February 1896 – 10 January 1973) was a British [[anaesthetist]], [[general practitioner]] and medical educator. She was a [[consultant (medicine)|consultant]] anaesthetist at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] from 1934 and dean of the [[Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine]] from 1945, retiring from both posts in 1962.

==Biography==
Lloyd-Williams was born on 14 February 1896 in [[Oswestry]]. She attended [[Queen Anne's School]] from 1908 to 1915 and Bedford Physical Training College from 1915 to 1917.

'''Lac de la Cavayère''' is an [[artificial lake]] in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] ''[[région in France|région]]'' of [[France]], close to the mediaeval town of [[Carcassonne]].

The lake, also known as ''Carcassonne Plage'' (in English, ''Carcassonne Beach''), was created by the building of a 23 metre high [[dam]] in 1988 after severe [[forest fires]] affected the area in 1985. The surface area of the lake, which is fed by the creeks of Montirat, Bazalac and Mitgé, is 180,000 m² and it is 1.5 million cubic metres in volume.

It is a short distance from the town of Carcassonne and has been made into a popular recreation area. Ducks and wildfowl are common and the 400,000 m² surrounding area is notable for a diversity of habitats, flora and fauna{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

The beaches slope gently and there are supervised bathing areas. Boats are available for rent and there are [[picnic]] areas and a [[crazy golf]] course as well as a nearby [[chateau]].

During 2005 the lake was closed to bathing due to strong [[algae|algal blooms]].

'''Leopold William Brandenburg''' (born 1886) was a 20th century American [[Physician|doctor]] and [[criminal]]. He became notorious after surgically changing the fingerprints and "facial contour" of criminal Ronald Philipps, a.k.a. "Roscoe Pitts," in 1941, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison, although the sentence was later overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/08/25/83937366.html?pageNumber=21|title=Dr. Brandenburg is Freed|date=25 August 1943|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitts had attempted to rob a grocery store using explosives in [[Wilkesboro, North Carolina]].

Brandenburg was later sentenced to five years in prison for illicitly prescribing [[morphine]], a narcotic, to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/10/18/94066180.html?pageNumber=19|title=Physician Found Guilty|date=18 October 1946|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75773">This is a '''list of incidents of cannibalism''', or anthropophagy, as the consumption of human flesh or internal organs by other human beings. Accounts of [[cannibalism]] date back as far as Biblical times, and some anthropologists suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies as early as the [[Paleolithic Era]]. Historically, numerous tribal societies have engaged in cannibalism, although very few are thought to continue the practice to this day.

Occasionally, starving people have resorted to cannibalism for survival necessity. Classical antiquity recorded numerous references to cannibalism during siege starvations. More recent well-documented examples include the ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'' sinking in 1820, the [[Donner Party]] in 1846 and 1847, and the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]]. Some murderers, such as [[Albert Fish]], [[Boone Helm]], [[Andrei Chikatilo]], and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], are known to have devoured their victims after killing them. Other individuals, such as artist [[Rick Gibson]] and journalist [[William Seabrook]], have legally consumed human flesh out of curiosity, or to attract attention to themselves.

==Prehistoric==
*The 100,000-year-old bones of six [[Neanderthal]]s found in the [[Moula-Guercy]] Cave, France, had been broken by other Neanderthals in such a way as to extract marrow and brains. Finds made in the [[El Sidrón]] cave in Spain, also show endo-cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/europes-hypocritical-history-of-cannibalism-42642371/?no-ist|title=Europe's Hypocritical History of Cannibalism|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice developed into a widespread business that flourished until the late 16th century. (As late as the early 19th century, mummies were still believed to have styptic properties against bleeding and were sold as pharmaceuticals in powdered form.&lt;ref name="Daly flesh"&gt;Quotes from [[John Sanderson (merchant)|John Sanderson]]'s ''Travels'' (1586) in ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1345912 That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy]'', [[Nicholas Daly]], NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Autumn, 1994), pp. 24–51. {{doi|10.2307/1345912}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

*On July 21, 1514, the captured Hungarian rebel leader [[György Dózsa]] was condemned to sit on a smouldering, heated iron throne, and forced to wear a heated iron crown and scepter (mocking his ambition to be king). While he was suffering, a procession of nine fellow rebels who had been starved beforehand were led to this throne. Next, executioners removed some pliers from a fire and forced them into Dózsa's skin. After tearing his flesh, the remaining rebels were ordered to bite spots where the hot pliers had been inserted and to swallow the flesh. The three or four who refused were simply cut up, prompting the others to comply. In the end, Dózsa died from the ordeal, while the rebels who obeyed were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barabási|first=Albert-László|title=Bursts|edition = First|year=2010|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|location=New York, United States|isbn=0-525-95160-1|pages=263–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account given by the two seamen covers a period from mid-1735 when they first set sail until January 1736 when they were rescued by Glanveil Nicholas, master of a scooner, who picked them up close to and landed them in Bridgetown, Barbadoes where they gave their sworn disposition. The men described in some detail (approx.800 words) how the ship sprung a leak, the slaves were unchained to help pump, how the ship finally sank, how eight men abandoned ship and some later ate human flesh as a means of surviving before Thompson and McCrone were rescued.&lt;ref&gt;The Gentleman's Magazine, July 1737&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1763, [[North American Indians]] performed an act of ritual cannibalism on a British soldier during the [[Siege of Fort Detroit]].

*In 1816, the French frigate [[French frigate Méduse (1810)|''Méduse'']] ran aground off Mauritania, and 147 passengers and crew took to sea on a hastily constructed raft. In the chaotic 13 days before they were rescued, the occupants of the raft were driven to suicide, murder, and cannibalism; only 15 men survived the experience.
*The ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'' was sunk by a [[sperm whale]] in the Pacific Ocean, in 1820. Most survivors of Captain Pollard's ship spent 90 days in small whaling boats before being rescued. Seven of the members who died during the 90 days were documented to have been eaten, some after they died, two others who were sacrificed for that purpose after drawing lots. One of the small boats was found containing two survivors sucking on the marrow of a human bone. The tale of the ''Essex'' inspired [[Herman Melville]] to write his novel, ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851).
*In 1822, [[Alexander Pearce]], an Irish convict, led an escape from [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Settlement]] in [[Van Diemen's Land]].

*[[Boone Helm]], also known as "The Kentucky Cannibal", was an American [[mountain man]], [[serial killer]], and fugitive, who ate human flesh on several occasions between 1850 and 1854, often out of necessity in extreme conditions. He made no secret of the fact and is reported to have said: "Many's the poor devil I've killed, at one time or another ... and the time has been that I've been obliged to feed on some of 'em".

*The case of ''[[R v. Dudley and Stephens]]'' (1884) 14 QBD 273 (QB) is an English case which dealt with four crew members of an English yacht, the ''Mignonette'', who were cast away in a storm some {{convert|1600|mi|km}} from the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. After several days, one of the crew, a 17-year-old cabin boy, fell unconscious due to a combination of starvation and drinking seawater. The others (one possibly objecting) decided then to kill him and eat him. They were picked up four days later. Two of the three survivors were found guilty of murder. A significant outcome of this case was that [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]] was determined to be no defence against a charge of murder.
*A report dated to July 28, 1892 indicates that three people were convicted on charges of cannibalism in the [[Sahalin]] [[penal colony]]. Two songs referencing cannibalism were also recorded among the residents of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Новодворский В., Дорошевич В. Коронка в пиках до валета.

*During the course of the [[Bailundo Revolt]], a group of [[Ovimbundu]] rebels decapitated a native merchant named Antonio de Silveira, roasted, and then consumed his body. The rebels forced Silveira's wife to carry his head in a basket. The killing held a ritualistic purpose aiming to produce "success magic", as the perpetrators belonged to the [[Kandundu Cult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://run.edu.ng/media/1834181203243.pdf|title=The Bailundo Revolt of 1902|website=Redeemer's University|author=Douglas Wheeler|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Seabrook, William Bueller |title= Jungle Ways |location= London, Bombay, Sydney |publisher= George G.

'''Loxoscelism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɒ|k|ˈ|s|ɒ|s|ᵻ|l|ɪ|s|əm}}) is a condition occasionally produced by the [[spider bite|bite]] of the [[recluse spider]]s (genus ''Loxosceles''). The area becomes dusky and a shallow open sore forms as the skin around the bite dies (necrosis). It is the only proven type of [[Necrosis|necrotic]] [[Spider bite|arachnidism]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swanson |first1=David L. |last2=Vetter |first2=Richard S. |year=2006 |title=Loxoscelism |journal=Clinics in Dermatology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=213–21 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2005.11.006 |url=http://urban.cmsdev.ucr.edu/docs/Spiders/%20Loxoscelism_S&amp;V.pdf |accessdate=12 April 2011 |pmid=16714202}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The recluse spiders are the only genus definitively shown to cause necrotic bites in humans. The layers of skin die and slough away leaving an ulcer. Since at least 1872, the blanket term ''necrotic arachnidism'' has been used in the medical literature, often erroneously implicating spiders that do not cause dermal necrosis. Spider species blamed for necrosis in the past have included [[wolf spider]]s, [[white-tailed spider]]s, [[Badumna|black house spider]]s, [[yellow sac spider]]s, [[orb weaver]]s, and funnel-weaving spiders such as the [[hobo spider]].&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"/&gt; |group=n}} While there is no known therapy effective for loxoscelism, there has been research on antibiotics, surgical timing, hyperbaric oxygen, potential [[antivenom]]s and vaccines.&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"/&gt; Because of the number of diseases that may mimic loxoscelism, it is frequently misdiagnosed by physicians.{{refn|Diseases that may cause symptoms similar to loxoscelism include: streptococcal or [[staphylococcal infection]] (particularly by [[methicillin]]-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''), herpes simplex, herpes zoster, diabetic ulcer, fungal infection, pyoderma gangrenosum, lymphomatoid papulosis, chemical burn, ''Toxicodendron'' dermatitis, squamous cell carcinoma, neoplasia, localized vasculitis, syphilis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, gonococcemia, purpura fulminans, sporotrichosis, Lyme disease, cowpox, and anthrax.&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"/&gt;|group=n}}

Loxoscelism  was first described in the United States in 1879 in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Appel |first1=MH |last2=Bertoni da Silveira |first2=R |author3=Gremksi, W |author4=Veiga, SS |year=2005 |title=Insights into brown spider and loxoscelism |journal=Invertebrate Survival Journal |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=152–158 |publisher=University of Modena and Reggio Emilia |issn=1824-307X |url=http://www.isj.unimo.it/articoli/ISJ109.pdf |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are up to 13 different ''Loxosceles'' species in North America (11 native and two nonnative), ''[[Loxosceles reclusa]]'' is the species most often involved in serious [[envenomation]]. ''[[Loxosceles reclusa]]''  has a limited habitat that includes the Southeast United States. In South America, ''[[Loxosceles laeta|L. laeta]]'', ''[[Loxosceles intermedia|L. intermedia]]'' (found in Brazil and Argentina), and ''[[Loxosceles gaucho|L. gaucho]]'' (Brazil) are the three species most often reported to cause necrotic bites.&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Loxoscelism may present with local and whole-body symptoms:

*'''Necrotic cutaneous loxoscelism''' is the medical term for the reaction most common in loxoscelism. It is characterized by a localized necrotic wound at the site of bite. The majority of ''Loxosceles'' bites result in minor skin irritation that heals in  one week.&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"/&gt; Such lesions often heal within 6 to 8 weeks, and can leave lasting scars.
*'''Viscerocutaneous loxoscelism''' refers to the combination of local and systemic manifestations that occur infrequently after ''Loxosceles'' bites. Symptoms include low energy, nausea and vomiting, and fever. Destruction of blood cells ([[hemolytic anemia]]) may require transfusion and injure the kidney.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|455|date=May 2009}} Consumption of clotting factors (so-called [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] ["DIC"]) and destruction of platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]) is reported most often in children. DIC may lead to dangerous bleeding. Occasionally, [[acute kidney failure]] may develop from [[myonecrosis]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]], leading to coma.&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"/&gt;

===Loxosceles toxins===
''Loxosceles'' venom has several toxins; the most important for necrotic arachnidism is the enzyme [[Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase|sphingomyelinase D]]. It is present in all recluse species to varying degrees and not all are equivalent. This toxin is present in only one other known spider genus (''[[Sicarius (genus)|Sicarius]]'').&lt;ref name="Swanson-Vetter"/&gt; The toxin dissolves the structural components of the cell membrane  generating ring forms that perhaps act as a trigger for cellular self-destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lajoie|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Zobel-Thropp|first2=Pamela A.|last3=Kumirov|first3=Vlad K.|last4=Bandarian|first4=Vahe|last5=Binford|first5=Greta J.|last6=Cordes|first6=Matthew H. J.|last7=Gasset|first7=Maria|title=Phospholipase D Toxins of Brown Spider Venom Convert Lysophosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin to Cyclic Phosphates|journal=PLoS ONE|date=29 August 2013|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e72372|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072372|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072372|pmid=24009677|pmc=3756997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of destruction is limited to the presence of the enzyme which cannot reproduce.

==Diagnosis==
The spider biting apparatus is short and bites are only possible in experimental animals with pressure on the spider's back. Thus many bites occur when a spider is trapped in a shirt or pant sleeve. There is no commercial chemical test to determine if the venom is from a [[brown recluse spider|brown recluse]]. The bite itself is not usually painful. Many [[Necrosis|necrotic lesions]] are erroneously attributed to the bite of the brown recluse. (See Note). Skin wounds are common and infections will lead to necrotic wounds. Thus many terrible skin infections are attributed falsely to the brown recluse.&lt;ref name="Vetter, Richard S 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vetter Richard S | year = 2000 | title = Medical Myth: Myth: idiopathic wounds are often due to brown recluse or other spider bites throughout the United States | journal = Western Journal of Medicine | volume = 173 | issue = 5| pages = 357–358 | doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.357 | pmid=11069881 | pmc=1071166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many suspected bites occurred  in areas outside of its natural habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vetter Richard S., Edwards G.

The diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that no attempt is made to positively identify the suspected spider. Because of this, other, non-necrotic species are frequently mistakenly identified as a brown recluse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vetter Richard S | year = 2009 | title = Arachnids misidentified as brown recluse spiders by medical personnel and other authorities in North America | url = | journal = Toxicon | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 545–547 | doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.04.021 | pmid=19446575}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several certified [[arachnologists]] are able to positively identify a brown recluse specimen on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vetter|first1=Rick|title=Myth of the Brown Recluse Fact, Fear, and Loathing|url=http://spiders.ucr.edu/myth.html|website=UCR Spiders Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of presumptive brown recluse spider bites reinforce improbable diagnoses in regions of North America where the spider is not endemic such as Florida, Pennsylvania, and California.

The [[mnemonic]] "'''NOT RECLUSE'''" has been suggested as a tool to help  professionals more objectively exclude skin lesions that were suspected to be loxosceles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2603498] Stoecker, WV, Vetter RS, Dyer, JA (Feb 2017) NOT RECLUSE—A Mnemonic Device to Avoid False Diagnoses of Brown Recluse Spider Bites. JAMA Dermatol. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.5665&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous (should be solitary), Occurrence (wrong geography) Timing (wrong season), Red Center (center should be black), Elevated (should be shallow depression), Chronic, Large (more than 10&amp;nbsp;cm), Ulcerates too quickly (less than a week), Swollen, Exudative (there should be no pus, it should be dry)

==Treatment==
Despite being one of the few medically important spider bites, there is no established treatment for the bite of a Loxosceles spider. Physicians wait for the body to heal itself, and assist with cosmetic appearance. There are, however, some remedies currently being researched.

===Anti-venoms===
Anti-venoms are commercially prepared antibodies to toxins in animal bites. They are specific for each bite. There are several [[anti-venom]]s commercially available in Brazil, which have been shown to be effective in controlling the spread of necrosis in rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barbaro |first1=K.C. |last2=Knysak |first2=I. |author3=Martins, R. |author4=Hogan, C. |author5=Winkel, K. |year=2005 |title= Enzymatic Characterization, Antigenic Cross-Reactivity And Neutralization Of Dermonecrotic Activity Of Five Loxosceles Spider Venoms Of Medical  Importance In The Americas |journal=Toxicon |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=489–99 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2004.12.009 |pmid=15733571}}&lt;/ref&gt; When administered immediately, they can almost entirely neutralize any ill effects. If too much time is allowed to pass, the treatment becomes ineffective. Most victims do not seek medical attention within the first twelve hours of being bitten, and these anti-venoms are largely ineffective after this point. Because of this, anti-venoms are not being developed more widely. They have, however, been proven to be very effective if administered in a timely manner and could be utilized in Brazil as a legitimate technique.

===Surgical treatment===
In cases where a large [[Necrosis|dermonecrotic lesion]] has developed, the dead tissue can be surgically removed.  Skin grafting may ultimately be needed to cover this defect.

==Species implicated==
===''Loxosceles''===
It is suspected that most if not all species of the genus ''[[Loxosceles]]'' have necrotic venom. Over fifty species have been identified in the genus, but significant research has only been conducted on species living in close proximity to humans.

====''Loxosceles reclusa'' (Brown Recluse Spider)====
Among the spiders bearing necrotic venom, the [[Brown Recluse]] is the most commonly encountered by humans. The range of the brown recluse spider extends from southeastern Nebraska to southernmost Ohio and south into Georgia and most of Texas. It can be distinguished by violin shaped markings on its back. The long spindly ("haywire") legs have no spines or banding pattern. The brown recluse has six eyes, arranged in pairs, an uncommon arrangement but not exclusive. However, many lesser known species of the Loxosceles genus are believed to have similar venoms. ''L. reclusa'' is a very non-aggressive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=R. G. |last2=Kelly |first2=P. |author3=Krober, M. S. |author4=Weir, M. R. |author5=Jones, R. |year=1994 |title= Necrotic Arachnidism |journal= The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=160 |issue=6 |pages=570–2 |issn=0093-0415 |pmid=8053187 |pmc=1022570}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been documented cases where a house has a very large population for many years without any of the human inhabitants being bitten. For this reason, ''L. reclusa'' bites are relatively rare, but, because its range overlaps human habitation, its bite is the cause of loxoscelism in North America.

====''Loxosceles laeta'' (Chilean Recluse Spider)====
''[[Loxosceles laeta]]'', commonly known as the Chilean Recluse Spider, is generally considered to be one of the most toxic species in the Loxosceles genus. It has a very wide range, having populations in Guatemala, Panama, Curaçao, Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina in South and Central America. In North America, there are populations in Vancouver, Canada, Massachusetts, California, Kansas and Florida. ''L. laeta'' can also be found in Finland and Australia. ''L. laeta'' has been documented at elevations between 200m and 2340m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gonçalves-de-Andrade |first1=Rute M. |last2=Tambourgi |first2=Denise V. |year=2003 |title= First Record On Loxosceles Laeta (Nicolet, 1849) (Araneae, Sicariidae) In The West Zone Of São Paulo City, São Paulo, Brazil, And Considerations Regarding Its Geographic Distribution |journal= Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=425–6 |doi=10.1590/S0037-86822003000300019 |pmid=12908048}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This range can probably be attributed to the species ability to last long periods of time without food or water. The laeta is cryptozoic, meaning it lives in dark concealed places. This can often mean piles of wood or brick for the laeta, facilitating more transportation of the species into new areas. Another reason for the laeta’s strong populations is the high fertility rate among its females. Each female can produce up to fifteen egg sacs in its life, with between fifty and one hundred and fifty eggs in each. Loxosceles laeta eggs have a high egg fertility index.

====''Loxosceles deserta'' (Desert recluse)====
''[[Loxosceles deserta|L. deserta]]'' is found in the Southwest United States. Human interactions with it are rare, because it usually is only found in native vegetation. It is not usually found within heavily populated areas, but its range does come near these areas. It is considered medically unimportant due to the low likelihood of human-to-spider encounters.

===Other species===
==== ''Lampoma cylindrata'' (White-tailed spider)====
The [[white-tailed spider]], found principally in Australia, was formerly blamed for a series of illnesses including necrotic arachnidism. This used to be part of academic and popular belief, but several reviews of the data have dispelled this myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Julian|last2=Weinstein|first2=Scott A.|title=A phoenix of clinical toxinology: White-tailed spider (Lampona spp.) bites. A case report and review of medical significance|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S004101011400155X|journal=Toxicon|volume=87|pages=76–80|doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2014.05.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Cheiracanthium inclusum'' (Yellow Sac Spider) ====
''[[Cheiracanthium inclusum]]'', also known as the Black-Footed Yellow Sac spider, has been implicated in necrotic skin lesions. ''C. inclusum's'' venom has been claimed to be weakly necrotic, but arachnologists contest this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vetter Richard S. ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = Verified bites by yellow sac spiders (genus Cheiracanthium) in the United States and Australia: Where is the necrosis?. | url = | journal = American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 74 | issue = 6| page = 1043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This spider can be found all over North, Central, and South America, as well as in The West Indies. It is often encountered by people indoors and outdoors alike.

====''Eratigena agrestis'' (Hobo Spider)====
Many necrotic lesions in the northwestern United States have been attributed to spider bite. The Centers for Disease Control made a survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Necrotic Arachnidism -- Pacific Northwest, 1988-1996|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00042059.htm|website=CDC MMWR}}&lt;/ref&gt; as brown recluses are not found in the Pacific Northwest. However, there is a large population of the [[Hobo spider|''E. agrestis'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baird |first1=Craig R. |last2=Stoltz |first2=Robert L. |year=2005 |title= Range Expansion of the Hobo Spider, ''Tegenaria agrestis'', in the Northwestern United States (Araneae, Agelenidae)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact has led many to believe that the bite of the Hobo Spider is also necrotic. Critics note that this evidence is only circumstantial.&lt;ref name="Vetter, Richard S 2000"/&gt; The species is of European origin and never known to have caused such effects over the hundreds of years that it has been known by, interacted with, and bitten people. Claims of a medically significant bite should be regarded as a myth.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz, James H. "Most necrotic ulcers are not spider bites." The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 72.4 (2005): 364-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Robert G., and Richard S. Vetter. "An approach to spider bites. Erroneous attribution of dermonecrotic lesions to brown recluse or hobo spider bites in Canada." Canadian family physician 50.8 (2004): 1098-1101.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Lycosa'' spp (wolf spiders)====
One of the pioneers in antivenom studies in Brazil in the 1920s first focused on ''[[Lycosa]]'' species as causes for illness and widespread necrotic lesions. This belief lasted for 50 years until the wolf spider was exonerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Sylvia M.|date=June 2015|title=The history of venomous spider identification, venom extraction methods and antivenom production: a long journey at the Butantan Institute, São Paulo, Brazil|url=https://jvat.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40409-015-0020-0|journal=Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins including Tropical Diseases|volume=21|issue=1|pages=21|doi=10.1186/s40409-015-0020-0|issn=1678-9199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
'''MAP International was founded as Medical Assistance Programs International''', an organization that provides medical supplies abroad, encourages community health development, prevents disease, and responds to disasters, was founded in 1954 by J. Raymond Knighton, the first Executive director of the [[Christian Medical and Dental Society|Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS)]]. MAP International is a member of [http://www.integralalliance.org Integral], an international cooperation of 19 Christian aid organizations. MAP International’s first project was to supply Shering Corporation and Eli Lilly’s donation of 11 tons of medicines abroad in developing areas. 

=== Disaster relief ===
Since then, MAP International has instituted numerous projects including but not limited to emergency relief efforts after Typhoon Gloria in Taiwan, civilian casualties in Panama, the fall of the Soviet Union, Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, the fall of the Taliban, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, and Zika relief in Latin America. MAP International also started Fellowship programs to train medical students, opened offices in developing areas such as Ecuador, Kenya, and West Africa, and donated billions of dollars in medicines and supplies to people in need.

=== Mission statement ===
MAP's Mission | MAP International is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities. Recognized for our 99% efficiency rating, we respond to the needs of those we serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Our mission is to advance the Total Health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. We carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy. Although MAP International is a Christian organization, it has a policy against discrimination based on religion, gender, race, and other aspects of an individual’s background, and will not refuse help to anyone based on these classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/about-map-guiding-principles|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Credibility ==
MAP International’s status as a highly credible organization is well attested to by multiple well-known sources. [[Forbes|Forbes, Inc.]] recognizes MAP International as the #37 Largest U.S. Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/map-international/|title=MAP International on the Forbes The 100 Largest U.S. Charities List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the MAP International program is very well recognized and generates a large amount of revenue. It illuminates important aspects of the program such as its donor dependency, total revenue, amount spent on charitable work, and fundraising efficiency. [[Better Business Bureau|BBB]] lists MAP International as an accredited charity, meaning it meets the standards in terms of governance, measuring effectiveness, finances, and fund raising and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/relief-and-development/map-international-in-brunswick-ga-1681|title=Charity Report - MAP International - give.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charity Navigator]] rates MAP International as 100 out of 100, and four out of four stars, and includes information about the program’s accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4042#.UmNRshbU7lJ|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for MAP International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNBC named MAP International #2 on their list of Top-Ten Charities Changing the World in 2015.  [[POPLINE|Popline]] points out that some health workers have biases against working with faith-based programs, but that the merits of the MAP International program should dispel these biases. It also discusses the financial benefits of FBOs in relation to “their ability to leverage volunteer work with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popline.org/node/241130Green, E. C.

== Current projects ==

MAP International recognizes its partners for their integral role in efficiently distributing donated medicines and supplies, and states the difficulties they have encountered in getting the medicines to the victims. For example, all of the medicine shipments in Leyte Island were washed away when the typhoon hit that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/568/typhoon_haiyan_map_is_responding|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the detrimental effects of Cyclone Phailin, MAP International is providing India with temporary shelter structures, food, medicine, and cooking utensils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/499/cyclone_phailin_hits_india|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAP International has responded to the Oklahoma Tornado by donating over $127,000 of supplies to their partner, Convoy of Hope, in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/oklahoma-relief|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation also mentions MAP International's affiliation with Abbott in response to the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bclc.uschamber.com/site-page/oklahoma-tornadoes-corporate-aid-tracker|title=(2013).

Water and Sanitation are aspects assimilated into all MAP International programs because of the significant impact they have on preventing disease and promoting other facets of Total Health. Water and Sanitation efforts involve building separate waste and clean drinking structures, providing water filters to communities, and establishing Community Led Total Sanitation programs. MAP International utilizes a [[sweat equity]] design to implement [http://www.sawyer.com Sawyer] water filters in underserved communities and implements a small-scale demonstration with the help of a few members in the community before introducing water sanitation efforts on a large-scale throughout the village. Sawyer attests to the integral role MAP International has played in distributing hundreds water filters to communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawyer.com/sawyersaves/kenya.html|title=Kenya - Sawyer International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community Led Total Sanitation programs are designed to educate and empower local community members to make their village a more sanitary and healthy environment through education about the negative health effects of drinking unclean water and the importance of separating human waste structures and drinking water structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//WATER%20AND%20SANITATION%20FINAL.pdf (2013).

'''NANDA International''' (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) is a professional organization of [[nurse]]s standardized [[nursing]] [[terminology]] that was officially founded in 1982 and develops, researches, disseminates and refines the nomenclature, [[:wikt:criteria|criteria]], and [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of [[nursing diagnosis|nursing diagnoses]]. In 2002, NANDA relaunched as '''NANDA International''' in response to the broadening scope of its membership. NANDA International published ''Nursing Diagnosis'' quarterly, which became the ''[[International Journal of Nursing Knowledge]]'' in 2002. Other related international associations are ''ACENDIO'' (Europe), ''AENTDE'' (Spanish language), ''AFEDI'' (French language) and ''JSND'' (Japan). The Membership Network Groups foster collaboration among NANDA-I members in countries ([[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[México]] and [[Nigeria]]-[[Ghana]]) and for languages: the [[German language|German]] Language Group ([[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]]) and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] Language Group ([[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]).

==History==
In 1973, [[Kristine Gebbie]] and [[Mary Ann Lavin]] called the First National Conference on the Classification of Nursing Diagnoses. It was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Attendees produced a beginning classification, an alphabetized list of nursing diagnoses. The conference also created three structures: A National Clearinghouse for Nursing Diagnoses, located at Saint Louis University and led by Ann Becker; a Nursing Diagnosis Newsletter, edited by Anne Perry; and a National Conference Group to standardize nursing terminology and led by Marjory Gordon. In 1982 NANDA was formed. It included members from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

NANDA developed a [[nursing classification]] to organize nursing diagnoses into different categories. Although the taxonomy was revised to accommodate new diagnoses, in 1994 it became apparent that an overhaul was needed. In 2002 Taxonomy II, which was a revised version of [[Gordon's functional health patterns]], was released.

In 2002, NANDA became NANDA International in response to requests from its growing base of membership from outside North America. The acronym of NANDA was retained in the name because of the name recognition, but it is no longer merely "North American", and in fact boasts members from 32 countries as of 2010.

'''NHS England''' is an executive [[non-departmental public body]] (NDPB) of the [[Department of Health and Social Care]].

NHS England oversees the budget, planning, delivery and day-to-day operation of the commissioning side of the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS in England]] as set out in the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commissioningboard.nhs.uk/about/ |title=About us |publisher=NHS Commissioning Board |accessdate=12 Feb 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the contracts for GPs and NHS dentists.  The Secretary of State publishes, annually, a document known as the [[NHS mandate|mandate]] which specifies the objectives which the Board should seek to achieve.  National Health Service (Mandate Requirements) Regulations are published each year to give legal force to the mandate.

NHS England employs around 6,500 staff in 50 sites around England. Most of its staff previously worked for the decommissioned [[NHS primary care trust|primary care trust]]s and [[strategic health authority|strategic health authorities]].

In 2018 it became clear that the organisation, while maintaining its statutory independence, was for practical to be merged with [[NHS Improvement]], and  seven “single integrated regional teams” would be jointly established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seven regions planned in NHS England and NHS Improvement 'integration'|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/policy-and-regulation/seven-regions-planned-in-nhs-england-and-nhs-improvement-integration/7022047.article?|accessdate=27 May 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of the National Health Service (England)}}
NHS England is the operating name of the '''NHS Commissioning Board''' and, before that, the NHS Commissioning Board Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/about/#lb |title=About us |publisher=NHS England |accessdate=11 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up as a [[special health authority]] of the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] in October 2011 as the forerunner to becoming an NDPB on 1 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commissioningboard.nhs.uk/about/ |title=About us |publisher=NHS Commissioning Board Authority |accessdate=30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed NHS England on 26 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/2013/03/26/nhs-england/ |title=NHS England Chairman welcomes new name |publisher=NHS England |accessdate=11 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its legal name remains the NHS Commissioning Board.

Sir [[David Nicholson (civil servant)|David Nicholson]] who became Chief Executive at the establishment of the Board retired at the end of March 2014 and was replaced by [[Simon Stevens Health Manager|Simon Stevens]].  One of Stevens' first acts was to announce a restructure of its 27 area teams in response to a requirement to reduce running costs which would reduce staffing by around 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: NHS England to cut hundreds of posts in restructure|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/exclusive-nhs-england-to-cut-hundreds-of-posts-in-restructure/5073389.article#.VBtGTxLGBJ0|accessdate=18 September 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 27 teams outside London were reduced to 12 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: NHS England's new area team structure|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/revealed-nhs-englands-new-area-team-structure/5075148.article#.VEqx5SsoKzY|accessdate=24 October 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System management==

It produced a planning document the [[Five Year Forward View]] in October 2014 which envisaged development of new models to suit local needs. 

NHS England in conjunction with the other central regulators established what is called a "success regime" in south and mid Essex, North Cumbria and north east and western Devon in June 2015.  It is intended to tackle “deep rooted and systemic issues that previous interventions have not tackled across [a] whole health and care economy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mackey: Success regime not working fast enough|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/quality-and-performance/mackey-success-regime-not-working-fast-enough/7001993.article|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 it organised the geographical division of England into 44 [[Sustainability and transformation plan]] areas with populations between 300,000 and 3 million.  These areas were locally agreed between [[NHS Trust]]s, local authorities and [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s. A leader was appointed for each area, who is to be responsible for the implementation of the plans which are to be agreed by the component organisations. They will be "working across organisational boundaries to help build a consensus for transformation and the practical steps to deliver it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The leaders chosen for 41 of England's STPs|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/sectors/commissioning/revealed-the-leaders-chosen-for-41-of-englands-stps/7003640.article|accessdate=8 April 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 it introduced a Capped Expenditure Process applied to NHS commissioners and providers in the 13 areas across England with the largest budget deficits.  It is intended to reduce their spending by around £500 million, and health leaders were told to ‘think the unthinkable’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Secret plans’ detail severe cuts across the NHS|url=http://www.onmedica.com/NewsArticle.aspx?id=c8ce1445-6dbe-41ab-a71a-f90561233daf|accessdate=3 September 2017|publisher=OnMedica|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational Pressures Escalation Levels Framework===

In October 2016 it introduced a new system for the management of operational difficulties in English hospitals, replacing the rather poorly defined system of red and black alerts which were locally defined. There are 4 OPEL levels. Level 1 is a state of normality.  Level 4 is a major crisis requiring external intervention either regionally or nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Nigel|title=Black alert?

==Primary care==
Applications by GPs to reduce their catchment area are dealt with by NHS England. Requests to reduce the number of patients eligible to join a practice and in some cases also to deregister existing patients, have risen with 26 made between April and October 2014 compared to 30 for the whole of 2013/14. Only 15 have been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England rejects one in four requests to shrink GP catchment areas|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/political/practice-boundaries/nhs-england-rejects-one-in-four-requests-to-shrink-gp-catchment-areas/20008296.article#.VFazJ5_raKI|accessdate=2 November 2014|publisher=Pulse|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 Mr Justice Popplewell declared that NHS England “has acted unlawfully by reason of its failure to make arrangements for the involvement of patients in primary care commissioning decisions as required by the National Health Service Act 2006”. The case involved the decision to scrap minimum practice income guarantee.  Richard Stein, a partner at [[Leigh Day]], said the declaration could mean that patients would have to be involved in discussions on changes to the GP contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England primary care decisions 'unlawful', High Court rules|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-nhs-england-primary-care-decisions-unlawful-high-court-rules/5077054.article#.VI4neyusUk4|accessdate=15 December 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHS England awarded a 4-year contract to [[Capita]] to become sole provider of administrative services including payment administration, management of medical records, and eligibility lists for practitioners for GPs, opticians and dentists across the UK in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Capita is awarded NHS England admin contract worth up to £1bn|url=http://www.cityam.com/218577/capita-awarded-nhs-england-admin-contract-worth-1bn?ITO=related-content|accessdate=26 June 2015|publisher=City AM|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology==
The organisation was reported to be developing a strategy to support the use of personal health records in June 2015.  This, it is hoped, could achieve up to £3.4&amp;nbsp;billion in annual efficiency savings by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS developing PHR adoption strategy|url=http://www.digitalhealth.net/news/45076/|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=Digital Health|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2016 it published an index of digital maturity, where each of the 239 NHS trusts assessed its own "readiness", "capabilities" and "Enabling infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Maturity Assessment|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/info-revolution/maturity-index/|publisher=NHS England|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First digital maturity index scores in full|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/technology-and-innovation/revealed-first-digital-maturity-index-scores-in-full/7003962.article|accessdate=19 June 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[NHS app]] was unveiled, with very public backing from [[Matt Hancock]], who presented it as the key a radical overhaul of NHS technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Matt Hancock's plan for an NHS tech revolution is doomed to fail |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-matt-hancock-technology-innovation |accessdate=8 September 2018 |publisher=Wired |date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialised commissioning==
Specialised services are those provided in relatively few hospitals, accessed by comparatively small numbers of patients but with catchment populations of usually more than one million. These services tend to be located in specialised hospital trusts that can recruit a team of staff with the appropriate expertise. NHS England is responsible for commissioning £15.6 billion of specialised services and for dealing with [[Individual Funding Request]]s in respect of the specialist services it commissions.
	
It was criticised for delays in deciding on a policy for the prescription of [[Everolimus]] in the treatment of [[tuberous sclerosis]]. Twenty doctors addressed a letter to the board in support of the charity Tuberous Sclerosis Association saying "around 32 patients with critical need, whose doctors believe everolimus treatment is their best or only option, have no hope of access to funding. Most have been waiting many months. Approximately half of these patients are at imminent risk of a catastrophic event (renal bleed or kidney failure) with a high risk of preventable death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lintern|first1=Shaun|title=Policy delays risk 'preventable deaths', doctors warn NHS England|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/policy-delays-risk-preventable-deaths-doctors-warn-nhs-england/5084158.article#.VTVrEyFVhBd|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015 it was reported that Luke Henry and Stephanie Rudwick, the parents of a child suffering from Tuberous Sclerosis were trying to sell their home in Brighton to raise the money to pay for treatment for their daughter Bethany who has tumours on her brain, kidneys and liver and suffers from up to fifty epileptic fits a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Couple forced to sell home after NHS refuse to fund daughter's treatment for rare illness|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/576462/Brighton-home-sell-sick-child|accessdate=12 May 2015|publisher=Daily Express|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 		 		
It authorises and pays for treatment of [[narcolepsy]] with [[sodium oxybate]] by means of individual funding requests on the basis of exceptional circumstances.  In May 2016 the High Court ordered NHS England to provide funding to treat a teenager with severe narcolepsy. The judge criticised their “thoroughly bad decision” and “absurd” policy discriminating against the girl when hundreds of other NHS patients already receive the drug. The Department of Health is also paying for the treatment of  people whose narcolepsy was caused by the swine flu vaccine [[Pandemrix]] in 2009-10 by means of private prescriptions outside the National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge criticises NHS England for 'totally irrational' drug decision|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/newsletter/sectors/commissioning/judge-criticises-nhs-england-for-totally-irrational-drug-decision/7004512.article?WT.tsrc=email&amp;WT.mc_id=Newsletter308|accessdate=4 May 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitration==
The organisation's responsibilities include arbitration in disputes between [[clinical commissioning group]]s and [[NHS trust]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mapped: Quarter of area teams resort to NHS England arbitration|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/mapped-quarter-of-area-teams-resort-to-nhs-england-arbitration/5083396.article|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding of Clinical Commissioning Groups==
NHS England allocates funding (of £69.5 billion in 2016/7) to CCGs in accordance with a funding formula.  Until 2016 progress towards the amount indicated by the formula from the historical allocation was very slow, and CCGs which were above their allocation did not actually suffer a reduction.  From April 2016 however CCGs with more than 10% above their fair share will receive "flat cash" - an effective reduction. This will also ensure than no CCG is more than 5% below its target allocation in 2016/7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Major allocations shakeup means real terms cuts for some CCGs|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/finance-and-efficiency/major-allocations-shakeup-means-real-terms-cuts-for-some-ccgs/7001224.article|accessdate=28 February 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NICO Clean Tobacco Card''' was a device exported from [[Japan]] to the [[United States]] in the 1960s, consisting of a small card impregnated with [[Uraninite|uranium ore]].  The card was to be placed inside a pack of [[cigarette]]s, and the producers claimed that the [[radiation]] emitted by the card would reduce [[tar]] and [[nicotine]], and enhance the [[smoking]] experience.

A similar product, the Nicotine Alkaloid Control Plate, was produced in the 1990s but not exported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1540">The '''National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947''' came into effect on 5 July 1948 and created the [[National Health Service in Scotland]]. Though the title 'National Health Service' implies one health service for the United Kingdom, in reality one NHS was created for [[England and Wales]], accountable to the [[Secretary of State for Health]] and a separate NHS was created for Scotland, accountable to the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. Similar health services in Northern Ireland were created by the Northern Ireland Parliament through the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1948.

Many sections of the Act were repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/58/schedule/7/enacted National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1972, Schedule 7 (as enacted)] at legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and the remaining provisions were repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/29/schedule/17 National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978, Schedule 17] at legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Obesity in Malta''' is a contemporary health issue. This problem is connected to several other illnesses and economic costs for the government. The causes for Malta's obesity are various and one of the leading aspects is physical inactivity.

Malta's authorities declare that obesity is one of the major preventable causes of other illnesses and finally, leading to an earlier death. In 2014, with the publication of the Eurostat statistics, Malta's obesity problem caught the national, as well as international attention intensively. In the same year, Malta's Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Mr. Chris Fearne, announced that the government is committed to tackle the prevailing obesity problem in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-05-09/news/government-committed-to-tackle-obesity-with-solid-measures-4921327616/|title=Government committed to tackle obesity with solid measures - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta appears to be the most obese country within the European Union - according to Eurostat and the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/243312/Malta-WHO-Country-Profile.pdf?ua=1|title=Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity - Malta|last=|first=|date=2013|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Overweight_and_obesity_-_BMI_statistics|title=Overweight and obesity - BMI statistics - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Obesity Statistics European Union, 2014.pdf|left|thumb|285x285px|The obesity statistics of the EU show that Malta is the most obese country in comparison to other member states. The data is retrieved from Eurostatistics.|alt=]]
With 26% - meaning one out of four adults - being obese, Malta is far ahead on the obesity scale, comparable to other EU countries.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; For children, the situation is worse in Malta, as 40% of all children are obese there. The prevalence of obesity has increased from 23% in 2002 to 25% in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/mt/en/publications/weighing-the-costs-of-obesity.html|title=Weighing the costs of obesity|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|website=PwC|language=en-mt|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Eurostat bases its obesity observation on a BMI calculation. In regard to this method, the definition of obesity is that a person needs to have a higher BMI of 30 in order to be categorized as obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170222/local/40-of-maltese-children-overweight-or-obese.640380|title=40% of Maltese children overweight or obese|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important findings of the Eurostat statistics included the systematic difference between men and women concerning the obesity level. The proportion of men being obese, with 28.1%, was much higher than that of women in Malta, with 23.9%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The age also plays an important role in Malta's obesity problem. Whereas only one young adult person out of 10 is considered to be obese in Malta (12%), one out of three older persons in Malta (33.6%) is categorized as obese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Education plays a certain role in Malta's obesity problem. In almost every EU member state, the share of obesity decreases with education level. 30.3% of Malta's obese population come from a low education level, and only 15.8% of people with a high education level were being classified as obese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Effects ==

Obesity tends to lead to a number of non-communicable diseases and impacts individuals through a lower quality and length of life. The mental effects of obesity should not be ignored either: depression, discrimination and lower educational attainment are psychological aspects related to the physical negative consequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Regarding the subsequent illnesses of obesity, the chances of being affected by diabetes type two, high blood pressure, heart diseases, a stroke, as well as some forms of cancer are way higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Javier)|first=Varo, J.J. (José|last2=Ángel)|first2=Martinez-Gonzalez, M.A. (Miguel|last3=de|first3=Irala, J. (Jokin)|last4=(J.)|first4=Kearney, J.|last5=(M.J.)|first5=Gibney, M.J.|last6=Alfredo)|first6=Martinez, J.A.

Additionally, death rates from ischaemic heart disease in Malta remain above the EU average, but have shown a relatively consistent downward trend. More than a quarter of all deaths from ischaemic heart disease were premature, occurring in people aged under 75.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Costs for the Government ===

But not only the health and quality of life of individuals is negatively influenced by obesity, the costs associated with obesity are weighting on the shoulders of several stakeholders, inter alia the government and the society at large. Based on the 2015 EHIS results, the cost of obesity in Malta has been estimated at 36.3 million euro. 23.8 million euros are thereby direct costs, divided into primary care, specialist care, hospital care, cost of allied healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical care, weight loss interventions and public interventions. The indirect costs, amounted to 12.5 million euro, consist of absenteeism, presenteeism, government subsidies, forgone earnings and forgone taxes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Different scholars point out a figure of 23.7 million euro for overweight and obesity in Malta, including herewith hospital costs and the cost of visits to general practitioners and specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuschieri|first=Sarah|last2=Vassallo|first2=Josanne|last3=Calleja|first3=Neville|last4=Camilleri|first4=Ryan|last5=Borg Axisa|first5=Ayrton|last6=Bonnici|first6=Gary|last7=Zhang|first7=Yimeng|last8=Pace|first8=Nikolai|last9=Mamo|first9=Julian|date=2016-10-09|title=Cuschieri et al-2016-Obesity Science &amp; Practice|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308952764_Cuschieri_et_al-2016-Obesity_Science_Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the inability to stop the growing levels of obesity will probably result in a loss up to 90,000 hours of work for Malta due to the connected health complications. Besides, it is also estimated that, if the rising percentages of obesity will not be stopped, the costs of obesity will rise to 41.4 million euro which is equal to 110 euro per capita. In the long term, the figure could even rise to 46.5 million euros by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170705/local/rising-levels-of-obesity-may-soon-hit-the-economy.652446|title=Rising levels of obesity may soon hit the economy|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical Inactivity ==
For decades, Malta has been sheltered from the influence of other cultures, but with its entry into the European Union and the growing globalization, Malta became easier to access. This aspect, in turn, led to more trade relations, enhancing its tourism and economic opportunities. Moreover, its culture and lifestyle was equally influenced. It is argued that it is exactly this change of Malta's traditional Mediterranean diet to a high-fat and high-sugar fast food nutrition which is favored by many Western European countries and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-maltese-so-fat-213170|title=Why Are The Maltese So Fat?|date=2011-11-26|work=International Business Times|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When regarding the causes of obesity in general, the major reasons for weight gains include diminished physical activity, high fat diets and inadequate adjustments of energy intakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=Robert C.|last2=Wright|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Pepe|first3=Margaret S.|last4=Seidel|first4=Kristy D.|last5=Dietz|first5=William H.|date=1997-09-25|title=Predicting Obesity in Young Adulthood from Childhood and Parental Obesity|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709253371301|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=337|issue=13|pages=869–873|doi=10.1056/nejm199709253371301|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, it is Malta's extremely westernized diet - which the Mediterranean genes cannot adopt to fastly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Jonathan C.K.|date=2012-03-02|title=Obesity as malnutrition: The role of capitalism in the obesity global epidemic|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajhb.22253|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=261–276|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22253|issn=1042-0533}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is Malta's lack of physical activity, affecting its obesity rate.

Taking the aspect of physical activity more detailed into account, there can be different layers identified for impacting the physical activity of a country. There exist natural,- built,- and social environment factors, as well as individual determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-01|title=Social determinants and lifestyles: integrating environmental and public health perspectives|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350616302505|journal=Public Health|language=en|volume=141|pages=270–278|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2016.09.019|issn=0033-3506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor influencing Malta's physical inactivity plays its built environment, meaning its urban design and its infrastructure. Infrastructure which is designed to encourage physical activity, such as the construction of bike lanes, diminishes obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Patricia|last2=Irwin|first2=Jennifer D.|last3=Gilliland|first3=Jason|last4=He|first4=Meizi|last5=Larsen|first5=Kristian|last6=Hess|first6=Paul|date=2009-3|title=Environmental influences on physical activity levels in youth|journal=Health &amp; Place|volume=15|issue=1|pages=357–363|doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2008.07.001|issn=1353-8292|pmid=18706850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta has the highest motorisation rate among any region from one of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or more recently. Following this argument, its motorisation rate consisted of 592 passenger cars per thousand inhabitants in 2012.&lt;ref name="Transport - Statistics Explained"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Transport|title=Transport - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are usual smaller EU countries which are having the highest motorisation rates: Luxembourg makes the first place with 661 passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants, whereas Malta follows directly with 634 cars per 1000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Transport - Statistics Explained"/&gt;

Next to the built environment, it is the social environment which influences the physical activity of a country. In this respect, the income factor is decisive. There exist a definite correlation between physical inactivity and a low level of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Yichen|last2=Jones-Smith|first2=Jessica C.|date=2015-02-12|title=Associations Between Family Income and Children’s Physical Fitness and Obesity in California, 2010–2012|journal=Preventing Chronic Disease|volume=12|doi=10.5888/pcd12.140392|issn=1545-1151|pmc=4329950|pmid=25674676}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 11 billion euro, Malta has the lowest GDP ration as country in 2017, compared to the other EU countries. When looking at the GDP per inhabitant (in accordance with the Purchasing Power Standards), Malta belongs with 27,500 euro to the lowest quarter of the EU countries. Luxembourg, with 75,000, is the country with the highest GDP per inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/Europa/EN/Country/Comparison/GER_EU_Compared.html|title=Data by country - EU comparison 2018: Germany and the other Member States - Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)|last=publisher|website=www.destatis.de|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta's comparably low income level explains partly its physical inactivity and its high obesity rate.

The individual determinant includes the education factor. It is a concern that people with a lower education status are more prone to be less physcially active, since these groups have less leisure time or poorer access to recreation and sport facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=E.

Especially since 2014, when the statistics about Malta being the most obese country, got published, Malta's government tries actively to tackle to obesity issue. Childhood obesity in particular is one of its major concerns: Kindergarten children learn how to prepare healthy foods and shops in schools are allowed to sell only products the Maltese authorities consider as healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/maltas-health-system-and-waistlines-feel-the-strain/|title=Malta’s battle of the bulge|date=2017-04-10|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Malta's government launched several initiatives in order to reduce obesity. One of the them is the 'Healthy Weight for Life strategy for 2012-2020, which aims to establish a society in which health lifestyles related to diet and physical activity become the norm and health choices are easy and accessible to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/malta/news/news/2012/05/malta-launches-obesity-strategy|title=Malta launches obesity strategy|date=2012-05-01|website=www.euro.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Malta published the "Food and Nutrition Policy and Action Plan for Malta 2015-2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://extranet.who.int/nutrition/gina/en/node/23606|title=Policy - Food and Nutrition Policy and Action Plan for Malta 2015-2020 {{!}} Global database on the Implementation of Nutrition Action (GINA)|website=extranet.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oxford Ophthalmological Congress''' (OOC) is an annual meeting of [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic surgeons]] at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Oxford Ophthalmological Congress| url=http://www.oxford-ophthalmological-congress.org.uk/page.asp?node=22&amp;sec=Home| publisher=Oxford Ophthalmological Congress }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Established in 1909, the Congress is the longest running continuous gathering in the [[United Kingdom]] of ophthalmic surgeons. Until recently it was also the largest and is now second only to the expanded Congress of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists itself. It brings together some 450 representatives each year.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the conference are summarized in the ''[[British Journal of Ophthalmology]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and also, where useful to the wider profession, in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Notes: Oxford Ophthalmological Congress Annual Report, 1951 | url=http://bjo.bmj.com/content/35/9/569.full.pdf | first=J.

==History==
In 1902, [[Robert Walter Doyne]] was appointed the first Reader in Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences. Level 6, West Wing, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU|title=A brief history of the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology|url=http://www.eye.ox.ac.uk/about/history|publisher=University of Oxford Medical Sciences Division|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post was inaugurated thanks to a benefaction from Mrs. Margaret Ogilvie. Doyne held the chair for 11 years and was also consulting ophthalmic surgeon to the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in Oxford. He later founded the [[Oxford Eye Hospital]].

In 1904 he was the lead representative for Ophthalmology at the annual meeting of the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA), which was held at Oxford in the summer. This programme was such a success that he was asked to arrange a similar meeting the following year and this then became a regular event each summer. 

As a result, the Oxford Ophthalmological Congress was formally established in 1909, and Doyne was appointed its first Master the following year. 

In 2014 Parul Desai became the first woman to be appointed Master, with the original title being maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.optometry.co.uk/news-and-features/news/?article=6159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==
The Congress is a 3-day colloquium, held each July in [[Oxford]] in [[England]], at which leading practitioners give talks on issues of interest to the profession. The main event of the Congress is the Doyne Memorial Lecture, but there are, in addition, opportunities for a number of quick-fire presentations, allowing newcomers to introduce themselves and their projects to a distinguished gathering of professional colleagues. The Founder's Cup is awarded for the best presentation and the Ian Fraser Cup is the other main award. The evenings are for socialising: an opportunity to catch up with old colleagues from other universities and hospitals, and a chance for the present and the future of the profession to meet each other.

==Prizes==
The Founder's Cup is the leading prize of the Congress and a fair indicator of the leading British-trained ophthalmologists of the future:
*2005: [[Robert MacLaren]]: Cup and medal - now Professor
*2006:
*2007:
*2008:
*2009:
*2010:
*2011: Mandeep Singh: Cup and medal - now Professor
*2012:
*2013: Mandeep Singh: Cup (bis) - (see above)
*2014: Samantha de Silva
*2015: Alun Barnard
*2016: Sofia Theodoropoulou

The other main award of the Congress is the Ian Fraser Cup.

The '''Pharmaceutical Affairs Law''' of [[South Korea]] is a law regulating the manufacturing, importation, and sale of drugs and medical devices.

==Effects==
The law has brought difficulties to [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] patients, as the test strip papers required by [[glucose meter]]s used for home [[blood glucose monitoring]] were considered pharmacological supplies under the law, and thus legally could only be sold by pharmacies. Medical supply shops were tacitly permitted to sell the test strips as well, but a 2005 crackdown on 200 such shops in [[Suseo-dong]], [[Gangnam-gu]], [[Seoul]] brought the law into the spotlight. Diabetics complained that different meters required different test strips, and pharmacies did not always carry the required brands. An official at the [[Korea Food &amp; Drug Administration]] said the government might resolve the issue by reclassifying the test strips as non-pharmacological supplies, but the issue would take time due to [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2643213|last=Kim|first=Jung-soo|date=2005-11-15|title=Diabetics claim pharmacy law discriminatory|periodical=Korea JoongAng Daily|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known as the posterior shoulder as it faces the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] of the mother.

'''Super Slow''' is a form of strengthening [[physical exercise]] ([[Strength training|resistance training]]) popularized by [[Ken Hutchins]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Ken. Super Slow: The ULTIMATE Exercise Protocol. Casselberry FL: Super Slow Systems, 1989, 1992. {{ISBN|0-9633199-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Super Slow is Hutchins [[trademark]]ed name for the [[High intensity training]] approach advocated by [[Arthur Jones (inventor)|Arthur Jones]]. It is based on ideas from the 1940s and 1960s called 10/10 "muscle contraction with measured movement" and implemented using fixed weight [[Nautilus, Inc.|Nautilus]] machines. In more recent times such "Time Under Load" ideas have seen a renaissance with Dr Doug McGuff's best selling Body by Science.

The 10 second lifting, 10 second lowering repetition speed of movement was suggested to Ken Hutchins by Dr. Vincent Bocchicchio.  Bocchicchio promoted his original idea as being impractical on compound movements such as leg press, chest press, overhead press, and pull downs (chin-ups). However, Hutchins developed a turnaround technique to include those important exercises during [[Nautilus, Inc.|Nautilus]]-funded [[osteoporosis]] research at the [[University of Florida]] in the early 1980s. In addition, Hutchins improved the resistance curves of the exercise equipment and reduced their friction to further enhance the loading effect upon the muscles. The effect of this approach was further improved by the practice of the exercises in an "ideal" environment wherein the temperature was cool, ventilation was provided, and distractions (audio, smell, visual) were minimized. This clinical environment, in combination with the slow speed and improved mechanics, had never been managed before. SuperSlow instructors are also educated with an emphasis on using precise language in exercise.

A ten/ten protocol was used in the 1940s by body builders and later in the 1960s by powerlifters as a plateau breaker under the name MC/MM or ''muscle contraction with measured movement''. This similar idea was sometimes advocated by Bob Hoffman of the [[York Barbell]] Company. None of these earlier approaches incorporated the ideal environment, the consistent turnaround technique, the superior equipment mechanics, nor the adherence to tracking muscular function that SuperSlow encompassed.

The method incorporates very slow repetition speeds as compared to traditional resistance training methods, with emphasis on minimizing acceleration and momentum to reduce the force the body is exposed to during exercise and improve muscular loading.

SuperSlow [[workout]]s typically consist of one set of each exercise carried out to complete muscle fatigue. Hutchins recommends performing each set for between 100 and 240 seconds, depending on the exercise and the subject's competence. A frequency of twice weekly is recommended for most trainees, with even less frequency for more advanced trainees. A workout should last no longer than 30 minutes and be performed to the exclusion of all other intense activity for maximum progress. In recent years, Hutchins has continued to refine methods and expand publications to include additional training methodology and exercise history.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Ken. The Renaissance of Exercise. Casselberry FL: Renaissance Exercise, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Some research indicates that Super Slow produces superior results compared to traditional methods in as little as 10 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Westcott, WL et al. Effects of regular and slow speed resistance training on muscle strength. Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness. 41: 154-158, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow repetitions may be particularly beneficial to trainees working around injuries or conditions requiring extra caution and may be useful for practicing proper form when learning new exercises. Personal trainers who have abandoned Super Slow for general use may still use it as a method for teaching new exercises or evaluating clients' exercise form.

Similar methods include Fred Hahn's Slow Burn system and Adam Zickerman's Power of 10 method. Zickerman's Power of Ten is identical to Super Slow in rep speed and philosophy. Hahn's Slow Burn method does not subscribe to the strict 10/10 rep tempo, and uses a heavier weight load than Super Slow. In Slow Burn training, the weight load chosen renders muscle fatigue in 40–90 seconds. Hahn also recommends two sessions per week for the vast majority of trainees. The word ''burn'' in Slow Burn is used to describe efficient fat burning via the use of a low carbohydrate eating regimen, NOT the feeling of burning muscles while doing the exercises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">'''Tobacco Policy in Armenia''' is the attempt by the Armenian authorities to regulate smoking in Armenia. Tobacco laws and regulations are controlled by the Ministry of Health of Armenia. Armenian men tend to be the most common tobacco users, as 42.5% of men over the age of 15 smoke.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Emergence of the Tobacco Control Law ==
According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) the three leading health risk factors in Armenia are: “alcohol use, road traffic injuries, and tobacco use.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaitsev|first1=Egor|title=Armenia|url=http://www.who.int/countries/arm/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia Ranks first in Europe and sixth in the world with more than 70% of the population being cigarette smokers. In 2004, Armenia joined the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and the National Tobacco Program was approved by Armenia’s Parliament. A bill was proposed to abolish the promotion and sale of tobacco products to minors, ban smoking in public places (such as universities and hospitals), enforce stricter regulations on tobacco companies and raise prices on all tobacco products to promote healthy lifestyles among all individuals in the country.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first “National Tobacco Control Law on Tobacco Realization, Consumption, Production and Usage Limitations” was signed into law in 2005 by President Robert Kocharyan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the law is in place to prohibit smoking in public places, regulate distribution of cigarettes by manufacturers, improve public health and awareness of the health hazards of smoking lack of enforcement has rendered this law to be unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manukyan|first1=Karine|title=Armenia’s National Tobacco Control Program|url=http://www.ceche.org/communications/armenia/armenia.html|website=Center for Communications, Health and The Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smoking Among Men, Women, and Adolescents ==
Tobacco use in Armenia is most commonly seen in men, although, over the years, women have started to smoke cigarettes as well, allowing for the emergence of a new market directed towards female smokers. According to the most recent WHO reports, an estimated 52.5% of men 1.5% of women over the age of 15 are smokers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaitsev|first1=Egor|title=Armenia|url=http://www.who.int/countries/arm/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; With smoking gaining popularity among women, tobacco companies are given an opportunity for a new market targeting female smokers. Large tobacco companies produce thin, colored, menthol flavored cigarettes especially designed for female smokers. Although there is a ban on the sale and advertisement of tobacco products to those who are underage (under the age of 18) adolescents have also began smoking at higher rates, starting as young as thirteen years of age due to a lack of enforcement of this ban.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This increasing trend in cigarette smoke has led to major health risks such as various lung diseases, risk of heart attacks, an increased risk of malignant tumors and allergies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krikorian|first1=Onnik|title=Armenians Struggle for Health Care and Medicines|url=http://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/country/armenia/summary|website=Tobacco Control Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations on Marketing of Tobacco Products and Resolving Uninformed Consumer Issues ==
Per the FCTC’s requirements the 2005 law that was signed by President Kocharyan also imposed regulations on public advertisement of tobacco products and proposed a complete ban of advertisements by 2010. According to the FCTC’s requirements the law also mandated proper labeling of cigarette packs to inform the public about the health risks associated with smoking. The warning label on cigarette packs reads “Smoking is Hazardous Health” and serves as a warning label for smokers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The Ministry of Health and the Future of Armenia's Tobacco Control Policy ==
The [[:hy:ՀՀ առողջապահության նախարարություն|Ministry of Health of Armenia]] is in control of laws and regulations associated with tobacco use. As of 2016 the current minister of the department is Levon Altunyan. The Ministry plans to have stricter regulations on the production, sale and consumption of all tobacco products as recently reported by Mr. Altunyan.

'''Turkish tobacco''', or '''Oriental tobacco''', is a highly aromatic, small-leafed variety of [[Nicotiana tabacum|tobacco]] which is sun-cured. Historically, it was cultivated primarily in [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], now divided among [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Turkey]], but it is now also grown on the [[Black Sea]] coast of Turkey, in [[Egypt]], in [[South Africa]] and elsewhere.

The name "Turkish" refers to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled the historic production areas until the late 19th/early 20th century.

== History ==
[[File:Stacks of tobacco in Prilep.JPG|thumb|Stacks of dried oriental tobacco in [[Prilep]], Macedonia]]

Tobacco originated in the Americas and was introduced to the [[Ottoman Turks]] by the Spanish. The Ottoman people over time developed their own method of growing and using tobacco.

Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco; today, its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco.

Turkish tobacco is sun-cured, which makes it more aromatic and, like flue-cured tobacco, more acidic than air or smoke-cured tobacco, thus more suitable for [[cigarette]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan Goodman|title=Tobacco in History|page=97|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1994|isbn=9780203993651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish tobacco has a much milder flavour and contains less nicotine and fewer carcinogens than other varieties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american.edu/ted/turkish-tobacco.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907010804/http://www.american.edu/ted/turkish-tobacco.htm |date=September 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cigarettes containing only Turkish tobacco, like Murad, Helmar, Balkan Sobranie or those supplied by urban tobacconists like [[Fribourg &amp; Treyer]] or Sullivan Powell in London, are no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Timeline: The Twentieth Century 1900-1949--The Rise of the Cigarette|url=http://archive.tobacco.org/resources/history/Tobacco_History20-1.html|work=tobacco.org|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blends, however, persist: the American Blend cigarette, in particular, uses Turkish mixed with more robust tobacco such as [[Virginia tobacco]] and [[Burley (tobacco)|Burley]]. Turkish tobacco plants usually have a greater number and smaller size leaves. These differences can be attributed to climate, soil, cultivation and treatment methods.

'''''Tysiąc v. Poland''''' (Application no. 5410/03) was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) in 2007. A [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman from [[Poland]], diagnosed with a severe eye disease, tried to get an [[abortion]] to avoid an escalation of her disease. Her requests were rejected by several medical doctors and she underwent labor of her third child. Her condition later deteriorated, and she sued one of the doctors. Her criminal lawsuits were rejected in Poland and the case was appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which accepted one part of the complaint, and the plaintiff was awarded damages.

==Background==
[[Image:Alicja Tysiąc.JPG|thumb|Alicja Tysiąc]]
Ms. A. Tysiąc suffered from severe [[myopia]]. During her third pregnancy in 2000, she was examined by three ophthalmologists. All of them concluded that, due to pathological changes in her [[retina]], the pregnancy and delivery constituted a risk to her eyesight. However, they refused to issue a certificate for the pregnancy to be terminated, despite Tysiąc's requests, saying that the risk of the retina detaching itself due to the strain caused by giving birth could be avoided if Mrs. Tysiąc delivered through cesarean section. Subsequently, Ms. Tysiąc sought further medical advice. A general practitioner (GP) issued a certificate stating that the third pregnancy constituted a threat to Ms. Tysiąc's health as there was a risk of rupture of the uterus, given her two previous deliveries by caesarean section. She further referred to Ms. Tysiąc's short-sightedness and to significant pathological changes in her retina. These considerations, according to the GP, also required that Ms. Tysiąc should avoid physical strain which in any case would hardly be possible as at that time the applicant was raising two small children on her own. Ms. Tysiąc understood that on the basis of this certificate she would be able to terminate her pregnancy lawfully.

Subsequently, Ms. Tysiąc contacted a state hospital, the Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics in Warsaw, in the area to which she was assigned on the basis of her residence, with a view to obtaining the termination of her pregnancy. On 26 April 2000 she had an appointment with Dr R.D., head of the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department of the Clinic. Dr R.D. examined her, but did not examine her ophthalmological records. Afterwards, he made a note on the back of the certificate issued by the GP that neither her short-sightedness nor her two previous deliveries by caesarean section constituted grounds for therapeutic termination of the pregnancy. He was of the view that, in these circumstances, the applicant should give birth by caesarean section. During the applicant's visit Dr R.D. also consulted an endocrinologist.

As a result, Ms. Tysiąc's pregnancy was not terminated. She delivered the child by caesarean section in November 2000.

Some time after the delivery, her eyesight deteriorated. On 11 January 2001 the social welfare centre issued a certificate to the effect that she was unable to take care of her children as she could not see from a distance of more than 1.5 metres.

Ms. Tysiąc lodged a criminal complaint against Dr R.D., alleging that he had prevented her from having her pregnancy terminated on medical grounds as recommended by the GP and permissible as one of the exceptions to a general ban on abortion. She complained that, following the pregnancy and delivery, she had sustained severe bodily harm by way of almost complete loss of her eyesight. The investigation of the applicant's complaint was carried out by the Warsaw-Śródmieście District Prosecutor. The prosecutor heard evidence from the ophthalmologists who had examined the applicant during her pregnancy. They stated that she could have had a safe delivery by caesarean section. The prosecutor further requested the preparation of an expert report by a panel of three medical experts (ophthalmologist, gynaecologist and specialist in forensic medicine) from the Białystok Medical Academy. According to the report, the applicant's pregnancies and deliveries had not affected the deterioration of her eyesight. Given the serious nature of the applicant's sight impairment, the risk of retinal detachment had always been present and continued to exist, and the pregnancy and delivery had not contributed to increasing that risk. Furthermore, the experts found that in the applicant's case there had been no factors militating against the applicant's carrying her baby to term and delivering it.

The criminal investigation against Dr R.D. was therefore discontinued.

==Judgment==
By 6 votes to 1, the court held that there was a violation of Article 8 [[ECHR]] (right to private life), as "''it is not the Court's task in the present case to examine whether the Convention guarantees a right to have an abortion" and "it has not been demonstrated that Polish law as applied to the applicant's case contained any effective mechanisms capable of determining whether the conditions for obtaining a lawful abortion had been met in her case.... the provisions of the civil law on tort as applied by the Polish courts did not afford the applicant a procedural instrument by which she could have vindicated her right to respect for her private life. The civil law remedy was solely of a retroactive and compensatory character. It could only, and if the applicant had been successful, have resulted in the courts granting damages to cover the irreparable damage to her health which had come to light after the delivery.... Crucially, the examination of the circumstances of the case in the context of criminal investigations could not have prevented the damage to the applicant's health from arising. The same applies to disciplinary proceedings before the organs of the Chamber of Physicians."

Judge Borrego Borrego filed a dissenting opinion, concluding that "the Court has decided that a human being was born as a result of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. According to this reasoning, there is a Polish child, currently six years old, whose right to be born contradicts the Convention. I would never have thought that the Convention would go so far, and I find it frightening". Judge Bonello filed a separate opinion, stating that his vote for finding a violation goes no further than "whether, in cases of conflicting views (between a pregnant woman and doctors, or between the doctors themselves) as to whether the conditions to obtain a legal abortion were satisfied or not, effective mechanisms capable of determining the issue were in place".

Besides, the court ruled unanimously that there was no violation of Article 3 (no torture, inhuman or degrading treatment).

Ms. Tysiąc was awarded €25000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and €14000 in respect of costs and expenses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9248">[[File:Weltmer Institute Emblem.jpg|thumb|125px|Weltmer Institute Emblem]]
The '''Weltmer Institute''' was an American organization that practiced '''weltmerism''', a kind of "magnetic healing" involving [[telepathy]] and [[hypnosis]]. Based in [[Nevada, Missouri]], it was founded by [[Sidney Abram Weltmer]] on February 19, 1897 and operated until 1933, being dissolved shortly after his death in 1930.

The institute was significant in generating business that helped boost the growth of Nevada. But the hypnotic and telepathic healing that it sold was criticized as ineffective voodoo and [[charlatanry]].

== History ==
[[File:Prof S. A. Weltmer 1912.jpg|right|135px|thumb|Sidney Weltmer in 1912]]
Sidney Weltmer was an enthusiastic supporter of the idea that healing could be the basis of a successful business. In his book ''How to Make Magnetic Healing Pay'', he had written that "a thorough knowledge of Magnetic Healing alone will not bring success, financially&amp;mdash;a knowledge of the business side of the science is necessary as well".&lt;ref name="Hoolihan2008"/&gt; Weltmer's interests in business culminated in his opening of the Weltmer Institute in Nevada, Missouri in 1897.&lt;ref name="Hoolihan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hoolihan|title=An Annotated Catalogue of the Edward C. Atwater Collection of American Popular Medicine and Health Reform, Volume 3: Supplement: A-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGcDUS7WUqYC&amp;pg=PA636|accessdate=2 February 2013|date=1 November 2008|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-284-6|page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height, the institute treated 400 people a day, generating a daily income of $3,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employed 17 healers, and more than 100 stenographers and typists to process mail.&lt;ref name=ndm2004/&gt;

After the closure of the Institute in 1933, the first building was sold to Milster Funeral Home. In 2005, the historical buildings were razed for the construction of new buildings on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Weltmer Institute Cameo Overview.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Weltmer Institute Cameo Overview]]
At the institute, practitioners performed mental healing through telepathy and mental suggestion.&lt;ref name="Atkinson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Walker Atkinson|title=Telepathy: Its Theory, Facts, and Proof|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e24_lI6DvxUC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=2 February 2013|date=30 August 2010|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61640-357-7|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One practitioner&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; J.O. Crone&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; wrote an account of his time at the institute; he claimed that he began work with scant instruction from Weltmer, who had been preoccupied. Crone wrote of his first hypnosis, of a woman patient, thus:{{quotation|she said ... " ... I want you to hypnotize me, get me quiet, and give me rest." Very well; this was my first attempt to hypnotize a patient, but I did not allow her to know but I had hypnotized a hundred or more. To tell the truth, I was almost scared to death.&lt;ref name="Crone1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. O.

== Reception and influence==
[[File:Weltmer Law Relations.jpg|thumb|Weltmer Law Relations]]
F. H. Behncke wrote in his 1920 book, ''Pioneer Teachers'', that the Weltmer Institute "may be called the foremost school for mental healing in America".&lt;ref name="Behncke1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=F.

The institute had a significant effect on the town of Nevada, Missouri. It was responsible for such an increase in volume of mail handled by the local post office, that these functions were upgraded to first class and housed in a new building. In addition, other of the town's facilities expanded in response to the business generated by the institute's activities.&lt;ref name=ndm2004&gt;{{cite news

Weltmer, and his institute, were attacked by critics. In his booklet of 1900, ''The Exposé of Weltmerism: Magnetic Healing De-magnetized'', Preston W. Pope described what he saw as errors in Welmer's practice;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA)''' is a global not-for-profit professional organization representing family physicians and [[general practitioner]]s from all regions of the world.  WONCA's mission is to improve the quality of life of the peoples of the world through high standards of care in general practice/family medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/AboutWonca/brief.aspx |title= About WONCA: WONCA in brief |publisher=WONCA Global Family Doctor |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WONCA is a non-governmental organization in official relations with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) representing family doctors and [[family medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/workforcealliance/members_partners/member_list/wonca/en/ |title= Global Health Workforce Alliance: Members &amp; partners: WONCA - World Organization of Family Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

WONCA was founded in 1972 and now has over 130 Member Organisations representing some 600,000 family doctors in some 150 countries and territories around the world.  WONCA has seven regions – Africa, Asia Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Iberoamericana-CIMF, North America, and South Asia – each with a Regional President and Regional Council.
WONCA supports a number of Working Parties, Special Interest Groups, and Young Doctors Movements. These bodies work to progress specific areas of interest to WONCA and its members around the globe. The groups involve hundreds of family doctors in their activities. Over the years they have carried out groundbreaking studies and research, and have produced many important publications. There are currently 11 Working Parties, including Education, Research, Quality Care, and Classification, and ten Special Interest Groups. Young Doctors Movements include "Vasco da Gama" in Europe; "Rajakumar" in Asia Pacific; "Spice Route" in South Asia; "Waynakay" in Iberoamericana; "AfriWON" in Africa; "Al Razi" in Eastern Mediterranean and "Polaris" in North America.

The acronym WONCA is derived from the first five initials of the World Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family Physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2777587/pdf/MHFM-06-057.pdf |title=Reports from the colleges: WONCA |journal=Mental Health in Family Medicine |date= March 2009 |number=6 |pages=57–9|accessdate=22 October 2014 |pmc=2777587 |pmid=22477889 |volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current President of WONCA is [[Michael Kidd (physician)|Professor Michael Kidd]], from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/AboutWonca/TheWONCAPresident.aspx |title= About WONCA: The WONCA President |publisher=WONCA Global Family Doctor |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amanda Howe|Professor Amanda Howe]] is the President-Elect and will become WONCA's first female President in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/AboutWonca/ExecutiveCommittee/PresidentElect2013.aspx |title=President-Elect 2013-16: Prof Amanda Howe (UK) |publisher=WONCA Global Family Doctor |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WONCA’s Secretariat, led by the CEO Dr Garth Manning, is based in Bangkok, Thailand.
