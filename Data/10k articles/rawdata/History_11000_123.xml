'''Advanced Persistent Threat 33''' (APT33) is a hacker group identified by [[FireEye]] as being supported by the [[government of Iran]].&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-apt33/ |date=September 20, 2017 |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |title=New Group of Iranian Hackers Linked to Destructive Malware}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FireEye"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html |publisher=[[FireEye]] |first=Jacqueline |last=O'Leary |first2=Josiah |last2=Kimble |first3=Kelli |last3=Vanderlee |first4=Nalani |last4=Fraser |date=September 20, 2017 |title=Insights into Iranian Cyber Espionage: APT33 Targets Aerospace and Energy Sectors and has Ties to Destructive Malware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FireEye believes that the group was formed no later than 2013.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

==Targets==
APT33 has reportedly targeted [[aerospace industry|aerospace]], [[defense industry|defense]] and [[Petrochemical industry|petrochemical]] industry targets in the [[United States]], [[South Korea]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt;

==Modus operandi==
APT33 reportedly uses a [[Dropper (malware)|dropper]] program designated DropShot, which can deploy a [[Wiper (malware)|wiper]] called ShapeShift, or install a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] called TurnedUp.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; The group is reported to use the ALFASHELL tool to send [[spear-phishing]] emails loaded with malicious [[HTML Application]] files to its targets.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt;

APT33 registered domains impersonating many commercial entities, including [[Boeing]], Alsalam Aircraft Company, [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Vinnell]].&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt;

==Identification==
FireEye and [[Kaspersky Lab]] noted similarities between the ShapeShift and [[Shamoon]], another [[Computer virus|virus]] linked to Iran.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; APT33 also used [[Farsi]] in ShapeShift and DropShot, and was most active during [[Iran Standard Time]] business hours, remaining inactive on the Iranian weekend.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt;

One hacker known by the [[pseudonym]] of xman_1365_x was linked to both the TurnedUp tool code and the Iranian Nasr Institute, which has been connected to the [[Iranian Cyber Army]].&lt;ref name="DB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FireEye"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-assembly-trump-russia/russia-rebukes-trump-over-iran-north-korea-accuses-u-s-of-missile-treaty-breach-idUSKCN1BV1QE |date=September 20, 2017 |title=Once 'kittens' in cyber spy world, Iran gaining hacking prowess: security experts |first=Eric |last=Auchard |quote=FireEye found some ties between APT33 and the Nasr Institute - which other experts have connected to the Iranian Cyber Army, an offshoot of the Revolutionary Guards - but it has yet to find any links to a specific government agency, Hultquist said. |first2=Jeremy |last2=Wagstaff |first3=Bozorgmehr |last3=Sharafedin |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; xman_1365_x has accounts on Iranian hacker forums, including Shabgard and Ashiyane.&lt;ref name="DB"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[The Daily Beast]]'' |quote=Included in a piece of non-public malware APT33 uses called TURNEDUP is the username “xman_1365_x.” xman has accounts on a selection of Iranian hacking forums, such as Shabgard and Ashiyane, although FireEye says it did not find any evidence to suggest xman was formally part of those site’s hacktivist groups. In its report, FireEye links xman to the “Nasr Institute,” a hacking group allegedly controlled by the Iranian government. |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/suspected-iranian-hackers-targeted-us-aerospace-sector |first=Joseph |last=Cox |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921010243/http://www.thedailybeast.com/suspected-iranian-hackers-targeted-us-aerospace-sector |archive-date=September 21, 2017 |title=Suspected Iranian Hackers Targeted U.S. Aerospace Sector}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alena Hájková''' (11 October 1924 in Prague – 2 August 2012 in Prague) was a Czech Communist resistance fighter and historian.

==Resistance==
Alena née Divišová was born in 1924 to a working class [[Prague]] family in [[Vršovice]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalibor Státník, "Spravedlivá mezi národy: Alena Hájková (1942-2012)," Dějiny a současnost 34,9, (2012), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; At 14, she left school and went to train as a seamstress. It was in her job that she met a Jewish friend, through who she was introduced to a  Jewish circle of leftist [[Hashomer Hatzair]]. This group of Jewish and non-Jewish Communist friends formed in 1943 the [[Resistance in German-occupied Czechoslovakia|resistance group Přehledy]]. Among them, Hájková met Jany Lebovič from eastern part of Czechoslovakia, with whom she fell in love. When the transports to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp#Main fortress|Theresienstadt]] started in fall 1941, Hájková and her family helped the deportees with food and preparation for transports.&lt;ref name="Čelovský"&gt;Bořivoj Čelovský, ed., Alenka: K osmdesátinám dr Aleny Hájkové (Šenov u Ostravy: Tilia, 2004), festschrift&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[gentile]]s in the group supported the Jewish members avoid transports under a false, non-Jewish identity. Among those who had gone to hiding was Lebovič. Hájková participated in help for Jewish friends and other resistance: in the first months of Terezín ghetto, she visited a few times and smuggled food to her friends. Later, she actively organized papers for those who went into illegality.&lt;ref name="Čelovský" /&gt; In March 1944, she was arrested and deported to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp#Small Fortress|Small Fortress Theresienstadt]] and in July 1944 to [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]. Before her liberation in April 1945, she was forced to do forced labor for the German armament industry, firm [[Hasag]] in the [[Schlieben]] and [[Altenburg]] satellite camps of [[Buchenwald]]. Hájková escaped in April 1945 from a [[death march]] during a bomb raid in Zwickau.&lt;ref name="Čelovský" /&gt;

==Postwar==
Upon her return to Prague, Hájková learned that her fiancé had been arrested together with most of the Přehledy in August 1944, and murdered in [[Auschwitz]]. She and a friend from Přehledy, [[Miloš Hájek]], married and had two sons. Her granddaughter Anna is a historian at the [[University of Warwick]]. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1971. She started studying in 1945 at the University of Political and Social Affairs (Vysoká škola politická a sociální), but her studies were interrupted when her children were born. Via long distance, Hájková studied history at the [[Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague|Philosophical Faculty of the Charles University]] and, in 1960, received her PhD. All the while, she was supporting her husband who was doing academic career. In 1952, at the height of [[Slánský trials]], she was one of the few who supported her friends when they were arrested. In 1960, she started working full time as historian: until 1965, she worked as lecturer of humanities at [[ČVUT]], next five years at the Czechoslovak committee for history of antifascists resistance.&lt;ref name="Čelovský" /&gt; During [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]], she spent her last working years as specialist in the [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|defense ministry]], where it was her job to write confirmations about participation in resistance according to the [https://www.psp.cz/sqw/sbirka.sqw?cz=255&amp;r=1946 law 255/1946]. This law enabled many former resistance fighters, who were now dissidents, to live on an early pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.badatelna.eu/fond/4706/ |title=Národní archiv - Hájková Alena, PhDr. |language=[[Czech language|Czech]] |work=www.badatelna.eu |publisher=LemonBone s.r.o. |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Hájková's expertise was leftist and Communist resistance in Second World War; she focused on individual people and wrote about Jewish Communist resistance fighters who were politically unpopular. Her books and articles are still in circulation, unlike most of contemporary Czech scholarship. In 1989, Hájková was reunited with her old Jewish friends from resistance who had emigrated to Israel and US. In 1991, she was awarded the title [[Righteous among the nations]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/righteousName.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4015186 |title=Alena Hájková |work=[[Yad Vashem]] |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, she coedited a critical edition of [[Julius Fucik (journalist)|Julius Fučík's Notes from the Gallows]]. She cooperated with [[Miroslav Kárný]] on researching the Holocaust and resistance in the [[Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]], and contributed to the research of the Terezín Memorial, including their prisoner database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Annales'' school}} 
The '''''Annales'' school''' ({{IPA-fr|a'nal}}) is a group of historians associated with a style of [[historiography]] developed by French [[historians]] in the 20th century to stress long-term [[social history]]. It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of [[Marxist historiography]].

The school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919–1996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915–2012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921–1984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923–2009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924–2014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (1929– ) and includes Jacques Revel,&lt;ref&gt;Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'études'' (full professor); he served as president of the École from 1995 to 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philippe Ariès]] (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalités''.  The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (1945– ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
  
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of Economic and Social History"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices
Janmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee '' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argues that "in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric J. Hobsbawm|title=Interesting Times: A Twentieth-century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQqAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=295|isbn=9780375422348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.&lt;ref&gt;One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire &amp; mesure'' (1986– ), devoted to quantitative history.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge," 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 [[postmodern]] sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is "no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, "Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social," in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalités''.&lt;ref&gt;On the decline of Annales, see Hunt (1986); for a summary of the movement see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The journal==
{{main article|Annales d'histoire économique et sociale}}
The journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939–1942, 1945), ''Mélanges d'histoire sociale'' (1942–1944), ''Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations'' (1946–1994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994– ).&lt;ref name="journal names"&gt;P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929–89'', p. 116 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography&lt;ref&gt;See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the intellectual world view of common people, or "mentality" (''mentalité''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, "Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography," ''Past &amp; Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Hexter, "Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien," '' Historians,'' pp. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch's interests were  highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hilkovitch &amp; Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'', were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].

==Precepts==
[[Georges Duby]], a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Duby, ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' (1973), forward&lt;/ref&gt;
The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.

==Postwar==
Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in World War II for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a "second" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].

==''Mentalités''==
Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations ("longue durée") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalités'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalité'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalité'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalité'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalité'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braudel's first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalité''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

==Regionalism==
Before ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''[[Philip II of Spain|Philippe II]] et la [[Franche-Comté]].'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.

The ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La Méditerranée.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Hinrichs, "Provinzen, Landschaften, Regionen in Der Modernen Französischen Geschichtswissenschaft – Ein Essay," ''Blätter Für Deutsche Landesgeschichte'' 1994 130: 1–12. {{ISSN|0006-4408}} Fulltext: [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact outside France==
The ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]. [[Franciszek Bujak]] (1875–1953) and [[Jan Rutkowski]] (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the "[[Polish October]]" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s [[Federico Brito Figueroa]] was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the "Annales School" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Nil Santiáñez-Tió, "Temporalidad y discurso histórico: Propuesta de una renovación metodológica de la historia de la literatura española moderna." [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature]. ''Hispanic Review'' 1997 65(3): 267–290. {{ISSN|0018-2176}} Fulltext: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474948  in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;   In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''[[The Practice of History]]'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]''. One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the ''Annales'' school was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of "new social history" from entirely different roots.  Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer [[Louis Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]] school centered on [[Bernard Slicher van Bath]] was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative "school" of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Jan |last=Kuys |title=Bernard Hendrik Slicher van Bath |encyclopedia=Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland |publisher=Verloren |year=2006 |url=http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Has been cited as a key influence in the development of [[World Systems Theory]] by sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel M. 2004. World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
The current leader is [[Roger Chartier]], who is Directeur d'Études at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, Professeur in the [[Collège de France]], and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of "practices," his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of "materials," his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of "places," his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11134">'''Antonio Tovar Llorente''' (Valladolid, 17 May 1911 – Madrid, 13 December 1985) was a Spanish [[philologist]], [[linguist]] and [[historian]].

==Biography==
The son of a [[notary]], he grew up in [[Elorrio]] (Vizcaya), [[Morella, Castellón|Morella]] (Castellón) and [[Villena]] (Alicante) where as a child he learned to speak [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Valencian language|Valencian]]. He studied Law at the [[Real Centro Universitario Escorial-Maria Christina|Universidad María Cristina de El Escorial]], History at the [[University of Valladolid]], and Classical Philology in Madrid, Paris and Berlin . He had as teachers, among others Cayetano de Mergelina, [[Manuel Gómez-Moreno González|Manuel Gómez-Moreno]], [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] and [[Eduard Schwyzer]].

He was president of the University Student Federation (FUE) in  Valladolid, a republican-leaning organisation, but in September 1936 after beginning the civil war, he adopted a [[Falangist]] attitude influenced by his intimate friend [[Dionisio Ridruejo]], and became one of those responsible for the propaganda of the nationalist government in [[Burgos]], though his disillusionment with the [[Francisco Franco]] regime started.

During the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]] he was in Berlin visiting a [[Hitler Youth]] camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/1985/12/15/opinion/503449204_850215.html El comienzo de la guerra: de Berlín a Valladolid, El País (15/12/1985)]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the nationalist zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/1986/07/18/opinion/522021621_850215.html De Berlín a Valladolid, El País (18/07/1986)]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Ridruejo as National Chief of Propaganda entrusted the radio  departament to Tovar and he was made responsible for [[Radio Nacional de España]] when it was being broadcast from [[Salamanca]] (1938). He also worked with the Falangist newspaper  ''Arriba España'' in [[Pamplona]],{{Sfn|Rodríguez Puértolas|2008|p=382}} edited by Fermín Yzurdiaga.

Following his relationship with Ridruejo and in the orbit of [[Ramón Serrano Súñer]], from December 1940 to April 1941 he occupied the position of Under-Secretary of Press and Propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;DECRETO de 14 de diciembre de 1940 por el que se nombra Subsecretario de Prensa y Propaganda del Ministerio de la Gobernación a don Antonio Tovar Llorente&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied Serrano Súñer on several trips to Germany&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis Suárez Fernández]] ''Franco'', Barcelona, Ariel, 2005. {{ISBN|84-344-6781-X}}, página 176&lt;/ref&gt; and Italy and during some of these he was present in some meetings with [[Mussolini]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnortedecastilla.es/valladolid/201510/31/vallisoletano-negocio-hitler-20151022172200.html El vallisoletano que negoció con Hitler, El Norte de Castilla (31/10/15))]&lt;/ref&gt; and with Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnortedecastilla.es/valladolid/201510/22/nido-fuhrer-disidencia-politica-20151022172830.html Del nido del Führer a la disidencia política, El Norte de Castilla (31/10/15))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving political life, he obtained the Latin lectureship at the [[University of Salamanca]] in 1942 and from then on devoted himself to teaching and research. He married Consuelo Larrucea the same year. He was member of the early [[Cortes Españolas|Francoist legislatures]].

During the ministry of [[Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez|Ruiz-Giménez]] (1951–1956), Tovar was appointed rector of the university. As rector, he organized the celebrations of its seventh centenary,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enclaverevista.com/enclavede/articulo.php?id_articulo=3846 Exposición de fotos de Guzmán Gombau sobre el VII Centenario]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was attended by the rectors of the main universities of the world, who made a memorable parade through the streets of Salamanca with their traditional costumes.

As a result of the centennial celebration of the centennial in 1954, Salamanca restarted awarding doctoral degrees (which the Moyano Law had reserved exclusively to the [[Central University of Madrid]])  A large amount of bibliographic materials, which had been taken by French troops leaving Spain in 1813 and kept in the [[Palais-Royal]] library,  were returned to the university library.

He created{{clarify|date=January 2018}} the first chair of "Basque language and literature" in Spain, at the [[University of Salamanca]]; its first holder was [[Koldo Mitxelena]].

Officially Tovar remained rector of Salamanca until 1963, even though he had previously left Spain.

He was a professor at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (1948–1949) and the [[National University of Tucumán]] (1958–1959), where he studied the indigenous languages of northern Argentina and tried to create a school that would continue his work in this field.

At the [[University of Illinois]], he was first named 'Miller Visiting Professor of Classics' (1960–1961), and then 'Professor of Classics' (1963–1967). In 1965 he gained the Latin chair at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]], which allowed him to return to Spain. Soon after arriving, there was a student protest, culminating in a demonstration led by Tierno Galván, Aranguren, García Calvo and Montero Díaz. When they were expelled  from the university of these (the first three permanently and Montero Diaz temporarily), Tovar resigned in solidarity and returned to the United States until 1967, when he was called to occupy the chair of comparative linguistics in the [[University of Tubingen]] (Germany), where he taught until his retirement in 1979.

He devoted his studies to classical philology and to a large number of languages, including Basque (a Basque-language etymological dictionary is now being published, in collaboration with [[Manuel Agud]] and [[Koldo Mitxelena]]), proto-Indo-European languages, other indigenous languages of the peninsula such as [[Iberian language|Iberian]], and Amerindian languages. (At the University of Salamanca, a chair in Amerindian languages bears his name.) He spoke a dozen languages and knew 150 others.

He was editor of the magazine ''Emerita'' (1939-1944), ''Minos'' (1951–1968, along with E. Peruzzi and MS Ruipérez ) and ''Acta Salamantisencia'' (1944-1951). He wrote literary criticism in the magazine ''Gaceta Ilustrada''.

'''Archaeology of the Romani people''' refers to the science of [[archaeology]] as applied in relation to the [[Romani people]], an ethnic group [[Romani diaspora|dispersed]] across the world, which is known under several different [[Names of the Romani people|names]]. The Romani people has a long [[History of the Romani people|history]], and most likely hails from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Throughout said history, the highly diverse Roma population has faced significant persecution – [[antiziganism]] – in many parts of the world, and continues to do so today.

==History and status==

Due to the Romani people's frequent status as outsiders in regards to mainstream society and a constant minority, lacking any form of [[nation state]] and in turn facing structural bias and neglect from many national, regional and local governments and authorities, the research done into Romani history and culture has often been either lacking or non-existent. In modern times, even when this issue gradually being resolved in some areas, the field of Romani archaeology remains virtually unexplored. For example, the prominent [[Hungary|Hungarian]] archaeologist [[Eszter Bánffy]] ([[:de:Eszter Bánffy|de]]), director of the ''Römisch-Germanische Kommission'' of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], has written that in all of post-[[Cold War]] era [[Eastern Europe]], she has not found a single archaeologist of Romani heritage, nor anyone interested in researching let alone excavating possible Romani archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="Banffy2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bánffy |first=Eszter |editor1-last=Biehl |editor1-first=Peter F. |editor2-last=Prescott |editor2-first=Christopher |title=Heritage in the Context of Globalization: Europe and the Americas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQBPg8SGBxMC|accessdate=6 February 2015 |date=15 December 2012 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-1-4614-6077-0 |page=79 |chapter=The Nonexisting Roma Archaeology and the Nonexisting Roma Archaeologists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[France|French]] sociologist Jean-Pierre Liégeois ([[:fr:Jean-Pierre Liégeois|fr]]), director of the Gypsy Research Centre, has asserted that due to their often highly mobile lifestyle and frequent societal discrimination, the Romani have left behind no such archaeological sites,&lt;ref name="Liégeois1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Liégeois|first=Jean-Pierre|title=Roma, Gypsies, Travellers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7l-fGIA2ZkC&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=1 January 1994|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|location=[[Strasbourg]]|isbn=978-92-871-2349-7|page=111|chapter=Lifestyle and Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been some limited field surveys and excavations of Romani-related sites.

===Scandinavia===

[[File:Snarsmon h.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Excavated building foundations in Snarsmon, Sweden, 2009.]]

This is especially the case in [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], where the [[Norwegian and Swedish Travellers]] arrived in the early 16th century. Two sites in particular have gone through several stages of excavation, with a third excavation project beginning in 2015. One is Snarsmon (also pejoratively called Tattarstaden, roughly ''the Gypsy Town''), a Romani village close to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] border in [[Tanum Municipality]] which was active as a sanctuary from the 1860s until the first years of the 20th century. Surveys began in 2003, with yearly excavations between 2004 and 2007. Done in the style of [[community archaeology]], participants – other than professional archaeologists – included both local inhabitants of non-Romani origin, as well as members from several Traveller organizations and one Roma cultural association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindholm |first=Kristina |date=2012 |chapter=Arkeologiska utgrävningar på Snarsmon |editor1-last=Andersson |editor1-first=Bodil |title=Snarsmon – resandebyn där vägar möts |location=[[Uddevalla]] |publisher=Bohusläns museum |page=78 |isbn=978-91-7686-247-6 |language=Swedish }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 February 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One result of this project was the establishment in 2012 of the first Swedish museum exhibition about Traveller history, located in the town of [[Uddevalla]], featuring some of the objects found during the excavations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Andersson |first=Birgitta |date=23 March 2012 |title=Resandefolket får egen utställning |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=125&amp;artikel=5032547 |newspaper=[[Sveriges Radio P4|P4 Väst]] |language=Swedish |location=[[Uddevalla]] |access-date=6 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Möt resandefolket! - Sveriges första permanenta utställning om resandefolket öppnar på Bohusläns museum. |language=Swedish |url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/vastarvet/pressreleases/moet-resandefolket-sveriges-foersta-permanenta-utstaellning-om-resandefolket-oeppnar-paa-bohuslaens-museum-735963 |publisher=[[Västra Götaland Regional Council]] |agency=[[Mynewsdesk]] |date=2 March 2012 |access-date=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Swedish site is Krämarstaden (roughly translated, ''the Huckster Town''), likewise a Romani village, located near [[Finnerödja]] in [[Laxå Municipality]]. The village was established in the first years of the 20th century, and abandoned in the beginning of the 1920s. Core surveys began at the same time as those in Snarsmon, with two phases of archaeological excavation taking place in 2013 and 2014, which much like the previous project involved professional archaeologists and other scientists, local inhabitants, and Swedish Travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vasternorrland/SiteCollectionDocuments/Sv/om-lansstyrelsen/eu-och-internationellt/vara-projekt/kalejdoskop/kramarstaden_plats_och_berattelse.pdf |title=Krämarstaden – plats och berättelse |last=Sannerstedt |first=Helen |language=Swedish |date=2011 |website=www.lansstyrelsen.se |publisher=Örebro läns museum |accessdate=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206230810/http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vasternorrland/SiteCollectionDocuments/Sv/om-lansstyrelsen/eu-och-internationellt/vara-projekt/kalejdoskop/kramarstaden_plats_och_berattelse.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Swedish |last=Mattsson |first=Jesper |date=11 October 2013 |title=Här grävs resandefolkets historia fram |url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/tvarsnytt/har-gravs-resandefolkets-historia-fram |newspaper=[[Sveriges Television]] |location=[[Stockholm]] |access-date=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206223030/http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/tvarsnytt/har-gravs-resandefolkets-historia-fram |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2015, excavations began at a Romani campsite outside of [[Stockholm]], in [[Skarpnäck (borough)|Skarpnäck]]. The camp was built in 1959 by the Swedish state as a temporary solution, until apartments could be arranged for the Romani, who had just been given full civic rights (and with that, a right to housing). The camp soon became permanent as the administrative process was dragged out, its inhabitants – about thirty people – living in tents, caravans and two home-built cottages, exposed to the weather. The two-year project, titled ''I stadens utkant'' (''In the City's Fringe''), is financed partially by the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]], and is a cooperative project between the [[Swedish History Museum]], the cultural association ''É Romani Glinda'' (the Romani Mirror), Mångkulturellt Centrum (Multicultural Center) in [[Botkyrka Municipality|Botkyrka]], and Stiftelsen Kulturmiljövård (the Cultural Environment Management Foundation). It will result in a book and an excavation report, in addition to certain finds forming part of the "Sweden's History" exhibition at the Swedish History Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kandi |first=Layla |date=8 April 2015 |title=Nytt projekt lyfter fram svensk-romernas förlorade kulturarv |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=478&amp;artikel=6136335 |newspaper=[[Sveriges Radio]] |language=Swedish |access-date=5 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tottmar |first=Mia |date=27 August 2015 |title=Här berättas en saknad del av Sveriges romska historia |url=http://www.dn.se/sthlm/har-berattas-en-saknad-del-av-sveriges-romska-historia/ |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish |access-date=5 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other archaeological sites belonging to the Romani people and the Scandinavian Travellers exist in Sweden as well as Norway, some of which were surveyed and mapped out in the transnational Scandinavian Traveller Map project. One of these, Tattardalen (''Gypsy Valley'') in [[Kungälv Municipality]], is a ruined farmstead dating back to the 1600s, and is therefore the oldest Scandinavian site connected to the Travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bohuslansmuseum.se/Vastarvet/Verksamheter/Bohuslans-museum/Faktasidor/Resandefolket/Resandekartan/ |title=Resandefolkets kulturminnen på kartan |author= |website=www.bohuslansmuseum.se |language=Swedish |publisher=Bohusläns museum |accessdate=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206225621/http://www.bohuslansmuseum.se/Vastarvet/Verksamheter/Bohuslans-museum/Faktasidor/Resandefolket/Resandekartan/ |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsewhere===

Another example of possibly Romani-related archaeology is a June 2010 excavation of the "Caird’s Cave" in [[Rosemarkie]], [[Scotland]], a site possibly inhabited by [[Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/273768.pdf |title=Excavations at Caird’s Cave,  Rosemarkie, 2010: Data Structure Report |last=Anderson‐Whymark |first=Hugo |date=2011 |website=www.her.highland.gov.uk |publisher=[[Politics of the Highland council area|Highland Council]] |accessdate=6 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to archaeology directly relating to Romani sites, there have also been some research done into the [[archaeogenetics]] and "linguistic archaeology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bakker |first1=Peter |last2=Monrad |first2=Astrid |date=2011 |title=Roma: linguistic archaeology of nomads |url=http://am.uis.no/getfile.php/Arkeologisk%20museum/publikasjoner/Varia-53-peterbakker-og-astridmonrad.pdf |journal=AmS-Varia |publisher=[[Stavanger Museum|Arkeologisk museum i Stavanger]] |issue=53 |pages=35–44 |access-date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Romani people. An example of this is the discovery of a skeleton in a [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] cemetery under [[Norwich Castle]] in [[Norfolk]], which – as reported by ''[[Council for British Archaeology|British Archaeology]]'' – was genetically identified as a possible Romani man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2008 |title=DNA surprise: Romani in England 400 years too early |url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba89/news.shtml#item4 |journal=[[Council for British Archaeology|British Archaeology]] |publisher=[[Council for British Archaeology]] |issue=89 |access-date=4 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923173717/http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba89/news.shtml#item4 |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Judson Brown''' (December 3, 1856 – January 11, 1963) was an American clergyman, [[missionary]] and author.

Brown was born in [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], and was ordained as a [[Presbyterian]] minister in 1883. Brown preached in various cities throughout the United States, including [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Oak Park, Illinois]] from 1883 to 1895. 

Often termed a "missionary statesman," Brown traveled throughout the world—most notably in China and other Asian countries. During the time Brown surveyed China, he wrote a seventeen-volume diary of what he'd seen and discovered.  Over time, Brown communicated with Roman Catholic, Jewish, and [[Greek Orthodox]] leaders, in addition to such influential Protestant clergymen as [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], [[Nathan Söderblom]], and [[John R. Mott]]. Brown himself received letters from five American Presidents and various other government officials. [[Booker T. Washington]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] (1839–1937), and [[John Wanamaker]] were among his famous American correspondents. In addition, members of European and Asian royalty, including Chinese general and emperor, [[Yuan Shih-kai]], were in communication with Brown. 

Overall, Brown will be remembered as a pioneer in the [[ecumenical]] and world missionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries and was an individual who was active in and out of the church. He served in a plethora of notable positions. The following is a lengthy chronology of Brown's achievements and activities. During this time Brown also preached at various churches.
 
Arthur Judson Brown died in New York City in 1963, 39 days after celebrating his [[Centenarians|106th birthday]]. He was subsequently buried in [[Orange, New Jersey]].

'''The Association for History and Computing''' (AHC) is an organization dedicated to the use of computers in [[history|historical]] research.

The AHC is an international organization with the aim of promoting the use of computers in all types of historical study, both for teaching and research. 
It was originally proposed at a conference at [[Westfield College]], [[University of London]], in March 1986. It was founded during a second conference at the same location a year later in March 1987.

The Association oversees a journal, ''[[History and Computing]]'', published by the [[Edinburgh University Press]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1633">The "'''Azes era'''" (also known as the Aja/Ajasa era), was named after the [[Indo-Scythian]] king, "King Azes the Great" or [[Azes I]]. As a number of inscriptions are dated in this era it is of great importance in dating the reigns of several kings and events in early [[Indian history]].

Earlier, some scholars believed that the Azes era was same as the [[Vikrama Samvat]] (57 BCE) used in India. However, this was disputed by Robert Bracey following discovery of an inscription of [[Vijayamitra]], which is dated in two eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alf Hiltebeitel |title=Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mahābhārata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLfHSOWKB-sC |date=2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-18566-6 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Falk and Bennett (2009) shows that these two were indeed separate eras, and that the Azes era can be dated with a high degree of likelihood to c. 48/47 or 47/46 BCE, depending on whether it began in the spring or the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Falk and Bennett (2009), pp. 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Brindisi (1156)''' was fought by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kingdom of Sicily]] over control of Southern Italy. 

The battle was part of a Byzantine campaign orchestrated by the emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] to recover [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] for the Byzantine Empire by taking advantage of the chaotic political situation in Norman Sicily following the death of [[Roger II]] and the succession of the [[William I of Sicily|William 'the Bad']].{{sfn|Magdalino|2017|p=58}}  While the Byzantine forces managed to take control of numerous southern Italian cities, including [[Bari]], the defeat at [[Brindisi]], inflicted during a protracted Byzantine siege of the city, effectively put an end to the Byzantine attempt at reconquest.{{sfn|Magdalino|2017|p=61}} 

Following the defeat, the Byzantine diplomat [[John Axouch]] arrived at the Byzantine base of [[Ancona]] in order to negotiate a favorable treaty with William. He was incredibly successful, and his negotiations allowed Manuel to exit the war with honor, despite a series of large-scale, successful Norman raids of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coasts of [[Greece]] and the consolidation of Norman Sicily under William.{{sfn|Magdalino|2017|p=61}}

'''Béla Ferenc József Grünwald de Bártfa''' ({{lang-hu|bártfai Grünwald Béla Ferenc József}}; 2 December 1839 – 4 May 1891) was a Hungarian nationalist politician and historian who was active in [[Upper Hungary]] (today mostly [[Slovakia]]).

==Life and career==
His father was a [[Zipser German]], Augustin Grünwald, while his mother Johanna Majovszky was a noble woman with Polish ancestry.
Born in [[Svätý Anton|Szentantal]], he trained as a lawyer, receiving a degree from the [[Royal University of Pest]]. Serving first as administrator (''[[ispán|alispán]]'') of [[Zólyom County]], in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1878|1878 elections]] he was elected a member of the Hungarian [[Országgyűlés|House of Representatives]] for Szliács (modern [[Sliač]]) in that county  as a member of the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]; he subsequently left the Liberals in 1880, serving as an independent before joining the [[Moderate Opposition]] party.{{sfn|Sturm|1888|p=213}} He was an activist for the assimilationist policies of [[Magyarisation]] in the predominantly Slovak region of Upper Hungary, founding and supporting the [[Upper Hungary Magyar Educational Society]].{{sfn|Kirschbaum|2010|p=300}} He viewed the construction of a centralised state as a political priority.{{sfn|Pók|1982|p=24}}

In his book "Közigazgatásunk és a szabadság" (Budapest, 1876) (Our public administration and freedom) he explained his views about the nationalization/Hungarianization policy, he urged the Hungarian politicians to act so effective and inexorable, like the French did in France and English did in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Közigazgatásunk és a szabadság" (Budapest, 1876)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a historian, Grünwald became a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] after the publication of his 1888 work, ''The Old Hungary'' (''A régi Magyarország'').{{sfn|Sturm|1888|p=213}} In his historical works, he pursued a [[People's history|"democratic" method]] of [[historiography]].{{sfn|Lakatos|1910|p=416}} He stated in ''The New Hungary'' (''Az új Magyarország''), the sequel to his 1888 book, "The genius, too, is born. He is born in a particular age, as a member of a particular nation, a class and a family, and the stamp these circles press onto his personality in his youth stays on him even if he has later come into conflict with them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#{{harvid|Lakatos|1910}}|Lakatos 1910]], p. 416. "A géniusz is születik. Születik egy bizonyos korban, mint egy nemzet, egy osztály s egy család tagja, s a bélyeg, melyet e körök ifjú korában nyomnak egyéniségére, megmarad rajta még akkor is, ha később ellentétbe jutott vele."&lt;/ref&gt; He charged the Hungarian nobility with a lack of national sentiment, and feeling greater solidarity with nobles from other nations than with the Hungarian nation;{{sfn|Benedek|1898|p=310}} the nobles, he argued, had neglected the development of Hungary as a [[nation-state]].{{sfn|Pók|1982|p=24}} Nevertheless, on 22 April 1889, he accepted [[ennoblement]] from [[Emperor Franz Joseph I]], becoming "de Bártfa" (''bártfai'').{{sfn|Lakatos|1910|p=416}}

Grünwald committed suicide by gunshot wound to the head in unclear circumstances while visiting Paris on 4 May 1891.{{sfn|Reszler|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Lackó|1986|p=14}} Shortly before his suicide, he sent a telegram to [[Albert Apponyi]], the leader of the Moderate Opposition, briefly notifying him of his death: "Béla Grünwald has died after a long period of suffering".&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Lackó|1986}}|Lackó 1986]], p. 15. "Grünwald Béla hosszú szenvedés után meghalt."&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous dramatic 1929 account, ''The Paris Story'' (''A párizsi regény''),{{sfn|Wilkinson|2009|p=105}} [[Dezső Szomory]] describes Grünwald's death and burial:

{{blockquote|He committed suicide on the bank of the Seine, just next to the water, thinking in one final thought that the water current would take him far away. But the water current didn't hurt him; it only washed the wound on his temple ... Grünwald's burial at [[Montmartre Cemetery]] was yet more dismal. On this autumnal day, [the cemetery] was like an English landscape, with plenty of grey air, some trees, some shrubs ...|Dezső Szomory|''A párizsi regény''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#{{harvid|Cs. Szabó|1939}}|Cs. Szabó 1939]], p. 45. "A Szajna partján lett öngyilkos, közvetlenül a víz mentén, úgy gondolván egy utolsó gondolatján, a víz sodra el fogja vinni messze. De a víz sodra nem bántotta, csak a sebét mosta el a halántékán ... Még szomorúbb volt Grünwald temetése a Montmartre-temetőben. Olyan volt ez ezen az őszi napon, mint egy angol tájkép, sok szürke levegővel, néhány fával, néhány cserjével ..."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grünwald's [[epitaph]] reads, "Here lies Béla Grünwald, unbreakable apostle of the Hungarian theory of the state."&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Pók|1982}}|Pók 1982]], p. 24. "Itt nyugszik Grünwald Béla, a magyar állameszme törhetetlen apostola."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniil Leonidovich Andreyev''' ({{lang-rus|Дании́л Леони́дович Андре́ев|p=dənʲɪˈil lʲɪɐˈnʲidəvʲɪtɕ ɐnˈdrʲejɪf|a=Daniil Lyeonidovich Andryeyev.ru.vorb.oga}}; November 2, 1906, [[Berlin]] – March 30, 1959, Moscow) was a Russian writer, poet, and Christian [[mysticism|mystic]].

== Biography ==
Daniil Andreyev, the son of [[Leonid Andreyev]] (a prominent Russian writer of the start of the 20th century), had [[Maxim Gorky]] as his godfather. After the infant's mother, Aleksandra Mikhailovna (Veligorskaya) Andreyeva (a great-niece of [[Taras Shevchenko]]), died shortly after childbirth, Leonid Andreyev gave the infant Daniil to his late wife's sister, Elizabeth Mikhailovna Dobrova, to raise. This act had two important consequences: it meant that when Leonid Andreev, like many other writers and intellectuals, left Russia (he emigrated to  the newly independent Finland in December 1917 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Bolshevik Revolution]]), his young son remained behind; it also meant that Daniil was raised in a household that remained deeply religious.

Like many{{quantify|date=June 2015}} of his contemporaries, the boy Daniil had a pronounced literary bent; he began writing poetry and prose in early childhood. He graduated from high school but could not attend university because of his "non-proletarian" background. Supporting himself as a graphic artist, he wrote in his spare time.

Daniil Andreyev was conscripted into the [[Red Army]] in 1942. He served as a non-combatant, and during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] of 1941-1944 helped to transport supplies across [[Lake Ladoga]]. After [[World War II]] Andreev returned to civilian life, but the Soviet authorities arrested him in April 1947, charged him with [[anti-Soviet propaganda]] and preparations to assassinate [[Joseph Stalin]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and sentenced him to 25 years of imprisonment. He suffered a heart attack in prison in 1954, the first manifestation of the heart condition that would eventually cause his death. In the same year his sentence was reduced to 10 years. He was released on April 22, 1957,&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;Pavlov, Galina (Галины Павлов): ''[http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2006/11/dva24-pr.html Два письма, три имени]'' (Letters of Andreyev), ''Звезда'' 2006/11. URL last accessed 2007-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; already terminally ill. He was officially [[rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] on July 11, 1957.&lt;ref name="letters"/&gt;

While incarcerated in [[Vladimir Central Prison]] from 1947 to 1957, Andreyev experienced mystic visions and started writing ''[[Roza Mira]]'', finishing it after his release. The book became known in the Soviet Union via [[samizdat]], but was first officially published only in 1991. In 1997 Lindisfarne Books published Jordan Roberts's English-language translation of ''Roza Mira''&lt;ref&gt;

in the USA.

== Works ==
Almost all works that Andreev wrote before 1947, were destroyed by [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security (MGB)]] as "anti-Soviet literature", including his novel ''Wanderers of Night'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Странники ночи}}) about the spiritual opposition to the Soviet regime and atheism.  Being imprisoned, however, Andreev managed to restore some of his poems.  He also tried to restore ''Wanderers of Night'', but he could only restore a few pages of it.  Also some works of his childhood were kept by his friend, including his first poems written at the age of 8.

His main book, ''[[Roza Mira]]'' ({{lang-ru|Роза Мира}}, literally "The Rose of the World") contains a detailed description of numerous layers of spiritual reality that surround Earth, of the forthcoming religion called Roza Mira that will emerge and unite all people and states, and of the events of the future advent of [[Antichrist]] and his fall.

Apart from Roza Mira, he wrote a poem ''The Iron Mystery'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Железная мистерия}}, published in 1990), a "poetic ensemble" (that is what he called it) ''Russian gods'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Русские боги}}, full text published in 1995) and other works.

The '''General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper''' (sometimes called '''Predator B''') is an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) capable of [[remotely controlled]] or [[autonomous flight]] operations, developed by [[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems]] (GA-ASI) primarily for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). The MQ-9 and other UAVs are referred to as Remotely Piloted Vehicles/Aircraft (RPV/RPA) by the USAF to indicate their human ground controllers.&lt;ref name=decision&gt;{{cite web |last=Escutia |first=Sondra |title=4 remotely piloted vehicle squadrons stand up at Holloman |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123175232 |publisher=US Air Force |accessdate=1 January 2012 |date=29 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729155412/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123175232 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Kyle |title=You say "drone," I say "remotely piloted" |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/16/us-aero-arms-summit-drones-idUSTRE5BF4DZ20091216 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=1 January 2012 |date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MQ-9 is the first [[USAF Hunter-Killer |hunter-killer]] UAV designed for long-endurance, [[High-altitude platform |high-altitude]] [[Surveillance aircraft |surveillance]].&lt;ref name=nameMQ9&gt;{{cite web |title='Reaper' moniker given to MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123027012 |publisher=US Air Force |accessdate=1 January 2012 |date=14 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914055555/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123027012 |archivedate=14 September 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the then–[[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]] General [[T. Michael Moseley]] said: "We've moved from using UAVs primarily in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance roles before Operation Iraqi Freedom, to a true hunter-killer role with the Reaper."&lt;ref name="nameMQ9"/&gt;

The MQ-9 is a larger, heavier, and more capable aircraft than the earlier [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator]]; it can be controlled by the same ground systems used to control MQ-1s.  The Reaper has a 950-[[Shaft horsepower |shaft-horsepower]] (712&amp;nbsp;kW) [[turboprop]] engine (compared to the Predator's {{convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on}} piston engine). The greater power allows the Reaper to carry 15 times more [[Aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] payload and cruise at about three times the speed of the MQ-1.&lt;ref name="nameMQ9"/&gt; The aircraft is monitored and controlled by aircrew in the Ground Control Station (GCS), including weapons employment.&lt;ref name=USAFfactsheet/&gt;

In 2008, the [[New York Air National Guard]] [[174th Attack Wing]] began the transition from [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] piloted fighters to MQ-9A Reapers, becoming the first fighter unit to convert entirely to [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle]] (UCAV) use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2007/07/ap_reaper_070715/ |title=Unmanned Reapers bound for Iraq, Afghanistan |author=Charles J.

The USAF operated 195 MQ-9 Reapers as of September 2016,&lt;ref name=Blk5/&gt; and plans to keep the MQ-9 in service into the 2030s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usafs-small-uas-roadmap-calls-for-swarming-kamikaz-424973/ USAF’s Small UAS roadmap calls for swarming ‘kamikaze’ drones] – Flightglobal.com, 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Origins===
General Atomics began development with the "Predator B-001", a proof-of-concept aircraft, which first flew on 2 February 2001. [[Abraham Karem]] is the designer of the Predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Whittle |first1=Richard |title=The Man Who Invented the Predator |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/the-man-who-invented-the-predator-3970502/?no-ist |website=Air &amp; Space Magazine |publisher=Air &amp; Space Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-001 was powered by an [[AlliedSignal]] [[Garrett TPE331]]-10T turboprop engine with {{convert|950|shp}}. It had an airframe that was based on the standard Predator airframe, except with an enlarged fuselage and wings lengthened from {{convert|48|feet}} to {{convert|66|feet}}. The B-001 had a speed of {{convert|220|knots}} and could carry a payload of {{convert|750|lb}} to an altitude of {{convert|50000|feet}} with an endurance of 30 hours.&lt;ref name="GA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uav.com/products/predator_b.html |title=Predator B UAS |publisher=General Atomics |accessdate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011121614/http://www.uav.com/products/predator_b.html |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company refined the design, taking it in two separate directions. The first was a jet-powered version; "Predator B-002" was fitted with a [[Williams FJ44]]-2A [[turbofan]] engine with {{convert|10.2|kN|lbf kgf|lk=on}} thrust. It had payload capacity of {{convert|475|lb}}, a ceiling of {{convert|60000|ft|km}} and endurance of 12 hours. The USAF ordered two airframes for evaluation, delivered in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/predator/ |work=airforce-technology.com |title=Predator RQ-1 / MQ-1 / MQ-9 Reaper |accessdate=12 January 2012}}{{Unreliable source? |reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST |date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two airframes delivered with prototypes B-001 and B-002 (now in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|USAF museum]] at Wright-Patterson AFB). B-002 was originally equipped with the FJ-44 engine but it was removed and a TPE-331-10T was installed so that the USAF could take delivery of two aircraft in the same configuration.

The second direction the design took was the "Predator B-003", referred to by GA as the "Altair", which has a new airframe with an {{convert|84|ft|adj=on}} wingspan and a takeoff weight of approximately {{convert|7000|lb}}. Like the Predator B-001, it is powered by a TPE-331-10YGD turboprop. This variant has a payload capacity of {{convert|3000|lb}}, a maximum ceiling of {{convert|52000|ft|km}}, and an endurance of 36 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Note: endurance figures vary greatly from source to source. The current figure being publicized by the USAF is 14 hours.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vector"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav.html |title=Unmanned Aerial Vehicles |author=Greg Goebel |accessdate=12 January 2012 |date=1 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CJpO2nC0?url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav.html |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, the USAF signed a contract for an initial pair of Predator Bs (001 and 002) for evaluation. Designated YMQ-9s due to their prototype role, they were delivered in 2002.&lt;ref name="GA"/&gt; The USAF referred to it as "Predator B" until it was renamed "Reaper". The USAF aimed for the Predator B to provide an improved "deadly persistence" capability, flying over a combat area night-and-day waiting for a target to present itself, complementing piloted [[attack aircraft]], typically used to drop larger quantities of ordnance on a target, while a cheaper RPV can operate almost continuously using ground controllers working in shifts, but carrying less ordnance.&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt;

===Operation===
[[File:MQ-9 Reaper Satcom.jpg|thumb|Satellite antenna and sensors of a NOAA-NASA flight demonstrator, 2005]]

Operators, stationed at bases such as [[Creech Air Force Base]], near [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, can hunt for targets and observe terrain using multiple sensors, including a [[thermographic camera]]. One claim was that the on-board camera is able to read a license plate from {{convert|2|mi|spell=in}} away.&lt;ref name='Time 2009-06-01'&gt;{{cite journal |title= Reaper: A New Way to Wage War |journal= Time |date= 1 June 2009 |page= 40 |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An operator's command takes 1.2&amp;nbsp;seconds to reach the drone via a [[satellite]] link. The MQ-9 is fitted with six stores pylons; the inner stores pylons can carry a maximum of {{convert|1500|lb}} each and allow carriage of external fuel tanks. The mid-wing stores pylons can carry a maximum of {{convert|600|lb}} each, while the outer stores pylons can carry a maximum of {{convert|200|lb}} each. An MQ-9 with two {{convert|1000|lb}} external fuel tanks and one thousand pounds of munitions has an endurance of 42&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt; The Reaper has an endurance of 14&amp;nbsp;hours when fully loaded with munitions.&lt;ref name="nameMQ9"/&gt; The MQ-9 carries a variety of weapons including the [[GBU-12 Paveway II]] laser-guided bomb, the [[AGM-114 Hellfire|AGM-114 Hellfire II]] air-to-ground missiles, the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]],&lt;ref name='Time 2009-06-01' /&gt; and the [[GBU-38]] Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). Tests are underway to allow for the addition of the [[AIM-92 Stinger]] air-to-air missile.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

By October 2007, the USAF owned nine Reapers,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071527 |title=Air Force's hunter-killer UAV now flying in Afghanistan |date=10 November 2007 |publisher=US Air Force |accessdate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174055/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071527 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by December 2010 had 57 with plans to buy another 272, for a total of 329 Reapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/12/air-force-is-through-with-predator-drones/ |title=Air Force Is Through With Predator Drones |author=Spencer Ackerman |date=14 December 2010 |work=Wired |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have stated that the USAF's insistence on qualified pilots flying RPVs is a bottleneck to expanding deployment. USAF Major General William Rew stated on 5 August 2008, "For the way we fly them right now"—fully integrated into air operations and often flying missions alongside manned aircraft—"we want pilots to fly them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shaun Waterman |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/05/bigger-deadlier-reaper-drone-deployed-in-iraq/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |title=Bigger, Deadlier Reaper Drone Deployed In Iraq |date=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reportedly has exacerbated losses of USAF aircraft in comparison with US Army operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/29/young_usaf_predator_pilot_officer_slam/ |title=USAF slammed for pranging Predators on manual |newspaper=The Register |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Robert Gates stated that, while manned aircraft are needed, the USAF must recognize "the enormous strategic and cultural implications of the vast expansion in remotely piloted vehicles..." and stated that as the service buys manned fighters and bombers, it must give equal weight to unmanned drones and "the service's important role in the cyber and space domains."&lt;ref name="Remarks20110304"/&gt;

In 2013, the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC) sought the ability to pack up an MQ-9 in less than eight hours, fly it anywhere in the world aboard a [[C-17 Globemaster III]], and then have it ready to fly in another eight hours to support special operations teams at places with no infrastructure. MQ-1 and MQ-9 drones must fly aboard cargo aircraft to travel long distances as they lack the refueling technology or speed to travel themselves; the C-17 is large enough to carry the aircraft and support systems and can land on short runways.

In November 2012, Raytheon completed ground verification tests for the [[ADM-160 MALD]] and [[ADM-160 MALD|MALD-J]] for integration onto the Reaper for an unmanned [[suppression of enemy air defenses]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheon-and-general-atomics-team-up-to-integrate-mald-onto-reaper-382308/ Raytheon and General Atomics team-up to integrate MALD onto Reaper] – Flightglobal.com, February 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2013, a company-owned MQ-9 equipped with a jamming pod and digital receiver/exciter successfully demonstrated its [[electronic warfare]] capability at Marine Corp Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, performing its mission in coordination with over 20 participating aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deagel.com/news/Predator-B-Successfully-Demonstrates-Electronic-Attack-Capability-in-USMC-Exercise_n000011810.aspx Predator B Successfully Demonstrates Electronic Attack Capability in USMC Exercise] – Deagel.com, 13 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A second electronic warfare test, fitted with the [[Northrop Grumman]] Pandora EW System, was conducted on 22 October 2013 with other unmanned aircraft and [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler]]s, showing effectiveness in a multi-node approach against a more capable IADS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suasnews.com/2014/01/27108/ga-asi-northrop-grumman-showcase-addl-unmanned-ea-attack-capabilities-in-2nd-usmc-exercise/ GA-ASI &amp; Northrop Grumman Showcase Add’l Unmanned EA Attack Capabilities in 2nd USMC Exercise] – sUASNews.com, 22 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the U.S. [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA) reported its interest in using the Reaper and its MTS-B sensor to provide firing quality data for early interception of [[ballistic missile]] launches. The MDA is exploring concepts to use the UAV's EO/IR sensor to achieve "launch-on-remote" capabilities with missile interceptors before detection by [[Aegis Combat System|Aegis]] radars.  At least two aircraft would be needed to triangulate a target to provide high-fidelity data. The MTS-B includes short and mid-wave IR bands, optimal for tracking launch and rocket burn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uasvision.com/2011/08/24/us-missile-defense-agency-testing-reaper-as-missile-hunter/ US Missile Defense Agency Testing Reaper as Missile Hunter] – UASvision.com, 24 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the MDA terminated plans to build a follow-on to the two orbiting [[Space Tracking and Surveillance System]] (STSS) satellites due to near-term costs, opting to continue testing the Reaper for ballistic missile target discrimination. The MDA planned to test the improved MTS-C sensor, which adds a long-wave IR detector optimized for tracking cold bodies such as missiles and warheads after booster burnout, or plumes and exhaust. The goal is to use data from multiple high-flying UAVs to provide an off-board cue to launch an [[RIM-161|SM-3 missile]] from an Aegis ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/mda-eyes-uavs-discrimination-boost-phase-kill MDA Eyes UAVs For Discrimination, Boost-Phase Kill] – Aviationweek.com, 16 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Two Reapers demonstrated their ability to track ballistic missiles using their MTS-B EO/IR turret during a test in late June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-reapers-demonstrate-missile-tracking-capability-428539/ USAF Reapers demonstrate missile tracking capability] – Flightglobal.com, 16 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, a study by the USAF's Scientific Advisory Board identified several improvements for operating the Reaper in contested airspace; adding readily available sensors, weapons, and threat detection and countermeasures could increase situational awareness and enable riskier deployments. Suggestions included a [[radar warning receiver]] (RWR) to know when it's being targeted, air-to-air and miniature air-to-ground weapons, manned-unmanned teaming, multi-UAV control, automatic take-offs and landings, and precision navigation and timing systems to fly in [[GPS]]-denied areas. Another idea was redesigned ground control stations with user-friendly video game-like controllers and touchscreen maps to access data without overwhelming operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/08/air-force-wants-make-its-drones-smarter-and-deadlier/118823/?oref=d-skybox The Air Force Wants To Make Its Drones Smarter and Deadlier] – Defenseone.com, 3 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-science-panel-recommends-mq-9-rq-4-improvement-415344/ USAF science panel recommends MQ-9, RQ-4 improvement plan] – Flightglobal.com, 5 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Air Force deputy chief of staff for ISR Robert Otto suggested redesigning the MQ-9's GCS to be operated by one person for most missions rather than two (to fly and work the sensors) to simplify operations and reduce manpower requirements by hundreds of sensor operators. Introducing an auto-land capability would also reduce the Reaper's manpower requirements to staff launch and recovery teams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-intel-chief-proposes-single-operator-mq-9-cockp-418317/ USAF intel chief proposes single-operator MQ-9 cockpit] – Flightglobal.com, 28 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic take-off and landing capabilities are already present in the [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]] and [[General Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]], and are planned to be provided to the MQ-9 in 2017.  The Air Force requires the manually loaded Reaper to operate from a runway at least {{convert|5000|ft|km|abbr=on}} long, but automated take-offs and landings would enable it to operate from a {{convert|3000|ft|km|abbr=on}} runway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-to-automate-mq-9-takeoffs-and-landings-424975/ USAF to automate MQ-9 takeoffs and landings] – Flightglobal.com, 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, an MQ-9 Block 5 flew with a [[Raytheon]] [[ALR-67 Radar Warning Receiver|ALR-69A RWR]] in its payload pod to demonstrate the aircraft's ability to conduct missions in the proximity of threat radars and air defenses, the first time this capability was demonstrated on a remotely piloted aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2017/04/11/Radar-warning-receiver-flies-for-first-time-in-Predator-drone/2571491931789/ Radar warning receiver flies for first time in Predator drone] – UPI.com, 11 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2015, the Pentagon reported that an MQ-9 had killed [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] member Mohammed Emwazi, popularly known as "[[Jihadi John]]", who was responsible for executing several Western prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defensetech.org/2015/11/13/reaper-strike-reportedly-kills-jihadi-john/ Reaper Strike Likely Killed ‘Jihadi John’] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115014814/http://defensetech.org/2015/11/13/reaper-strike-reportedly-kills-jihadi-john/ |date=15 November 2015 }} – Defensetech.org, 13 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a record number (20) of Air Force drones crashed.  Working with engineers from General Atomics, investigators identified three parts of the starter-generator that were susceptible to breakdowns. But they could not determine why they were failing.  Col. William S. Leister informed Pentagon officials that investigators from the Air Force, General Atomics and Skurka had investigated the problem for more than a year. The team, he said, had identified "numerous manufacturing quality issues" yet had been unable to determine the exact cause of the failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/01/19/more-u-s-military-drones-are-crashing-than-ever-as-new-problems-emerge/ |title=More Air Force drones are crashing than ever as mysterious new problems emerge |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA initially expressed interest in a production version of the B-002 turbofan-powered variant,&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt; but instead leased an unarmed Reaper variant, which carries the GA-ASI company name "Altair".  Altair is one of the first three "Predator-B" airframes. The other two airframes, known as "Predator-B 001" and "Predator-B 002", had a maximum gross weight of {{convert|7500|lb}}. Altair differs from these models in that it has an {{convert|86|ft|m|adj=on}} long wingspan ({{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} greater than early and current MQ-9s). The Altair has enhanced avionics systems to better enable flights in FAA-controlled civil airspace and demonstrate "over-the-horizon" command and control capability from a ground station. These aircraft are used by NASA's [[NASA Earth Science Enterprise |Earth Science Enterprise]] as part of the [[NASA ERAST Program]] to perform on-location science missions.&lt;ref name=NASAfactsheet&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA ERAST Fact Sheet |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-020-DFRC.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, NASA's [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] obtained an MQ-9 (and mobile ground control station), named ''Ikhana'', for the Suborbital Science Program within the Science Mission Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-097-DFRC.html |title=Ikhana Unmanned Science and Research Aircraft System |publisher=NASA |date=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Ihkana was used to survey the [[October 2007 California wildfires|Southern California wildfires]], supporting firefighter deployments based upon the highest need. The [[California Office of Emergency Services]] had requested NASA support for the [[Esperanza Fire]], and the General Atomics Altair was launched less than 24 hours later on a 16-hour mission to map the fire's perimeter. The fire mapping research is a joint project with NASA and the US Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/story.php?id=388&amp;sec= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717193852/http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/news/story.php?id=388 |title=Emergency UAV Mission to Esperanza Fire |publisher=NASA |date=November 2006 |archivedate=17 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2006/06-45.html |title=NASA Supports UAS Fire Mapping Efforts on California Fire |publisher=NASA |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASA Ikhana was used to survey the descent of the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] [[Exploration Flight Test 1]] (EFT-1) module on its first test mission 5 December 2014. The aircraft loitered at {{convert|27000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, used its IR camera to detect the capsule, then switched to the optical camera to observe its descent through parachute deployment and landing in the [[Pacific]] Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/nasa-ikhana-uav-to-monitor-orion-test-module39s-descent-406796/ NASA Ikhana UAV to monitor Orion test module's descent] – Flightglobal.com, 5 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Predator B, called "CBP-104" (initially referred to as "CBP-102"), was delivered in September 2006 and commenced limited border protection operations on 18 October 2006. The president's FY2006 emergency supplemental budget request added $45 million for the program and the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill added an additional $20 million. In October 2006, GA-ASI announced a $33.9 million contract to supply two more Predator B systems by the fall of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/42310-1.html |title=Predator to be on the prowl again |accessdate=31 October 2006 |author=Alice Lipowicz |date=17 October 2006 |work=Government Computer News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103103005/http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/42310-1.html |archivedate=3 November 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2009, the program was further expanded to include patrols of the Canada–US border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2009/02/16/drones-border.html |title=U.S. launches unmanned aerial drones to monitor Manitoba border |accessdate=22 June 2009 |date=16 February 2009 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503154817/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2009/02/16/drones-border.html |archivedate=3 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2015, the U.S. approved a deal covering weapons integration onto Italy's Reaper aircraft, which would make it the first country outside the UK to weaponise the drone.  The potential for increased contribution to NATO coalition operations, improved operational flexibility, and enhanced survivability for Italian forces prompted the request.&lt;ref name="flightglobal4nov15"&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-authorises-weapons-upgrade-for-italian-reapers-418604/ US authorises weapons upgrade for Italian Reapers] – Flightglobal.com, 4 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
On 19 June 2013, General Atomics and [[Fokker Technologies]] signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) to offer the MQ-9 Reaper to the Dutch government for their need of a Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE) UAV. The MOU recognizes that Fokker will assist in maintenance and support of the aircraft in the Netherlands if a deal goes through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suasnews.com/2013/06/23403/ga-asi-and-fokker-team-to-offer-predator-b-to-the-netherlands-pas13/ GA-ASI and Fokker Team to Offer Predator B to the Netherlands PAS13] – sUASNews.com, 19 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2013, the Dutch Minister of Defense announced that the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] (RNLAF) has selected the MQ-9 Reaper Block-V as its new MALE UAV. The new MALE UAV 306 squadron will be based at [[Leeuwarden Air Base]]. In July 2018 the Dutch government signed a Letter of Acceptance for the acquisition through the Foreign Military Sales process. The Dutch MQ-9 are to have the Synthetic Aperture Radar with the Maritime Search option and also a special ground search radar with more range and electronic sensors to detect ground radar and signals.  The RNLAF plans to buy four ground stations (two at homebase, 2 at foreward operating base) and four MQ-9s block-V. The aircraft are to reach full operational status in 2020.  Currently no weapons are planned for the Reapers, but are 'provided for'.{{vague|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2013/11/21/defensie-kiest-reaper-als-onbemand-vliegtuig/ Defensie kiest Reaper als onbemand vliegtuig] – Ministerie van Defensie, 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
On 6 August 2015, the [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Defence]] announced it would buy four Reaper surveillance aircraft with two ground control stations for €25 million ($27 million) in 2016, costing €171 million over five years.  General Atomics will partner with Spanish Company [[SENER]] to deliver unarmed versions to Spain, making it the fifth European country to order the Reaper.  In addition to selecting the Reaper, Spain is interested in the joint German-French-Italian project to develop a European MALE UAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/international/europe/2015/08/06/spain-buy-us-surveillance-drones/31231101/ Spain To Buy 4 US Surveillance Drones] – Defensenews.com, 6 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Defense Department cleared the purchase on 6 October 2015.

==Variants==

===Naval version===
A navalised Reaper, named ''Mariner'', was proposed for the U.S. Navy's [[Broad Area Maritime Surveillance]] (BAMS) program. It had an increased fuel capacity for an endurance of up to 49 hours.&lt;ref name="GAmar"&gt;[http://www.uav.com/products/mariner.html General Atomics official Mariner web page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510041526/http://www.uav.com/products/mariner.html |date=10 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations included one for [[aircraft carrier]] operations with folding wings for storage, shortened, reinforced landing gear, an arresting hook, cut-down or eliminated ventral flight surfaces and six stores pylons for a total load of 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms).&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt; The [[RQ-4 Global Hawk |Northrop Grumman RQ-4N]] was selected as the BAMS winner.

The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates two maritime variants of the MQ-9, known as ''Guardians''.&lt;ref name="Guardian B" /&gt; The [[United States Coast Guard |U.S. Coast Guard]] evaluated the Guardian, including performing joint operations with CBP.&lt;ref name=USCG&gt;{{cite web |title= Future os Unmanned Aircraft Systems Highlighted |url= http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/newsroom/pdf/CG9newsletterFall11-3.pdf |work= Delivering the Goods: News from U.S. Coast Guard Acquisition |publisher= US Coast Guard |accessdate= 27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBP and the Coast Guard operate one MQ-9 Guardian jointly out of land-based stations in Florida and Texas.&lt;ref name="CG"/&gt;

General Atomics hopes to test a [[sonobuoy]] launch capability from the Guardian in 2016 to demonstrate its ability to carry them, control them, and send information back to the ground station over a SATCOM link.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/new-maritime-capability-developed-for-mq-9-417133/ New maritime capability developed for MQ-9] – Flightglobal.com, 25 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===MQ-9 Block 5===
On 24 May 2012, General Atomics conducted the successful first flight of its upgraded MQ-9 Block 1-plus Reaper. The Block 1–plus version was designed for increased electrical power, secure communications, automatic landing, increased gross takeoff weight (GTOW), weapons growth, and streamlined payload integration capabilities. A new high-capacity starter generator offers increased electrical power capacity to provide growth capacity; a backup generator is also present and is sufficient for all flight-critical functions, improving the electrical power system's reliability via three independent power sources. New communications capabilities, including dual ARC-210 VHF/UHF radios with wingtip antennas, allow for simultaneous communications between multiple air-to-air and air-to-ground parties, secure data links, and an increased data transmission capacity. The new trailing arm main landing gear allows the carriage of heavier payloads or additional fuel. Development and testing were completed, and Milestone C was achieved in September 2012.  Follow-on aircraft will be redesignated ''MQ-9 Block 5''.&lt;ref&gt;(29 January 2013) [http://insidedefense.com/index.php?option=com_user&amp;view=login&amp;return=aHR0cDovL2luc2lkZWRlZmVuc2UuY29tL1VubWFubmVkLVN5c3RlbXMvV2Vla2x5LUFsZXJ0L3dlZWtseS1hbGVydC1qYW51YXJ5LTI5LTIwMTMvbWVudS1pZC04OTAuaHRtbA== USAF Works To Address Avionics Software Deficiencies In MQ-9 Reaper] InsideDefence,com, Retrieved 3 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suasnews.com/2012/09/18590/ga-asi-introduces-system-wide-enhancements-for-predator-bmq-9-reaper/ GA-ASI Introduces System-Wide Enhancements for Predator B/MQ-9 Reaper] – sUASNews.com, 5 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 2013, the USAF awarded General Atomics a $377.4 million contract for 24 MQ-9 Block 5 Reapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suasnews.com/2013/10/25674/air-force-to-buy-24-late-model-reaper-hunter-killer-uavs-under-terms-of-377-4-million-contract/ Air Force to buy 24 late-model Reaper hunter-killer UAVs under terms of $377.4 million contract] – sUASNews.com, 22 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The MQ-9 Block 5 flew its first combat mission on 23 June 2017.&lt;ref name=Blk5&gt;[https://www.defensetech.org/2017/06/30/air-forces-newest-mq-9-reaper-drone-now-hunting-isis/ The Air Force’s Newest MQ-9 Reaper Drone Is Now Hunting ISIS] - Defensetech.org, 30 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sky Guardian===
International demand for a MALE RPAS capable of being certified for operation within civilian airspace drove General Atomics to develop a version of the platform known by GA-ASI as ''SkyGuardian'', previously called Certifiable Predator B, in order to make it compliant with European flight regulations to get more sales in European countries. In order to fly over national airspace, the aircraft meets [[NATO STANAG 4671]] airworthiness requirements with lightning protection, different composite materials, and [[sense and avoid technology]]; performance changes include a {{convert|79|ft|m|abbr=on}} wingspan that has [[winglet]]s and enough fuel for a 40-hour endurance at {{convert|50000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Features include High Definition EO/IR Full Motion Video sensor, De/Anti-Icing System, TCAS and Automatic Take-Off &amp; Land. The system also includes a completely redesigned &amp; modernized integrated ground control station with 4 crew stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2015/06/25/general-atomics-readies-drone-for-european-skies/ General Atomics Readies Drone for European Skies] – DoDBuzz.com, 25 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skyGuardian&gt;http://www.ga-asi.com/Websites/gaasi/images/products/aircraft_systems/pdf/SkyGuardian_DataSheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2018, a GA-ASI Company owned MQ-9B SkyGuardian was flown from the United States to RAF Fairford in the UK for the first transatlantic flight of a MALE UAV. It is to be displayed at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) air show where the aircraft was given RAF Markings of [[No. 31 Squadron RAF]]. This follows an announcement by the RAF's Chief of Air Staff that 31 Sqn would be the 1st RAF Squadron to operate a similar version of the MQ-9B aircraft, to be known as the Protector RG Mark 1, starting in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenseworld.net/news/22943/General_Atomics_MQ___9B_UAV_Completes_Transatlantic_Flight#.W03059JKiHs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-raf-touts-potential-of-protector-progra-450222/&lt;/ref&gt;

Protector will be able to carry up to 18 [[Brimstone missile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/JosephHDempsey/status/1019585082011635713&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glozel-vallon-2008.jpg|thumb|View of the area where Glozel is located]]
'''Glozel''' ({{Coord|46|02|N|3|36|E|}}) is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in central [[France]], part of the [[commune in France|commune]] of [[Ferrières-sur-Sichon]], [[Le Mayet-de-Montagne]], [[Allier]], some 17&amp;nbsp;km from [[Vichy]].

Glozel is probably best known as the place where, from 1924 to 1930, over 3,000 artifacts were discovered, including clay tablets, sculptures and vases, some of which were inscribed with symbols or letters.

Variously dated to at times [[Neolithic]], [[Iron Age]] and [[Medieval]] times, the finds initiated a series of claims, counterclaims and heated debates among archaeologists. The objects were all initially dismissed as a hoax.&lt;Ref&gt;A. Vayson de Pradenne (1933). [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/glozel-forgeries/382DEBC62AA4782C86E7F0201C9F3173 The Glozel Forgeries]. Antiquity, 4(14) https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003598X00004518&lt;/ref&gt; Later research confirmed that some of the items date back to the iron age.&lt;ref name=McKerrell1974/&gt;  After further analysis and dating, the French Ministry of Culture released a report in 1995 which concluded that the site was medieval and later but also contained Iron Age artifacts. It also stated that the site included forgeries, author unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jean-Pierre|first1=Daugas,|last2=J-P|first2=Démoule,|last3=Jean|first3=Guilaine,|last4=Didier|first4=Miallier,|last5=Pierre|first5=Pétrequin,|last6=Jean-Claude|first6=Poursat,|title=Résumé des recherches effectuées à Glozel entre 1983 et 1990, sous l'égide du ministère de la culture|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/racf_0220-6617_1995_num_34_1_2730|website=Revue archéologique du Centre de la France|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=fr-FR|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and excavation==
{{onesource|section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Fradin dans musee.jpg|thumb|Young Émile Fradin inside his museum]]
The initial discovery was made on 1 March 1924 by 17-year-old Émile Fradin (born August 8, 1906, died February 10, 2010 age 103 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/7370099/Emile-Fradin.html Émile Fradin obituary], ''Daily Telegraph'', March 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) and his grandfather Claude Fradin. Émile was guiding a cow-drawn plow when the cow's foot became stuck in a cavity. Freeing the cow, the Fradins uncovered an underground chamber, with walls of clay bricks and 16 clay floor tiles, containing human bones and ceramic fragments.

Adrienne Picandet, a local teacher, visited the Fradins' farm in March, and afterwards informed the Minister of Education about the site. On July 9, another teacher, Benoit Clément, visited the Fradins representing the [[Société d'émulation|Société d'Émulation du Bourbonnais]], later returning with a man called Viple. Clément and Viple used pickaxes to break down the chamber's remaining walls, which they took away with them. Later, Viple wrote to Émile Fradin identifying the site as Gallo-Roman, dating to between about A.D 100-400, and possibly of archeological importance. The January issue of the ''Bulletin de la Société d'Émulation du Bourbonnais'' mentioned the finds, intriguing Antonin Morlet, a [[Vichy]] physician and amateur archaeologist. Morlet visited the farm on 26 April, offering 200 francs to be allowed to complete the excavation. Morlet began his excavations on 24 May 1925, discovering tablets, idols, bone and flint tools and engraved stones. Morlet identified the site as [[Neolithic]] in a report entitled ''Nouvelle Station Néolithique'' published in September 1925, with Émile Fradin listed as co-author.

Two other tombs were uncovered in 1927. More excavations were performed in April 1928. After 1941, a new law outlawed private excavations, and the site remained untouched until the Ministry of Culture re-opened excavations in 1983. The full report was never published, but a 13-page summary appeared in 1995. The authors suggest that the site is [[Middle Ages|medieval]] (roughly A.D. 500–1500), possibly containing some earlier [[Iron Age]] objects, but was likely enriched by forgeries. A group of scholars organized by [[René Germain]] held an annual [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] about Glozel in Vichy from 1996 to 2009.

===Glozel affair and controversy===
[[File:Glozel-musée-2008.jpg|thumb|Glozel Museum in 2008]]
[[File:Vitrines-Glozel-2.jpg|thumb|Glozel Museum]]
French archaeological academia was dismissive of Morlet's 1925 report, published by an amateur and a peasant boy. Morlet invited a number of archaeologists to visit the site during 1926, including [[Salomon Reinach]], curator of the National Museum of [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], who spent three days excavating. Reinach confirmed the authenticity of the site in a communication to the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]. Similarly, famous archaeologist [[Abbé Breuil]] excavated with Morlet and was impressed with the site, but on 2 October, Breuil wrote that "everything is false except the stoneware pottery".

At the meeting of the International Institute of Anthropology in Amsterdam, held in September 1927, Glozel was the subject of heated controversy. A commission was appointed for further investigation, arriving at Glozel on 5 November 1927. During their three-day excavation campaign, the archaeologists were observed by spectators, who were by now flocking to the site, finding various artifacts, but in their report of December 1927, the commission declared everything at Glozel with the exception of a few pieces of flint axes and stone were fake. [[René Dussaud]], curator at the [[Louvre]] and famous epigrapher, also accused Émile Fradin of forgery. On 8 January 1928, Fradin filed suit for defamation against Dussaud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museedeglozel.com/1928.htm|title=Glozel, l'année 1928|publisher=Musée de Glozel |accessdate=17 January 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felix Regnault]], the president of the French Prehistoric Society, visited Glozel on 24 February 1928. After briefly visiting the site's small museum, he filed a complaint of fraud. On 25 February, the police, under the direction of Regnault, searched the museum, destroyed glass display cases and confiscated three cases of artifacts. On 28 February the suit against Dussaud was postponed due to Regnault's pending indictment against Fradin. A new group of neutral archaeologists, called the Committee of Studies, was appointed by scholars who were uncomfortable with the ongoing controversy.{{cn|date=July 2015}} 

Excavating from 12 to 14 April 1928, they found more artifacts, and in their report asserted the authenticity of the site, which they identified as Neolithic. Gaston-Edmond Bayle, chief of the Criminal Records Office in Paris, analyzed the confiscated artifacts. Bayle's report identified the artifacts as recent forgeries, and on 4 June 1929, Émile Fradin was indicted for fraud on the basis of Bayle's report. The verdict against Fradin was reverted by an appeal court in April 1931. The defamation charge against Dussaud came to trial in March 1932, and Dussaud was found guilty of defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.museedeglozel.com/Corpus/ProcFrad.pdf |format = PDF |title = Tribunal correctionnel de la Seine |language = French |publisher = Musée de Glozel |accessdate = July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating the artifacts==
{{unsourced|section|date=July 2015}}
Glass found at Glozel was dated [[spectrography|spectrographically]] in the 1920s, and again in the 1990s at the [[SLOWPOKE reactor]] at the [[University of Toronto]] by [[neutron activation analysis]]. Both analyses place the glass fragments in the medieval period. Alice and Sam Gerard together with Robert Liris in 1995 managed to have two bone tubes found in Tomb II C-14 dated at the AMS C-14 laboratory at the [[University of Arizona]], finding a 13th-century date.

[[Thermoluminescence dating]] (TL) of Glozel pottery in 1974 confirmed that the pottery was not produced recently.&lt;ref name=McKerrell1974&gt;Hugh McKerrell, et al. (1974) [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/thermoluminescence-and-glozel/07BD18F2E0D6B01CA55233888BD0A4E6 Thermoluminescence and Glozel]. Antiquity, 48(192) https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003598X00058208&lt;/ref&gt;By 1979, 39 TL dates on 27 artifacts separated the artifacts into three groups: the first between 300 BC and 300 AD ([[Celtic Gaul|Celtic]] and [[Roman Gaul]]), the second medieval, centered on the 13th century, and the third recent. TL datings of 1983 performed in Oxford range from the 4th century to the medieval period.

[[Carbon-14]] datings of bone fragments range from the 13th to the 20th century. Three C-14 analyses performed in Oxford in 1984 dated a piece of charcoal to the 11th to 13th century, and a fragment of an ivory ring to the 15th century. A human [[femur]] was dated to the 5th century.

==Glozel tablets==
Some 100 [[ceramic]] tablets bearing inscriptions are among the artefacts found at Glozel. The inscriptions are, on average, on six or seven lines, mostly on a single side, although some specimens are inscribed on both faces.

The symbols on the tablets are reminiscent of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], but they have not been conclusively deciphered. There were numerous claims of decipherment, including identification of the language of the inscriptions as [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Urartian language|Chaldean]], [[Eteocretan language|Eteocretan]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Latin]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]], [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]].&lt;ref name="Hizt"&gt;[http://www.museedeglozel.com/Trad2030.htm Traducteurs de Glozel de l'entre-deux-guerres&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museedeglozel.com/Trad5090.htm Traducteurs de Glozel d'après-guerre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museedeglozel.com/Trad2000.htm Traducteurs actuels de Glozel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Girl listening to radio.gif|thumb|right|250px|Before television, during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s when radio was the dominant entertainment medium, families gathered to listen to the home radio in the evening.]]

The '''old-time radio''' era, sometimes referred to as the '''Golden Age of Radio''', was an era of [[radio programming]] in the United States during which [[radio]] was the dominant electronic home [[entertainment|entertainment medium]].  It began with the birth of commercial [[radio broadcasting]] in the early 1920s and lasted through the 1940s, when [[television]] gradually superseded radio as the medium of choice for scripted programming, variety and dramatic shows. There were few U.S. network attempts at major scripted radio dramas after the end of several long-running dramatic series in 1962, including ''Suspense'' and ''Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar''.{{cn|date=October 2017}} 

Radio was the first [[broadcast media|broadcast medium]], and people regularly tuned-in to their favorite radio programs, and families gathered to listen to the home radio in the evening.  According to a 1947 [[C. E. Hooper]] survey, 82 out of 100 Americans were found to be radio listeners.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}   A variety of new entertainment formats and genres were created for the new medium, many of which later migrated to television:  [[radio play]]s, mystery serials, [[soap opera]]s, [[quiz show]]s, [[talent show]]s, daytime and evening [[variety show|variety hours]], [[situation comedy|situation comedies]], [[play-by-play]] sports, [[children's show]]s, [[cooking show]]s, and more.  

Since this golden era, American commercial radio programming has shifted to more narrow formats of news, talk, sports and [[music radio|music]]. Religious broadcasters, listener-supported public radio and college stations provide their own distinctive formats. 

__TOC__

==Origins==
The broadcasts of live drama, comedy, music and news that characterize the Golden Age of Radio had a precedent in the [[Théâtrophone]], commercially introduced in [[Paris]] in 1890 and available as late as 1932. It allowed subscribers to eavesdrop on live stage performances and hear news reports by means of a network of telephone lines. The development of radio eliminated the wires and subscription charges from this concept.

On [[Christmas Eve]] 1906, [[Reginald Fessenden]] is said to have broadcast the first radio program, consisting of some violin playing and passages from the Bible. While Fessenden's role as an inventor and early radio experimenter is not in dispute, several contemporary radio researchers have questioned whether the Christmas Eve broadcast took place, or whether the date was in fact several weeks earlier. The first apparent published reference to the event was made in 1928 by H.P. Davis, Vice President of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], in a lecture given at [[Harvard University]]. In 1932 Fessenden cited the Christmas Eve 1906 broadcast event in a letter he wrote to Vice President S.M. Kinter of Westinghouse. Fessenden's wife Helen recounts the broadcast in her book ''Fessenden: Builder of Tomorrows'' (1940), eight years after Fessenden's death. The issue of whether the 1906 Fessenden broadcast actually happened is discussed in Donna Halper's article "In Search of the Truth About Fessenden"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwonline.com/article/922|title=In Search of the Truth About Fessenden |work=Radio World Online|author=Halper, Donna|date=14 February 2007|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in James O'Neal's essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwonline.com/pages/s.0052/t.437.html|author=O'Neal, James E.|title=Fessenden: World's First Broadcaster?--A Radio History Buff Finds That Evidence for the Famous Brant Rock Broadcast Is Lacking|work=Radio World Online|date=October 25, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129095540/http://www.rwonline.com/pages/s.0052/t.437.html|archivedate=29 January 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwonline.com/article/72046|author=O'Neal, James E.|title=Fessenden — The Next Chapter|work=Radio World Online|date=December 23, 2008|accessdate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annotated argument supporting Fessenden as the world's first radio broadcaster was offered in 2006 by Dr. John S. Belrose, Radioscientist Emeritus at the Communications Research Centre Canada, in his essay "Fessenden's 1906 Christmas Eve broadcast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocom.net/Fessenden/BelroseXmas.pdf|title=Fessenden's 1906 Christmas Eve broadcast|author=Belrose, John S.|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until after the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] catastrophe in 1912 that radio for mass communication came into vogue, inspired first by the work of [[amateur radio|amateur ("ham") radio]] operators. Radio was especially important during World War I as it was vital for air and naval operations. World War I brought about major developments in radio, superseding the [[Morse code]] of the wireless telegraph with the vocal communication of the wireless telephone, through advancements in [[vacuum tube]] technology and the introduction of the [[transceiver]].

After the war, numerous radio stations were born in the United States and set the standard for later radio programs. The first radio news program was broadcast on August 31, 1920 on the station [[WWJ (AM)|8MK]] in [[Detroit]]; owned by ''[[The Detroit News]]'', the station covered local election results. This was followed in 1920 with the first commercial radio station in the United States, [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], being established in [[Pittsburgh]]. The first regular entertainment programs were broadcast in 1922, and on March 10, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' carried the front-page headline: "Radio Sweeping Country: 1,000,000 Sets in Use."&lt;ref&gt;Sayles, Ron. ''Old-Time Radio Digest'', Volume 2009, number 51.&lt;/ref&gt; A highlight of this time was the first [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] being broadcast on January 1, 1923 on the Los Angeles station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]].

==Radio networks==
Several radio networks broadcast in the United States, airing programs nationwide. Their distribution made the ''golden age of radio'' possible.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Christensen, "Remember Radio?" July, 2012 http://www.todaysengineer.org/2012/Jul/backscatter.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The networks declined in the early 1960s; Mutual and NBC's parent companies both closed down their radio operations in the 1990s, while ABC lasted until 2007 when it was bought by [[Citadel Broadcasting]], which was in turn merged with [[Cumulus Media]] on September 16, 2011. As of November 14, 2013, Mutual, ABC and NBC's radio assets now reside with [[Cumulus Media]]'s [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]] division through numerous mergers and acquisitions since the mid-1980s, with ABC maintaining a limited radio ownership presence. CBS's radio license assets were folded into [[Entercom]] in 2017, with CBS shareholders acquiring a stake in that company as part of the reorganization. NBC, CBS and ABC now produce content for radio through their television divisions; the Mutual name was retired in 1999; the network has since been dismantled, with what few stations remaining under common ownership being owned by [[iHeartMedia]].

The major networks were:
*[[NBC Red Network|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC); [[Red Network]], created by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), 1926
*NBC [[Blue Network]]; launched 1927, which RCA was forced to divest under [[antitrust]] laws and became the [[ABC Radio (United States)|American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in 1945
*[[CBS Radio News|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS); 1927
*[[Mutual Broadcasting System]]; 1934. Mutual was initially run as a cooperative in which the flagship stations owned the network, not the other way around as was the case with the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]. Mutual was purchased by [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] in 1985, which retired the Mutual name in 1999.

==Types of programs==
During the Golden Age of Radio, new forms of entertainment were created for the new medium, which later migrated to television and other media:  [[radio play]]s, mystery, adventure and detective serials, [[soap opera]]s, [[quiz show]]s, [[variety show|variety hour]]s, [[talent show]]s, [[situation comedy|situation comedies]], [[children's show]]s, as well as live musical concerts and [[play by play]] [[sports radio|sports]] broadcasts.  In addition, the capability of the new medium to get information to people created the format of modern [[radio news]]: headlines, [[remote broadcast|remote reporting]], sidewalk interviews  (such as ''[[Vox Pop (radio)|Vox Pop]]''), [[panel discussion]]s, [[weather forecasting|weather reports]], farm reports.

[[Image:You Can't Do Business with Hitler rehearsal.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Rehearsal for the World War II radio show ''You Can't Do Business with Hitler'' with John Flynn and Virginia Moore. This series of programs, broadcast at least once weekly by more than 790 radio stations in the United States, was written and produced by the radio section of the Office of War Information (OWI).]]
The earliest radio programs of the 1920s were largely unsponsored; radio stations were a service designed to sell radio receivers. By the late 1920s, radio had reached [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] and [[market saturation|saturated the market]], necessitating a change in business model. The sponsored musical feature soon became most popular program format. Most early radio sponsorship came in the form of selling the [[naming rights]] to the program, as evidenced by such programs as ''[[The A&amp;P Gypsies]]'', ''[[Champion Spark Plug Hour]]'', ''[[The Clicquot Club Eskimos]]'', and ''[[King Biscuit Time]]''; commercials as they are known in the modern era were still relatively uncommon and considered intrusive. During the 1930s and 1940s, the leading orchestras were heard often through big band remotes, and NBC's ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' continued such remotes well into the 1950s by broadcasting live music from New York City jazz clubs to rural America.

[[Classical music]] programs on the air included ''[[The Voice of Firestone]]'' and ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]''. [[Texaco]] sponsored the [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]; the broadcasts, now sponsored by the [[Toll Brothers]], continue to this day around the world, and are one of the few examples of live classical music still broadcast on radio. One of the most notable of all classical music radio programs of the Golden Age of Radio featured the celebrated Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], which had been created especially for him. At that time, nearly all classical musicians and critics considered Toscanini the greatest living maestro. Popular songwriters such as [[George Gershwin]] were also featured on radio. (Gershwin, in addition to frequent appearances as a guest, also had his own program in 1934.) The [[New York Philharmonic]] also had weekly concerts on radio. There was no dedicated classical music radio station like [[NPR]] at that time, so classical music programs had to share the network they were broadcast on with more popular ones, much as in the days of television before the creation of [[National Educational Television|NET]] and [[PBS]].

[[Country music]] also enjoyed popularity. ''[[National Barn Dance]]'', begun on Chicago's [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in 1924, was picked up by [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] in 1933. In 1925, ''[[WSM (AM)|WSM]] Barn Dance'' went on the air from [[Nashville]]. It was renamed the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in 1927 and NBC carried portions from 1944 to 1956. NBC also aired ''The [[Red Foley]] Show'' from 1951 to 1961, and [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] carried ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' from 1953 to 1961.

Radio attracted top comedy talents from [[vaudeville]] and Hollywood for many years: [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Fred Allen]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Victor Borge]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Billie Burke]], [[Bob Burns (comedian)|Bob Burns]], [[Judy Canova]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[Jean Shepherd]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[Ed Wynn]]. [[Sitcom|Situational comedies]] also gained popularity, such as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', ''[[Easy Aces]]'', ''[[Ethel and Albert]]'', ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'', ''[[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]]'', ''[[The Great Gildersleeve]]'', ''[[The Halls of Ivy]]'' (which featured screen star [[Ronald Colman]] and his wife [[Benita Hume]]), ''[[Meet Corliss Archer]]'', ''[[Meet Millie]]'', and ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]''.

Radio comedy ran the gamut from the small town humor of [[Lum and Abner]], [[Herb Shriner]] and [[Minnie Pearl]] to the dialect characterizations of [[Mel Blanc]] and the caustic sarcasm of [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]]. Gags galore were delivered weekly on ''[[Stop Me If You've Heard This One]]'' and ''[[Can You Top This?]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/rhofsection.php?page=274|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.museum.tv|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; panel programs devoted to the art of telling jokes. Quiz shows were lampooned on ''[[It Pays to Be Ignorant]]'', and other memorable parodies were presented by such satirists as [[Spike Jones]], [[Stoopnagle and Budd]], [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Bob and Ray]]. British comedy reached American shores in a major assault when NBC carried ''[[The Goon Show]]'' in the mid-1950s.

[[Image:Radio - Keep It Free.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Radio-related World War II propaganda poster]]
Some shows originated as stage productions: [[Clifford Goldsmith|Clifford Goldsmith's]] play ''[[What a Life (play)|What a Life]]'' was reworked into NBC's popular, long-running ''[[The Aldrich Family]]'' (1939–1953) with the familiar [[catchphrase]]s "Henry! Henry Aldrich!," followed by Henry's answer, "Coming, Mother!" Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman's Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway hit, ''[[You Can't Take It with You (play)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1936), became a weekly situation comedy heard on Mutual (1944) with Everett Sloane and later on NBC (1951) with [[Walter Brennan]].

Other shows were adapted from comic strips, such as ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'', ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Gasoline Alley]]'', ''[[The Gumps]]'', ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', ''[[Popeye the Sailor]]'', ''[[Red Ryder]]'', ''[[Reg'lar Fellers]]'', ''[[Terry and the Pirates (radio serial)|Terry and the Pirates]]'' and ''[[Tillie the Toiler]]''. Bob Montana's redheaded teen of comic strips and comic books was heard on radio's ''[[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]]'' from 1943 to 1953. ''The Timid Soul'' was a 1941–1942 comedy based on cartoonist [[H. T. Webster]]'s famed [[Caspar Milquetoast]] character, and Robert L. [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] was adapted to several different radio formats during the 1930s and 1940s. Conversely, some radio shows gave rise to spinoff comic strips, such as ''My Friend Irma'' starring [[Marie Wilson (American actress)|Marie Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everybody’s Friend: Remembering Stan Lee and Dan DeCarlo’s 'My Friend Irma' |work=Hogan's Alley |volume=#16 |publisher=cartoonician.com |url= http://cartoonician.com/everybodys-friend-remembering-stan-lee-and-dan-decarlos-my-friend-irma/ |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[soap opera]], ''[[Clara, Lu, and Em]]'' was introduced in 1930 on Chicago's [[WGN (AM)|WGN]]. When daytime serials began in the early 1930s, they became known as soap operas because many were sponsored by soap products and detergents. The line-up of late afternoon adventure serials included ''[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]'', ''[[The Cisco Kid]]'', ''[[Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy]]'', ''[[Captain Midnight]]'', and ''[[Tom Mix#Radio|The Tom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters]]''. Badges, rings, decoding devices and other [[radio premiums]] offered on these adventure shows were often allied with a sponsor's product, requiring the young listeners to mail in a [[boxtop]] from a breakfast cereal or other [[proof of purchase]].

Radio dramas were presented on such programs as ''[[Norman Corwin|26 by Corwin]]'', ''NBC Short Story'', ''[[Arch Oboler's Plays]]'', ''[[Quiet, Please]]'', and ''[[CBS Radio Workshop]]''. [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' and ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' were considered by many critics to be the finest radio drama anthologies ever presented. They usually starred Welles in the leading role, along with celebrity guest stars such as [[Margaret Sullavan]] or [[Helen Hayes]], in adaptations from literature, Broadway, and/or films. They included such titles as ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (a title now feared lost), ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', and ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. It was on ''Mercury Theatre'' that Welles presented his celebrated-but-infamous [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|1938 adaptation]] of [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', formatted to sound like a [[breaking news]] program. ''[[Theatre Guild on the Air]]'' presented adaptations of classical and Broadway plays. Their Shakespeare adaptations included a one-hour ''[[Macbeth]]'' starring [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] and [[Judith Anderson]], and a 90-minute ''[[Hamlet]]'', starring [[John Gielgud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |title=Hamlet (Episode 065) |format=MP3 |work=Theater Guild on the Air |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |url= https://archive.org/download/TheaterGuildontheAir/Tgoa_51-03-04_ep065-Hamlet.mp3 |date=1951-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings of many of these programs survive.

During the 1940s, [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]], famous for playing [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson]] in films, repeated their characterizations on radio on ''[[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', which featured both original stories and episodes directly adapted from [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s stories. None of the episodes in which Rathbone and Bruce starred on the radio program were filmed with the two actors as Holmes and Watson, so radio became the only medium in which audiences were able to experience Rathbone and Bruce appearing in some of the more famous Holmes stories, such as "[[The Speckled Band]]". There were also many dramatizations of Sherlock Holmes stories on radio without Rathbone and Bruce.

During the latter part of his career, celebrated actor [[John Barrymore]] starred in a radio program, ''Streamlined Shakespeare'', which featured him in a series of one-hour adaptations of [[Shakespeare]] plays, many of which Barrymore never appeared in either on stage or in films, such as ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (in which he played both [[Malvolio]] and [[Sir Toby Belch]]), and ''[[Macbeth]]''.

''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' and ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' presented adaptations of Hollywood movies, performed before a live audience, usually with cast members from the original films. ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'', ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'', ''[[The Mysterious Traveler]]'' and ''[[Inner Sanctum Mystery]]'' were popular thriller anthology series. Leading writers who created original material for radio included [[Norman Corwin]], [[Carlton E. Morse]], [[David Goodis]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Arch Oboler]], [[Wyllis Cooper]], [[Rod Serling]], [[Jay Bennett (author)|Jay Bennett]], and [[Irwin Shaw]].

==Broadcast production methods==
The RCA 44BX microphone had two live faces and two dead ones. Thus actors could face each other and react. An actor could give the effect of leaving the room by simply moving his head toward the dead face of the microphone. The scripts were paper-clipped together. It has been disputed whether or not actors and actresses would drop finished pages to the carpeted floor after use.

==History of professional radio recordings in the United States==

===Radio stations===
In the beginning of the Golden Age, American [[radio network]] programs were almost exclusively broadcast live, as the national networks prohibited the airing of recorded programs until the late 1940s because of the inferior sound quality of phonograph discs, the only practical recording medium. As a result, prime-time shows would be performed twice, once for each coast. However, "reference recordings" were made of many programs as they were being broadcast, for review by the sponsor and for the network's own archival purposes. With the development of high-fidelity magnetic wire and tape recording in the years following World War II, the networks became more open to airing recorded programs and the prerecording of shows became more common.

Local stations, however, had always been free to use recordings and sometimes made substantial use of prerecorded [[radio syndication|syndicated]] programs distributed on pressed (as opposed to individually recorded) [[transcription discs]].

Recording was done using a cutting lathe and [[acetate disc]]s. Programs were normally recorded at 33{{fraction|1|3}} [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] on 16&amp;nbsp;inch discs, the standard format used for such "[[transcription disc|electrical transcriptions]]" from the early 1930s through the 1950s. Sometimes, the groove was cut starting at the inside of the disc and running to the outside. This was useful when the program to be recorded was longer than 15 minutes so required more than one disc side. By recording the first side outside in, the second inside out, and so on, the sound quality at the disc change-over points would match and result in a more seamless playback. An inside start also had the advantage that the thread of material cut from the disc's surface, which had to be kept out of the path of the cutting stylus, was naturally thrown toward the center of the disc so was automatically out of the way. When cutting an outside start disc, a brush could be used to keep it out of the way by sweeping it toward the middle of the disc. Well-equipped recording lathes used the vacuum from a water aspirator to pick it up as it was cut and deposit it in a water-filled bottle. In addition to convenience, this served a safety purpose, as the cellulose nitrate thread was highly flammable and a loose accumulation of it combusted violently if ignited.

Most recordings of radio broadcasts were made at a [[radio network]]'s studios, or at the facilities of a network-owned or [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]d station, which might have four or more lathes. A small local station often had none. Two lathes were required to capture a program longer than 15 minutes without losing parts of it while discs were flipped over or changed, along with a trained technician to operate them and monitor the recording while it was being made. However, some surviving recordings were produced by local stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://southernspaces.org/2008/tennessee-jamboree-local-radio-barn-dance-and-cultural-life-appalachian-east-tennessee|title=The Tennessee Jamboree: Local Radio, the Barn Dance, and Cultural Life in Appalachian East Tennessee|first=Hanson, |last=Bradley|date=30 March 2018|website=southernspaces.org|volume=2008|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonradio.org/faq.html |title=Frequently-Asked Questions |accessdate=2007-05-16 |work=The Archives@BostonRadio.org |author=Fybush, Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a substantial number of copies of an electrical transcription were required, as for the distribution of a syndicated program, they were produced by the same process used to make ordinary records. A master recording was cut, then electroplated to produce a stamper from which pressings in vinyl (or, in the case of transcription discs pressed before about 1935, shellac) were molded in a record press.

===Armed Forces Radio Service===
{{Main article|American Forces Network#History}}
[[Image:Sinatra Radio.gif|thumb|300px|right|[[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Alida Valli]] converse over Armed Forces Radio Service during World War II]]
The Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) had its origins in the U.S. [[United States Department of War|War Department]]'s quest to improve troop morale. This quest began with short-wave broadcasts of educational and information programs to troops in 1940. In 1941, the War Department began issuing "Buddy Kits" (B-Kits) to departing troops, which consisted of radios, 78 rpm records and electrical transcription discs of radio shows. However, with the entrance of the United States into World War II, the War Department decided that it needed to improve the quality and quantity of its offerings.

This began with the broadcasting of its own original variety programs. ''[[Command Performance (radio series)|Command Performance]]'' was the first of these, produced for the first time on March 1, 1942. On May 26, 1942, the Armed Forces Radio Service was formally established. Originally, its programming comprised network radio shows with the commercials removed. However, it soon began producing original programming, such as ''[[Mail Call (radio program)|Mail Call]]'', ''[[G.I. Journal]]'', ''[[Jubilee (radio)|Jubilee]]'' and ''[[GI Jive]]''. At its peak in 1945, the Service produced around 20 hours of original programming each week. 

From 1943 until 1949 the AFRS also broadcast programs developed through the collaborative efforts of the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] and the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] in support of America's [[cultural diplomacy]] initiatives and President Franklin Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor policy]]. Included among the popular shows was ''[[Viva America]]'' which showcased leading musical artists from both North and South America for the entertainment of America's troops. Included among the regular performers were: [[Alfredo Antonini]], [[Juan Arvizu]], [[Nestor Mesta Chayres]] and [[John Serry Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3WyZ9A4_XEC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGr83up4bdAhUGy1kKHTBxDZMQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=VIva%20America&amp;f=false ''The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series'' Mackenzie, Harry.

After the war, the AFRS continued providing programming to troops in Europe. During the 1950s and early 1960s it presented performances by the Army's only symphonic orchestra ensemble - the [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3WyZ9A4_XEC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Seventh+Army+Symphony+Orchestra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGr83up4bdAhUGy1kKHTBxDZMQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Seventh%20Army%20Symphony%20Orchestra&amp;f=false ''The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series''] Harry MacKenzie, Greeenwood Press, CT. 1999, p. 198 {{ISBN|0-313-30812-8}} "Seventh Army Symphony on Armed Forces Radio in 1961 performing works by Vivaldi and Dvorak" on http://books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, it also provided programming for future wars that the United States was involved in. It survives today as a component of the [[American Forces Network]] (AFN).

All of the shows aired by the AFRS during the Golden Age were recorded as electrical transcription discs, vinyl copies of which were shipped to stations overseas to be broadcast to the troops. People in the United States rarely ever heard programming from the AFRS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/AFRS.htm |title=Armed Forces Radio Services broadcasts |accessdate=2007-05-16 |work=Bing Crosby Internet Museum |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221191200/http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/AFRS.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; though AFRS recordings of Golden Age network shows were occasionally broadcast on some domestic stations beginning in the 1950s.

In some cases, the AFRS disc is the only surviving recordingof a program.

===Home radio recordings in the United States===
There was some home recording of radio broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s. Examples from as early as 1930 have been documented. During these years, home recordings were made with disc recorders, most of which were only capable of storing about four minutes of a radio program on each side of a twelve-inch [[78 rpm]] record. Most home recordings were made on even shorter-playing ten-inch or smaller discs. Some home disc recorders offered the option of the [[LP record|33{{fraction|1|3}} rpm]] speed used for electrical transcriptions, allowing a recording more than twice as long to be made, although with reduced audio quality. Office dictation equipment was sometimes pressed into service for making recordings of radio broadcasts, but the audio quality of these devices was poor and the resulting recordings were in odd formats which had to be played back on similar equipment. Due to the expense of recorders and the limitations of the recording media, home recording of broadcasts was not common during this period and it was usually limited to brief excerpts.

The lack of suitable home recording equipment was somewhat relieved in 1947 with the availability of [[wire recording|magnetic wire recorders]] for domestic use. These were capable of recording an hour-long broadcast on a single small spool of wire, and if a high-quality radio's audio output was recorded directly, rather than by holding a microphone up to its speaker, the recorded sound quality was very good. However, because the wire cost money and, like [[magnetic tape]], could be repeatedly re-used to make new recordings, only a few complete broadcasts appear to have survived on this medium. In fact, there was little home recording of complete radio programs until the early 1950s, when increasingly affordable reel-to-reel tape recorders for home use were introduced to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audiolabo.free.fr/revue1999/content/History_tape.htm|title=The History of Magnetic Tape|author=|date=|website=audiolabo.free.fr|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UnivMemphis&gt;{{cite web |url=https://umdrive.memphis.edu/mbensman/public/collectingarticle.html |title=A History of Radio Program Collecting |accessdate=2007-05-18 | author=Bensman, Marvin R. |work=Radio Archive of the University of Memphis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording media==

===Electrical transcription discs===
{{main article|Electrical transcription}}
[[Image:War of the Worlds ET.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast by Orson Welles on electrical transcription disc]]
Before the early 1950s, when radio networks and local stations wanted to preserve a live broadcast, they did so by means of special [[gramophone record|phonograph records]] known as "[[transcription disc|electrical transcriptions]]" (ETs), made by cutting a sound-modulated groove into a blank disc. At first, in the early 1930s, the blanks varied in both size and composition, but most often they were simply bare aluminum and the groove was indented rather than cut. Typically, these very early recordings were not made by the network or radio station, but by a private recording service contracted by the broadcast sponsor or one of the performers. The bare aluminum discs were typically 10 or 12&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter and recorded at the then-standard speed of 78 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], which meant that several disc sides were required to accommodate even a 15-minute program. By about 1936, 16-inch aluminum-based discs coated with cellulose nitrate lacquer, commonly known as [[Acetate disc|acetates]] and recorded at a speed of 33{{fraction|1|3}} rpm, had been adopted by the networks and individual radio stations as the standard medium for recording broadcasts. The making of such recordings, at least for some purposes, then became routine. Some discs were recorded using a "hill and dale" vertically modulated groove, rather than the "lateral" side-to-side modulation found on the records being made for home use at that time. The large slow-speed discs could easily contain fifteen minutes on each side, allowing an hour-long program to be recorded on only two discs. The lacquer was softer than shellac or vinyl and wore more rapidly, allowing only a few playbacks with the heavy pickups and steel needles then in use before deterioration became audible.

During World War II, aluminum became a necessary material for the war effort and was in short supply. This caused an alternative to be sought for the base on which to coat the lacquer. Glass, despite its obvious disadvantage of fragility, had occasionally been used in earlier years because it could provide a perfectly smooth and even supporting surface for mastering and other critical applications. Glass base recording blanks came into general use for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.otrsite.com/articles/artwb006.html | title=Music Electrically Transcribed! | author=Beaupre, Walter J. |accessdate=2007-11-05 | work=The Vintage Radio Place }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic wire recording===
In the late 1940s, [[wire recording|wire recorders]] became a readily obtainable means of recording radio programs. On a per-minute basis, it was less expensive to record a broadcast on wire than on discs. The one-hour program that required the four sides of two 16-inch discs could be recorded intact on a single spool of wire less than three inches in diameter and about half an inch thick. The audio fidelity of a good wire recording was comparable to acetate discs and by comparison the wire was practically indestructible, but it was soon rendered obsolete by the more manageable and easily edited medium of magnetic tape.

===Reel-to-reel tape recording===
[[Bing Crosby]] became the first major proponent of magnetic tape recording for radio, and he was the first to use it on network radio, after he did a demonstration program in 1947.&lt;ref name=UnivMemphis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=qwcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ABC Spends 100G in Shift From Wax to Tape Repeats]", ''Billboard'', Feb. 21, 1948, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Tape had several advantages over earlier recording methods. Running at a sufficiently high speed, it could achieve higher fidelity than both electrical transcription discs and magnetic wire. Discs could be edited only by copying parts of them to a new disc, and the copying entailed a loss of audio quality. Wire could be divided up and the ends spliced together by knotting, but wire was difficult to handle and the crude splices were too noticeable. Tape could be edited by cutting it with a blade and neatly joining ends together with adhesive tape. By early 1949, the transition from live performances preserved on discs to performances prerecorded on magnetic tape for later broadcast was complete for network radio programs.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=xBYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5 NBC Drops All Wax Bans]", ''Billboard'', Jan. 29, 1949, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fg4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5 Webs' Tape Measure Grows]", ''Billboard'', Nov. 5, 1949, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the physical distribution of prerecorded programming to individual stations, 16-inch 33{{fraction|1|3}} rpm vinyl pressings, less expensive to produce in quantities of identical copies than tapes, continued to be standard throughout the 1950s.

==Availability of recordings==
The great majority of pre-World War II live radio broadcasts, many never recorded at all, have not been preserved; most of the oldest existing radio program recordings date to the early 1930s, and several of the longer-running radio dramas have their archives complete or nearly complete back to that time. The earlier the date, the less likely it is that a recording of the broadcast was made and survives. A good number of prerecorded syndicated programs from this period have survived because copies of those were originally distributed far and wide. Recordings of live network broadcasts from the World War II years were preserved in the form of pressed vinyl copies issued by the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) and survive in relative abundance. Syndicated programs from World War II and later years have nearly all survived. The survival of network programming from this time frame is more inconsistent; the networks started prerecording their formerly live shows on magnetic tape for subsequent network broadcast, but did not physically distribute copies, and the tapes, unlike electrical transcription ("ET") discs, could be "wiped" and re-used (especially since, in the age of emerging trends such as television and [[music radio]], such recordings were believed to have virtually no [[rerun]] or resale value). Thus, while some prime time network radio series from this era exist in full or almost in full, especially the most famous and longest-lived of them, less prominent or shorter-lived series (such as [[serial (radio and television)|serials]]) may have only a handful of extant episodes. [[Aircheck]]s, off-the-air recordings of complete shows made by, or at the behest of, individuals for their own private use, sometimes help to fill in such gaps. The contents of privately made recordings of live broadcasts from the first half of the 1930s can be of particular interest, as little live material from that period survives. Unfortunately, the sound quality of very early private recordings is often very poor, although in some cases this is largely due to the use of an incorrect playback stylus, which can also badly damage some unusual types of discs.

Most of the Golden Age programs in circulation among collectors &amp;ndash; whether on analog tape, CD, or in the form of [[MP3]]s &amp;ndash; originated from 16-inch transcription discs. In many cases, the circulating recordings are several generations of analog reel-to-reel and cassette tape copies down the line from the original discs, being the product of tape-trading among collectors during the decades before lossless digital duplication was possible. The muffled sound, dropouts, sudden changes in sound quality, unsteady pitch and other defects heard all too often are almost always accumulated tape copy defects. The audio quality of the source discs, when they have survived unscathed and are accessed and dubbed anew, is usually found to be reasonably clear and undistorted, sometimes startlingly good, although like all phonograph records they are vulnerable to wear and the effects of scuffs, scratches and ground-in dust. Many shows from the 1940s have survived only in edited AFRS versions, although some exist in both the original and AFRS forms.

===Copyright status===
Unlike film, television, and print items from the era, the copyright status of most recordings from the Golden Age of Radio is unclear. This is because, prior to 1972, the United States delegated the [[sound recording copyright symbol|copyrighting of sound recordings]] to the individual states, many of which offered more generous [[common law copyright]] protections than the federal government offered for other media (some offered ''perpetual'' copyright, which has since been abolished; under the [[Music Modernization Act]] of September 2018, any sound recording 95 years old or older will be thrust into the public domain regardless of state law).&lt;ref name="soundreccopyright"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/sound/|title=Federal Copyright Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings - U.S. Copyright Office|author=|date=|website=www.copyright.gov|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions are AFRS original productions, which are considered [[work of the United States government]] and thus both ineligible for federal copyright and outside the jurisdiction of any state; these programs are firmly in the [[public domain]] (this does not apply to programs carried by AFRS but produced by commercial networks).

In practice, most old-time radio recordings are treated as [[orphan work]]s: although there may still be a valid copyright on the program, it is seldom enforced. The copyright on an individual sound recording is distinct from the federal copyright for the underlying material (such as a published script, music, or in the case of adaptations, the original film or television material), and in many cases it is impossible to determine where or when the original recording was made or if the recording was copyrighted in that state. The U.S. Copyright Office states "there are a variety of legal regimes governing protection of pre-1972 sound recordings in the various states, and the scope of protection and of exceptions and limitations to that protection is unclear."&lt;ref name="soundreccopyright"/&gt; For example, [[New York (state)|New York]] has issued contradicting rulings on whether or not common law exists in that state; the most recent ruling, 2016's ''[[Flo &amp; Eddie]], Inc. v. [[Sirius XM Radio]]'', holds that there is no such copyright in New York in regard to public performance.&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;{{Cite news|last=Klepper|first=David|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RECORDING_COPYRIGHT_RULING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-12-20-16-50-38|title=OWNERS OF 1967 HIT SONG 'HAPPY TOGETHER' LOSE COPYRIGHT CASE|publisher=Associated Press|date=20 December 2016|accessdate=13 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221093429/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RECORDING_COPYRIGHT_RULING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-12-20-16-50-38|archivedate=21 December 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating matters is that certain examples in case law have implied that radio broadcasts (and faithful reproductions thereof), because they were distributed freely to the public over the air, may not be eligible for copyright in and of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;This was a key point in ''Waring v. [[WDAS (AM)|WDAS Broadcasting Sta.]]'', a case that determined that a record company could claim copyright on a sound recording under Pennsylvania law because the recording was specifically designated as not being for radio broadcast.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet Archive]] and other organizations that distribute public domain and open-source audio recordings maintain extensive archives of old-time radio programs.

== Legacy ==
;United States
Some old-time radio shows continued on the air, although in ever-dwindling numbers, throughout the 1950s even after their television equivalents had conquered the general public. One factor which helped to kill them off entirely was the evolution of popular music (including the development of [[rock and roll]]), which led to the birth of the [[top 40]] radio format. A top 40 show could be produced in a small studio in a local station with minimal staff. This displaced [[Full service (radio format)|full-service]] network radio and hastened the end of virtually all scripted radio drama by 1962. (Radio in and of itself would survive, thanks in part to the proliferation of the [[transistor radio]], and permanent installation in vehicles, making the medium far more portable than television.) Full-service stations that did not adopt either top 40 or the mellower [[beautiful music]] or [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] formats eventually developed [[all-news radio]] in the mid-1960s.

Scripted radio comedy and drama in the vein of old-time radio has a limited presence on U.S. radio. Several radio theatre series are still in production in the United States, usually airing on Sunday nights. These include original series such as ''[[Imagination Theater]]'' and a radio adaptation of ''[[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' TV series, as well as rerun compilations such as the popular daily series ''[[When Radio Was]]'' and [[USA Radio Network]]'s ''[[USA Radio Network#Golden Age of Radio Theatre|Golden Age of Radio Theatre]]'', and weekly programs such as [[Ed Walker (radio personality)|Ed Walker]]'s ''The Big Broadcast'' on [[WAMU]]. These shows usually air in late nights and/or on weekends on small AM stations. Carl Amari's nationally syndicated radio show "Hollywood 360" features 6 old-time radio episodes each week during his 4-hour broadcast. Amari also broadcasts old-time radio shows on "The WGN Radio Theatre" heard every Saturday and Sunday night on 720-WGN in Chicago. Local rerun compilations are also heard, primarily on [[public radio]] stations. [[Sirius XM Radio]] maintains a full-time [[Radio Classics]] channel devoted to rebroadcasts of vintage radio shows.

Starting in 1974, [[Garrison Keillor]], through his syndicated two-hour-long program ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', has provided a living museum of the production, tone and listener's experience of this era of radio for several generations after its demise.  Produced live in theaters throughout the country, using the same sound effects and techniques of the era, it ran through 2016 with Keillor as host. The program includes segments that are close renditions (in the form of parody) of specific genres of this era, including Westerns ("Dusty and Lefty, The Lives of the Cowboys"), detective procedurals ("[[Guy Noir]], Private Eye") and even advertising through fictional commercials.  Keillor also wrote a novel, ''[[WLT: A Radio Romance]]'' based on a radio station of this era—including a personally narrated version for the ultimate in verisimilitude. Upon Keillor's retirement, replacement host [[Chris Thile]] chose to reboot the show and eliminate much of the old-time radio trappings of the format.&lt;ref&gt;Baenen, Jeff (April 12, 2016).

Vintage shows and new audio productions in America are accessible more widely from recordings or by satellite and web broadcasters, rather than over conventional AM and FM radio.  The [[National Audio Theatre Festival]] is a national organization and yearly conference keeping the audio arts - especially audio drama - alive, and continues to involve long-time voice actors and OTR veterans in its ranks. Its predecessor, the Midwest Radio Theatre Workshop, was first hosted by [[Jim Jordan (actor)|Jim Jordan]], of "Fibber McGee and Molly" fame, and [[Norman Corwin]] advised the organization.

One of the longest running radio programs celebrating this era is ''The Golden Days of Radio'', which was hosted on the [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio Service]] for more than 20 years and overall for more than 50 years by Frank Bresee, who also played "Little Beaver" on the ''[[Red Ryder]]'' program as a child actor.

One of the very few still-running shows from the earlier era of radio is a Christian program entitled ''[[Unshackled!]]'' The weekly half-hour show, produced in Chicago by [[Pacific Garden Mission]], has been continuously broadcast since 1950. The shows are created using techniques from the 1950s (including home-made sound effects) and are broadcast across the U.S. and around the world by thousands of radio stations.

Today, radio performers of the past appear at conventions which feature re-creations of classic shows, as well as music, memorabilia and historical panels. The largest of these events was the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention, held in [[Newark, New Jersey]] which held its final convention in October 2011 after 36 years. Others include REPS in Seattle (June), SPERDVAC in California, the Cincinnati OTR &amp; Nostalgia Convention (April), and the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention (September).  Veterans of the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention, including Chairperson Steven M. Lewis of The Gotham Radio Players, Maggie Thompson, publisher of the ''Comic Book Buyer's Guide'', Craig Wichman of audio drama troupe Quicksilver Audio Theater and long-time FOTR Publicist Sean Dougherty have launched a successor event, [http://www.celebratingaudiotheater.org Celebrating Audio Theater - Old &amp; New], scheduled for October 12–13, 2012.

Radio dramas from the golden age are sometimes recreated as live stage performances at such events. One such group, led by director [[Daniel Wakefield Smith|Daniel Smith]], has been performing re-creations of old-time radio dramas at [[Fairfield University]]'s [[Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts]] since the year 2000.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jan Ellen |last=Spiegel |title=We Interrupt This Play for a News Bulletin on the War |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-09-09 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/09peoplect.html?ex=1190001600&amp;en=c2a8d60db4ac9e04&amp;ei=5070 |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio Dramas |work=[[Regina A.

The 40th anniversary of what is widely considered the end of the old time radio era (the final broadcasts of ''[[Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar]]'' and ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'' on September 30, 1962) was marked with a commentary on NPR's ''All Things Considered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chimes |first=Art |title=Last Radio Drama |publisher=National Public Radio |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1150876 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A handful of radio programs from the old-time era remain in production, all from the genera&lt;!--plural--&gt; of news or music: the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' (1925), ''[[Music and the Spoken Word]]'' (1929), the ''[[CBS World News Roundup]]'' (1938), ''[[King Biscuit Time]]'' (1941) and the ''[[Renfro Valley Gatherin']]'' (1943). Of those, all but the Opry maintain their original short-form length of 30 minutes or less. The ''[[WWVA Jamboree|Wheeling Jamboree]]'' counts an earlier program on a competing station as part of its history, tracing its lineage back to 1933.

;Elsewhere
Regular broadcasts of radio plays are also heard in &amp;mdash; among other countries &amp;mdash; Australia, Croatia, Estonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raadioteater |language=Estonian |publisher=[[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]] (formerly Eesti Raadio) |year=2015 |url=http://raadioteater.err.ee/raadioteater/avaleht |accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, such scripted radio drama continues on [[BBC Radio 3]] and (principally) [[BBC Radio 4]], the second-most popular radio station in the country, as well as on the rerun channel [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], which is the seventh-most popular station there.

[[File:Pollock 2018 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Griselda Pollock in 2018.]]
'''Griselda Pollock''' (born 11 March 1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Birthdays| newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | pages = 33| date = 11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a visual theorist, cultural analyst and scholar of international, postcolonial feminist studies in the [[visual arts]]. Based in England, she is well known for her theoretical and methodological innovation, combined with readings of historical and contemporary art, film and cultural theory. Since 1977, Pollock has been one of the most influential scholars of modern, [[avant-garde]] art, [[postmodern art]], and [[contemporary art]]. She is also a major influence in [[feminist theory]], [[feminist art|feminist]] [[art history]] and [[gender studies]].&lt;ref name=Malvern&gt;See Sue Malvern, "Griselda Pollock", in Chris Murray (ed.), ''Key Writers on Art: The Twentieth Century'' (London: Routledge, 2002) p. 199f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Born in [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], Griselda Pollock grew up in both French and English Canada. Moving to Britain during her teens, Pollock studied Modern History at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1967–1970) and [[History of art|History of European Art]] at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] (1970–72).  She received her doctorate in 1980 for a study of ''[[Vincent van Gogh]] and Dutch Art: A reading of his notions of the modern.'' After teaching at [[University of Reading|Reading]] and [[University of Manchester|Manchester Universities]], Pollock went to the [[University of Leeds]] in 1977 as Lecturer in History of Art and Film and was appointed to a Personal Chair in Social and Critical Histories of Art in 1990. In 2001 she became Director of Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History at the University of Leeds, where she is Professor of Social and Critical Histories of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Looking Back to the Future'' (London: Routledge, 2001) p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Pollock celebrated 40 years of creating 'a feminist space' at the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies at the University of Leeds. 

==Art history==
Griselda Pollock is regarded as a feminist art historian and cultural theorist of art practices and [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Jonathan|date= 2001|title= The New Art History: A Critical Introduction |url= http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/186421159|location= London|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 9780415230070|access-date= 7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yefimov|first1=Alla|title=Feminist Interventions, Shifting Terrains: An Interview with Griselda Pollock|journal=Afterimage|date=March 1990|volume=17|issue=8|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work  challenges mainstream models of art and art history that have excluded the role of women in art, and at the same time explores the social structures that result in this exclusion. She examines the interaction of the social categories of gender, class and race,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; crucially researching the relationship between them and [[psychoanalysis]] and art, and drawing on the work of such French cultural theorists as Michel Foucault. Her theorization of subjectivity takes both psychoanalysis and Foucault's ideas about social control into account.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She is known for her work on the artists [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], [[Eva Hesse]] and [[Charlotte Salomon]].&lt;ref name=Malvern /&gt; and Alina Szapocznikow, Lubaina Himid, Sutapa Biswas, Christine Taylor Patten, [[Louise Bourgeois]], Anna Maria Maiolino and Vera Frenkel. She has developed a range of concepts with which to theorise and practice critical feminist interventions in art's histories: old mistresses, vision and difference, avant-garde gambits, generations and geographies, differencing the canon and most recently, the virtual feminist museum.

In 2014 she was suggested by [[Michael Paraskos]] to the [[BBC]] to act as the presenter for a proposed remake of the 1969 television series [[Civilisation (TV series)|''Civilization'']], a series originated by the art historian [[Kenneth Clark]]. Paraskos described Professor Pollock as 'one of the few academics around with the full breadth of knowledge of the sweep of art history.'&lt;ref&gt;Tim Walker, 'Griselda Pollock in running for Civilisation role' in ''The Daily Telegraph'' (UK newspaper), 3 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Studies and Cultural Analysis==
Griselda Pollock is the founding director of the Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History at the University of Leeds. Initiated with a grant from the then AHRB in 2001, CentreCATH is a transdisciplinary project connecting fine art, histories of art and cultural studies across the shared engagements with class, gender, sexuality, post colonial critique and queer theory. Its five research themes are: social exclusion and hospitality, musicality/aurality/textuality, architecture and philosophy, virtuality and digitally, memoria/historia/amnesia.  After its first five years in which CentreCATH organised seminars and conferences on and around these themes. 17 publications emerged from this project, many of which appear in the New Encounters: Arts, Cultures and Concepts series (I B Tauris). In 2007, with Max Silverman, Griselda Pollock won a second major grant for the project Concentrationary Memories: The Politics of Representation which explores the concept of an anxious and vigilant form of cultural memory analysing the devastating effects of the totalitarian assault on the human condition and alert to the persistent not only of this perpetual threat, but is invasion of popular culture in the form of a concentrationary imaginary. The project explored the forms of aesthetic resistance to totalitarian terror and the concentrationary imaginary.  Four edited collections have been produced: Concentrationary Cinema, Concentrationary Memory, Concentrationary Imaginaries and forthcoming Concentrationary Art.  The most recent CentreCATH project was a Leverhulme Visiting Professorship for Carilyn Christov Bakargiev which  undertook a critical analysis of the Documenta exhibitions with special reference to dDOCUMENTA (13). CentreCATH has collaborated with Opera North on several projects and is currently engaged in a long-term project Performing Violence.

It is one of the three towns in the [[Otavi Triangle]], situated on the [[B8 road (Namibia)|B8 national road]] that leads from [[Otavi]] to the [[Caprivi Strip]]. Grootfontein receives an annual average rainfall of {{convert|557|mm}}, although in the 2010/2011 rainy season {{convert|956|mm}} were measured.&lt;ref name="Nam2011"&gt;{{cite news

==Overview==
The place was known to the [[Herero people|Herero]] under the name ''Otjivanda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, 40 [[Boer]] families from the north-west of [[South Africa]] settled at Grootfontein. Part of the [[Dorsland trek]]kers, they were heading towards [[Angola]].  When that territory fell under [[Portugal|Portuguese]] control, they turned back and established the [[Upingtonia|Republic of Upingtonia]] at Grootfontein.  Abandoned by 1887, it became the headquarters of the [[South West Africa Company]] in 1893.

In 1908 the [[Roman Catholic church]] established a [[Mission (station)|mission]] in Grootfontein as the basis of their eventually successful attempt to establish missions in [[Kavango Region|Kavango]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sata vuotta suomalaista lähetystyötä 1859–1959.

Like all the towns in the Otavi Triangle, Grootfontein is very green in summer but drier in winter.  In spring, [[jacaranda]] and [[Royal Poinciana|flamboyant trees]] bloom in profusion. The town has an old German [[Schutztruppe]] fortress from the year 1896, which today houses a [[museum]] that expounds on the local history.  The economic mainspring of the area were for many decades the [[Berg Aukas]] and [[Abenab]] mines to the north east of the town. These produced [[zinc]] and [[vanadium]] but have since closed.  This is [[dolomite]] country and the [[carbonate]] deposits in the upper parts of the mine have yielded interesting [[fossil]]s of [[simian]] or [[pongoid]] creatures that lived millions of years before modern humans evolved.

Twenty four kilometres west of Grootfontein lies the huge [[Hoba meteorite]].  At over 60 tons, it is the largest known [[meteorite]] on Earth, as well as being the largest naturally occurring mass of iron known to exist on the planet's surface.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
[[File:Grootfontein Airport (2018).jpg|thumb|Military Airport and the town beyond]]
Grootfontein is a [[railhead]] on [[TransNamib]], the national railway and transport system. The next station to the west is [[Otavi]]. Grootfontein is also home of Namibia's main military base which housed several units of the now departed [[South African Defence Force]]. It has an airfield that can handle large transport carriers such as the Hercules C130, as well as commercial passenger aircraft.

===Agriculture===
''Grootfontein Show'', an annual agricultural exhibition that takes place since 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6338">'''Ilhan Niaz''' (born 10 October 1980) is a [[professor]] of [[history]] from [[Pakistan]]. He is winner of the first [[Karachi Literature Festival]] (KLF) Award for best non fiction in English in 2011 and the winner of the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan's (HEC-P) Best Book Publication in Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities of 2010 Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karachiliteraturefestival.org/announcements/untitledpost ]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Official KLF website. Retrieved 9 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and research==
Niaz has completed all his post graduate work from [[Quaid-i-Azam University]], Islamabad. He completed his MSc in history in 2003,  M.Phil in 2004 and his PhD in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hist.qau.edu.pk/ Resume under Faculty] Department of History, QU Retrieved 9 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The PhD thesis became the basis for his second book which won the KLF Award and the HEC Best Book Publication Award. He has been published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, www.foreignaffairs.com, and other leading international publications.

In his first book, ''An Inquiry into the Culture of Power of the Subcontinent'', Niaz developed a theoretical framework that explains the rise and fall of states in [[South Asia]]. The core elements of this framework are a type of the state (continental bureaucratic empire) that manifests three main properties in its organization. First, the state is the property of the ruler or the rulers. Second, the ruler(s) operate through hierarchical institutions (military, bureaucracy, priests). Third, they exercise power arbitrarily and due to the official ideology or religion are above lawful criticism. Niaz presents a macro-historical overview of South Asia from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] to near-contemporary India and Pakistan and demonstrates the elements of continuity in the behavior of ruling elites over this period. He argues that since independence from Britain in 1947, India and Pakistan have slowly gone back to their primordial cultures of power that are delusional, arbitrary, ideocratic and treat the state as a personal estate. In his second book, ''The Culture of Power and Governance of Pakistan, 1947-2008'', Niaz provides a detailed study of Pakistan's experience of behavioral regression since 1947. The framework developed in the first book is applied and adjusted in light of the archival material found in Islamabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niaz|first=Ilhan|title=Pakistan's Brief Case Warriors|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137713/ilhan-niaz/pakistans-briefcase-warriors|publisher=CFR and Foreign Affairs|accessdate=August 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niaz's latest book, ''Old World Empires: Cultures of Power and Governance in Eurasia'', was published by Routledge, New York in April 2014, and is available in India and Pakistan in an Oxford University Press edition released in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415725972/&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Niaz advances the framework developed in his works on South Asia and Pakistan and applies it to India, China, Persia, Continental Europe, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Japan, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oup.com.pk/shopexd.asp?id=6115# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-12 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150412052229/http://www.oup.com.pk/shopexd.asp?id=6115# |archive-date=2015-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niaz takes a long-view of historical development that combines deterministic factors such as geography and environment with variable factors such as leadership, politics, and ideology, to provide an overview of how states developed structurally and in terms of mentality. This is the first instance of a Pakistani historian developing a philosophical framework for understanding global macro-history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1156167/review-old-world-empires-by-ilhan-niaz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Rakhigarhi will be discussed briefly in view of the limited published material."}} 

[[Aridification]] of this region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial spur for the [[Urbanization|urbanisation]] associated with the civilisation, but eventually also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward.&lt;ref name=madella-fuller/&gt;&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giosan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=brooke-2015/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Note-Brooke"}}

Of these, the earlier is often called the Early Harappan culture, while the later one may be referred to as the Late Harappan, both of which existed in the same area as the Mature Harappan Civilisation.

The Indus Valley Civilisation was named after the Indus Valley, where the first remains were found.

The Indus Valley Civilisation has also been called by some the "Sarasvati culture", the "Sarasvati Civilisation", the "Indus-Sarasvati Civilisation" or the "Sindhu-Saraswati Civilisation", as the [[Ghaggar-Hakra river]] is identified by some with the mythological [[Sarasvati River]],&lt;ref name="Singh2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maisels2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Keith Maisels|title=Early Civilizations of the Old World: The Formative Histories of Egypt, The Levant, Mesopotamia, India and China|date=16 December 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-83731-1|page=184|chapter=The Indus/'Harappan'/Sarasvati Civilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CushRobinson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Denise Cush|author2=Catherine A.

The Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) encompassed much of [[Pakistan]], western [[India]], and northeastern [[Afghanistan]]; extending from Pakistani [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] in the west to [[Uttar Pradesh]] in the east, northeastern Afghanistan in the north and [[Maharashtra]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harappa.com/har/indus-saraswati-geography.html | title=The Largest Bronze Age Urban Civilization | publisher=harappa.com | accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shortugai]] to the north is on the [[Oxus River]], the Afghan border with [[Tajikistan]], and in the west [[Sutkagan Dor]] is close to the Iranian border. The [[Kulli culture]] of Balochistan, of which more than 100 settlement sites are known, can be regarded as a local variant of the IVC, or a related culture.

The geography of the Indus Valley put the civilisations that arose there in a highly similar situation to those in [[Egypt]] and [[Peru]], with rich agricultural lands being surrounded by highlands, desert, and ocean. Recently, Indus sites have been discovered in Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] as well. Other IVC colonies can be found in Afghanistan while smaller isolated colonies can be found as far away as [[Turkmenistan]] and in Maharashtra. The largest number of colonies are in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], and [[Gujarat]] belt.

Potential sources for this river include the Yamuna River, the Sutlej River, or both rivers. However, the lack of large-scale incision on the interfluve demonstrates that large, glacier-fed rivers did not flow across the Ghaggar-Hakra region during the Holocene [...] The present Ghaggar-Hakra valley and its tributary rivers are currently dry or have seasonal flows. Yet rivers were undoubtedly active in this region during the Urban Harappan Phase. We recovered sandy fluvial deposits approximately 5;400 y old at Fort Abbas in Pakistan (SI Text), and recent work (33) on the upper Ghaggar-Hakra interfluve in India also documented Holocene channel sands that are approximately 4;300 y old. On the upper interfluve, fine-grained floodplain deposition continued until the end of the Late Harappan Phase, as recent as 2,900 y ago (33) (Fig. 2B). This widespread fluvial redistribution of sediment suggests that reliable monsoon rains were able to sustain perennial rivers earlier during the Holocene and explains why Harappan settlements flourished along the entire Ghaggar-Hakra system without access to a glacier-fed river."&lt;ref name="Giosan"/&gt;}} There is evidence of dry river beds overlapping with the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar River]] in India and [[Hakra]] channel in Pakistan.

The ruins of [[Harappa]] were described in 1842 by [[Charles Masson]] in his ''Narrative of Various Journeys in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], Afghanistan, and the Punjab'', where locals talked of an ancient city extending "thirteen [[Kos (unit)|cosses]]" (about 25 miles or 41&amp;nbsp;km).{{refn|group=note|Masson: "A long march preceded our arrival at Haripah, through jangal of the closest description.... When I joined the camp I found it in front of the village and ruinous brick castle. Behind us was a large circular mound, or eminence, and to the west was an irregular rocky height, crowned with the remains of buildings, in fragments of walls, with niches, after the eastern manner.... Tradition affirms the existence here of a city, so considerable that it extended to Chicha Watni, thirteen cosses distant, and that it was destroyed by a particular visitation of Providence, brought down by the lust and crimes of the sovereign."{{sfn|Masson|1842}} Note that the [[Kos (unit)|coss]], a measure of distance used from [[Vedic]] period to [[Mughal era|Mughal]] times, is approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}}.}}

In 1856, [[Alexander Cunningham]], later director-general of the Archaeological Survey of Northern India, visited Harappa where the British engineers [[John Brunton|John]] and [[William Brunton]] were laying the [[History of rail transport in India|East Indian Railway Company]] line connecting the cities of [[Karachi]] and [[Lahore]]. John wrote, "I was much exercised in my mind how we were to get [[track ballast|ballast]] for the line of the railway". They were told of an ancient ruined city near the lines, called Harappa. Visiting the city, he found it full of hard well-burnt bricks, and, "convinced that there was a grand quarry for the ballast I wanted", the city of Harappa was reduced to ballast.&lt;ref name=davreau&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Indus Valley|author=Davreau, Robert|title=World's Last Mysteries|editor=Reader's Digest|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, further north, John's brother William Brunton's "section of the line ran near another ruined city, bricks from which had already been used by villagers in the nearby village of Harappa at the same site. These bricks now provided ballast along {{convert|93|mi|km}} of the railroad track running from Karachi to Lahore".&lt;ref name=davreau /&gt;

In 1872–75, Cunningham published the first Harappan [[stamp seal|seal]] (with an erroneous identification as [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] letters).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Cunningham]] (1875). [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.547220 Archaeological Survey of India, Report for the Year 1872–73] (Vol. 5): [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.547220/2015.547220.Archaeological-Surbey#page/n115/mode/2up 105]–8 and pl. 32-3. Calcutta: [[Archaeological Survey of India]].&lt;/ref&gt; More Harappan seals were discovered in 1912 by [[John Faithfull Fleet]], prompting an archaeological campaign under [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Hubert Marshall]]. Marshall, Rai Bahadur [[Daya Ram Sahni]] and [[Madho Sarup Vats]] began excavating Harappa in 1921, finding buildings and artefacts indicative of an ancient civilisation. These were soon complemented by discoveries at [[Mohenjo-daro]] by [[Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay|Rakhal Das Banerjee]], [[Ernest J. H. Mackay]], and Marshall. By 1931, much of Mohenjo-daro had been excavated, but excavations continued, such as that led by [[Mortimer Wheeler|Sir Mortimer Wheeler]], director of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] in 1944. Among other archaeologists who worked on IVC sites before the independence in 1947 were [[Ahmad Hasan Dani]], [[B. B. Lal|Brij Basi Lal]], Nani Gopal Majumdar, and Sir Marc [[Aurel Stein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EoahDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Ahmad+Hasan+Dani,+Brij+Basi+Lal,+Nani+Gopal+Majumdar,+and+Sir+Marc+Aurel+Stein.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vYigk0HoMz&amp;sig=h2Y18a_ZFKpQDZry0HCRkl2zy3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6JDgh5TXAhWKso8KHftlCwEQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahmad%20Hasan%20Dani%2C%20Brij%20Basi%20Lal%2C%20Nani%20Gopal%20Majumdar%2C%20and%20Sir%20Marc%20Aurel%20Stein.&amp;f=false|title=International Journal of Social Impact, Volume 1, Issue 2|author=IJSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following independence, the bulk of the archaeological finds were inherited by Pakistan where most of the IVC was based; but due to more recent discoveries, India now has 50% more sites than Pakistan. Outposts of the Indus Valley civilisation were excavated as far west as [[Sutkagan Dor]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Pakistani Balochistan]], as far north as at Shortugai on the Amu Darya (the river's ancient name was [[Oxus River|Oxus]]) in current [[Afghanistan]], as far east as at [[Alamgirpur]], Uttar Pradesh, India and as far south as at [[Malwan]], in modern-day [[Surat]], Gujarat, India.&lt;ref name="Singh2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early medieval India : from the Stone Age to the 12th century|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131711200|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;dq=Upinder+Singh&amp;q=malvan#v=snippet&amp;q=malvan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the inclusion of the predecessor and successor cultures – Early Harappan and Late Harappan, respectively – the entire Indus Valley Civilisation may be taken to have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th centuries BCE. It is part of the Indus Valley Tradition, which also includes the pre-Harappan occupation of Mehrgarh, the earliest farming site of the Indus Valley.{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991}}{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=27}}

Several periodisations are employed for the periodisation of the IVC.{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991}}{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=27}} The most commonly used classifies the Indus Valley Civilisation into Early, Mature and Late Harappan Phase.{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=25}} An alternative approach by Shaffer divides the broader Indus Valley Tradition into four eras, the pre-Harappan "Early Food Producing Era," and the Regionalisation, Integration, and Localisation eras, which correspond roughly with the Early Harappan, Mature Harappan, and Late Harappan phases.&lt;ref name="Shaffer 1992 loc=I:441–464, II:425–446"/&gt;{{sfn|Manuel|2010|p=148}}

According to Rao, Hakra Ware has been found at [[Bhirrana]], and is ''pre-Harappan'', dating to the 8th–7th millennium BCE.{{sfn|Dikshit|2013|p=129-133}}{{sfn|Mani|2008|p=237-238}}{{sfn|Sarkar|2006|p=2-3}} Hakra Ware culture is a material culture which is contemporaneous with the early Harappan Ravi phase culture (3300–2800 BCE) of the Indus Valley.{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=158}}{{sfn|Ahmed|2014|p=107}} According to Dikshit and Rami, the estimation for the antiquity of [[Bhirrana]] as ''pre-Harappan'' is based on two calculations of charcoal samples, giving two dates of respectively 7570–7180 BCE, and 6689–6201 BCE.{{sfn|Dikshit|2013|p=129-133}}{{sfn|Mani|2008|p=237-238}}

Lukacs and Hemphill suggest an initial local development of Mehrgarh, with a continuity in cultural development but a change in population.

== Early Harappan ==
[[File:Indus Valley Civilization, Early Phase (3300-2600 BCE).png|thumb|right|Early Harappan Period, c. 3300–2600 BCE]]

The Early Harappan Ravi Phase, named after the nearby [[Ravi River]], lasted from {{Circa|3300}} BCE until 2800 BCE. It is related to the [[Hakra Ware culture|Hakra Phase]], identified in the Ghaggar-Hakra River Valley to the west, and predates the [[Kot Diji]] Phase (2800–2600 BCE, Harappan 2), named after a site in northern [[Sindh]], Pakistan, near [[Mohenjo-daro]]. The earliest examples of the [[Indus script]] date to the 3rd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World's Writing Systems|page=372|author=Peter T. Daniels|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parpola"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parpola|first=Asko|year=1994|title=Deciphering the Indus Script|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mature phase of earlier village cultures is represented by [[Rehman Dheri]] and [[Amri (Pre-Harappa)|Amri]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frontiers of Indus Civilisation|last=Durrani|first=F. A.|publisher=Books &amp; Books|year=1984|location=Delhi|pages=505–510|chapter=Some Early Harappan sites in Gomal and Bannu Valleys|editor=[[B. B. Lal|Lal, B. B.]]|editor2=[[S. P. Gupta|Gupta, S. P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kot Diji]] represents the phase leading up to Mature Harappan, with the citadel representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life. Another town of this stage was found at [[Kalibangan]] in India on the Hakra River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thapar|first=B. K.|year=1975|title=Kalibangan: A Harappan Metropolis Beyond the Indus Valley|journal=Expedition|volume=17|issue=2|pages=19–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials, including [[lapis lazuli]] and other materials for bead-making. By this time, villagers had domesticated numerous crops, including [[pea]]s, [[sesame seed]]s, [[date (fruit)|dates]], and cotton, as well as animals, including the [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]. Early Harappan communities turned to large urban centres by 2600 BCE, from where the mature Harappan phase started. The latest research shows that Indus Valley people migrated from villages to cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence for Patterns of Selective Urban Migration in the Greater Indus Valley (2600–1900 BC): A Lead and Strontium Isotope Mortuary Analysis|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123103 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0123103 | volume=10|journal=PLOS One|page=e0123103|year=2015 | last1 = Valentine | first1 = Benjamin|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1023103V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Indus-Valley-people-migrated-from-villages-to-cities-New-study/articleshow/47111875.cms|title=Indus Valley people migrated from villages to cities: New study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stages of the Early Harappan period are characterised by the building of large walled settlements, the expansion of trade networks, and the increasing integration of regional communities into a "relatively uniform" material culture in terms of pottery styles, ornaments, and [[stamp seal]]s with [[Indus script]], leading into the transition to the Mature Harappan phase.&lt;ref name="J.M.

According to Giosan et al. (2012), the slow southward migration of the monsoons across Asia initially allowed the Indus Valley villages to develop by taming the floods of the Indus and its tributaries. Flood-supported farming led to large agricultural surpluses, which in turn supported the development of cities. The IVC residents did not develop irrigation capabilities, relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods.&lt;ref name=Giosan/&gt; Brooke further notes that the development of advanced cities coincides with a reduction in rainfall, which may have triggered a reorganisation into larger urban centers.&lt;ref name=brooke-2015/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Note-Brooke"}}

According to J. G. Shaffer and D. A. Lichtenstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Problems and New Perspectives in the Archaeology of South Asia|last=Shaffer|first=Jim G.|year=1989|series=Wisconsin Archaeological Reports 2|pages=117–126|chapter=Ethnicity and Change in the Indus Valley Cultural Tradition|authorlink=Jim G. Shaffer|author2=Lichtenstein, Diane A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Mature Harappan Civilisation was "a fusion of the Bagor, Hakra, and Kot Diji traditions or 'ethnic groups' in the Ghaggar-Hakra valley on the borders of India and Pakistan".&lt;ref name="possehl" /&gt;

By 2600 BCE, the Early Harappan communities turned into large urban centres. Such urban centres include [[Harappa]], [[Ganeriwala]], [[Mohenjo-daro]] in modern-day Pakistan, and [[Dholavira]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Rakhigarhi]], [[Rupar]], and [[Lothal]] in modern-day India.&lt;ref name="re-enters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indus-river-re-enters-india/1/158976.html |title=Indus re-enters India after two centuries, feeds Little Rann, Nal Sarovar |publisher=India Today|date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, more than 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Indus Rivers and their tributaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Cities ===
[[File:Sokhta Koh.jpg|right|thumb|Computer-aided reconstruction of coastal Harappan settlement at Sokhta Koh near [[Pasni City|Pasni]], Pakistan]]
A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture is evident in the Indus Valley Civilisation making them the first urban centre in the region. The quality of municipal town planning suggests the knowledge of [[urban planning]] and efficient municipal governments which placed a high priority on [[hygiene]], or, alternatively, accessibility to the means of religious ritual.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

As seen in Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and the recently partially excavated [[Rakhigarhi]], this urban plan included the world's first known urban [[sanitation]] systems: see [[hydraulic engineering of the Indus Valley Civilisation]]. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from [[water well|wells]]. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, [[wastewater|waste water]] was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets. Houses opened only to inner [[courtyard]]s and smaller lanes. The house-building in some villages in the region still resembles in some respects the house-building of the Harappans.&lt;ref&gt;It has been noted that the courtyard pattern and techniques of flooring of Harappan houses has similarities to the way house-building is still done in some villages of the region. {{Harvnb|Lal|2002|pp=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in many areas of Pakistan and India today. The advanced architecture of the Harappans is shown by their impressive dockyards, [[granary|granaries]], warehouses, brick platforms, and protective walls. The massive walls of Indus cities most likely protected the Harappans from floods and may have dissuaded military conflicts.&lt;ref name=MorrieAEJ&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=A.E.J.|title=History of Urban Form: Before the Industrial Revolutions |date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-582-30154-2 |page=31|edition=Third|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whBEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohenjo-daro Priesterkönig.jpeg|thumb|right|So-called "Priest King" statue, [[Mohenjo-daro]], late [[Mature Harappan]] period, National Museum, Karachi, Pakistan]]
The purpose of the citadel remains debated. In sharp contrast to this civilisation's contemporaries, [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], no large monumental structures were built. There is no conclusive evidence of palaces or temples – or of kings, armies, or priests. Some structures are thought to have been granaries. Found at one city is an enormous well-built bath (the "[[Great Bath, Mohenjo-daro|Great Bath]]"), which may have been a public bath. Although the citadels were walled, it is far from clear that these structures were defensive. They may have been built to divert flood waters.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Most city dwellers appear to have been traders or artisans, who lived with others pursuing the same occupation in well-defined neighbourhoods. Materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals, beads and other objects. Among the [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] discovered were beautiful glazed [[faïence]] beads. [[Steatite]] seals have images of animals, people (perhaps gods), and other types of inscriptions, including the yet un-deciphered [[Indus script|writing system of the Indus Valley Civilisation]]. Some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods and most probably had other uses as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Although some houses were larger than others, Indus Civilisation cities were remarkable for their apparent, if relative, [[egalitarianism]]. All the houses had access to water and drainage facilities. This gives the impression of a society with relatively low [[wealth concentration]], though clear social levelling is seen in personal adornments. {{clarify|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Dholavira1.JPG|thumb|[[Dholavira]] Sophisticated Water Reservoir, evidence for hydraulic sewage systems in the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation]]
Toilets that used water were used in the Indus Valley Civilisation. The cities of [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]] had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated [[sewage system]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, J. C. and Ubertini, Lucio (2004). The Basis of Civilization – Water Science? pg 161. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (International Association of Hydrological Sciences Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authority and governance ===
Archaeological records provide no immediate answers for a centre of power or for depictions of people in power in Harappan society. But, there are indications of complex decisions being taken and implemented. For instance, the majority of the cities were constructed in a highly uniform and well-planned grid pattern, suggesting they were planned by a central authority; extraordinary uniformity of Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery, seals, weights and bricks; presence of public facilities and monumental architecture; heterogeneity in the mortuary symbolism and in grave goods (items included in burials).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

These are the major theories:{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
* There was a single state, given the similarity in artefacts, the evidence for planned settlements, the standardised ratio of brick size, and the establishment of settlements near sources of raw material.
* There was no single ruler but several cities like Mohenjo-daro had a separate ruler, Harappa another, and so forth.
* Harappan society had no rulers, and everybody enjoyed equal status and hence some type of Democracy.

The people of the Indus Civilisation achieved great accuracy in measuring length, mass, and time. They were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measures. A comparison of available objects indicates large scale variation across the Indus territories. Their smallest division, which is marked on an ivory scale found in [[Lothal]] in Gujarat, was approximately 1.704&amp;nbsp;mm, the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the [[Bronze Age]]. Harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes, including the measurement of mass as revealed by their [[hexahedron]] weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Search of the Cradle of Civilization:New Light on Ancient India|last=Feuerstein|first=Georg|last2=Kak|first2=Subhash|last3=Frawley|first3=David|publisher=Quest Books|year=2001|page=73|isbn=0-8356-0741-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[chert]] weights were in a ratio of 5:2:1 with weights of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 units, with each unit weighing approximately 28&amp;nbsp;grams, similar to the English [[Imperial units#Mass|Imperial ounce]] or Greek uncia, and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of 0.871. However, as in other cultures, actual weights were not uniform throughout the area. The weights and measures later used in [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (4th century BCE) are the same as those used in [[Lothal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sergent|first=Bernard|title=Genèse de l'Inde|year=1997|page=113|language=French|isbn=2-228-89116-9|publisher=Payot|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harappans evolved some new techniques in [[metallurgy]] and produced copper, [[bronze]], lead, and [[tin]]. The engineering skill of the Harappans was remarkable, especially in building docks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRMGDmdE9FkC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=harappan+building+docks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRi93ok97NAhUB22MKHS78AIQQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harappan%20building%20docks&amp;f=false|first=Raj|last=Pruthi|title=Prehistory and Harappan Civilization|page=260|publisher=APH Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, archaeologists studying the remains of two men from [[Mehrgarh]], Pakistan, discovered that the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, from the early Harappan periods, had knowledge of proto-[[dentistry]]. Later, in April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that the oldest (and first early Neolithic) evidence for the drilling of human teeth ''in vivo'' (i.e., in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh. Eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults were discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Mehrgarh that dates from 7,500–9,000 years ago. According to the authors, their discoveries point to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coppa|first=A.|date=6 April 2006|title=Early Neolithic tradition of dentistry: Flint tips were surprisingly effective for drilling tooth enamel in a prehistoric population|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=440|issue=7085|pages=755–6|doi=10.1038/440755a|pmid=16598247|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2006Natur.440..755C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various sculptures, seals, bronze vessels [[Indian Pottery|pottery]], gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in [[terracotta]], bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC|first=Jane|last=McIntosh|page=248|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form. These terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.&lt;ref name="Keay, John 2000"&gt;Keay, John, India, a History.  New York: Grove Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]] reacted with surprise when he saw the famous Indus bronze statuette of a slender-limbed [[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|dancing girl]] in Mohenjo-daro:

{{quote|When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric; they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art, and culture. Modeling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the Hellenistic age of Greece, and I thought, therefore, that some mistake must surely have been made; that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years older than those to which they properly belonged&amp;nbsp;.... Now, in these statuettes, it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling; that makes us wonder whether, in this all-important matter, Greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a far-off age on the banks of the Indus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India discovered|page=172|publisher=Collins|author=John Keay|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many crafts including, "shell working, ceramics, and agate and glazed steatite bead making" were practised and the pieces were used in the making of necklaces, bangles, and other ornaments from all phases of Harappan culture. Some of these crafts are still practised in the subcontinent today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kenoyer|first=Jonathan Mark|year=1997|title=Trade and Technology of the Indus Valley: New Insights from Harappa, Pakistan|journal=World Archaeology|volume=29|issue=2: "High–Definition Archaeology: Threads Through the Past"|pages=262–280|doi=10.1080/00438243.1997.9980377|authorlink=Jonathan Mark Kenoyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some make-up and toiletry items (a special kind of combs (kakai), the use of [[collyrium]] and a special three-in-one toiletry gadget) that were found in Harappan contexts still have similar counterparts in modern India.&lt;ref name="Lal 2002 82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lal|2002|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terracotta female figurines were found (ca. 2800–2600 BCE) which had red colour applied to the "manga" (line of partition of the hair).&lt;ref name="Lal 2002 82" /&gt;

Seals have been found at [[Mohenjo-daro]] depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a [[yoga]]-like pose (see image, the so-called ''Pashupati'', below).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This figure, sometimes known as a [[Pashupati seal|Pashupati]], has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Sir John.

A harp-like instrument depicted on an Indus seal and two shell objects found at Lothal indicate the use of stringed musical instruments. The Harappans also made various toys and games, among them cubical [[dice]] (with one to six holes on the faces), which were found in sites like Mohenjo-Daro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lal|2002|p= 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade and transportation ===
[[File:Lothal dock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The docks of ancient [[Lothal]] as they are today (2006)]]{{further|Lothal|Meluhha}}
The Indus civilisation's economy appears to have depended significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The IVC may have been the first civilisation to use wheeled transport.&lt;ref&gt;Hasenpflug, Rainer, The Inscriptions of the Indus civilisation Norderstedt, Germany, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These advances may have included [[bullock cart]]s that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can see on the Indus River today; however, there is secondary evidence of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and what they regard as a docking facility at the coastal city of [[Lothal]] in western India ([[Gujarat]] state). An extensive canal network, used for irrigation, has however also been discovered by H.-P. Francfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=H.-P.+Francfort+indus+canal+network&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_6-Xgl9_NAhUJMo8KHWpKCJsQ6AEIHjAA|page=157|first=Upinder|last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 4300–3200 BCE of the [[chalcolithic]] period (copper age), the Indus Valley Civilisation area shows ceramic similarities with southern [[Turkmenistan]] and northern Iran which suggest considerable mobility and trade. During the Early Harappan period (about 3200–2600 BCE), similarities in pottery, seals, figurines, ornaments, etc. document intensive caravan trade with [[Central Asia]] and the [[Iranian plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parpola|2005|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from the dispersal of Indus civilisation artefacts, the trade networks, economically, integrated a huge area, including portions of [[Afghanistan]], the coastal regions of [[Persia]], northern and [[western India]], and [[Mesopotamia]]. Studies of tooth enamel from individuals buried at Harappa suggest that some residents had migrated to the city from beyond the Indus Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surprising Discoveries From the Indus Civilization|work= National Geographic|first= Traci |last=Watson|date= 29 April 2013|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130425-indus-civilization-discoveries-harappa-archaeology-science/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that trade contacts extended to [[Crete]] and possibly to Egypt.&lt;ref name="GoogleBooks-4532313"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNsXZkdHvXUC&amp;pg=PA67 |title=The Hindus: an alternative history |isbn=978-0-19-959334-7 |date=30 September 2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=67 |first=Wendy |last=Doniger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations as early as the middle Harappan Phase, with much commerce being handled by "middlemen merchants from Dilmun" (modern [[Bahrain]] and [[Failaka]] located in the [[Persian Gulf]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Underwater archaeology proceedings of the Society for Historical Archaeology Conference at Kingston, Jamaica 1992|last=Neyland|first=R.

Several coastal settlements like Sotkagen-dor (astride Dasht River, north of Jiwani), [[Sokhta Koh]] (astride Shadi River, north of [[Pasni City|Pasni]]), and Balakot (near Sonmiani) in Pakistan along with Lothal in western India, testify to their role as Harappan trading outposts. Shallow harbours located at the estuaries of rivers opening into the sea allowed brisk maritime trade with Mesopotamian cities.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is generally assumed that most trade between the Indus Valley (ancient Meluhha?) and western neighbors proceeded up the Persian Gulf rather than overland. Although there is no incontrovertible proof that this was indeed the case, the distribution of Indus-type artifacts on the Oman peninsula, on Bahrain and in southern Mesopotamia makes it plausible that a series of maritime stages linked the Indus Valley and the Gulf region.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Potts (2009), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/maritime-trade-i-pre-islamic-period MARITIME TRADE: PRE-ISLAMIC PERIOD] iranicaonline.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1980s, important archaeological discoveries were made at [[Ras al-Jinz]] ([[Oman]]), demonstrating maritime Indus Valley connections with the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Maurizio Tosi 1993, pp. 745-61"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Tosi: ''Die Indus-Zivilisation jenseits des indischen Subkontinents'', in: ''Vergessene Städte am Indus'', Mainz am Rhein 1987, {{ISBN|3805309570}}, S. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitoman.nl/pdf/RAJ%20English%20brochure%20copy.pdf Story of Ras Al Jinz.] Oman Information&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
According to Gangal et al. (2014), there is strong archeological and geographical evidence that neolithic farming spread from the Near East into north-west India, but there is also "good evidence for the local domestication of barley and the [[zebu]] cattle at Mehrgarh."{{sfn|Gangal|2014}}{{refn|group=note|name=Gangal|Gangal refers to Jarrige JF (2008), ''Mehrgarh Neolithic''. Pragdhara 18: 136–154; and to Costantini L (2008), ''The first farmers in Western Pakistan: the evidence of the Neolithic agropastoral settlement of Mehrgarh''. Pragdhara 18: 167–178}}

According to Jean-Francois Jarrige, farming had an independent origin at Mehrgarh, despite the similarities which he notes between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus valley, which are evidence of a "cultural continuum" between those sites. Nevertheless, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background," and is not a "'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East."&lt;ref name="Jarrige"&gt;Jean-Francois Jarrige [http://www.archaeology.up.nic.in/doc/mn_jfj.pdf ''Mehrgarh Neolithic''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221610/http://archaeology.up.nic.in/doc/mn_jfj.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }}, Paper presented in the International Seminar on the "First Farmers in Global Perspective," Lucknow, India, 18–20 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Jim G. Shaffer]] writes that the Mehrgarh site "demonstrates that food production was an indigenous South Asian phenomenon" and that the data support interpretation of "the prehistoric urbanisation and complex social organisation in South Asia as based on indigenous, but not isolated, cultural developments".&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer 1999 p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarrige notes that the people of [[Mehrgarh]] used domesticated wheats and [[barley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarrige|first=J.-F.|year=1986|title=Excavations at Mehrgarh-Nausharo|journal=Pakistan Archaeology|volume=10|issue=22|pages=63–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Shaffer and Liechtenstein note that the major cultivated cereal crop was naked six-row barley, a crop derived from two-row barley.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer and Liechtenstein 1995, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Gangal agrees that "Neolithic domesticated crops in Mehrgarh include more than 90% barley," noting that "there is good evidence for the local domestication of barley." Yet, Gangal also notes that the crop also included "a small amount of wheat," which "are suggested to be of Near-Eastern origin, as the modern distribution of wild varieties of wheat is limited to Northern Levant and Southern Turkey.{{sfn|Gangal|2014}}{{refn|group=note|Gangal refers to Fuller DQ (2006), ''Agricultural origins and frontiers in South Asia: a working synthesis.

The cattle that are often portrayed on Indus seals are humped [[Indian aurochs]], which are similar to [[Zebu]] cattle. Zebu cattle is still common in India, and in Africa. It is different from the European cattle, and had been originally domesticated on the Indian subcontinent, probably in the [[Baluchistan, Pakistan|Baluchistan region]] of Pakistan.{{sfn|Gallego Romero|2011}}{{sfn|Gangal|2014}}{{refn|group=note|name=Gangal}}

Research by J. Bates et al. (2016) confirms that Indus populations were the earliest people to use complex multi-cropping strategies across both seasons, growing foods during summer (rice, millets and beans) and winter (wheat, barley and pulses), which required different watering regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=J|year=1986|title=Approaching rice domestication in South Asia: New evidence from Indus settlements in northern India|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=78|issue=22|pages=193–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Bates et al. (2016) also found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process of rice in ancient South Asia, based around the wild species ''Oryza nivara''. This led to the local development of a mix of "wetland" and "dryland" agriculture of local ''Oryza sativa indica'' rice agriculture, before the truly "wetland" rice ''Oryza sativa japonica'' arrived around 2000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bates|first1=Jennifer|title=Rice farming in India much older than thought, used as 'summer crop' by Indus civilisation|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/rice-farming-in-india-much-older-than-thought-used-as-summer-crop-by-indus-civilisation|accessdate=21 November 2016|publisher=Research|date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
{{see also|Substratum in Vedic Sanskrit|l1=Substratum in Vedic Sanskrit|Harappan language|l2=Harappan language|Dravidian peoples#Origins|l3=Origins of Dravidian peoples}}

It has often been suggested that the bearers of the IVC corresponded to [[proto-Dravidian]]s linguistically, the break-up of proto-Dravidian corresponding to the break-up of the [[Late Harappan]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harappa.com/script/parpola0.html|title=Indus Writing Analysis by Asko Parpola}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish Indologist [[Asko Parpola]] concludes that the uniformity of the Indus inscriptions precludes any possibility of widely different languages being used, and that an early form of Dravidian language must have been the language of the Indus people.&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit has also contributed to Indus Civilization, Deccan Herald, 12 August 2012 [http://www.deccanherald.com/content/79062/sanskrit-has-contributed-indus-civilisation.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [[Dravidian language]] family is concentrated mostly in [[southern India]] and northern and eastern [[Sri Lanka]], but pockets of it still remain throughout the rest of India and Pakistan (the [[Brahui language]]), which lends credence to the theory.

According to Heggarty and Renfrew, Dravidian languages may have spread into the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] subcontinent with the spread of farming.{{sfn|Heggarty|Renfrew|2014}} According to David McAlpin, the Dravidian languages were brought to India by immigration into India from [[Elam]].&lt;!-- **START OF NOTE** --&gt;{{refn|group=note|See:

[[File:The 'Ten Indus Scripts' discovered near the northern gateway of the Dholavira citadel.jpg|thumb|800px|center|&lt;center&gt;Ten Indus Signs, dubbed the [[Dholavira Signboard]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Between 400 and as many as 600 distinct Indus symbols&lt;ref&gt;Wells, B. An Introduction to Indus Writing. Early Sites Research Society (West) Monograph Series, 2, Independence MO 1999&lt;/ref&gt; have been found on [[seal (device)|seals]], small tablets, ceramic pots and more than a dozen other materials, including a "signboard" that apparently once hung over the gate of the inner citadel of the Indus city of Dholavira. Typical [[Indus inscriptions]] are no more than four or five characters in length, most of which (aside from the Dholavira "signboard") are tiny; the longest on a single surface, which is less than 1&amp;nbsp;inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm) square, is 17 signs long; the longest on any object (found on three different faces of a mass-produced object) has a length of 26 symbols.

While the Indus Valley Civilisation is generally characterised as a literate society on the evidence of these inscriptions, this description has been challenged by Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Farmer, Steve |author2=Sproat, Richard |author3=Witzel, Michael |url=http://www.safarmer.com/fsw2.pdf|title=The Collapse of the Indus-Script Thesis: The Myth of a Literate Harappan Civilization}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that the Indus system did not encode language, but was instead similar to a variety of non-linguistic sign systems used extensively in the Near East and other societies, to symbolise families, clans, gods, and religious concepts. Others have claimed on occasion that the symbols were exclusively used for economic transactions, but this claim leaves unexplained the appearance of Indus symbols on many ritual objects, many of which were mass-produced in [[Moulding (process)|moulds]]. No parallels to these mass-produced inscriptions are known in any other early ancient civilisations.&lt;ref&gt;These and other issues are addressed in {{harvtxt|Parpola|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 study by P. N. Rao et al. published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], computer scientists, comparing the pattern of symbols to various linguistic scripts and non-linguistic systems, including DNA and a computer programming language, found that the Indus script's pattern is closer to that of spoken words, supporting the hypothesis that it codes for an as-yet-unknown language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Rajesh P.

Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel have disputed this finding, pointing out that Rao et al. did not actually compare the Indus signs with "real-world non-linguistic systems" but rather with "two wholly artificial systems invented by the authors, one consisting of 200,000 randomly ordered signs and another of 200,000 fully ordered signs, that they spuriously claim represent the structures of all real-world non-linguistic sign systems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safarmer.com/Refutation3.pdf A Refutation of the Claimed Refutation of the Non-linguistic Nature of Indus Symbols: Invented Data Sets in the Statistical Paper of Rao et al.

The messages on the seals have proved to be too short to be decoded by a computer. Each seal has a distinctive combination of symbols and there are too few examples of each sequence to provide a sufficient context. The symbols that accompany the images vary from seal to seal, making it impossible to derive a meaning for the symbols from the images. There have, nonetheless, been a number of interpretations offered for the meaning of the seals. These interpretations have been marked by ambiguity and subjectivity.&lt;ref name="RAO" /&gt;{{rp|69}}

Photos of many of the thousands of extant inscriptions are published in the ''Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions'' (1987, 1991, 2010), edited by [[Asko Parpola]] and his colleagues. The most recent volume republished photos taken in the 1920s and 1930s of hundreds of lost or stolen inscriptions, along with many discovered in the last few decades; formerly, researchers had to supplement the materials in the ''Corpus'' by study of the tiny photos in the excavation reports of Marshall (1931), MacKay (1938, 1943), Wheeler (1947), or reproductions in more recent scattered sources.

The religion and belief system of the Indus Valley people have received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of [[Indian religions]] that later developed in the area. However, due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, and the fact that the Indus script remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later Hindu perspective.{{sfn|keay|}}{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=281–282}}

An early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harappan sites&lt;ref name="ratnagarCA"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ratnagar |first=Shereen |date=April 2004 |title=Archaeology at the Heart of a Political Confrontation The Case of Ayodhya |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/5696/1/5696.pdf |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=239–259 |doi=10.1086/381044 |jstor=10.1086/381044}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that of [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]], who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus ([[linga]]) and vulva ([[yoni]]); and, use of baths and water in religious practice. Marshall's interpretations have been much debated, and sometimes disputed over the following decades.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=48–78}}{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–156}}[[File:IndusValleySeals swastikas.JPG|thumb|[[Swastika]] seals of Indus Valley Civilisation in [[British Museum]]]]

One Indus Valley seal shows a seated figure with a horned headdress, possibly [[tricephalic]] and possibly [[ithyphallic]], surrounded by animals. Marshall identified the figure as an early form of the Hindu god [[Shiva]] (or [[Rudra]]), who is associated with [[Asceticism#Hinduism|asceticism]], [[yoga]], and [[Lingam|linga]]; regarded as a [[Pashupati|lord of animals]]; and often depicted as having three eyes. The seal has hence come to be known as the [[Pashupati Seal]], after ''[[Pashupati]]'' (lord of all animals), an epithet of Shiva.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=48–78}}{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–144}} While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]] Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|pp=180–181}} Herbert Sullivan and [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with ''Mahisha'', the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with [[vahana]]s (vehicles) of deities for the four cardinal directions.{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=399–432}} Writing in 2002, [[Gregory L. Possehl]] concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would be going too far.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–144}} Despite the criticisms of Marshall's association of the seal with a proto-Shiva icon, it has been interpreted as the [[Tirthankara]] [[Rishabhanatha]] by [[Jains]] and [[Vilas Sangave]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Vilas Sangave|year=2001|title=''Facets of Jainology: Selected Research Papers on Jain Society, Religion, and Culture''|publisher=Popular Prakashan: Mumbai|isbn=978-81-7154-839-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FGSGmP4jNcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an early [[Buddha]] by Buddhists.&lt;ref name=ratnagarCA /&gt; Historians such as [[Heinrich Zimmer]] and [[Thomas McEvilley]] believe that there is a connection between first [[Jain]] Tirthankara Rishabhanatha and the Indus Valley civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophies of India|last=Zimmer|first=Heinrich|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1969|isbn=978-0-691-01758-7|editor-last=Campbell|editor-first=Joseph|location=NY|pages=60, 208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas McEvilley]] (2002) ''The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies''.

Marshall hypothesised the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines, and thought that this was a precursor of the Hindu sect of [[Shaktism]]. However the function of the female figurines in the life of Indus Valley people remains unclear, and Possehl does not regard the evidence for Marshall's hypothesis to be "terribly robust".{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–145}} Some of the [[Baetylus|baetyls]] interpreted by Marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead, while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise ''yoni'' were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars, although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated.{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|pp=286–287}} Many Indus Valley seals show animals, with some depicting them being carried in processions, while others show [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeric creations]]. One seal from Mohenjo-daro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger, which may be a reference to the [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian myth]] of such a monster created by goddess [[Ninhursag|Aruru]] to fight [[Gilgamesh]].{{sfn|Marshall|1931|p=67}}

In contrast to contemporary [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamian]] civilisations, Indus Valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=18}}{{sfn|Thapar|2004|p=85}} This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the [[Great Bath]] at Mohenjo-daro is widely thought to have been so used, as a place for ritual purification.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–145}}{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|pp=275–277, 292}} The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation are marked by their diversity, with evidence of supine burial, fractional burial (in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment), and even cremation.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=152, 157–176}}{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|pp=293–299}}

[[File:Coach driver Indus 01.jpg|thumb|right|Late Harappan figures from a hoard at [[Daimabad]], 2000 BCE]]

Around 1900 BCE signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around 1700 BCE most of the cities had been abandoned. Recent examination of human skeletons from the site of Harappa has demonstrated that the end of the Indus civilisation saw an increase in inter-personal violence and in infectious diseases like [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="Schug2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins Schug|first=G|date=November 2012|title=A Peaceful Realm?

According to historian [[Upinder Singh]], "the general picture presented by the late Harappan phase is one of a breakdown of urban networks and an expansion of rural ones."&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA211 ''A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century''], p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of approximately 1900 to 1700 BCE, multiple regional cultures emerged within the area of the Indus civilisation. The [[Cemetery H culture]] was in [[Punjab]], [[Haryana]], and [[Western Uttar Pradesh]], the [[Jhukar phase|Jhukar culture]] was in [[Sindh]], and the [[Rangpur, India|Rangpur culture]] (characterised by Lustrous Red Ware pottery) was in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.harappa.com/indus2/180.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Jane (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;pg=PR14 ''The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA211 ''A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century''], p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites associated with the Late phase of the Harappan culture are [[Pirak]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan]], and [[Daimabad]] in [[Maharashtra]], India.&lt;ref name="J.M. Kenoyer 2006 pp. 21"/&gt;

The largest Late Harappan sites are Kudwala in [[Cholistan]], [[Bet Dwarka]] in [[Gujarat]], and [[Daimabad]] in [[Maharashtra]], which can be considered as urban, but they are smaller and few in number compared with the Mature Harappan cities. Bet Dwarka was fortified and continued to have contacts with the [[Persian Gulf]] region, but there was a general decrease of long-distance trade.&lt;ref&gt;U. Singh (2008), pp.181,223&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the period also saw a diversification of the agricultural base, with a diversity of crops and the advent of [[double-cropping]], as well as a shift of rural settlement towards the east and the south.&lt;ref name="U. Singh 2008, pp.180-181"&gt;U. Singh (2008), pp.180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

The pottery of the Late Harappan period is described as "showing some continuity with mature Harappan pottery traditions," but also distinctive differences.&lt;ref name="U. Singh 2008, p.211"&gt;U. Singh (2008), p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Many sites continued to be occupied for some centuries, although their urban features declined and disappeared. Formerly typical artifacts such as stone weights and female figurines became rare. There are some circular [[stamp seal]]s with geometric designs, but lacking the [[Indus script]] which characterised the mature phase of the civilisation. Script is rare and confined to potsherd inscriptions.&lt;ref name="U. Singh 2008, p.211"/&gt; There was also a decline in long-distance trade, although the local cultures show new innovations in [[faience]] and glass making, and carving of stone beads.&lt;ref&gt;Kenoyer (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Urban amenities such as drains and the public bath were no longer maintained, and newer buildings were "poorly constructed". Stone sculptures were deliberately vandalised, valuables were sometimes concealed in [[hoard]]s, suggesting unrest, and the corpses of animals and even humans were left unburied in the streets and in abandoned buildings.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh (2008), pp.91,98&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later half of the 2nd millennium BCE, most of the post-urban Late Harappan settlements were abandoned altogether. Subsequent material culture was typically characterised by temporary occupation, "the campsites of a population which was nomadic and mainly pastoralist" and which used "crude handmade pottery."&lt;ref&gt;F.R. Allchin (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C&amp;pg=PA36 ''The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States''] (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is greater continuity and overlap between Late Harappan and subsequent cultural phases at sites in [[Punjab]], [[Haryana]], and western [[Uttar Pradesh]], primarily small rural settlements.&lt;ref name="U. Singh 2008, pp.180-181"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allchin (ed., 1995), p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Aryan invasion"===
{{See also|Vedic period|Indo-Aryan migration}}
In 1953 Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] proposed that the invasion of an Indo-European tribe from Central Asia, the "[[Indo-Aryan migration|Aryans]]", caused the decline of the Indus Civilisation. As evidence, he cited a group of 37 skeletons found in various parts of Mohenjo-daro, and passages in the Vedas referring to battles and forts. However, scholars soon started to reject Wheeler's theory, since the skeletons belonged to a period after the city's abandonment and none were found near the citadel. Subsequent examinations of the skeletons by [[Kenneth A. R. Kennedy|Kenneth Kennedy]] in 1994 showed that the marks on the skulls were caused by erosion, and not by violence.&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture|year=2001|pages=159–60|author=Edwin Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cemetery H Pottery.png|thumb|left|Painted pottery urns from Harappa (Cemetery H period)]]
In the [[Cemetery H culture]] (the late Harappan phase in the Punjab region), some of the designs painted on the funerary urns have been interpreted through the lens of [[historical Vedic religion|Vedic literature]]: for instance, peacocks with hollow bodies and a small human form inside, which has been interpreted as the souls of the dead, and a hound that can be seen as the hound of [[Yama]], the god of death.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams (eds., 1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture''], p.102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridget and Raymond Allchin (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan''], p.246&lt;/ref&gt; This may indicate the introduction of new religious beliefs during this period, but the archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis that the Cemetery H people were the destroyers of the Harappan cities.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=102–103}}

Scholars have long argued that these rains shaped the origins of the urban Harappan societies, which emerged from Neolithic villages around 2600 BC. It now appears that this rainfall began to slowly taper off in the third millennium, at just the point that the Harappan cities began to develop.

As the monsoons kept shifting south, the floods grew too erratic for sustainable agricultural activities. The residents then migrated towards the Ganges basin in the east, where they established smaller villages and isolated farms. The small surplus produced in these small communities did not allow development of trade, and the cities died out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-indus-harappan-20120528,0,1127932.story | title = Migration of monsoons created, then killed Harappan civilization | author = Thomas H.

=== Earthquakes ===
There are archaeological evidences of major earthquakes at Dholavira in 2200 BCE as well as at Kalibangan in 2700 and 2900 BCE. Such succession of earthquakes, along with drought, may have contributed to decline of Ghaggar-Harka system. Sea level changes are also found at two possible seaport sites along the Makran coast which are now inland. Earthquakes may have contributed to decline of several sites by direct shaking damage, by sea level change or by change in water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A. Grijalva|first=K|last2=L.

===Continuity===
Archaeological excavations indicate that the decline of Harappa drove people eastward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kamandalu: The Seven Sacred Rivers of Hinduism|page=125|publisher=Mayur University|first=Shrikala|last=Warrier}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Possehl, after 1900 BCE the number of sites in today's India increased from 218 to 853. According to Andrew Lawler, "excavations along the Gangetic plain show that cities began to arise there starting about 1200 BCE, just a few centuries after Harappa was deserted and much earlier than once suspected."&lt;ref name="Science" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Most sites of the [[Painted Grey Ware]] culture in the Ghaggar-Hakra and Upper Ganges Plain were small farming villages. However, "several dozen" PGW sites eventually emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterized as towns, the largest of which were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades, albeit smaller and simpler than the elaborately fortified large cities which grew after 600 BCE in the more fully urban [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;James Heitzman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RdcnAgh_StUC ''The City in South Asia''] (Routledge, 2008), pp.12–13&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Jim Shaffer there was a continuous series of cultural developments, just as in most areas of the world. These link "the so-called two major phases of urbanisation in South Asia".&lt;ref name="Spodek" /&gt;

At sites such as [[Bhagwanpura, Haryana|Bhagwanpura]] (in [[Haryana]]), archaeological excavations have discovered an overlap between the final phase of Late Harappan pottery and the earliest phase of [[Painted Grey Ware]] pottery, the latter being associated with the [[Vedic Period|Vedic Culture]] and dating from around 1200 BCE. This site provides evidence of multiple social groups occupying the same village but using different pottery and living in different types of houses: "over time the Late Harappan pottery was gradually replaced by Painted Grey ware pottery," and other cultural changes indicated by archaeology include the introduction of the horse, iron tools, and new religious practices.&lt;ref name="J.M. Kenoyer 2006 pp. 21"/&gt;

There is also a Harappan site called [[Rojdi]] in [[Rajkot]] district of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. Its excavation started under an archaeological team from Gujarat State Department of Archaeology and the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania in 1982–83. In their report on archaeological excavations at Rojdi, [[Gregory Possehl]] and M.H. Raval write that although there are "obvious signs of cultural continuity" between the Harappan Civilisation and later South Asian cultures, many aspects of the Harappan "sociocultural system" and "integrated civilization" were "lost forever," while the Second Urbanisation of India (beginning with the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] culture, c. 600 BCE) "lies well outside this sociocultural environment".&lt;ref&gt;Harappan Civilisation and Rojdi, by Gregory L. Possehl and M.H. Raval (1989) https://books.google.com/books?id=LtgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Harappan ==
{{Main|Iron Age India}}

Previously, scholars believed that the decline of the Harappan civilisation led to an interruption of urban life in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Indus Valley Civilisation did not disappear suddenly, and many elements of the Indus Civilisation appear in later cultures. The [[Cemetery H culture]] may be the manifestation of the Late Harappan over a large area in the region of [[Punjab]], [[Haryana]] and western [[Uttar Pradesh]], and the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]] its successor. David Gordon White cites three other mainstream scholars who "have emphatically demonstrated" that [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] derives partially from the Indus Valley Civilisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= White|first= David Gordon|title= Kiss of the Yogini|year= 2003|publisher= University of Chicago Press|location= Chicago|isbn= 0-226-89483-5|page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2016}}, archaeological data suggests that the material culture classified as Late Harappan may have persisted until at least c. 1000–900 BCE and was partially contemporaneous with the [[Painted Grey Ware]] culture.&lt;ref name="Spodek"&gt;{{cite book|last= Shaffer|first= Jim|year= 1993|chapter= Reurbanization: The eastern Punjab and beyond|title= Urban Form and Meaning in South Asia: The Shaping of Cities from Prehistoric to Precolonial Times|editor= [[Howard Spodek|Spodek, Howard]] |editor2=Srinivasan, Doris M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard archaeologist Richard Meadow points to the late Harappan settlement of [[Pirak]], which thrived continuously from 1800 BCE to the time of the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]] in 325 BCE.&lt;ref name="Science" /&gt;

In the aftermath of the Indus Civilisation's localisation, regional cultures emerged, to varying degrees showing the influence of the Indus Civilisation. In the formerly great city of Harappa, burials have been found that correspond to a regional culture called the [[Cemetery H culture]]. At the same time, the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]] expanded from [[Rajasthan]] into the [[Gangetic Plain]]. The Cemetery H culture has the earliest evidence for [[cremation]]; a practice dominant in [[Hinduism]] today.

== Historical context ==

=== Near East ===
The mature (Harappan) phase of the IVC is contemporary to the [[Early Bronze Age|Early]] and [[Middle Bronze Age]] in the [[Ancient Near East]], in particular the [[Old Elamite period]], [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic]] to [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III]] [[Mesopotamia]], Prepalatial [[Minoan Crete]] and [[Old Kingdom]] to [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]] [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].

The IVC has been compared in particular with the civilisations of [[Elam]] (also in the context of the [[Elamo-Dravidian]] hypothesis) and with [[Minoan Crete]] (because of isolated cultural parallels such as the ubiquitous [[Goddess|goddess worship]] and depictions of [[bull-leaping]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H.|last=Mode|title=Indische Frühkulturen und ihre Beziehungen zum Westen|location=Basel|year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVC has been tentatively identified with the toponym [[Meluhha]] known from Sumerian records; the Sumerians called them Meluhhaites.&lt;ref&gt;John Haywood, ''The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Civilizations'', Penguin Books, London, ç2005, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shahr-i-Sokhta]], located in southeastern Iran shows trade route with [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran Almanac and Book of Facts|publisher=Echo Institute|page=59|quote=city of Shahr-e-Sukhteh near the Afghanistan border, an area which has been aptly [...] point on the trade routes between the Indus Valley, the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brotherhood"&gt;{{cite book|title=Brotherhood of Kings: How International Relations Shaped the Ancient Near East|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTvRCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Shahr-i-Sokhta+indus+valley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqxKWA6d3NAhWFm5QKHVr1DBIQ6AEISzAI|first=Amanda H.|last=Podany|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of seals with Indus script have been also found in Mesopotamian sites.&lt;ref name="brotherhood" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legacy of Dilmun: The Roots of Ancient Maritime Trade in Eastern Coastal Arabia in the 4th/3rd Millennium B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfrQAAAAMAAJ|first=Constance Maria|last=Piesinger|publisher=University of Wisconsin|page=668|quote=Rare finds of square seals with Indus script have been found in Mesopotamia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art of the First Cities: The Third Millennium B.C. from the Mediterranean to the Indus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8l9X_3rHFdEC&amp;pg=PA246|quote=Square-shaped Indus seals of fired steatite have been found at a few sites in Mesopotamia.|author1=Joan Aruz|author2=Ronald Wallenfels|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dasyu ===
After the discovery of the IVC in the 1920s, it was immediately associated with the indigenous [[Dasyu]] inimical to the [[Rigvedic tribes]] in numerous hymns of the [[Rigveda]]. [[Mortimer Wheeler]] interpreted the presence of many unburied corpses found in the top levels of Mohenjo-daro as the victims of a warlike conquest, and famously stated that "[[Indra]] stands accused" of the destruction of the IVC. The association of the IVC with the city-dwelling Dasyus remains alluring because the assumed timeframe of the first Indo-Aryan migration into India corresponds neatly with the period of decline of the IVC seen in the archaeological record. The discovery of the advanced, urban IVC however changed the 19th-century view of early Indo-Aryan migration as an "invasion" of an advanced culture at the expense of a "primitive" aboriginal population to a gradual [[acculturation]] of nomadic "barbarians" on an advanced urban civilisation, comparable to the Germanic migrations after the [[Fall of Rome]], or the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion of [[Babylonia]]. This move away from simplistic "invasionist" scenarios parallels similar developments in thinking about [[language transfer]] and population movement in general, such as in the case of the migration of the proto-Greek speakers into Greece, or the Indo-Europeanisation of Western Europe.

=== Munda ===
[[Munda languages|Proto-Munda]] (or [[paraphyletic|Para]]-Munda) and a "lost phylum" (perhaps related or ancestral to the [[Nihali language]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witzel |first=Michael |year=1999 |title=Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan ({{IAST|Ṛgvedic}}, Middle and Late Vedic) |url=http://ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf |journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies |volume=5 |issue=1 |authorlink=Michael E.

[[Michael Witzel]] suggests an underlying, prefixing language that is similar to [[Austroasiatic]], notably [[Khasi language|Khasi]]; he argues that the Rigveda shows signs of this hypothetical Harappan influence in the earliest historic level, and Dravidian only in later levels, suggesting that speakers of Austroasiatic were the original inhabitants of Punjab and that the Indo-Aryans encountered speakers of Dravidian only in later times.&lt;ref name="Witzel"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies|authorlink=Michael Witzel|last=Witzel|first=Michael|title=The Languages of Harappa|date=February 2000|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/IndusLang.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ioan Bianu''' (1856 or 1857{{ref label|A|a|none}} – February 13, 1935) was an [[Austrian Empire|Imperial Austrian]]-born [[Romania]]n philologist and bibliographer. The son of a peasant family from [[Transylvania]], he completed high school in [[Blaj]], where he became a disciple of [[Timotei Cipariu]] and [[Ioan Micu Moldovan]]. As a youth, he espoused [[Romanian nationalism]], and came into conflict with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities, before finally emigrating to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] in 1876. There, he attended the [[University of Bucharest]], later joining the faculty, where he taught [[Romanian literature|Romanian literary history]]. He was affiliated with the [[Romanian Academy Library]] for over half a century, transforming the institution from the meager state in which he found it, and overseeing a five-fold increase of its collection. He helped author two important multi-volume works detailing early books and manuscripts from his country, and was a founder of [[library and information science]] in his adoptive country. Near the end of his life, struggling with deafness, Bianu withdrew from the Library in favor of his friend [[Radu R. Rosetti]], but went on to serve as president of the [[Romanian Academy]].

Bianu's scholarship was doubled by his work as an organizer in the field, and, especially after 1880, by a participation in political intrigues. He was a disciple of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], joining the latter's [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and canvassing support in academia. Bianu continued to agitate among the Transylvanian Romanians, but, by 1896, both he and Sturdza had turned moderate on the national issue, and favored a rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. As such, Bianu was a "[[Germanophilia|Germanophile]]" during World War I, meaning that he criticized Romania's alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. He remained in [[German Empire|German]]-occupied territory following the [[Battle of Bucharest|fall of Bucharest]], but was spared persecution upon the end of war.

==Biography==

===Beginnings===
He was born in [[Valea Lungă, Alba|Făget (Oláhbükkös)]], a village east of the [[Transylvania]]n town of [[Blaj]]&lt;ref name="m253; ln(07)142"&gt;Mihai, p. 253; Nastasă (2007), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; (on the southern border of [[Kis-Küküllő County]] from 1876, and nowadays in [[Alba County]]). His parents, Grigore and Anica (''née'' Popa), married in 1855; it was Grigore's second marriage.&lt;ref name="d206"&gt;Dumitraș, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two sons and three daughters, all of whom survived into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitraș, pp. 206–207&lt;/ref&gt; The Bianu family was an old peasant one of some means, the village a small Romanian one on a hillside. Living in proximity to the spiritual center of the [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]] in what was then the Austrian Empire, they belonged to that faith.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitraș, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu attended primary school in his native village. His father understood the importance of schooling, even if this implied material sacrifices, and the boy studied for nearly a decade at the gymnasium and [[Inochentie Micu Clain National College|the Romanian high school]] in Blaj.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitraș, p. 208. See also Nastasă (2007), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; When he arrived in 1868, the local atmosphere was uncertain and marked by the faculty's activism against the recent [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], which consecrated Transylvania part of the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian Crown]], against Romanian demands.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitraș, pp. 208–210&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bianu was there, [[Timotei Cipariu]] was at the height of his career.&lt;ref name="m253; ln(07)142"/&gt; He lived with one of his teachers, [[Ioan Micu Moldovan]], who helped provide for his daily needs and with whom the former pupil kept touch until the teacher's death in 1915. It was in Moldovan's home that Bianu's interest in old Romanian books was first awakened, and he recalled in later years how he was treated there like a son.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitraș, pp. 209–210. See also Nastasă (2007), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; One of his final acts at the school was to participate in an annual demonstration of the May 1848 assembly on ''[[Câmpia Libertății]]''. This was the last such gathering, as the Hungarian authorities banned them henceforth.&lt;ref name="d215"&gt;Dumitraș, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianu graduated in 1876, in the same class as his cousin [[Vasile Bianu]], the future physician and political figure.&lt;ref name="vmliga"&gt;Victor Macaveiu, "Liga Culturală la Blaj. Congresul anual, 27—29 Iunie 1926", in ''Cultura Creștină'', Nr. 4–6/1926, pp. 97–99&lt;/ref&gt; Bearing a recommendation from Moldovan for [[August Treboniu Laurian]], Ioan left for [[Bucharest]], capital of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]];&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 253. See also Nastasă (2007), pp. 142, 505&lt;/ref&gt; four classmates joined him in emigrating.&lt;ref name="d215"/&gt; Laurian, supported by the poet [[Gheorghe Sion]],&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; obtained him a post as assistant at the [[National Library of Romania|Central State Library]]. He was thus able to support himself until 1880 while attending the literature and philosophy faculty of [[Bucharest University]]. In early 1879, he was named archivist and librarian of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="m253"&gt;Mihai, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Notoriously thrifty, he lived on the [[Romanian Academy Library]] grounds, downtown Bucharest, where he also raised cows.&lt;ref name="ln(07)130; (10)396"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 130; (2010), p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, he won a competition to become professor of Romanian language and literature at [[Saint Sava National College]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 253; Nastasă (2007), p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, with the help of his former professor [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]],&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, pp. 787–788&lt;/ref&gt; he received a scholarship to study Romance philology in [[University of Milan|Milan]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 169; Mihai, p. 253; Nastasă (2007), pp. 202–203, 226, 399; Urs, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; He met the Romanist [[Émile Picot]],&lt;ref&gt;Urs, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; took courses with [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] and [[Gaston Paris]], but the lasting impact of his sojourn lay in the eye-opening visits to libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 788; Nastasă (2007), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by the [[Palazzo Brera]], the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]], libraries across Italy, the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], the [[British Museum]] and the [[Bodleian Library]], he at the same time became keenly aware of the poor state of Romania's libraries and gathered ideas for their improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 788&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bianu la birou.png|thumb|300px|Bianu at his [[Romanian Academy Library]] desk, ca. 1900]]
After returning home in 1883, he became assistant professor at Bucharest University's department of Romanian literature. He still made visits abroad: in 1885, he spent time in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia-Lodomeria]], researching the [[Jagiellonian Library]] for Romanian-related subjects, the [[House of Ossoliński|Ossoliński]] archive at [[Lviv|Lemberg]], and the [[Dosoftei]] fund at [[Zhovkva|Schowkwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Bianu, ''Insemnărĭ istorice și literare adunate din biblioteci și arhive galiţiene în vara anului 1885. Extrasŭ din Analele Academieĭ Române, Seria II, Tom. VIII, Secț. I''. Bucharest: Tipografia Academieĭ Române (Laboratoriĭ Românĭ), 1886. See also Crăciun, p. 789&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his own request, he was also sent to [[Vistula Land|Russian Poland]], where he researched the [[Radziwiłł]] collection at [[Nesvizh Castle]]. He was hosted there by Antoni Radziwiłł, who allowed him to copy some 300 documents,&lt;ref&gt;"Foița. Academia română. Sesiunea generală din anul 1887. Raportul secretatului general asupra lucrărilor făcute în anul 1886–87 (Urmare)", in ''[[Telegraful Român]]'', Nr. 28/1887, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; and befriended his young daughter, later the Countess [[House of Potocki|Potocki]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, IV), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor and National Liberal agent===
Upon his return to Bucharest in June 1886, Bianu married Alexandrina Băicoianu, described by his friend [[Sextil Pușcariu]] as a "brilliantly spiritual" woman,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; and was thus received into the Bucharest upper-class. As noted by social historian Lucian Nastasă, this move also ensured Bianu more recognition as a scholar, as well as access to politics—through Băicoianu, he was now related to historian [[Alexandru D. Xenopol]] and politician [[Nicolae Xenopol]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 505–506; (2010), pp. 99, 103&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were Pușcariu's godparents upon the latter's own wedding, in September 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 111, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Bianu began his collaboration with Hasdeu's neoromantic literary review, ''Revista Nouă''.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Călinescu]], ''Istoria literaturii române de la origini pînă în prezent'', pp. 567, 569. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed the book review column, as well as a biography of the writer [[Gheorghe Asachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Bilciurescu, ''Bucureștii și bucureștenii de ieri și de azi'', pp. 266, 269. Bucharest: [[Universul|Editura Ziarului ''Universul'']], 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Elected a corresponding member of the Academy in 1887, he was elevated to titular status in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 253; Nastasă (2007), pp. 26, 495, 503, 506, 509–510&lt;/ref&gt; After losing the Romanian literature chair to [[Ovid Densusianu]] in 1901, in 1902 Bianu became the titled holder of the Romanian literature history professorate at the University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 245–246, 385, 398–402. See also Mihai, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; He was later also elected dean of the literature faculty.&lt;ref name="c789"/&gt; In addition to such work, in 1904 he served on a panel of inquiry created by the [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Ministry of Education]], closing down the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Sion|Notre-Dame de Sion]] schools, accused of forcefully converting [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] students to [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Bacalbașa]], ''Bucureștii de altă dată'', Vol. III, p. 84. Bucharest: [[Universul]], 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a member of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and auditor of its Bucharest club,&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1928), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu was an ally of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] and reached the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]]. Without serious ambitions in this realm, he preferred to be a sort of ''[[éminence grise]]'' to the party leader.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 169. See also Nastasă (2007), pp. 83, 89, 270–271; (2010), p. 257; Rosetti, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; From as early as 1887, he interceded between Sturdza and PNL-friendly academics, including the Slavist [[Ioan Bogdan]], obtaining their support against rival [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservatives]], and helping them travel for specialization abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 89, 106–107, 233–234, 270–272, 294, 320–321, 327–329; (2010), pp. 171–172, 350–351, 398&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bianu maintained links with the Conservatives' literary club, ''[[Junimea]]'', which he frequented as an outside guest in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; He also maintained links with the Conservative clubs of [[Western Moldavia]], befriending the moderate Conservative [[Radu Rosetti]]—and then his young son, [[Radu R. Rosetti]]. The two politicians discussed issues on bipartisan policies, and even conspired to remove incompetent administrators of either hue from their offices.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 26, 41, 45, 50, 81, 88, 106, 132–134&lt;/ref&gt; He and Hasdeu also persuaded Radu Sr to start his work as a social historian and theorist, and afterward helped him to find employment as an archivist.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 45, 83, 106&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nastasă, Bianu, allegedly the lover of Sturdza's wife Zoe,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; was an expert at maneuvering the "levers of power", and presided upon his own "clique".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianu was initially an orthodox [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]], campaigning for unity between Romania and his native Transylvania. During the early 1880s, when Sturdza served as Academy president, Bianu returned to Blaj, hoping to persuade Cipariu to resume his contacts with the Academy. Cipariu objected, mainly because of his dislike for Hasdeu and his conflict with Laurian.&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, Bianu joined the executive committee of the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]]&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1928), pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; and began sending out sponsorship to the leaders of the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'' protest movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; During the backlash, Bianu was sent by Sturdza to assist [[Eugen Brote]] and other exiled ''Memorandists'' at Milan. His plan to resettle the participants in various European countries was nevertheless seen as "downright absurd" by its intended beneficiaries, who preferred to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valeriu Braniște]], "Avanpremieră editorială. Clandestin prin imperiu", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', October 1971, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianu's own stance on Transylvania changed over several years. In 1896, with Sturdza as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], Bianu participated in the rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. During the state visit to Romania of [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], Sturdza sent Bianu, [[Grigore Antipa]], [[Ștefan Sihleanu]] and [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]] to [[Bolvașnița|Vârciorova]], where they were to meet Austrian delegates ahead of the Cultural League, which sent protesters. The two Romanian delegations clashed which each other, an incident which was reported with amusement in the Bucharest press.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa (1928), pp. 217–218&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu also continued to work for the Bucharest National Liberal club during the next decade, helping Sturdza win over ''Junimea'' from the Conservatives. During the [[Romanian general election, 1905|elections of 1905]], he backed the ''Junimist'' candidate [[Titu Maiorescu]] and, in return, obtained ''Junimea''{{'}}s support for the National Liberal [[Petru Poni]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu and Poni remained close friends for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu also used his influence for advancing many other scholarly goals, such as when, in 1909, he brought to Romania [[Ramiro Ortiz (academic)|Ramiro Ortiz]], who founded the Bucharest school of Italian studies.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 227, 420&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime===
During the earliest stages of World War I, with Romania still cautiously neutral, Bianu also took a neutralist attitude. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who was president of the Cultural League, noted that Bianu, unlike Sturdza, did not wish to see Romania committed to the [[Central Powers]]. This was because "he resented us fighting alongside the Hungarians, who never ever had any other objective but to crush us."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, IV), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bianu was also one of the Transylvanians and minority-PNL members who also rejected proposals to join the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Among these "[[Germanophilia|Germanophiles]]", Bianu stood out for speaking out against the project to occupy Transylvania from Austria-Hungary with Entente support.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 73, 81, 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1914, using the pen name Ion Frunză, he published the essay ''Pentru lămurirea situației. Cuvinte către români'' ("Making Things Clear. An Address to the Romanians"). This work, soon after translated into German, argued that the Entente was a cover for the [[Russian Empire]], [[Pan-Slavism]], and the "[[Turanism|Turanic hordes]]"; he decried the persecution of Romanians in Austria-Hungary, but noted that they all fared much better than the Romanians living in Russia's [[Bessarabia Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 169–171, 208, 232–233, 254&lt;/ref&gt; This view was instantly supported by the sociologist [[Dimitrie Gusti]], who suggested that "Frunză's admirable work" should be published "in millions of copies, so that every Romanian will read it".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|in autumn 1916]], a PNL cabinet and [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] announced Romania's support for the Entente; Romanian troops [[Battle of Transylvania|briefly entered Transylvania]], but Romania was in turn invaded by the Central Powers. Bianu stifled his opposition, but did not openly criticize all the Central Powers. In September, shortly after the [[Battle of Turtucaia]], he penned in ''[[Viitorul]]'' an article specifically targeting the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Bulgarians in Romania]], whom he called "venomous snakes". According to historian [[Lucian Boia]], this is "possibly the most anti-Bulgarian writing ever published in Romanian"; "Bianu says nothing about the Austro-Hungarians or Germans, as if Romanians had only been at war with the Bulgarians in 1916!"&lt;ref name="lb171"&gt;Boia, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian army and administration headed for Western Moldavia: Bianu's son Alexandru was drafted, but, according to his adversaries, spent the war in relative safety at [[Bârlad]], shying away from active duty.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Proca, "Bârladul în Primul Război Mondial. Mărturii documentare", in ''Acta Musei Tutovensis. Memorialistică'', Vol. III, 2018, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Also controversially, Bianu Sr chose not to join the exodus, and remained with the Germanophiles and neutralists in [[Battle of Bucharest|occupied Bucharest]], to 1918. He noted that he watched on, "eyes flooded in tears", as the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] marched through the streets.&lt;ref name="lb171"/&gt; One of ten academicians to remain behind, he ensured that the Academy Library continued to function in relatively normal terms, refusing to publish under the occupation regime,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; but also collaborating with the occupier to at least some degree.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 109–110, 124, 172–176&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bianu's letters of the occupation are a primary source for the activities of Germanophiles such as Antipa, [[Petre P. Carp]], [[Alexandru Al. Beldiman]], [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], and [[Iacob Negruzzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 45, 73–74, 138, 172–176, 186–187, 193–194, 253–254&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu sided with Carp in his critique of PNL politics, but, unlike him and Beldiman, did not call for the dethronement of King Ferdinand. He also refrained from signing up to Carp's openly pro-German platform.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 173–175&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was remembered by the anti-Germanophiles for participating at banquets hosted by the puppet governor, [[Lupu Kostaki]].&lt;ref&gt;Cancicov, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] also asked Bianu to vouch for officer [[Alexandru Leca Morariu]], who was accused of being secretly a Romanian nationalist agitator.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|conceded defeat in May 1918]], and the Academy could resume work in Bucharest under a German-friendly Conservative regime, with [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] as Prime Minister. In October, Bianu joined his returning peers and reported on the damages incurred during the previous years.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; He scandalized public opinion further after ordering public mourning at the Academy after the death of a pro-Austrian cleric, [[Vasile Mangra]].&lt;ref&gt;Cancicov, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; The loyalist government was fully restored in Bucharest within a month, following the unexpected [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|defeat of Germany]], which led to the establishment of [[Greater Romania]] (which included [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|united Transylvania]]). In December, Prime Minister [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] was welcomed by the Academy. According to the now-disgraced Marghiloman, his supporters were either barred from attending or, in Bianu's case, silenced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru Marghiloman]], ''Note politice, 4. 1918–1919'', p. 183. Bucharest: Editura Institutului de Arte Grafice Eminescu, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; In this new climate, Bianu was investigated by an Academy commission as a wartime collaborator in March 1919, but refused to present himself for questioning. As he put it, the group investigating him only relied on cut-outs from the anti-Germanophile press.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 348, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
In May 1919, Bianu joined efforts with Iorga and other pro-Entente academicians in order to obtain the international recognition of Romania's new borders. However, they failed to convince [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs]] to sponsor their diplomatic correspondence with Western European academies.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1930), pp. 208–210&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was mentioned by name and castigated in the Academy commission report of July 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 352–353&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu suffered no further consequences. Three years later, a conflict erupted between King Ferdinand and the PNL, on one side, and the Transylvanian-based [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR), on the other. At core was the issue of Transylvanian autonomy. Bianu used his intermediary position to negotiate a PNR presence at [[Alba Iulia]], where Ferdinand crowned himself King of Greater Romania, but was unable to convince [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]].&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu, pp. 481–484&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianu's time was divided between Bucharest and [[Predeal]], where, in 1912, he had built himself a villa.&lt;ref name="ln(07)130; (10)396"/&gt; From ca. 1909, his wife had fallen ill and was hardly ever seen in public.&lt;ref name="ni(36)323–4"&gt;Iorga (1936), pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Alexandru studied law in Paris and returned to Romania in 1923 to work as a bank clerk, before finally joining the diplomatic corps and serving as commercial attaché in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 301, 457&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Bianu helped organize Romania's first national congress of librarians, and later that year founded the country's first librarians' association,&lt;ref name="p64"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dina Paladi, [http://www.bibnat.ro/dyn-img/publicatii/Revista_BNR_1_2008-COMPLETA.pdf "Bibliologi celebri"], in ''Revista Bibliotecii Naționale a României'', Vol. XIV, Nr. 1, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; alongside a Romanian Practical School of Archival Science, modeled on the [[École Nationale des Chartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

During his final years, he declared his dissatisfaction with the "exclusivist-repulsive individualism" in Romanian academic life, describing it as an "evil" influence.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1925, he was forced to announce that the Academy had a 90% deficit and was cutting back on expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, V), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to intervene politically for his various protegés, including the literary critic [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]] and the linguist [[Theodor Capidan]], and steered the career of philologist [[Alexandru Rosetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 113–114, 185, 190–193, 295–296, 302–303, 323–324, 360, 504, 506; (2010), p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1926, Bianu and his cousin Vasile returned to Blaj for the Cultural League Congress, presided upon by Iorga.&lt;ref name="vmliga"/&gt; He also reluctantly presented himself as a candidate for the post of Academy president, but lost by a large margin to [[Emil Racoviță]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, V), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Bianu had expressed his dislike of [[Italian fascism]], and, as a consequence, the Italian authorities passed him over for awards and distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, V), pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1928, during his last months at University, he seconded Rector [[Ermil Pangrati]] in urging government to dissolve the antisemitic Union of Christian Students, which was causing disturbances and riots;&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Nastasă, ''Antisemitismul universitar în România (1919–1939)'', pp. 403–404. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor Minorităților Naționale, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-6-06-927445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this stance was contrasted by Vasile, who, as a member of the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], argued that [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]] sympathized with [[Hungarian irredentism]].&lt;ref&gt;Attila Gidó, ''Două decenii. Evreii din Cluj în perioada interbelică'', p. 115. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor Minorităților Naționale, 2014.  {{ISBN|978-606-8377-28-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching hampered by a progressive deafness, which had begun much earlier in life, Bianu withdrew from the University in mid 1928, resigning his seat to his disciple, folklorist [[Dumitru Caracostea]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 296, 363–364, 437, 482; (2010), pp. 249, 413, 418&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year, Caracostea had contributed to a Bianu ''[[Festschrift]]'', alongside Iorga, Pușcariu, Alexandru Rosetti, [[Vasile Bogrea]], [[Nicolae Cartojan]], [[Charles Drouhet]], and [[Petre P. Panaitescu]].&lt;ref name="nncomag"&gt;N. N. Condéescou, "''Omagiu lui I. Bianu din partea colegilor și foștilor săi elevi''", in ''Revue Critique d'Histoire et de Littérature'', Vol. 63, Issue 1, January 1929, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had inaugurated a project to design a new Library building, Bianu ultimately resigned his position there in early 1931, assigning his seat to Radu R. Rosetti.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Secrieru, "Radu R. Rosetti – istoric militar, academician și bibliotecar", in ''Confluențe Bibliologice'', Nr. 1–2/2006, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he announced that he was also suffering from kidney disease and [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, VI), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Made secretary general of the Academy in 1927,&lt;ref name="p64"/&gt; Bianu was elected as its president on June 1, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, V), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; An early admirer and political ally,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; the geologist [[Ludovic Mrazek]], referred to Bianu as a force of professional conservatism, one of several "decent men and sincere patriots" who stood up to intellectual fads.&lt;ref name="ln(07)495"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1932, the new king [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] made Bianu a Knight of the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, VI), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on behalf of the Romanian Academy, Bianu and [[Gheorghe Țițeica]] began corresponding with the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]]—part of a larger effort to bring about a détente in [[Romania–Russia relations|Romanian–Soviet relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, VI), pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned later that year, but continued to serve as vice president to his death.&lt;ref name="p64"/&gt;

A widower since December 1929,&lt;ref name="ni(36)323–4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gbez67"&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', p. 67. Bucharest: [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu died in his Bucharest home on February 13, 1935, after an episode of [[uremia]]. His body was laid in state at the Academy, and the Faculty of Letters marked the occasion by suspending courses for the day.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 437, 457&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried alongside Alexandrina Bianu in Plot 54 of [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref name="gbez67"/&gt; In his obituary piece, the Cultural League's Iorga referred to Bianu as "the Academy's titular god".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1936), p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; Bianu's personal book collections, comprising some 1,400 volumes, was bequeathed to the Academy Library.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by [[Alexandru Odobescu]], [[Ion Ghica]] and Sturdza, who inspired in him an appreciation for books and libraries, Bianu renounced the idea of a scientific career in favor of working as a librarian.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 253. See also Nastasă (2007), pp. 43, 202–203, 499&lt;/ref&gt; His first publication, in 1876, was a monograph on [[Samuil Micu-Klein]]. When he entered the Academy Library in 1879, the beginning of a 56-year affiliation that would end with his death,&lt;ref name="d205"&gt;Dumitraș, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; the institution had 6,000 donated volumes; by 1885, there were 30,000 and its formative phase was complete.&lt;ref name="m253"/&gt; In 1895, he started a bibliographic office at the library that through 1925 would attract the efforts of the country's scholars interested in creating a general bibliography of Romanian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 253–254&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his leadership, the need for additional research tools became apparent. He helped counter the lack of manuscripts, old books and documents on the language and national history by initiating an ample campaign for identifying and donating such materials.&lt;ref name="m254"&gt;Mihai, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; He ensured that the Academy Library became the National Library and helped merge the Central State Library into this institution in 1901, later folding in a number of private libraries. He pushed for an 1884 law mandating printing presses to send two copies of everything they printed to the Academy Library, and was behind improvements to the law in 1904.&lt;ref name="c789"&gt;Crăciun, p. 789&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he became one of the main proponents of reforming the [[Romanian alphabet]],&lt;ref name="ln(07)495"/&gt; but later declared himself against "excessive [[Phonemic orthography|phoneticism]]", standing up to reformists such as [[Simion Mehedinți]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1939, VI), pp. 61, 313&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, he and [[Ioan Bogdan]] reported trying to rescue the Library's [[Church Slavonic]] corpus from confiscation by the [[Bulgarian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 174–175, 186; Iorga (1930), pp. 47–48, 51–52, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianu authored a number of works on philology as well as history, particularly cultural history. Thoroughly familiar with old Romanian literature, he authored two books that remain valuable reference works. The first was the monumental ''Bibliografia Românească veche (1508–1830)''. Covering four volumes (1508–1716, 1716–1807, 1808–1817 and 1817–1830), it was written in collaboration with [[Nerva Hodoș]] and later [[Dan Simonescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 254; Urs, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; First suggested to Bianu by [[Émile Picot]], it was conceived as a coherent and pan-Romanian project, supplanting earlier catalogues by Vasile Popp and Cipariu.&lt;ref&gt;Urs, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; As an analytical work, it was also based on [[Émile Legrand]]'s ''Bibliographie hellénique ou description raisonnée des ouvrages publiés par des Grecs au XVIIIe siècle''.&lt;ref name="nncomag"/&gt;

The books it encompassed were published in the Romanian lands during this period in Romanian, Slavonic, Greek and even Georgian, by both Romanians and foreigners; it also included books published abroad by Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Urs, pp. 351–352, 354; Vladu, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Publication began in 1903 (preceded by early drafts from 1898), took a nearly two-decade hiatus after Hodoș' death in 1913, and resumed once Simonescu joined the project in 1931. It was completed after Bianu's death, in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Urs, p. 351. See also Mihai, pp. 253–254; Vladu, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Likened to [[George Călinescu]]'s history of Romanian literature, although more historic in aspect, it was the country's most ample bibliography at the time, praised by Iorga for its completeness.&lt;ref name="m254"/&gt; It was however criticized by later bibliographers, and by Bianu himself, for being inconsistent and incomplete in its selection or presentation of titles.&lt;ref&gt;Urs, pp. 352–354&lt;/ref&gt; The work covers 1,526 known books and 300 unknown works, going up to 2,024 with addenda and errata.&lt;ref&gt;Urs, p. 351. See also Mihai, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the preparation involved the 1898 press publication of an appeal for old books, in which priests, teachers, professors and others who owned or knew of books printed between 1508 and 1830 were asked to inform the library of their existence and if possible loan them. The appeal was accompanied by a list of 621 titles of known books in this category; its author was particularly interested in books not on the list. Bianu's call was received with particular enthusiasm in Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Vladu, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His former teacher Moldovan emerged as a steady collaborator, not only facilitating access to his library and Cipariu's diocesan collection, but also providing valuable advice over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Urs, pp. 350–351; Vladu, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In his turn, Moldovan sent a letter to the province's Greek-Catholic clergy, asking them to supply information about the rare books in their parishes, and Bianu soon received 140 responses regarding books that were not on his initial list.&lt;ref name="v10"&gt;Vladu, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianu's other key work was the three-volume ''Catalogul manuscriselor românești din Biblioteca Academiei'', written with two other authors and published between 1907 and 1931. Bianu published a number of other books on early Romanian literature as well as textual editions,&lt;ref name="m254"/&gt; including ''[[Psaltirea Scheiană]]''&lt;ref name="nncomag"/&gt; and, in 1924, the newly discovered ''[[Codicele de la Ieud]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Viorel Câmpean, ''Oameni și locuri din Sătmar, Vol. I'', p. 124. Satu Mare: Citadela, 2008.  {{ISBN|978-973-88823-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His close analysis of manuscripts and contributions to [[paleography]] through his study of the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]] identify him as a historian;&lt;ref name="m256"&gt;Mihai, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; he also involved himself in disputes with Slavists over the publishing of historical sources—whether they should follow the interests of linguists or cater to historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 113–114, 185, 190–193, 295–296, 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, he organized bibliophile exhibits at the Bellu House, on Academy grounds.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. V., "Cartea românească veche", in ''Cultura Creștină'', Nr. 4–6/1926, pp. 171–174&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Bianu was responsible for ''Creșterea Colecțiunilor'', the Academy's bibliographic periodical, which between 1906 and 1929 chronicled the publications received by the library.&lt;ref name="c791"&gt;Crăciun, p. 791&lt;/ref&gt; His colleagues there included [[Ilarie Chendi]], [[Septimiu Albini]], [[Alexandru Sadi-Ionescu]], [[Vasile Pârvan]], [[Alexandru Lapedatu]], [[George Giuglea]], [[George Murnu]], [[Nicolae Cartojan]], [[Alexandru Obedenaru]], [[Constantin Moisil]] and [[Ioachim Crăciun]].&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, pp. 791–792&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==

===Footnote===
{{note label|A|a|none}} His date of birth is usually given as September 8 or October 1, 1856, although it is possible he was born in 1857; a date of February 20 has been proposed. Bianu himself stated he was born in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitraș, pp. 205–206, 207&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Krypiakevych''' ({{lang-uk|Іва́н Крип'яке́вич}}; 25 June 1886 – 21 April 1967) was a Ukrainian historian, academician, professor of [[Lviv University]] and director of the Institute of Social Sciences of [[Ukraine]]. He was a specialist on Ukrainian history of the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, writing extensively on the social history of [[western Ukraine]] and the political history of the Ukrainian [[Cossack]]s, especially during the time of Hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. He also wrote many textbooks for school use, popularizations, and some historical fiction for children.

==Austrian period==

Krypiakevych was born and raised in Lemberg ([[Lviv]]) in [[Austrian Galicia]] in a family of the Greek Catholic priest and emigrant from the [[Chełm Land]]. During his school years Krypiakevych talked exclusively in [[Polish language]]. Later he studied history under [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] at [[Lviv University]]. He wrote his 1911 doctorate on "The Cossacks and Bathory's Privileges," a study of the origins of the Ukrainian Cossacks legally registered with the Polish government. From 1908 to 1914, he published extensively in Galician Ukrainian journals and magazines and took part in the ''[[Prosvita]]'', or "Enlightenment" movement geared to raise the educational level of the Galician Ukrainian peasantry. From 1905, he began publishing in the scholarly journal of the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], which under the leadership of Hrushevsky became a kind of unofficial Ukrainian Academy of Sciences serving the Ukrainian people on both sides of the Austrian-Russian border. In 1907 Krypiakevych on the notice of Andrzej Kazimierz Potocki, a Governor of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, was imprisoned for student protests that took place near the [[Lviv University]]. He initially was detained as a terrorist, but later it was degraded as disturbing a public peace.

From 1911 to 1939, he taught at the Polish gymnasia (High Schools) at [[Zhovkva]] and [[Rohatyn]] and at the [[Lviv Academic Gymnasium|Academic Gymnasium]] in Lviv. From 1918 to 1919, he taught at the newly established Ukrainian University at [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] but returned to Galicia (now absorbed into [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]) at the fall of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] to the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. In 1921-25 Krypiakevych was a professor of the clandestine Lviv Ukrainian University.

==Interwar Galicia==

During the interwar period, Krypiakevych, being excluded from a university  position by the Polish regime, continued to teach at various gymnasia and to actively support the Shevchenko Scientific Society. From 1921 to 1924, he was a professor of the Secret Ukrainian University in Lviv and was secretary of its senate. From 1934 to 1939, he taught at the Greek Catholic Theological Academy. All of his major works during this period appeared in the Ukrainian and not the Polish language. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he remained active in various educational and public projects such as preserving the gravesites of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and promoting tourist literature about Ukrainian Galicia. From 1934, he was head of the Historical Section of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.

Unlike many other students of Hrushevsky, Krypiakevych never politically or intellectually rebelled against the authority of his mentor, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]. Although he did turn away from Hrushevsky's populism to a pro-state interpretation of Ukrainian history, he revered his mentor's memory and in 1935 published a short biography of him.

==Soviet annexation and war==

The 1939 [[German invasion of Poland|fall]] of the Polish Republic and the Soviet [[Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine, 1939–1940|annexation]] of Galicia brought far-reaching changes to academic as well as social and political life and Krypiakevych was appointed professor of history at the reorganized and partially [[Sovietized]] [[Lviv University]].

The university was suppressed during the German [[District of Galicia|occupation]] but Krypiakevych found work at the Ukrainian Publishing House in Lviv. Unlike many of his Galician Ukrainian colleagues, mostly for family reasons, he decided to remain in Lviv after the German retreat westwards.

==Soviet period==

The [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive|return]] of the Soviets brought renewed repressions to the west Ukrainian intelligentsia and in 1946 Krypiakevych was deported east to [[Kiev]] with many of his colleagues being accused in the Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]] (see [[Ukrainian nationalism#Soviet Union and Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism|Soviet Union and Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism]]). For several years, he experienced political persecution, but in 1948, he was able to return to Lviv, and, with the help of the Soviet Ukrainian historian, Fedir Shevchenko, learned to adapt his historical writing to Soviet conditions and to the Soviet censors. From 1951, he headed the Institute of Social Sciences at the Lviv branch of the Academy of Sciences of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. In 1958, he was elected an "Academic" of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. He died in 1967 in Lviv, a respected member of the Soviet Ukrainian historical profession. Ivan Krypiakevych was buried at [[Lychakivskiy Cemetery]], Lviv.

==Major works==

Krypiakevych's early works dealt with the early modern history of the City of Lviv and the social history of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. Thereafter, he turned to the history of the Cossacks and published his dissertation on the [[Báthory]] reforms; he then undertook further studies of the Cossacks in international politics, and then the Cossack "state" created by [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] in 1648. Most of these works were published in the "Memoirs of the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]]."

During the period of Polish ascendency, Krypiakevych co-authored and published many popularizations, the most important of which were his "Great History of Ukraine" (1935), his "History of the Ukrainian Army" (1936), and his "History of Ukrainian Culture" (1937). His textbooks of Ukrainian history were widely used both in Galicia and also among Ukrainians in North America. At this time, he also prepared a new scholarly "History of Ukraine" which was only published in 1949 in the west under the pseudonym 'Ivan Kholmsky'.

During the Soviet period, Krypiakevych was known as an expert on the era of Khmelnytsky and on the occasion of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the [[Treaty of Pereiaslav]] between the Cossacks and the Russian [[Tsar]] his "Bohdan Khmelnytsky" appeared in a very luxurious edition (1954). During the 1960s, he was very active at editing historical journals and mentoring younger Ukrainian historians, but a few years after his death in 1967, the [[Shelest]] Renaissance, which had briefly occurred under the protection of Ukrainian Communist Party leader, [[Petro Shelest]], and had made possible so many of the cultural and academic achievements of the 1960s, came to an end (1972), and Krypiakevych's scholarly legacy was partly repressed. His monograph on the medieval [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]] only appeared posthumously in 1984.

==Legacy==

With the emergence of the [[Mikhail Gorbachev#Domestic reforms|Gorbachev reforms]] and [[Ukrainian independence]], his major works from pre-Soviet times were reprinted and uncensored editions of certain of his Soviet-era works like "Bohdan Khmelnytsky" were published. Today, he is widely revered as one of Hrushevsky's foremost students, a continuator of his tradition, and one of the most important historians of western Ukraine. The Institute of Ukrainian Studies of the National Academy of Sciences in Lviv is named in his honour.

In 1993 the Institute of Social Studies of Academy of Sciences of the UkrSSR in [[Lviv]] was renamed into the Krypiakevych Institute of Ukrainian Studies ([[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]).

[[File:GollJ.JPG|thumb|Jaroslav Goll]]
'''Jaroslav Goll''' (14 July 1846 – 8 July 1929) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] historian, medievalist, educator, writer and translator. He was a representative of the historical [[positivism]]. He studied history at the [[Charles University]] in Prague under Czech [[Václav Vladivoj Tomek]] and German [[Konstantin Höfler]]. In 1871 he worked at the [[University of Göttingen]] where he was influenced by positivist [[Georg Waitz]]. Then he studied in [[Berlin]], [[Hague]] and London. In 1875, he began teaching at the University of Prague, where he worked until his retirement in the year 1910. Then he very actively involved in politics. In 1895 he founded the ''Český časopis historický'' (''Czech Historical Review''), the most important historical journal in the Czech lands, which still exists today. In 1907 he was elected rector of the university. His main professional interest was [[English history|English]] medieval history. He also devoted a study personalities of Czech history ([[Jan Amos Komenský|Komenský]], [[František Palacký|Palacký]], [[Petr Chelčický|Chelčický]]). His pupils are called Goll's school. He gave private lessons later Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] during his studies in Prague. He was the grandfather of the Czech actress [[Nataša Gollová]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4202408|title = Jaroslav Goll|journal = The Slavonic and East European Review|volume = 8|issue = 23|pages = 409–412|last1 = Šusta|first1 = Josef|year = 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus spoke [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Φλαβίου Ἰωσήπου τὰ εὑρισκόμενα – Flavii Josephi Opera. Graece et latine. Recognovit Guilelmus Dindorfius [= [[Karl Wilhelm Dindorf|Wilhelm Dindorf]]]. Volumen secundum.'' Paris, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; was a first-century [[Roman Jews|Romano-Jewish]] scholar, [[historian]] and [[hagiographer]], who was born in [[Jerusalem]]—then part of [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judea]]—to a father of [[Jewish priesthood|priestly]] descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry.

He initially fought against the Romans during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] as head of Jewish forces in [[Galilee]], until surrendering in 67 CE to [[Roman army|Roman forces]] led by [[Vespasian]] after the six-week siege of [[Siege of Yodfat|Jotapata]]. Josephus claimed the [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messianic]] [[prophecy|prophecies]] that initiated the First Roman-Jewish War made reference to Vespasian becoming [[Emperor of Rome]]. In response Vespasian decided to keep Josephus as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became Emperor in 69 CE, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the emperor's family name of Flavius.&lt;ref name="Mimouni 2012 p.133"&gt;[[Simon Claude Mimouni]], ''Le Judaïsme ancien du VIe siècle avant notre ère au IIIe siècle de notre ère : Des prêtres aux rabbins'', Paris,  P.U.F., coll. « Nouvelle Clio », 2012, {{p.|133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted [[Roman citizenship]]. He became an advisor and friend of Vespasian's son [[Titus]], serving as his translator when Titus led the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]]. Since the siege proved ineffective at stopping the Jewish revolt, the [[Destruction of Jerusalem|city's destruction]] and the looting and destruction of [[Herod's Temple]] (Second Temple) soon followed.

Josephus recorded [[Jewish history]], with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Telushkin |first1=Joseph |title=Ancient Jewish History: The Great Revolt |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-great-revolt-66-70-ce |website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including the [[Siege of Masada]]. His most important works were ''[[The Jewish War]]'' ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;75) and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;94).{{sfn|Harris|1985}} ''The Jewish War'' recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. ''Antiquities of the Jews'' recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of [[Early Christianity]].{{sfn|Harris|1985}} (See main article [[Josephus on Jesus]]).

==Biography==
[[File:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Galilee]], site of Josephus's governorship, before the First Jewish–Roman War]]
Born into one of Jerusalem's elite families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Martin|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilisations|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-713-99447-6|page=8|quote=Josephus was born into the ruling elite of Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus introduces himself in [[Greek language|Greek]] as'' Iōsēpos'' (Ιώσηπος), son of [[Matthias (father of Josephus)|Matthias]], an ethnic [[Kohen|Jewish priest]]. He was the second-born son of Matthias. His older full-blooded brother was also called [[Matthias (brother of Josephus)|Matthias]].{{sfn|Mason|2000|p=12–13}} Their mother was an aristocratic woman who descended from the royal and formerly ruling [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean dynasty]].{{sfn|Nodet|1997|p=250}} Josephus's paternal grandparents were [[Josephus (grandfather of Josephus)|Josephus]] and his wife—an unnamed Hebrew noblewoman, distant relatives of each other and direct descendants of [[Simon Psellus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofthedaughters.com/38.pdf|pages=349–350|title=JOSEPHUS LINEAGE|website=History of the Daughters|edition=Fourth|date=December 2012|publisher=L P Publishing|location=Sonoma, California }}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus's family was wealthy. He descended through his father from the priestly order of the [[Jehoiarib]], which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Schürer|1973|p=45–46}} Josephus was a descendant of the high priest Jonathon.{{sfn|Schürer|1973|p=45–46}} He was raised in Jerusalem and educated alongside his brother.{{sfn|Mason|2000|p=13}} 

In his early twenties, he traveled to negotiate with Emperor [[Nero]] for the release of 12 Jewish priests. Upon his return to Jerusalem, at the outbreak of the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], Josephus was appointed the military governor of [[Galilee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=G. J. |last=Goldberg |url=http://www.josephus.org/life.htm |title=The Life of Flavius Josephus |publisher=Josephus.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually he strove with [[John of Gischala]] over the control of Galilee, who like Josephus, had amassed to himself a large band of supporters from [[Gischala]] (Gush Halab) and [[Arraba, Israel|Gabara]],{{efn|A large village in Galilee during the 1st century CE., located to the north of Nazareth.

After the Jewish garrison of Yodfat fell under siege, the Romans invaded, killing thousands; the survivors committed suicide. According to Josephus, he was trapped in a cave with 40 of his companions in July 67 CE. The Romans (commanded by Flavius Vespasian and his son Titus, both subsequently [[Roman emperor]]s) asked the group to surrender, but they refused. Josephus suggested a method of collective suicide;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''The Jewish War''. Book 3, Chapter 8, par. 7&lt;/ref&gt; they drew lots and killed each other, one by one, counting to every third person. Two men were left (this method as a mathematical problem is referred to as the [[Josephus problem]], or Roman roulette),&lt;ref&gt;Cf. this example, [http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/130.html ''Roman Roulette'']. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221165652/http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/130.html |date=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who surrendered to the Roman forces and became prisoners. In 69 CE, Josephus was released.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The War of the Jews/Book IV|Jewish War&amp;nbsp;IV.622–629]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to his account, he acted as a negotiator with the defenders during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, in which his parents and first wife died.

While being confined at Yodfat (Jotapata), Josephus claimed to have experienced a divine revelation that later led to his speech predicting Vespasian would become emperor. After the prediction came true, he was released by Vespasian, who considered his gift of prophecy to be divine. Josephus wrote that his revelation had taught him three things: that God, the creator of the Jewish people, had decided to "punish" them; that "fortune" had been given to the Romans; and that God had chosen him "to announce the things that are to come".{{sfn|Gray|1993|p=35–38}}{{sfn|Aune|1991|p=140}}{{sfn|Gnuse|1996|p=136–142}} To many Jews, such claims were simply self-serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Martin|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilisations|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-713-99447-6|page=9|quote=Later generations of Jews have been inclined to treat such claims as self-serving}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 71 CE, he went to Rome in the entourage of Titus, becoming a Roman citizen and client of the ruling [[Flavian dynasty]] (hence he is often referred to as Flavius Josephus). In addition to Roman citizenship, he was granted accommodation in conquered [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] and a pension. While in Rome and under Flavian patronage, Josephus wrote all of his known works. Although he uses "Josephus", he appears to have taken the Roman [[praenomen]] Titus and [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] Flavius from his patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Attested by the third-century Church theologian [[Origen]] (''Comm. Matt.'' 10.17).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Vespasian]] arranged for Josephus to marry a captured Jewish woman, whom he later divorced. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} About 71 CE, Josephus married an [[Alexandria]]n Jewish woman as his third wife. They had three sons, of whom only [[Flavius Hyrcanus]] survived childhood. Josephus later divorced his third wife. Around 75 CE, he married his fourth wife, a [[Ancient Greece|Greek Jewish]] woman from [[Crete]], who was a member of a distinguished family. They had a happy married life and two sons, [[Flavius Justus]] and [[Flavius Simonides Agrippa]].

Josephus's life story remains ambiguous. He was described by Harris in 1985 as a [[Torah Judaism|law-observant Jew]] who believed in the compatibility of [[Judaism]] and [[Graeco-Roman]] thought, commonly referred to as [[Hellenistic Judaism]].{{sfn|Harris|1985}} Before the 19th century, the scholar Nitsa Ben-Ari notes that his work was shunned like that of converts, then banned as those of a traitor, whose work was not to be studied or translated into Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/~nitsaba/Publications/papers/NBA-DoubleConversionBen-Hur2002.pdf|first=Nitsa|last=Ben-Ari|title=The double conversion of ''Ben-Hur'': a case of manipulative translation|journal=Target|volume=14|number=2|date=2003|pages=263–301|quote="The converts themselves were banned from society as outcasts and so was their historiographic work or, in the more popular historical novels, their literary counterparts. Josephus Flavius, formerly Yosef Ben Matityahu (34-95), had been shunned, then banned as a traitor."|access-date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His critics were never satisfied as to why he failed to commit suicide in Galilee, and after his capture, accepted the patronage of Romans.

The historian E.&amp;nbsp;Mary Smallwood writes critically of Josephus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Josephus] was conceited, not only about his own learning, but also about the opinions held of him as commander both by the Galileans and by the Romans; he was guilty of shocking duplicity at Jotapata, saving himself by sacrifice of his companions; he was too naive to see how he stood condemned out of his own mouth for his conduct, and yet no words were too harsh when he was blackening his opponents; and after landing, however involuntarily, in the Roman camp, he turned his captivity to his own advantage, and benefited for the rest of his days from his change of side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Josephus|first= Flavius|title=The Jewish War|translator-first=G.&amp;nbsp;A.|translator-last= Williamson|others=Introduction by E.&amp;nbsp;Mary Smallwood|location=New York|publisher=Penguin|date=1981|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Author Joseph Raymond calls Josephus "the Jewish [[Benedict Arnold]]" for betraying his own troops at Jotapata.{{sfn|Raymond|2010|p=222}}

==Scholarship==
[[File:Josephusbust.jpg|thumb|250px|The 1st-century Roman portrait bust said to be of Josephus,  conserved in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], Copenhagen, Denmark]]

The works of Josephus provide crucial information about the First Jewish-Roman War and also represent important literary source material for understanding the context of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and late [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] Judaism.

Josephan scholarship in the 19th and early 20th centuries took an interest in Josephus's relationship to the sect of the [[Pharisees]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} It consistently portrayed him as a member of the sect and as a traitor to the Jewish nation—a view which became known as the classical concept of Josephus.{{sfn|Millard|1997|p=306}} In the mid-20th century a new generation of scholars{{Who|date=November 2009}} challenged this view and formulated the modern concept of Josephus. They consider him a Pharisee but restore his reputation in part as patriot and a historian of some standing. In his 1991 book, Steve Mason argued that Josephus was not a Pharisee but an orthodox Aristocrat-Priest who became associated with the philosophical school of the Pharisees as a matter of deference, and not by willing association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Flavius_Josephus.shtml |title=Flavius Josephus and the Pharisees |website=The Bible and Interpretation|date=April 2003 |accessdate=2012-05-18|first=Steve|last= Mason|authorlink=Steve Mason (biblical scholar)}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of Josephus include useful material for historians about individuals, groups, customs, and geographical places. Some of these, such as the city of [[Seron]], receive no mention in the surviving texts of any other ancient authority. His writings provide a significant, extra-Biblical account of the post-Exilic period of the [[Maccabees]], the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty, and the rise of [[Herod the Great]]. He describes the [[Sadducee]]s, Jewish [[Kohen Gadol|High Priests]] of the time, [[Pharisees]] and [[Essenes]], the Herodian Temple, [[Quirinius]]' census and the [[Zealots]], and to such figures as [[Pontius Pilate]], [[Herod the Great]], [[Agrippa&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Agrippa&amp;nbsp;II]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Josephus on Jesus#Reference to Jesus as brother of James (xx 9.1)|James the brother of Jesus]], and to [[Jesus]] (for more see [[Josephus on Jesus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|quote="In the sixteenth century the authenticity of the text [Testimonium Flavianum] was publicly challenged, launching a controversy that has still not been resolved today"|authorlink=Alice Whealey|first=Alice |last=Whealey|title=Josephus on Jesus: The Testimonium Flavianum Controversy from Late Antiquity to Modern Times|publisher=[[Peter Lang Publishing]]|date=2003|ISBN=978-0-8204-5241-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus represents an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple [[Judaism]] and the context of [[early Christianity]].

A careful reading of Josephus's writings and years of excavation allowed [[Ehud Netzer]], an [[archaeologist]] from [[Hebrew University]], to discover what he considered to be the location of [[Herod_the_Great#Herod's_tomb|Herod's Tomb]], after a search of 35 years.&lt;ref name=Kraft2007&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[NY Times]] | title = Archaeologist Says Remnants of King Herod’s Tomb Are Found | first= Dina |last=Kraft | date = May 9, 2007 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/world/middleeast/09herod.html?_r=0 |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was above [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s and pools, at a flattened desert site, halfway up the hill to the [[Herodium]], 12&amp;nbsp;km south of Jerusalem—as described in Josephus's writings.{{sfn|Murphy|2008|p=99}} In October 2013, archaeologists Joseph Patrich and Benjamin Arubas challenged the identification of the tomb as that of Herod.&lt;ref name=Hasson2013&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = Haaretz | title = Archaeological stunner: Not Herod's Tomb after all? | first = Nir |last=Hasson | date = October 11, 2013 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/life/archaeology/.premium-1.551881 |accessdate=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927144851/http://www.haaretz.com/life/archaeology/.premium-1.551881 |archive-date=27 September 2015 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Patrich and Arubas, the tomb is too modest to be Herod's and has several unlikely features.&lt;ref name=Hasson2013/&gt; Roi Porat, who replaced Netzer as excavation leader after the latter's death, stood by the identification.&lt;ref name=Hasson2013/&gt;

===Manuscripts, textual criticism, and editions===
For many years, the works of Josephus were largely known in Europe only in an imperfect Latin translation from the original Greek. Only in 1544 did a version of the standard Greek text become available in French, edited by the Dutch [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Arnoldus Arlenius]]. The first English translation, by [[Thomas Lodge]], appeared in 1602, with subsequent editions appearing throughout the 17th century. The 1544 Greek edition formed the basis of the 1732 English translation by [[William Whiston]], which achieved enormous popularity in the English-speaking world. It was often the book—after the Bible—that Christians most frequently owned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} A cross-reference apparatus for Whiston's version of Josephus and the biblical canon also exists.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book|last1=Clontz|first1=T.|last2=Clontz|first2=J.|title=The Comprehensive New Testament|publisher=Cornerstone Publications|date=2008|ISBN=978-0-9778737-1-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Rick|last= Bennett |url=http://www.accordancebible.com/Comprehensive-Crossreferences |title=New Release: Comprehensive Crossreferences |publisher=Accordancebible.com |date= November 30, 2011|accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whiston claimed that certain works by Josephus had a similar style to the [[Pauline Epistles|Epistles of St Paul]].{{sfn|Maier|1999|p=1070}}

Later editions of the Greek text include that of [[Benedikt Niese]], who made a detailed examination of all the available manuscripts, mainly from France and Spain. [[Henry St. John Thackeray]] used Niese's version for the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition widely used today.

The standard ''editio maior'' of the various Greek manuscripts is that of [[Benedictus Niese]], published 1885–95. The text of ''Antiquities'' is damaged in some places. In the ''Life'', Niese follows mainly manuscript P, but refers also to AMW and R. Henry St. John Thackeray for the [[Loeb Classical Library]] has a Greek text also mainly dependent on P.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} André Pelletier edited a new Greek text for his translation of ''Life''. The ongoing Münsteraner Josephus-Ausgabe of [[Münster University]] will provide a new critical apparatus. There also exist late Old Slavonic translations of the Greek, but these contain a large number of Christian interpolations.{{sfn|Bowman|1987|p=373}}

=== Josephus's audience ===
Scholars debate about Josephus's intended audience. For example, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' could be written for Jews—"a few scholars from Laqueur onward have suggested that Josephus must have written primarily for fellow-Jews (if also secondarily for Gentiles). The most common motive suggested is repentance: in later life he felt so badly about the traitorous ''War'' that he needed to demonstrate … his loyalty to Jewish history, law and culture."{{sfn|Mason|1998|p=66}} However, Josephus's "countless incidental remarks explaining basic Judean language, customs and laws … assume a Gentile audience. He does not expect his first hearers to know anything about the laws or Judean origins."{{sfn|Mason|1998|p=67}} The issue of who would read this multi-volume work is unresolved. Other possible motives for writing ''Antiquities'' could be to dispel the misrepresentation of Jewish origins{{sfn|Mason|1998|p=68}} or as an apologetic to Greek cities of the Diaspora in order to protect Jews and to Roman authorities to garner their support for the Jews facing persecution.{{sfn|Mason|1998|p=70}} Neither motive explains why the proposed Gentile audience would read this large body of material.

== Historiography and Josephus ==
In the Preface to ''Jewish Wars'', Josephus criticizes historians who misrepresent the events of the [[Jewish–Roman wars|Jewish–Roman War]], writing that "they have a mind to demonstrate the greatness of the Romans, while they still diminish and lessen the actions of the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;''JW'' preface. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus states that his intention is to correct this method but that he "will not go to the other extreme … [and] will prosecute the actions of both parties with accuracy."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''JW'' preface. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus suggests his method will not be wholly objective by saying he will be unable to contain his lamentations in transcribing these events; to illustrate this will have little effect on his historiography, Josephus suggests, "But if any one be inflexible in his censures of me, let him attribute the facts themselves to the historical part, and the lamentations to the writer himself only."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

His preface to ''Antiquities'' offers his opinion early on, saying, "Upon the whole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of felicity is proposed by God."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Ant.'' preface. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; After inserting this attitude, Josephus contradicts himself: "I shall accurately describe what is contained in our records, in the order of time that belongs to them … without adding any thing to what is therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He notes the difference between history and philosophy by saying, "[T]hose that read my book may wonder how it comes to pass, that my discourse, which promises an account of laws and historical facts, contains so much of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;''Ant.'' preface. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both works, Josephus emphasizes that accuracy is crucial to historiography. Louis H. Feldman notes that in ''Wars'', Josephus commits himself to critical historiography, but in ''Antiquities'', Josephus shifts to rhetorical historiography, which was the norm of his time.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=9}} Feldman notes further that it is significant that Josephus called his later work "Antiquities" (literally, archaeology) rather than history; in the Hellenistic period, archaeology meant either "history from the origins or archaic history."{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=10}} Thus, his title implies a Jewish peoples' history from their origins until the time he wrote. This distinction is significant to Feldman, because "in ancient times, historians were expected to write in chronological order," while "antiquarians wrote in a systematic order, proceeding topically and logically" and included all relevant material for their subject.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=10}} Antiquarians moved beyond political history to include institutions and religious and private life.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=13}} Josephus does offer this wider perspective in ''Antiquities''.

To compare his historiography with another ancient historian, consider [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]. Feldman lists these similarities: "Dionysius in praising Rome and Josephus in praising Jews adopt same pattern; both often moralize and psychologize and stress piety and role of divine providence; and the parallels between … Dionysius's account of deaths of [[Aeneas]] and [[Romulus]] and Josephus's description of the death of [[Moses]] are striking."{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=13}}

The works of Josephus are major sources of our understanding of Jewish life and history during the first century.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=848–849}}

===''The Jewish War''===
{{Main|The Jewish War}}
His first work in Rome was an account of the Jewish War, addressed to certain "upper barbarians"—usually thought to be the Jewish community in [[Mesopotamia]]—in his "paternal tongue" (''War'' I.3), arguably the Western [[Aramaic language]]. In 78 CE he finished a seven-volume account in [[Greek language|Greek]] known as the ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'' ([[Latin]] ''Bellum Judaicum'' or ''De Bello Judaico''). It starts with the period of the [[Maccabees]] and concludes with accounts of the fall of [[Jerusalem]], and the succeeding fall of the fortresses of Herodion, Macharont and Masada and the Roman victory celebrations in Rome, the mopping-up operations, Roman military operations elsewhere in the empire and the uprising in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]. Together with the account in his ''Life'' of some of the same events, it also provides the reader with an overview of Josephus's own part in the events since his return to Jerusalem from a brief visit to Rome in the early 60s (''Life'' 13&amp;ndash;17).

In the wake of the suppression of the Jewish revolt, Josephus would have witnessed the marches of [[Titus]]'s triumphant legions leading their Jewish captives, and carrying treasures from the despoiled [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. It was against this background that Josephus wrote his ''War'', claiming to be countering anti-Judean accounts. He disputes the claim{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} that the Jews served a defeated God and were naturally hostile to Roman civilization. Rather, he blames the Jewish War on what he calls "unrepresentative and over-zealous fanatics" among the Jews, who led the masses away from their traditional aristocratic leaders (like himself), with disastrous results. Josephus also blames some of the [[Roman governor]]s of [[Iudaea Province|Judea]], representing them as corrupt and incompetent administrators. According to Josephus, the traditional Jew was, should be, and can be a loyal and peace-loving citizen. Jews can, and historically have, accepted Rome's hegemony precisely because their faith declares that God himself gives empires their power.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===''Jewish Antiquities''===
{{Main|Antiquities of the Jews}}
The next work by Josephus is his twenty-one volume ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', completed during the last year of the reign of the Emperor Flavius [[Domitian]], around 93 or 94 CE. In expounding Jewish history, law and custom, he is entering into many philosophical debates current in Rome at that time. Again he offers an ''apologia'' for the antiquity and universal significance of the Jewish people. Josephus claims to be writing this history because he "saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their writings,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Ant.'' preface. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; those writings being the history of the Jews. In terms of some of his sources for the project, Josephus says that he drew from and "interpreted out of the Hebrew Scriptures"&lt;ref&gt;''Ant.'' preface. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was an eyewitness to the wars between the Jews and the Romans,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which were earlier recounted in ''Jewish Wars''.

He outlines Jewish history beginning with the creation, as passed down through Jewish historical tradition. [[Abraham]] taught [[science]] to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], who, in turn, taught the [[Greeks]].{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=232}} [[Moses]] set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which, like that of Rome, resisted [[monarchy]]. The great figures of the [[Tanakh]] are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders. He includes an autobiographical appendix defending his conduct at the end of the war when he cooperated with the Roman forces.

Louis H. Feldman outlines the difference between calling this work ''Antiquities of the Jews'' instead of ''History of the Jews''. Although Josephus says that he describes the events contained in ''Antiquities'' "in the order of time that belongs to them,"&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Feldman argues that Josephus "aimed to organize [his] material systematically rather than chronologically" and had a scope that "ranged far beyond mere political history to political institutions, religious and private life."{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=13}}

===''Against Apion''===
{{Main|Against Apion}}
Josephus's ''[[Against Apion]]'' is a two-volume defence of [[Judaism]] as [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], stressing its antiquity, as opposed to what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent tradition of the Greeks. Some [[anti-Judaic]] allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer [[Apion]], and myths accredited to [[Manetho]] are also addressed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''José Fernando Ramírez''' (May 5, 1804 &amp;ndash; March 4, 1871) was a distinguished [[Mexico|Mexican]] historian in the 19th century. He was a mentor of [[Alfredo Chavero]], who considered him "the foremost of our historians."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[Howard F. Cline|Cline, Howard F.]], "Selected Nineteenth-Century Mexican Writers on Ethnohistory," in ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]], Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', Part 2. p. 374. University of Texas Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramírez was born in [[Parral, Chihuahua]] but grew up in [[Durango (city)|Durango]], where he became a prominent liberal politician. After graduating with a degree in law from San Luis Gonzaga he was elected several times to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Mexico|Senate]]. He chaired the Ministry of Foreign affairs under three different administrations and became a minister in the Supreme Court of Justice.

Ramírez specialized in [[Pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] and sixteenth-century Mexican history and excelled as a biographer. He headed the Imperial Academy of Sciences and Literature during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], directed the National Museum (1852) and built an impressive collection of historical documents. Among his works  are one on [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]] and several translations of [[Aztec codices]] such as ''[[Mapa Quinatzin]]'' and ''[[Codex Aubin]]''. He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistr American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; A bibliography of his writings on Mesoamerican ethnhistory appears in the ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix B, Ramírez, selected writing of ethnohistorical interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5084">'''Louise M. Burkhart''' (born 1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n88-128316}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American academic [[ethnohistorian]] and [[anthropologist]], noted as a scholar of early colonial [[Mesoamerican literature]]. In particular, her published research has a focus on aspects of the religious beliefs and practices of [[Nahuatl]]-speakers in central [[Mexico]]. Her work examines the historical documention from the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]] and the subsequent era of [[colonial Mexico]], and studies the continuities and transformations of indigenous [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] communities and culture. Burkhart has written extensively on colonial Nahuatl drama, folklore, poetry and [[catechism|catechistic]] texts, translating a number of these documents from the original Nahuatl with commentaries and historical interpretations and notes. She has also published research on the aesthetics and iconography of [[pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] and [[Indochristian art]], Nahuatl linguistics, and the rise of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] cult within [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Mexican Roman Catholicism]].

{{As of|2009}} Burkhart is a professor in the Anthropology Department of the [[State University of New York at Albany]] (SUNY Albany), where she has taught since 1990.

==Studies and academic career==
Burkhart studied for a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in anthropology at [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]], [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1980. Her postgraduate studies were undertaken at [[Yale University|Yale]], where in 1982 she completed a [[M.Phil.]] in anthropology. Her course work included field research conducted in Mexico on Nahuatl language, literature, and communities.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"&gt;{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae |url=http://www.albany.edu/anthro/fac/Burkhart/cvanthroweb.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |work=Anthropology Department |publisher=[[University at Albany]] |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining her Master's degree Burkhart enrolled in Yale's doctorate studies program in anthropology, while also working as instructor and teaching assistant for courses on Nahuatl literature and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ethnography. Burkhart was awarded her [[Ph.D.]] in 1986, where her dissertation was supervised by renowned [[Mayanist]] scholar [[Michael D. Coe]]. Her dissertation, "The Slippery Earth: Nahua-Christian Moral Dialogue in Sixteenth-Century Mexico", was revised and published as a book in 1989 by [[University of Arizona Press]].

In 1987 Burkhart received an [[American Philosophical Society]] Fellowship grant to conduct archival research in [[Madrid]]. Other fellowships and research grants obtained during the late 1980s include ones from Chicago's [[Newberry Library]], a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] grant for the [[John Carter Brown Library]], and a fellowship in pre-Columbian studies at [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection]]. During this time Burkhart also held adjunct and visiting lecturer positions at the [[University of Connecticut]] (1986–87) and [[Purdue University]] (1989–90).&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"/&gt;

In 1990 Burkhart joined the faculty at SUNY Albany as [[assistant professor]]. In conjunction with her ongoing academic research projects and publications,  Burkhart has taught a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses at Albany. These include courses on Native American and Mesoamerican myths and folklore, ethnological theory, Mesoamerican texts and literature, anthropology and [[ethnology]] of Native American religion and pre-Columbian art, and Nahuatl language instruction.  In 1997 Burkhart reached the academic rank of [[associate professor]], and became a full professor in 2003. Her professorial appointment is jointly held between the Anthropology Department and the Department of Latin American and Caribbean Studies.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">'''Manuel Artigas y Cuerva''' was a historian and journalist. He was born in [[Tacloban, Leyte]], on October 15, 1866. His parents were  [[Miguel Artigas y Rodriguez]], a Spaniard from [[Cadiz, Spain]] and [[Soledad Cuerva y Molina]] of Bulacan. They were originally from [[Baler, Aurora|Baler]] but they moved to Leyte in 1860 when Soledad's father, an officer in the artillery corps, was transferred.

==Early life==

In 1874 his mother moved back to Manila. Manuel attended [[Colegio de la Immaculada Concepcion]]. He transferred to the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo Municipal]] as an alumno interno de beca. He took up undergraduate studies in medicine at [[University of Santo Tomas]]. After three years he transferred to [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]]. In 1883 he became a civil servant.

To supplement his income, Artigas wrote prolifically, basing many of his works on important archival materials:

• El Municipio Filipino (a collection of laws of Manila)

• Historia Municipal de Filipinas desde los Primeros Tiempos de la Dominacion Española hasta nuestros Dias (1894, 2 vols)

• Los Sucesos de 1872 (Manila, 1911)

• Reseña de la Provincia de Leyte (Manila, 1914)

• El Procedimento Administrativo y la Jurisdiccion Centencioso-Administivo y la Jurisdiction en Filipinas

• Diccionario Tecnico-histerico de la Administracion de Filipinas-Manila

• Historia de las Revoluciones Filipinas

• Historia de Filipinas (Manila, 1916)

• El Parlamento Filipino-Manila

• La Primera Imprenta del Filipinas-Manila

• El General Antonio Luna Novicio

• Reseña Historica dela Universidad de Santo Tomas de Manila

• Historia de la Instruccion Publica en Filipinas

• Bibliografia  Medico-Famtaceutica.

==Career==

He was recognized because of his incessant writings and in 1907, he became assistant librarian in the Philippine Section of the American Circulating Library. He initiated Act No. 1849 which created the Philippine Public Library.

In 1919 he was promoted to curator of the Filipiniana division. Then in 1911 he was appointed chief of the division. Four years later he was promoted to chief of the Philippine Library, and  in 1921, appointed acting director. He rapidly expanded the [[Filipiniana]] collection from 829 titles in December 1907 to more than 20,000 titles in December 1914. Artigas did this by acquiring the private collections of [[James LeRoy]], [[Jose P. Rizal]], [[José Zulueta|Jose Clemente Zulueta]], [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera|T.H. Pardo de Tavera]], [[Mariano Ponce]] and the [[Tabacalera]]. Due to his efforts, the Filipiniana collection of the [[Philippine National Library]] became one of the most complete collection in Philippine studies.

He was a member of the executive board of the Asociacion Historico-Geografica de Filipinas as well as the prestigious Academia de la Lengua Filipina. In 1915, he was inducted as an honorary corresponding member of the Real Sociedad Geografica de Madrid, and in 1916 entered the roster of members of the Real Academia de la Historia, and the Academia Hispano-Americana de Cadiz, Spain.

Aside from being a curator, librarian, and historian, Artigas also excelled in the development of Philippine historical studies through his many publications. Artigas wrote the biographies of [[Antonio Luna]], [[Apolinario Mabini]], [[Wenceslao Retana]], [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Graciano Lopez Jaena]], [[Juan Cailles]] and [[Mariano Ponce]]. Apart from these biographies, he also published the multi-volume [[Galeria de Filipinos Ilustres]], a book about important and illustrious Filipinos during that time.

Artigas died on April 2, 1925. He was survived by his wife [[Luisa Losada y Mijares]] and 12 children. The family was left destitute because it is said that he left them nothing but his books.

== Research and publications ==
Bucur has published eight volumes, three of them as a single author, and the rest as co-author or editor. Her first monograph, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkh6s Eugenics and Modernization in Interwar Romania]'' (2002), examined the intellectual debates and policy-making activities of a group of doctors, lawyers, biologists, anthropologists, and politicians who used eugenicist ideas to propel Romanian society and institutions to a level of modernization in social engineering akin to attempts made in Germany and other West European states during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=William H.|date=1 January 2003|title=Review of Eugenics and Modernization in Interwar Romania|jstor=3185594|journal=Slavic Review|volume=62|issue=2|pages=372–374|doi=10.2307/3185594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second monograph, ''[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=142056 Heroes and Victims: Remembering War in Twentieth-Century Romania]'' (2009), offered a close examination of various forms of remembering and commemorating the two world wars from 1918 onwards, with a focus on the tensions between grassroots and individual efforts (autobiographical writing, funerary monuments, commemorative plaques) and state-initiated commemorations (military cemeteries, official remembrance day commemorations, films).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tismaneanu|first=Vladimir|date=1 January 2010|title=Review of Heroes and Victims: Remembering War in Twentieth-Century Romania. Indiana-Michigan Series in Russian and East European Studies|jstor=27896145|journal=Slavic Review|volume=69|issue=4|pages=971–974}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a focus on the different meanings embodied in these various efforts, Bucur illuminates the important role played by such contestations in shaping the meaning of heroism, patriotism, and self-sacrifice along gender, regional, and ethno-religious lines. More recently, she has published ''[http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/gendering-modernism-9781350026247/ Gendering Modernism: A Historical Reappraisal of the Canon]'' (2017), which asks readers to reconsider the revolutionary aspects of modernism from the perspective gender norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/gendering-modernism-9781350026247/|title=Gendering Modernism|last=Bloomsbury.com|website=Bloomsbury Publishing|language=en|access-date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 she is publishing two new books. ''[http://centuryofwomen.com/ The Century of Women: How Women Have Transformed the World Since 1900]'' is a bold overview of recent history from a feminist humanist perspective, placing women's historical empowerment at the heart of understanding recent changes in politics, economics, demography, culture, and knowledge making. Karen Offen, of Stanford University, calls it a book that "should find a place on every intelligent person's reading list."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442257405/The-Century-of-Women-How-Women-Have-Transformed-the-World-since-1900|title=The-Century-of-Women-How-Women-Have-Transformed-the-World-since-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her newest monograph, co-authored with [[Mihaela Miroiu]], ''Birth of Democratic Citizenship: Women in Modern Romania'', will come out in November 2018 with Indiana University Press.

In addition to these monographs and other co-edited volumes, she has published over seventy articles and chapters in a variety of outlets, from ''The American Historical Review'' to the ''Times Literary Supplement''. She has had dozens of media appearances and interviews in the press, from the ''History Channel'' to ''Al-Jazeera''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiana.academia.edu/MariaBucurDeckard/CurriculumVitae|title=Maria Bucur-Deckard {{!}} Indiana University - Academia.edu|website=indiana.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Romanian studies ==
A passionate promoter of culture and history from her native country, Bucur has helped organize eleven conferences on Romanian Studies (2007-2017) at Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~reeiweb/newsEvents/past.shtml#Romanian|title=Russian &amp; East European Institute: News &amp; Events|website=www.indiana.edu|language=en|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with her colleague [http://www.indiana.edu/~iuslavic/faculty/Illias.shtml Christina Zarifopol-Illias], she worked to establish the first Romanian Studies graduate fellowship in the United States at Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 2009|title=REEIfication|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~reeiweb/newsEvents/newsletters/2009/Apr_09_REEIfication.pdf|journal=REEIfication: News from Indiana University's Russian and East European Institute|volume= 33| issue =  2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has worked with various partners in Romania.

'''Marsyas of [[Philippi]]''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Μαρσύας, Κριτοφήμου, Φιλιππεύς; 3rd century BC) was a [[Macedon]]ian [[Greeks|Greek]] historian and the son of Critophemus. He was often called ''Marsyas the Younger'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μαρσύας ὁ Νεώτερος}}) to distinguish him from [[Marsyas of Pella]], with whom he has frequently been confounded. The earliest writers by whom he is cited is [[Pliny the Elder|Plinius]] and [[Athenaeus]]. The latter tells us that he also served as a priest of [[Heracles]]. His works were ''Μακεδονικά'' On Macedonia (6 books), ''Αρχαιολογία'' Archaeology (On Attica?) (12 books) and ''Μυθικά'' On Myths (7 books).

{{Calendar}}
'''May''' is the fifth month of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]]  and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian Calendars]] and the third of seven months to have a length of 31 days.

May is a month of [[Spring (season)|spring]] in the Northern Hemisphere and [[autumn]] in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, May in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is the seasonal equivalent of [[November]] in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. Late May typically marks the {{Tooltip|start|From Memorial Day in the United States while Victoria Day in Canada}} of the summer vacation season in the United States and Canada and ends on [[Labor Day]], the first Monday of September.

==Background==
The month of May (in Latin, ''[[Maius]]'') was named for the [[Greek God]]dess [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], who was identified with the [[Roman era]] [[goddess]] of fertility, [[Bona Dea]], whose festival was held in May. Conversely, the Roman poet [[Ovid]] provides a second etymology, in which he says that the month of May is named for the ''maiores,'' Latin for "elders," and that the following month (June) is named for the ''iuniores,'' or "young people" (''Fasti VI.88'').
[[File:MTA Peregrina 2.jpg|thumb|140px|Roses to Virgin Mary]]
[[Mayovka]], in the context of the late [[Russian Empire]], was a [[picnic]] in the countryside or in a park in the early days of May, hence the name. Eventually, "mayovka" (specifically, "proletarian mayovka") came to mean an illegal celebration of [[May 1]] by revolutionary public, typically presented as an innocent picnic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homofestivus.ru/maevki.html|title=Маевки|work=homofestivus.ru|access-date=2015-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100624/http://homofestivus.ru/maevki.html|archive-date=2015-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special devotions to the [[Virgin Mary]] take place in May. See [[May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary]].

[[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower appears in May. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Arietids]] shower from May 22 – July 2, and peaks on June 7. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in May.

===Ancient Roman observances===
Under the calendar of ancient Rome, the festival of [[Bona Dea]] fell on May 1, [[Argei]] fell on May 14 or May 15, [[Agonalia]] fell on May 21, and [[Ambarvalia]] on May 29. [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. [[Lemuria (festival)]] fell on 9,11, and 13 May under the Julian calendar. The [[College of Aesculapius and Hygia]] celebrated two festivals of [[Rosalia (festival)]], one on May 11 and one on May 22. Rosalia was also celebrated at [[Pergamon]] on May 24–26. A military Rosalia festival, [[Rosaliae signorum]], also occurred on May 31. [[Rosalia (festival)#Military Rosaliae|Ludi Fabarici]] was celebrated on May 29 – June 1. [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]] would receive a sacrifice on the Ides of May (May 15).  [[Tubilustrium]] took place on May 23 as well as in March. These dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].

'''Milan Grol''' (12 September 1876 – 3 December 1952) was a Serbian literary critic, historian and politician.

== Biography ==
Milan Grol was born in [[Belgrade]] on 12 September 1876. He completed his studies at the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in 1899 and then taught for a year at a [[secondary school]]. Afterwards, he moved to [[Paris]] and spent two years there studying literature, theatre and art. He returned to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] in 1902 and found work as a teacher at the [[National Theatre in Belgrade]]. Alongside writers such as [[Jovan Skerlić]], [[Radoje Domanović]] and [[Stevan M. Luković]], Grol wrote many articles critical of King [[Alexander I of Serbia|Alexander I]] in newspapers such as ''Dnevni list'' (Daily Paper) and ''Odjek'' (Echo). In April 1903, he was transferred to [[Negotin]] because of his opposition to Serbia's ruling [[Obrenović dynasty]]. He returned to Belgrade on 29 May 1903, following the [[May Coup (Serbia)|May Overthrow]] which led to the extinction of the Obrenović dynasty and the restoration of the [[Karađorđević dynasty]] to the Serbian throne. Politically, Grol identified with a group of left-wing urban democrats led by Ljubomir Živković, Ljubomir Stojanović and Jaša Prodanović. This movement separated from the [[People's Radical Party]] and later became the Independent Radical Party. After 1903, Grol continued to work with Skerlić, first as a journalist, and, from 1905 to 1909, as the editor of ''Dnevni list'', which represented the left-wing ideals of the Independent Radical Party. Grol became a dramatist at the National Theatre and remained in that position until 1906. He taught for three more years before becoming the director of the National Theatre in 1909. From 1912 to 1914, he was the editor-in-chief of ''Odjek''. Grol joined the main committee of the Independent Radical Party in 1913.{{sfn|Topham|1995|p=381}}

Grol remained director of the National Theatre until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in the summer of 1914. The war prompted him to relocate to [[Geneva]], where he headed the Serbian Press Bureau from 1915 until 1918. After World War I, he and politician [[Ljubomir Davidović]] founded the Democratic Association, which later became the [[Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Democratic Party]]. Grol was again named director of the National Theatre in 1918, and held this position until 1924. In 1922, he and Kosta Jovanović founded the ''Nedeljni glasnik'' (Sunday Herald), which called for constitutional reform, the lessening of centralism, and more political agreement between Croatia and Serbia. Following the outbreak of a political crisis with the Democratic Party, Grol began editing ''Odjek'' again and split with Davidović following [[Svetozar Pribićević]]'s departure from the party. Grol was twice elected to the parliament of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], in 1925 and 1927. He was a member of a Yugoslav coalition government consisting of Democrats, Radicals and the [[Slovene People's Party]], and served as Minister of Education until 1929, when he reunited with Davidović and joined the opposition. In 1929, Grol joined the Kolarčeve Foundation Committee and organized the Kolarčev People's University in Belgrade. He began publishing ''Odjek'' again in 1936. Following Davidović's death in 1940, Grol became president of the Democratic Party. He became the Kolarčev People's University first director in 1941. He joined the government of [[Dušan Simović]] in March 1941 and went into exile following the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] that April.{{sfn|Topham|1995|p=381}}

Grol held various posts in the Yugoslav government-in-exile during [[World War II]] in London: Minister for Social Welfare and Public Health, from 27 March to January 1942; Minister of Transport, from 10 January 1942 to 26 June 1943; and Minister of Foreign Affairs, from 26 June to 10 August 1943.

In the first half of 1944, Serb politicians in the government-in-exile attempted to convince King Peter to appoint Grol to replace [[Božidar Purić]] as Prime Minister, but British pressure resulted in the appointment of a non-Serb, Dr. [[Ivan Šubašić]], who would be willing to remove [[Draža Mihailović]] from his post as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The British had assessed that no Serb politician would be in a position to remove Mihailović.&lt;ref name&gt;[[#Tomasevich 1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1945, prior to the return of the government-in-exile to Yugoslavia, King Peter named Grol as a member of the regency to be formed under the [[Treaty of Vis|Tito-Šubašić agreement]], however [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] would not accept Grol in the regency, and he was ultimately not appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts 1973|Roberts (1973)]], pp. 312–316&lt;/ref&gt; When the government-in-exile returned to Yugoslavia in March 1945 and merged with the interim Partisan government, Grol became vice premier without portfolio in the unified government under Prime Minister Tito. On 18 August 1945,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts 1973|Roberts (1973)]], p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Grol resigned his cabinet post because the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|communists]] failed to observe the conditions that had been agreed upon with the government-in-exile when the unified government was established.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Grol tried to re-publish the pre-war Democratic Party magazine called ''Demokratija'', but was blocked by the Partisans. He was placed under house arrest in November 1945, and withdrew from public life after the introduction of [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|communist rule]]. He testified at the trial of [[Draža Mihailović]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captives Sold, Tribunal Told'', [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] – 25 Jun 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nei Lopes.jpg|thumb|right|Nei Lopes]]
'''Nei Braz Lopes''' (born May 9, 1942 in [[Irajá]], Rio de Janeiro) is a singer, composer, lawyer, writer and historian, working primarily with the Brazilian genre of [[samba]] and African-Brazilian studies.

==Biography==
Born in [[Irajá]] in Rio de Janeiro (a traditional samba neighborhood which also brought us [[Zeca Pagodinho]], among others), Nei Lopes graduated as an attorney at law from the University of Brazil, but at the start of the 70's abandoned his recently begun legal career to dedicate himself to music and literature. A professional composer since 1972, Nei Lopes became prominent especially through his partnership with [[Wilson Moreira]] and by their work, recorded by almost all interpreters of traditional samba. In the 80's, Nei, already acclaimed, was one of the supporters of the [[Pagode]] movement, which took samba back to the airwaves after an eclipse period.

In the 90's, Nei started partnerships with people identified with the [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] label, such as composer [[Guinga]] and [[Zé Renato]]. He also has a song with [[Chico Buarque]].

Nei is the author of a vast book opus concerning Afro-Brazilian thematics, and [[samba]] thematics in particular. He has been working, since 1995, in the "Brazilian Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora", his most ambitious work.

'''Publius Rutilius Rufus''' (158 BC{{spaced ndash}}after 78 BC) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman, consul, orator and historian of the [[Rutilia gens]], as well as great-uncle of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

During his consulship, he reformed the drill system and improved army discipline. As legate to [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]], he attempted to protect the inhabitants of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] from extortion by the [[equites]], which led to him being falsely accused of extorting those provincials. The charge was false, but as the juries were chosen from the equestrian order, he was condemned. He was exiled, and went to [[Smyrna]], where he wrote a history of Rome in Greek.

==Early life==
He was the third child of a Publius Rutilius{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, the other children being called Lucius and Rutilia (mother of [[Gaius Aurelius Cotta|Caius Cotta]]). Rufus studied philosophy under [[Panaetius]] (becoming a [[Stoicism|Stoic]]), law, public speaking under [[Sulpicius Galba]],&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100434654 |title=Rutilius Rufus, Publius |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Oxford Reference |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greek.

==Military career and consulship==
He started his military career in 134 BC, as a member of the staff of [[Scipio Africanus Minor]] during the [[Numantine War]]. Later on, Rufus was a legate of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus]] in the campaign against [[Jugurtha of Numidia]] of 109 BC, along with [[Gaius Marius]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; He distinguished himself in the [[Battle of the Muthul]], where he faced a charge by the foe [[Bomilcar (2nd century BC)|Bomilcar]] and managed to capture or maim most of the Numidian [[war elephant]]s.

In 115 BC Rufus was defeated for the consulship by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]] and prosecuted him for [[ambitus]]. Scaurus in turn prosecuted Rufus for the same charge. Both charges failed. In 105 BC he was elected to the [[consul]]ship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ToPAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Smith |first=William |date=1871 |title=A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers |page=761 |location=New York, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a senior partner of [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]]. His main achievements concerned the discipline of the army and the introduction of an improved system of drill. Subsequently, he served as legate to [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]], governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

==Exile and later life==
By assisting his superior in his efforts to protect the inhabitants of Asia from the extortions of the ''[[publicani]]'', or farmers of taxes, Rufus incurred the hatred of the [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian order]], to which the ''publicani'' belonged. In 92 BC he was charged with extorting money from the provincials, although he had made efforts to prevent them from being extorted. The charge was widely known to be false, but as the juries at that time were chosen from the equestrian order, he was condemned, as the order bore a grudge against him. Famous Roman gourmand [[Apicius (1st century BC)|Apicius]] had a hand in his demise. His property was confiscated to satisfy claims for compensation.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Theodor |date=1867 |title=The History of Rome |publisher=Richard Bentley |page=219 |volume=3 |location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He retired to [[Mytilene]], and afterwards to [[Smyrna]], where he spent the rest of his life (possibly as an act of defiance against his prosecutors: he was welcomed with honour into the very city for which he was prosecuted as allegedly looting), and where [[Cicero]] visited him as late as the year 78 BC. Although invited by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] to return to Rome, Rufus refused to do so. It was during his stay at Smyrna that he wrote his autobiography and a history of Rome in Greek, part of which is known to have been devoted to the [[Numantine War]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; He possessed a thorough knowledge of law, and wrote treatises on that subject, some fragments of which are quoted in the [[Digests (Roman law)|Digests]]. He was also well acquainted with Greek literature.

==Bankruptcy law reform==
{{see also|Twelve Tables|History of bankruptcy law}}
According to Professor Levinthal, in an article from 1918,&lt;ref&gt;L Levinthal, ‘The Early History of Bankruptcy Law’ [1918] [[University of Pennsylvania]] Law Review 223, 235-6&lt;/ref&gt; Rutilius happened to be a revolutionary for bankruptcy proceedings.

{{Cquote|The process of general execution against the debtor's property introduced into [[Roman law]] by Rutilius was called ''bonorum emptio'' or ''venditio''. Whether the debtor was solvent or insolvent, whether there were many creditors or there was but one creditor, the proceeding was the same, leading to a sale of the entire estate of the debtor for the benefit of his creditors. The ''bonorum venditio'' was only granted when the debtor had committed one of several acts.&lt;ref&gt;Gaius, iii, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; These acts, which might be termed acts of bankruptcy, were (a) absconding (''latitans'') or hiding from creditors,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cic. Verr, ii, 24, s. 59. Compare the Pennsylvania statute of June 13, 1836, relating to domestic attachment.&lt;/ref&gt; (b) leaving a judgment unsatisfied for thirty days, and (c) admitting, without discharging, a debt, and taking no steps to pay it. The creditor or creditors were granted by the [[Praetor]] ''a missio in possessionem'', equivalent to the English "receiving order." In other words, they were put into possession of the debtor's estate. Then, at fixed intervals, followed three decrees: the first publicly advertised the sale and gave notice to the non-petitioning creditors to put in their claims; the second authorized the creditors to choose from among themselves a ''magister'', equivalent to our trustee, to superintend the sale; and the last enabled them to publish the conditions under which the sale would take place. After a third interval, the estate, or ''universitas juris'', of the debtor was put up to auction, and knocked down to the highest bidder (''bonorum emptor''), i. e., to the person who offered the creditors the highest percentage on their claims, the creditors being paid ''pro rata''.}}

'''Samuel Mosheim Schmucker''' or '''Smucker'''&lt;ref&gt;Smucker changed the spelling of his family name.&lt;/ref&gt; (January 12, 1823 – May 12, 1863) was an [[United States|American]] historical writer and popular biographer.

==Biography==
Born at [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], [[Virginia]], the son of respected [[Lutheran]] pastor [[Samuel Simon Schmucker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=John Walter Wayland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN8qIyxGfLUC&amp;pg=PA563|title=A History of Shenandoah County|location=Strasburg, Virginia|publisher=Shenandoah Publishing House|year=1969|page=563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Schmucker graduated from [[Phillips Academy]], Andover, Massachusetts, in 1839 and [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College|Washington College]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1840 and became a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor in the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]].  Schmucker held pastorates at [[Lewistown, Pennsylvania|Lewistown]] (1842–45) and Germantown, [[Pennsylvania]] (1845–48).

Schmucker left the ministry in 1848, studied law, and practiced in [[Philadelphia]] (1850–53).  After two years in New York, he returned to Philadelphia and devoted his remaining years to writing, mostly popular biographies.  According to the [[National Cyclopaedia of American Biography]], Schmucker's works "exhibit diligence in compiling rather than deep research."&lt;ref&gt;''National Cyclopaedia of American Biography'', 5: 101 (1891).&lt;/ref&gt;

A fierce critic of the [[Higher Criticism|Higher Critic]] [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and his fellow "Modern Infidels," Schmucker unwittingly anticipated the [[Shakespearean authorship question]] with a mocking demonstration that "historic doubts regarding [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]" were "equally applicable to [[Shakespeare]]."  Although he never doubted that Shakespeare had written Shakespeare, the 25-year-old Schmucker "carefully mapped out almost all the arguments subsequently used to question Shakespeare's authorship."&lt;ref&gt;[[James S. Shapiro|James Shapiro]], ''Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010), 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmucker died in Philadelphia on May 12, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/nationalcyclopae05newy#page/100/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the archaeological find|the artwork|Sutton Hoo Helmet (sculpture)}}
The '''Sutton Hoo helmet''' is a decorated [[Anglo-Saxon]] helmet which was discovered during the 1939 excavation of the [[Sutton Hoo]] [[ship burial|ship-burial]]. It was buried around 625 and is widely believed to have been the helmet of King [[Rædwald of East Anglia]], and its elaborate decoration may have given it a secondary function akin to a crown. The helmet is "the most iconic object" from "one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries ever made," and one of the most important Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever found.{{sfn|Google Arts &amp; Culture}}{{sfn|Davis|2013}} Its visage features eyebrows, nose, and moustache, creating the image of a man joined by a dragon's head to become a soaring dragon with outstretched wings. It has become a symbol of the Dark Ages and also "of Archaeology in general."{{sfn|Richards|1992|p=131}} It was excavated as hundreds of rusted fragments, and was first displayed following an initial reconstruction in 1945–46, and then in its present form after a second reconstruction in 1970–71.

The helmet and the other finds from Sutton Hoo were determined by a [[treasure trove]] inquest to be the property of [[Edith Pretty]], who owned the site of the ship-burial. She donated all the objects to the [[British Museum]], where they were conserved and put on display. The helmet was on view in Room 41 in 2018.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=718–731}}{{sfn|British Museum a}}

{{Main|Sutton Hoo}}
The helmet was buried among other regalia and instruments of power as part of a furnished ship-burial, probably dating from the early seventh century. Although the man in the grave has not been identified, the contents of the grave point to its being that of a king.{{sfn|Ruffin|2006|p=43}} It is generally thought most likely that Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, is the person buried in the ship, due to the proximity of the royal [[vill]] of Rendlesham{{sfn|Ruffin|2006|p=43}} and as use of the site is believed to have been a time when he held power in England.

The ship had been hauled from the nearby river up the hill and lowered into a prepared trench.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=176–180}}{{sfn|Evans|1986|pp=32–40}} Inside this, the helmet was wrapped in cloths and placed to the left of the head of the body.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=138–231}}{{sfn|Evans|1986|pp=46–49}} An oval mound was constructed around the ship.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=144, 156}} Long afterwards, the chamber roof collapsed violently under the weight of the mound, compressing the ship's contents into a seam of earth.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=488–577}}

It is thought that the helmet was shattered either by the collapse of the burial chamber or by the force of another object falling on it.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}} The fact that the helmet had shattered meant that it was possible to reconstruct it. Had the helmet been crushed before the iron had fully oxidised, leaving it still pliant, the helmet would have been squashed,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}} leaving it in a distorted shape similar to the [[Vendel]]{{sfn|Lindqvist|1950|pp=3–4, 24}} and [[Valsgärde]]{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=30–31}} helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138 n.2}}

The Sutton Hoo helmet, weighing an estimated {{convert|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=185}} was made of iron and covered with decorated sheets of tinned bronze.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=140}} Fluted strips of moulding divided the exterior into panels, each of which was stamped with one of five designs.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=140}} Two depict figural scenes, another two zoophormic interlaced patterns; a fifth pattern, known only from seven small fragments and incapable of restoration, is only known to occur once on an otherwise symmetrical helmet and may have been used to replace a damaged panel.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=137–140, 143}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}} The existence of these five designs has been generally understood since the first reconstruction, published in 1947.{{sfn|Maryon|1947}}{{refn|group=note|With that said, the evidence for the unidentified design has changed over time, from one piece which later turned out to be part of design 2, to the seven pieces recognised today. Maryon suggested an unidentified design because of a single piece showing "a solitary leg, from knee to foot, about {{convert|1/2|in|mm|disp=sqbr}} high."{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}} Williams's reconstruction moved this piece "from the bottom edge of the cap at the rear up to a position against the crest at top centre," where it was revealed to be a part of the second design after all.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=128}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=207}} The existence of an unidentified pattern was thus putatively eliminated when Bruce-Mitford claimed in his 1972 article on the new reconstruction that there were only four designs.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}} Even in the first volume of ''The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial'', published in 1975, he referred to the unidentified scene in the past tense, stating that "at the time of the re-excavation [1965] it was believed that there was a third figural scene on the helmet."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}} Indications of a third scene did not return until volume two of the same work, published in 1978, where seven small fragments were discussed as being incapable of placement within the four known designs.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=197–199}}}} The succeeding three decades gave rise to an increased understanding of the designs and their parallels in contemporary imagery, allowing possible reconstructions of the full panels to be advanced, and through the second reconstruction their locations on the surface of the helmet to be redetermined.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=47–50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=121–122, 128–130}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=199–200, 207–208}} As referred to below, the designs are numbered according to [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]]'s 1978 work.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}}

=== Construction ===
The core of the helmet was constructed of iron and consisted of a cap from which hung a face mask and cheek and neck guards.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=140–146}} The cap was "beaten up out of a single piece of metal."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203}}{{refn|group=note|There is nothing to suggest that the cap was made from more than one piece of metal, although "the extreme deterioration of the fragments has not allowed this to be confirmed beyond doubt."{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=95 n.4}} Radiographs show no "welded, forged or riveted join," while the "joining of certain fragments at the crown of the helmet demonstrates that the iron sheeting of the cap ran continuously through under the crest."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}} Based on this evidence it seems likely that the cap was made from a single piece of metal.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}}}} On either side of it were hung iron cheek guards,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=171}} deep enough to "completely protect the side of the face"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=204}} and curved inward "both longitudinally and laterally."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=172}} Two hinges per side, possibly made of leather, supported these pieces,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=171–172}} allowing them to be pulled flush with the face mask and "completely enclose" the face.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=204}} A neck guard was attached to the back of the cap and made of two overlapping pieces: a shorter piece set inside the cap, over which attached a "broad fan-like portion" extending downwards, "straight from top to bottom but curved laterally to follow the line of the neck."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=174}} The inset portion afforded the neck guard extra movement, and like the cheek guards was attached to the cap by leather hinges.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=174}} Finally, the face mask was riveted to the cap on both sides and above the nose.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=163–164}} Two cutouts served as eye openings,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=163}} while a third opened into the hollow of the overlaid nose, thereby facilitating access to the two nostril-like holes underneath; though small, these holes would have been among the few sources of fresh air for the wearer.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=167}}

Atop the foundational layer of iron were placed decorative sheets of tinned bronze.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146, 204}} These sheets, divided into five figural or zoomorphic designs,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=137–140, 143}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}} were manufactured by the ''pressblech'' process.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=47 n.194}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=220}}{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=109–110}} Preformed dies similar to the [[Torslunda plates]]{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968b|p=233}} were covered with thin metal which, through applied force, took up the design underneath;{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=109–114}}{{sfn|Hawthorne|Smith|1979|pp=153–154}} identical designs could thus be "mass-produced" from the same die, allowing for their repeated use on the helmet and other objects.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=47 n.194}}{{refn|group=note|This technique is distinguished from [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] work, a much more labor intensive process. Repoussé work uses small punches to raise individual details from behind a metal sheet,{{sfn|Maryon|1971|pp=113–116}}{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=108–109}} which are then refined from the front by [[Repoussé and chasing|chasing]],{{sfn|Maryon|1971|pp=113–116}} whereas ''pressblech'' work raises a design in one operation from a single die.{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=109–114}} Permutations of ''pressblech'' work involving multiple operations do, however, exist. The die used for design 5 on the Sutton Hoo helmet, for example, appears to have had a billeted border on only one each of its long and short sides,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=201–202}} while on the neck guard the design is seen with borders along both long sides.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=202}} "If the die was applied not one impression at a time but as seen on the face-mask, as a continuous series of impressions carefully juxtaposed, on a large sheet of foil, this could be cut in such a way as to leave the pattern with double borders down each side. It seems that this was the method used on the neck-guard."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=202}}}} Fluted strips of white alloyed moulding—possibly of tin and copper, and possibly [[swaging|swaged]]{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=111 n.1, 226–227}}—divided the designs into framed panels, held to the helmet by bronze rivets.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146, 204}} The two strips running from front to back alongside the crest were gilded.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=150, 205, 227}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=80–81}} The edges of the helmet were further protected by U-shaped brass tubing, fastened by swaged bronze clips{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146, 227}} and themselves further holding in place the ''pressblech'' panels that shared edges with the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=146}}

A final layer of adornments added to the helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran across the top of the cap and terminated at front and back.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203}} It was made of "D-sectioned" tubing{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203}} and consisted of two parts, an inverted "U-shaped" piece into which a "flat bottom strip" was placed.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}} As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=158, 203}} From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152–155}} That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=159}} A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=205}} its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by "a massive rivet shank."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=161}} To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=141}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=168–169}} Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=169, 228–230}} where individual bronze cells held square garnets.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}} The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=163–164, 168–169}} This tang was itself riveted to the cap,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=164}} one of five attachment points for the cast bronze{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} nose and mouth piece.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=164–167}} Both sides of the nose featured "two small round projecting plates,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=165}} connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=165–167}} An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the "background was punched down" and filled with [[niello]] or another metallic inlay,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=231}} leaving "triangles in relief" that were silvered.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} A tracer (a "rather blunt chisel . . . used chiefly for outlining"{{sfn|Maryon|1971|p=120}}) was used to provide a grooved border on each side.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} Running horizontally aside the nasal bridge were three punched circles per side, inlaid with silver and possibly surrounded by niello.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} Beneath these circles, also running horizontally from the center of the nose to its sides were [[Repoussé and chasing|chased]]{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} "alternate rows of plain flutings and billeted strips which run obliquely between the central strip and a billeted lower edge."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=167}} This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=167–168}} The curve along the bevelled lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=142–143}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=168}} Excepting the portions covered by the eyebrows and dragon head,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=163}} or adorned with silver or niello,{{refn|group=note|Maryon states that niello was used to separate the inlaid silver wires of the eyebrows, to fill in the punched-down designs on the nasal ridge, and to surround the punched circles on the nasal bridge and lower lip.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–143}} Oddy, however, does not identify the helmet among the objects in the Sutton Hoo burial that exhibit the use of niello—the shield, the large hanging bowl, the great gold buckle, and the drinking horns.{{sfn|Oddy|1980|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Oddy|2004|pp=275–276}} With regards to the suggestion of niello on the nose, Oddy states that "[t]he metal of which these inlays are made is compact and is not corroded. In view of its condition it must be interpreted as a metallic inlay and not as niello which has subsequently been reduced to silver metal."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=231}}}} the nose and mouth piece was heavily gilded,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=167–168}} which is suggested by the presence of mercury to have been done with the [[Gilding#Fire-gilding|fire-gilding]] method.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=231}}

Breaking the symmetry of the helmet are subtle differences in the two eyebrows, and in the methods employed to fashion the [[cloisonné]] garnets. The dexter and sinister eyebrows, though at first glance identical, may have been "manufactured in different ways while being intended to look essentially the same."{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=521}} The dexter brow is approximately 5 millimeters shorter than the sinister, and contained 43 rather than 46 inlaid silver wires and one or two fewer garnets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}}{{refn|group=note|Bruce-Mitford suggests there were 23 garnets in the dexter eyebrow and 25 in the sinister,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}} but a technical report appending the chapter posits 21 and 22 respectively.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=229–230}}}} Gilding on the dexter eyebrow was "reddish in colour" against the "yellowish" hue of the sinister,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=229}} while the latter contains both trace amounts of mercury and a tin corrosion product which are absent from its counterpart. Moreover, while the individual bronze cells into which the garnets are set, both on the dexter brow and on three of the four remaining dragon eyes, are underlain by small pieces of "hatched gold foil,"{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}} those on the sinister side, and the sinister eye of the upper dragon head, have no such backing.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=160, 169}} The gold backing served to reflect light back through the garnets, increasing their lustre and deepening their colour.{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=141–142}} Where this backing was missing on the sinister eyebrow and one dragon eye, the luminosity of the garnets would be "substantially dimmed" by direct placement against the bronze.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=520}}

=== Dragon motifs ===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - winged dragon motif.png|thumb|alt=Black and white line drawing of the winged dragon motif from the front of the helmet, composed of four fragments: a dragon head, the two eyebrows forming the wings, and the nose and moustache piece forming the body and tail respectively.|The winged dragon motif from the front of the helmet, with eyebrows for wings and the nose and mouth piece for body and tail]]
Three dragon heads are represented on the helmet. Two bronze-gilt dragon heads feature on either end of the iron crest running from the front to the rear of the skull cap.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}} The third sits at the junction between the two eyebrows, facing upward and given fuller form by the eyebrows, nose and moustache to create the impression of a dragon in flight.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}} There it soars upwards in the "central and most dramatic feature of the entire helmet," baring its teeth at the "snake-like dragon" flying down the crest.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=86}}

To the extent that the helmet is jewelled, such decoration is largely confined to the elements associated with the dragons.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=204–205}} Convex garnets sunk into the heads give the dragons red eyes.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=141}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=160, 205}} The eyebrows are likewise inlaid with square garnets on their under edges, continuing outwards on each side to where they terminate in gilded boars' heads;{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=169, 204–205}} in addition to their secondary decorative function as wings, the eyebrows may therefore take on a tertiary form as boars' bodies.{{sfn|Newton|1993|p=37}} The subtle differences between the eyebrows, the sinister of which lacks the gold foil backing employed on the dexter, may suggest an allusion to the one-eyed god [[Odin]];{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=532}} seen in low light, with the garnets of only one eye reflecting light, the helmet may have itself seemed to have only one eye.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=522}}{{refn|group=note|An alternative theory suggests that the discrepancy between eyebrows is the result of a repair job.{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|pp=29–30}} "That the absence of foils might result from a repair," however, "and presumably therefore a shortage of gold, seems unlikely in view of the minute quantities needed. Additionally, given the evident skill required to shape the gold cell walls and cut the garnets so precisely, the decision to omit the gold foils on the left eyebrow appears all the more deliberate."{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=521}} The repair theory also fails to account for the absence of gold foil behind one of the garnet dragon eyes.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=521}} On the other hand, a repair could explain the other subtle differences between the eyebrows, such as their slightly different lengths and colours, which are not addressed by the theorized allusion to Odin.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=239}}}}

More gold covers the eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and dragon heads, as it does the two fluted strips that flank the crest.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=205}} The crest and eyebrows are further inlaid with silver wires.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=140, 144}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=122, 124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=200, 204}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=155, 158, 169, 205}} Combined with the silvery colour of the tinned bronze, the effect was "an object of burnished silvery metal, set in a trelliswork of gold, surmounted by a crest of massive silver, and embellished with gilded ornaments, garnets and niello{{mdash}}in its way a magnificent thing and one of the outstanding masterpieces of barbaric art."{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=144}}

=== Design 1: Dancing warriors ===

The dancing warriors scene is known from six fragments and occurs four times on the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=186–189}} It is seen on the two panels immediately above the eyebrows, accounting for five of the fragments. The sixth fragment is placed in the middle row of the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] cheek guard, on the panel closest to the face mask;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=186–189}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=80}} the generally symmetrical nature of the helmet implies the design's position on the opposite side as well.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=128}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=207}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=172–173}} None of the six pieces show both warriors, although the "key fragment" depicts their crossed wrists.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=187}} A full reconstruction of the scene was inferred after the first reconstruction, when Rupert Bruce-Mitford spent six weeks in Sweden and was shown a nearly identical design on the then unpublished [[Valsgärde]] 7 helmet.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1948a|p=6}}{{sfn|Archaeological News Letter|1948}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1950a|p=449}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=186}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}}

Design 1 pictures two men "in civilian or ceremonial dress"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=187}} perhaps engaged in a spear or sword dance{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=188}}{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|pp=103, 109}} "associated with the cult of Odin, the war-god."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=129}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=208}} Their outer hands each hold two spears, pointed towards their feet,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=50}} while their crossed hands grip swords.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}} The depiction suggests "intricate measures," "rhythm," and an "elasticity of . . . dance steps."{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|p=109}} Their trailing outer legs and curved hips imply movement towards each other,{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|pp=121–122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=189}} and they may be in the climax of the dance.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=189}} The prevalence of dance scenes with a "similarity of the presentation of the scheme of movement" in contemporary Scandinavian and Northern art suggests that ritual dances "were well-known phenomena."{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|pp=104–106}} Sword dances in particular were recorded among the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] as early as the first century AD, when [[Tacitus]] wrote of "[n]aked youths who practice the sport bound in the dance amid swords and lances," a "spectacle" which was "always performed at every gathering."{{sfn|Tacitus|1868|p=17}}{{sfn|Tacitus|1886|p=14}}{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|p=109}} Whatever the meaning conveyed by the Sutton Hoo example, the "ritual dance was evidently no freak of fashion confined to a particular epoch, but was practised for centuries in a more or less unchanged form."{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|p=122}}

While many contemporary designs portray ritual dances,{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960}} at least three examples show scenes exceptionally similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet and contribute to the understanding of the depicted sword dance. The same design—identical but for a different type of spears held in hand,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=189 n.3}} a different pattern of dress,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=49}} and a lack of crossed spears behind the two men{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=188}}—is found on the Valsgärde 7 helmet, while a small fragment of stamped foil from the [[Gamla Uppsala#The eastern mound|eastern mound]] at [[Gamla Uppsala]] is "so close in every respect to the corresponding warrior on the Sutton Hoo helmet as to appear at first glance to be from the same die," and may even have been "cut by the same man."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=208}} The third similar design is one of the four [[Torslunda plates]],{{sfn|Nerman|1948|pp=79–81}} discovered in [[Öland]], Sweden, in 1870.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=214}} This plate, which is complete and depicts a figure with the same attributes as on design 1, suggests the association of the men in the Sutton Hoo example with "the cult of Odin."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=129}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=208}} The Torslunda figure is missing an eye, which laser scanning revealed to have been removed by a "sharp cut, probably in the original model used for the mould."{{sfn|Arrhenius|Freij|1992|p=76}} Odin too lost an eye, thus evidencing the identification of the Torslunda figure as him, and the Sutton Hoo figures as devotees of him.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=129}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=208}}{{sfn|Arrhenius|Freij|1992|p=76}}

=== Design 2: Rider and fallen warrior ===
[[File:06XX Goldscheibe mit Reiterdarstellung anagoria.JPG|thumb|alt=Colour photograph showing the gold Pliezhausen bracteate, which depicts a scene nearly identical to design 2.|The Pliezhausen bracteate shows a scene nearly identical to design 2.]]
Eight fragments represent all known instances of the second design, accounting for its placement on a like number of panels.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=190–197}} It is surmised to have originally appeared twelve times on the helmet,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=190}} although this theory assumes that the unidentified third design, which occupies one of the twelve panels, was a replacement for a damaged panel.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} Assuming so, the pattern occupied eight spaces on the lowest row of the skull cap (i.e., all but the two showing design 1), and two panels, one atop the other rising towards the crest, in the centre of each side.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=126–127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=202–203}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}} All panels showing design 2 appear to have been struck from the same die.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=192}} The horse and rider thus move in a clockwise direction around the helmet, facing towards the rear of the helmet on the dexter side, and towards the front on the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] side.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=192}}

As substantial sections of design 2 are missing, particularly from the "central area,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=197}} reconstruction relies in part on continental versions of the same scene.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=190–193}} In particular, similar scenes are seen on the Valsgärde 7{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=192–193, 195–197}} and 8{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193, 197}} helmets, the Vendel 1 helmet,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} and on the [[Pliezhausen brooch|Pliezhausen bracteate]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193–194, 196–197}} The latter piece, in particular, is both complete and nearly identical to the Sutton Hoo design.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=37–39}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193–196}} Although a mirror image, and lacking in certain details depicted in design 2 such as the sword carried by the rider and the scabbard worn by the fallen warrior,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=196}}{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} it suggests other details such as the small shield held by the kneeling figure.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=194}}

Design 2 shows a mounted warrior, spear held overhead, trampling an enemy on the ground.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}} The latter leans upwards and, grasping the reins in his left hand, uses his right hand to thrust a sword into the chest of the horse.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}} Atop the horse's rump kneels a "diminutive human, or at least anthropomorphic figure."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}} The figure is stylistically similar to the horseman. Its arms and legs are positioned identically, and, together with the rider, it clutches the spear with its right hand.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}}

The iconographic meaning of design 2 is unknown. It may derive from Roman models,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1977|p=121}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1986|pp=198, 200}}{{sfn|Carver|2005|p=240}} which frequently depicted images of warriors trampling vanquished enemies.{{sfn|Mackintosh|1986}} The subsequent development of the design, which has been found in England, Sweden, and Germany, suggests that it carried a unique meaning broadly understood in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic tradition]].{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} Whereas the Roman examples show riders in moments of unqualified victory,{{sfn|Mackintosh|1986|p=1}} in Germanic representations the scene is ambiguous.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193, 197}} The symbolism is unclear,{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=80}}{{sfn|Beck|1964|p=6}} and elements of victory are combined with elements of defeat:{{sfn|Beck|1964|p=43}}{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} the rider directs his spear straight forward at an invisible enemy, not down at the visible enemy on the ground; though the enemy is trampled, the rider's horse is dealt a fatal wound; and a small and possibly divine figure hovers behind the rider, its body taking the form of a victorious [[swastika]]{{refn|group=note|Assuming that this figure, which is only partly preserved on the Sutton Hoo helmet, takes the form of the like figure on the Pliezhausen bracteate.{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|pp=82–83}}}} while it seemingly guides the spear.{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|pp=82–83}} An overarching theme of the design may therefore be that of fate.{{sfn|Beck|1964|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} In this understanding the divine figure, possibly Odin, guides the warrior in battle, but does not completely free him from the deadly threats he faces.{{sfn|Beck|1964|pp=42–43}} The gods are themselves subject to the whims of fate, and can provide only limited help against the rider's enemies.{{sfn|Beck|1964|pp=43–44}}

=== Design 3: Unidentified figural scene ===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - design 3 fragments.png|thumb|alt=Black and white line drawings of the seven fragments that do not correspond to any known design on the helmet.|The seven unidentified fragments]]
Seven small fragments suggest a third figural scene somewhere on the Sutton Hoo helmet. They are nevertheless too small and ambiguous to allow for the reconstruction of the scene.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=197–199}} Its presence is suggested "not more than four times, and perhaps only once";{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} because other fragments demonstrate the occurrence of design 1{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=186–187}} or design 2{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=190–191}} on all seven available panels on the sinister side of the helmet, and on the forwardmost two panels on the dexter side (in addition to on the highest dexter panel), placement of design 3 "must have occurred towards the rear of the helmet"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} on the dexter side.

That which remains of design 3 may suggest that a "variant rider scene" was employed to fix damage to a design 2 panel,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} similar to how a unique ''pressblech'' design on the Valsgärde 6 helmet was likely used in repair.{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=29–31}} Fragment (a) for example shows groups of parallel raised lines running in correspondence "with changes of angle or direction in the modelled surface, which on the analogy of the Sutton Hoo and other rider scenes in Vendel art, strongly suggest the body of a horse."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=197–198}} Though smaller, fragment (d) shows similar patterns and suggests a similar interpretation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} Fragment (b), meanwhile, shows "two concentric raised lines two millimetres apart," and "appears to be a segment of the rim of a shield which would be of the same diameter as that held by the rider in design 2."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}}

The theory of design 3 as a replacement panel gains some support from damage towards the back of the helmet, yet is contradicted by the placement of fragment (c). The crest, complete for {{convert|25.5|cm|abbr=on}} from front to back, is missing {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} above the rear dragon head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=154}} This head is itself mostly missing, and was entirely omitted from the 1945–46 reconstruction.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=125}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=205}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=159–163}} These missing portions are offered by Bruce-Mitford as a possible indication that the helmet at one time suffered damage necessitating the restoration of at least one design 2 panel with a new equestrian scene.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=224–225}} This theory does not explain why the rear crest and dragon head would not have been themselves repaired, however, and it is not helped by fragment (c). This fragment is an edge piece placed in the 1970–71 reconstruction on the dexter rear of the helmet at the bottom left of a panel where either design 2 or design 3 is expected, yet is "an isolated element quite out of context with any other surviving fragment and with what appears to be the subject matter of the design 3 panel."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}} Bruce-Mitford suggests that as it is an edge piece it may have originally been a scrap placed under another piece to fill a gap, for it is "otherwise inexplicable."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}}{{refn|group=note|Bruce-Mitford appears reluctant to even acknowledge fragment (c) as part of Design 3. Despite writing in 1978 that "[t]he fragment is mounted in the present helmet reconstruction on the right side towards the back,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}} in 1982 he wrote that "none of the fragments that show portions of Design 3 are mounted in the helmet. Since we know neither what this scene depicted, nor how many times it was employed, to place such fragments in the reconstructed helmet could give a false impression both of the subject and of the position it may have occupied in the decorative layout of the helmet."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=272 n.31}} These contradictory statements would be reconciled by accepting Bruce-Mitford's theory that fragment (c) was a scrap, and not meant to be seen.}}

=== Design 4: Larger interlace ===
Occurring on the cheek guards, the neck guard and the skull cap,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}} the larger interlace pattern was capable of a complete reconstruction.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150}} Unlike the two identified figural scenes, partial die impressions of design 4 were used in addition to full die impressions.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150}} Blank spaces on the skull cap and neck guard, devoid of decorative designs, allowed for impressions of design 4 "that are either complete or nearly so."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=149}} On the cheek guards, by contrast, which are irregularly shaped and fully decorated, "the interlace designs are trimmed and sometimes turned on edge to fill awkward spaces."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=150}}

Design 4 depicts "a single quadruped in ribbon style."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=200}}

=== Design 5: Smaller interlace ===
The smaller interlace pattern covered the face mask, was used prominently on the neck guard, and filled in several empty spaces on the cheek guards.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150}} It is a zoomorphic design, like the larger interlace, and shows "two animals, upside down and reversed in relation to each other, whose backward-turning heads lie towards the centre of the panel."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=201}}

The Sutton Hoo helmet was both a functional piece of battle equipment and a symbol of its owner's power and prestige. It would have offered considerable protection if ever used in battle,{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:46}} and at the same time, being the richest known Anglo-Saxon helmet, would have indicated its owner's status.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=200 n.32}} As it is older than the man with whom it was buried, the helmet may also have been an heirloom,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=724–725}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=224–225}} symbolic of the ceremonies of its owner's life and death;{{sfn|Christensen|2000|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=43–44}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|p=304}} it may further be a progenitor of [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]], known in Europe since around the twelfth century,{{sfn|Almgren|1983|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1167–1169}} indicating both a leader's right to rule and his connection with the gods.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|pp=521–522, 533–534}}

Whether or not the helmet was ever worn in battle is unknown, but though delicately ornamented, it would have done the job well.{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:46}} Other than leaving spaces to allow movement of the shoulders and arms, the helmet leaves its wearer's head entirely protected,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=125}} and unlike any other known helmet of its general type, it has a face mask, one-piece cap, and solid neck guard.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The iron and silver crest would have helped deflect the force of falling blows,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=707, 752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=210}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=158}} and holes underneath the nose would have created a breathable—if stifling{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:59}}—environment within.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=157}} If two suppositions are to be taken as true—that damage to the back of the helmet occurred before the burial,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=199, 224–225}} and that Raedwald is properly identified as the helmet's owner—then the helmet can be at least described as one that saw some degree of use during its lifetime, and that was owned by a person who saw battle;{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:32}} according to [[Bede]], around 616 Raedwald defeated [[Æthelfrith]] of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] in the Battle of the [[River Idle]].{{sfn|Keynes|1992|p=104}}

Beyond its functional purpose, the Sutton Hoo helmet would have served to convey the high status of its owner. Little more than an iron cap, such as the helmets from [[Shorwell helmet|Shorwell]] and [[Pioneer Helmet|Wollaston]],{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=93}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=25}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}} would be needed if one only sought to protect one's head.{{sfn|Christensen|2000|p=34}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=43}} Yet helmets were also objects of prestige in Anglo-Saxon England, as indicated by archaeological, literary, and historical evidence.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1067–1070}} Helmets are relatively common in ''[[Beowulf]]'', an Anglo-Saxon poem focused on royals and their aristocratic milieu,{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1169}}{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=57, 60}} but rarely found today; only six are currently known, despite the excavation of thousands of graves from the period.{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|pp=93, 93 n.8}}{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=41 n.27}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1167}} Much as this could also be reflective of poor rates of artefact survival, or even recognition—the Shorwell helmet was at first misidentified as a "fragmentary iron vessel",{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|pp=83–84}} the Wollaston helmet as a bucket,{{sfn|Read|2006|p=38}} and a plain [[Roman Britain|Roman]] helmet from [[Burgh Castle]] as "cauldron fragments"{{sfn|Johnson|1980|p=303}}—the extreme scarcity suggests that helmets were never deposited in great numbers, and signified the importance of those wearing them.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1167}}

That the Sutton Hoo helmet was likely around 100 years old when buried suggests that it may also have been an heirloom, a sample from the royal treasury passed down from another generation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=724–725}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=224–225}}{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:22}} The same suggestion has been made for the shield from the burial, as both it and the helmet are objects with distinct Swedish influence.{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=137}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948a|p=105}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=74}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1950b|p=71}} The importance of heirloom items is well documented in poetry;{{sfn|Whitelock|1958|p=91}} every sword of note in ''Beowulf'', from [[Hrunting]] to [[Nægling]], has such a history,{{sfn|Brady|1979|p=91}} and the poem's hero, whose own pyre is stacked with helmets,{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=1}} uses his dying words to bestow upon his follower [[Wiglaf]] a gold collar, [[Mail (armour)|byrnie]], and gilded helmet.{{sfn|Christensen|2000|p=35}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=44}} The passing of the helmet, from warrior to warrior and then to the ground, would have been symbolic of the larger ceremony of the passing of titles and power,{{sfn|Christensen|2000|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=43–44}} and the final elegy for the man buried in the mound.{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|p=304}}

The helmet easily outstrips all other known examples in terms of richness.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–214}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1170}}{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=200 n.32}} It is uniquely from a presumed royal burial,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–214}} at a time when the monarchy was defined by the helmet and the sword.{{sfn|Alföldi|1934|p=140}}{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=12:31}} Helmets, perhaps because they were worn by rulers so frequently, may have come to be identified as crowns.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1167}}{{sfn|Almgren|1983|p=12}} Though many intermediate stages in the typological and functional evolution are yet unknown,{{sfn|Ambrosiani|1983|p=25}} the earliest European crowns that survive, such as the turn-of-the-millennium [[Holy Crown of Hungary|crown of Saint Stephen]] and of [[Constance of Aragon]], share the same basic construction of many helmets, including the [[Coppergate Helmet|Coppergate example]], contemporaneous with the one from Sutton Hoo: a brow band, a nose-to-nape band, and lateral bands.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1167–1169}} A divine right to rule, or at least a connection between gods and leader—also seen on earlier Roman helmets, which sometimes represented [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman gods]]{{sfn|Gamber|1966|p=285}}—may also have been implied by the alteration to the sinister eyebrow on the Sutton Hoo helmet; the one-eyed appearance could only have been visible in low light, such as when its wearer was in a hall, the seat of the king's power.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|pp=521–522, 533–534}}

== Context and parallels ==
Unique in many respects, the Sutton Hoo helmet is nevertheless inextricably linked to its Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian contexts. It is one of only six known Anglo-Saxon helmets, along with those found at [[Benty Grange helmet|Benty Grange]], [[Coppergate Helmet|Coppergate]], [[Pioneer Helmet|Wollaston]], [[Shorwell helmet|Shorwell]] and [[Staffordshire helmet|Staffordshire]],{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=41 n.27}} yet is closer in character to those from [[Vendel]] and [[Valsgärde]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=225}} At the same time, the helmet shares "consistent and intimate" parallels with those characterised in the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'',{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=224}} and, like the Sutton Hoo ship-burial as a whole,{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=47}} has had a profound impact on modern understandings of the poem.{{sfn|Frank|1992|pp=54–55}}

=== Helmets ===
Within the corpus of sixth and seventh century helmets, the Sutton Hoo helmet is broadly classified as a "crested helmet,"{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=199–203, 230–231}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1086}} distinct from the continental [[spangenhelm]]{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=190–197, 227–229}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1082–1084, 1087}} and [[lamellenhelm]].{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=197–198, 229–230}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1082–1083, 1085}} 50 helmets are so classified,{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=199–203, 230–231}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1083, 1086}}{{refn|group=note|This number consolidates the work of multiple scholars. [[Heiko Steuer|Steuer]] numbers the helmets from 1 through 30,{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=230–231}} although he groups the five Vendel examples—three whole, two fragmentary—as #13, and the four Valsgärde examples as #15.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=231}} His list thus truly encompasses 37 helmets. Tweddle adds six to Steuer's list{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1083}}—a seventh turned out not to be the tenth-century helmet that he suggested, but rather a [[World War II]] [[SSK 90 helmet|SSK 90]] ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' helmet manufactured by [[Siemens]]{{sfn|Strong|2002}}{{sfn|Nederlandse Munten}}—but makes no mention of the fact that Steuer grouped nine helmets into two spots on his list. Tweddle's addition therefore makes 44 (37+6)—not the 37 (30+7) that he claimed.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1083}} To these may be added the subsequent discoveries from [[Wollaston, Northamptonshire|Wollaston]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Horncastle helmet fragment|Horncastle]], [[Uppåkra]], Inhåleskullen, and [[Gevninge helmet fragment|Gevninge]], along with the [[Guilden Morden boar|boar from Guilden Morden]], for a total of 50 known crested helmets.}} although barely more than a dozen can be reconstructed{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1090}} and a few are so degraded that they are not indisputably from helmets.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=231}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1086}} Excepting an outlier fragment found in [[Kiev]];{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1083, 1086, 1125}} all crested helmets originate from England or Scandinavia.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1086–1087}}

Of the crested helmets the Sutton Hoo helmet belongs to the Vendel and Valsgärde class, which themselves derive from the Roman infantry and cavalry [[Late Roman ridge helmet|helmets]] of the fourth and fifth century [[Constantine the Great|Constantinian]] workshops.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=223}} Helmets were found in graves 1, 12 and 14 at Vendel (in addition to partial helmets in graves 10 and 11), and in graves 5, 6, 7 and 8 at Valsgärde.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=208}} The Sutton Hoo example shares similarities in design, yet "is richer and of higher quality" than its Scandinavian analogues;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=210}} its differences may reflect its manufacture for someone of higher social status, or its closer temporal proximity to the antecedent Roman helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=212–214}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Although the Staffordshire helmet, currently undergoing research and reconstruction, may prove to be more closely related, the four other known Anglo-Saxon helmets share only minor details in decoration and few similarities in construction with the example from Sutton Hoo. In construction its cheek guards and crest link it to its Anglo-Saxon contemporaries, yet it remains the only helmet to have a face mask, fixed neck guard, or cap raised from a single piece of metal. Decoratively it is linked by its elaborate eyebrows, boar motifs, and wire inlays, but is unparalleled in its extensive ornamentation and ''pressblech'' patterns. The similarities likely reflect "a set of traditional decorative motifs which are more or less stable over a long period of time";{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1095}} the differences may simply highlight the disparity between royal and patrician helmets, or may indicate that the Sutton Hoo helmet was more a product of its Roman progenitors than its Anglo-Saxon counterparts.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=212–214}}

The primary structural similarity between the Sutton Hoo and other Anglo-Saxon helmets lies in the presence of cheek guards, a feature shared by the Coppergate, Wollaston and Staffordshire helmets,{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|p=20}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=989, 1094}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=38}}{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|pp=32, 41}} yet generally missing from their Scandinavian counterparts.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The construction of the Sutton Hoo helmet is otherwise largely distinguished from all other Anglo-Saxon examples. Its cap is unique in having been raised from a single piece of iron.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203, 214}} The caps of the other helmets were each composed of at least eight pieces. On the iron Coppergate, Shorwell and Wollaston helmets, a brow band was joined by a nose-to-nape band, two lateral bands, and four infill plates,{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|pp=13, 15}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=941, 946}}{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|pp=83, 85}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=38}} while the Benty Grange helmet was constructed from both iron and horn.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=231–232}}{{sfn|Lester|1987|p=34}} A brow band was joined both by nose-to-nape and ear-to-ear bands and by four strips subdividing the resultant quadrants into eighths.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=230–231}} Eight pieces of horn infilled the eight open spaces, with the eight joins each covered by an additional strip of horn.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=231–232}} The Sutton Hoo helmet is also the only known Anglo-Saxon helmet to have either a face mark or a fixed neck guard;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} the Coppergate and Benty Grange helmets, the only others to have any surviving form of neck protection,{{refn|group=note|The Wollaston helmet, which was designed similarly to the Coppergate helmet,{{sfn|Meadows|1996–97|pp=192–193}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=25}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}} may have originally had some form of neck protection. Ploughing of the field in which it was buried, however, destroyed much of the helmet, including most of the dexter side.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=2–3, 9, 25}} "The rear edge of the helmet's brow band is almost entirely lost through ploughing but the short section that did survive, when x-rayed, appeared to have part of at least 2 possible perforations on its damaged edge. The purpose of perforations in this position could only be to fix a neck guard of some type."{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=9}} The remaining section of the rear edge of the brow band is only 26&amp;nbsp;mm long, however, rendering "[t]he purpose, and on such a small length the existence, of the perforations . . . uncertain."{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=9}}}} used [[camail]] and horn, respectively,{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=999–1009}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=233}} and together with the Wollaston helmet protected the face by use of nose-to-nape bands elongated to form [[nasal helmet|nasal]]s.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=946, 952}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=231}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}}

The decorative similarities between the Sutton Hoo helmet and its Anglo-Saxon contemporaries are peripheral, if not substantial. The helmets from Wollaston and Shorwell were designed for use rather than display;{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=93}} the latter was almost entirely utilitarian, while the former, "a sparsely decorated 'fighting helmet,'"{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}} contained only a boar crest and sets of incised lines along its bands as decoration.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=9, 16}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=42}} Its boar crest finds parallel with that atop the Benty Grange helmet,{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=6}} the eyes on which are made of garnets "set in gold sockets edged with filigree wire . . . and having hollow gold shanks . . . which were sunk into a hole" in the head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=241}} Though superficially similar to the garnets and wire inlays on the Sutton Hoo helmet, the techniques employed to combine garnet, gold and filigree work are of a higher complexity more indicative of Germanic work.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=241}} A helmet sharing more distinct similarities with the Sutton Hoo example is the one from Coppergate. It features a crest and eyebrows, both hatched{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|p=15}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1094}} in a manner that may reflect "reminiscences or imitations of actual wire inlays"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=211}} akin to those on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Webster|1998|p=188}} The eyebrows and crests on both helmets further terminate in animal heads, though in a less intricate manner on the Coppergate helmet,{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1094–1095}} where they take a more two-dimensional form. These similarities are likely indicative of "a set of traditional decorative motifs which are more or less stable over a long period of rime," rather than of a significant relationship between the two helmets.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1095}} Compared with the "almost austere brass against iron of the Coppergate helmet," the Sutton Hoo helmet, covered in tinned ''pressblech'' designs and further adorned with garnets, gilding, and inlaid silver wires, radiates "a rich polychromatic effect."{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1095}} Its appearance is substantially more similar to the Staffordshire helmet, which, while still undergoing conservation, has "a pair of cheek pieces cast with intricate gilded interlaced designs along with a possible gold crest and associated terminals."{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=41}} Like the Sutton Hoo helmet it was covered in ''pressblech'' foils,{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=31}} including a horseman and warrior motif so similar to design 3 as to have been initially taken for the same design.{{sfn|Pilkington|2012}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Significant differences in the construction of the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} solid neck guard,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–212}} or cap made from one piece of metal,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} and only two have distinct cheek guards.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1104–1106}} The neck guards "seem without exception to have [been] either iron strips or protective mail curtains."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}} The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used iron strips as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14{{sfn|Lindqvist|1931a|p=9}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1932|p=31}} and Valsgärde 5{{sfn|Lindqvist|1932|pp=25–26}} brow bands,{{sfn|Gamber|1982|p=210}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=253}} and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet,{{sfn|Lindqvist|1925|pp=183–184}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1932|pp=30–31}} others would have hung alongside them.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1111–1112}} [[Aventail|Camail]] was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|pp=244–245, 253–254}}{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} 7{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=254}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=215}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} and 8,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} and from Vendel 1{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=13}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|p=13}}{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|pp=244–245, 253–254}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} and 12.{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=46}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|pp=46–47}}{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=254}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=254}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}} and 11,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=253}} and from Solberga,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1977|p=27}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or iron strips used to protect the neck.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1104–1106}} The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of "a differing version well forward on the face" of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} Though "difficult to reconstruct,"{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1105}} fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1104–1106}} Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa all started with a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with latticed iron strips,{{sfn|Lindqvist|1925|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1111–1112, 1112}} while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand.{{sfn|Arwidsson|1954|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1121}} The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10,{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1120}} and Broa,{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1106–1107}} which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional infills. The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant;{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=53–54}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|p=54}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1106}} that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant;{{sfn|Arwidsson|1977|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1121}} the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical infills for each quadrant, but with "elaborate"{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1119}} Y-shaped iron strips creating a latticed effect;{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1121}} and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with latticed iron strips, and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of lattice work and a triangular plate.{{sfn|Lindqvist|1931a|pp=5, 8}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1111, 1113–1114}}

The decorative and iconographic similarities between the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets are remarkable; they are so pronounced as to have helped in the reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet's own imagery, and to have fostered the idea that the helmet was made in Sweden, not Anglo-Saxon England. Its ornate crest and eyebrows are paralleled by the Scandinavian designs, some of which replicate or imitate its silver wire inlays; garnets adorn the helmets from Sutton Hoo and Valsgärde 7; and the ''pressblech'' designs covering the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets are both ubiquitous and iconographically intertwined. Although the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets almost universally have crests, hence their general classification as "crested helmets,"{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=200}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1083}} the wire inlays in the Sutton Hoo crest find their closest parallel in the "Veldel-type helmet-crests in which such wire-inlay patterns are imitated in casting or engraving."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=211}} Thus the crests from the Vendel 1{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=14}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=13}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1925|pp=198–199}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|p=13}}{{sfn|Martin-Clarke|1947|pp=63, pl.

In all these decorative respects, two Scandinavian helmets, from Valsgärde 7 and Gamla Uppsala, are uniquely similar to the Sutton Hoo example.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=214–215}} The Valsgärde 7 crest has a "cast chevron ornament";{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=215}} the helmet "is 'jeweled', like the Sutton Hoo helmet, but showing a greater use of garnets";{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=218}} and it contains figural and interlace ''pressblech'' patterns, including versions of the two figural designs used on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=218}} Unlike on the Sutton Hoo helmet, the Valsgärde 7 rider and fallen warrior design was made with two dies, so that those on both dexter and sinister sides are seen moving towards the front, and they contain some "differing and additional elements."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=218}} The Valsgärde 7 version of the dancing warriors design, however, contains "only [one] major iconographic difference," the absence of two crossed spears behind the two men.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=188}} The scenes are so similar that it was only with the Valsgärde 7 design in hand that the Sutton Hoo design could be reconstructed.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1950a|p=449}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}} The Gamla Uppsala version of this scene is even more similar. It was at first thought to have been struck from the same die,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1948b|pp=397–398}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=208}} and required precise measurement of the original fragments to prove otherwise.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1986|p=198}} Though the angles of the forearms and between the spears are slightly different, the Gamla Uppsala fragment nonetheless provides "the closest possible parallel" to the Sutton Hoo design.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=50}} Taken as a whole, the Valsgärde 7 helmet serves "better than any of the other helmets of its type to make explicit the East Scandinavian context of the Sutton Hoo helmet."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=215}} Its differences, perhaps, are explained by the fact that it was in the grave of a "yeoman-farmer," not royalty.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1948a|p=6}} "Royal graves strictly contemporary with [it] have not yet been excavated in Sweden, but no doubt the helmets and shields such graves contained would be nearer in quality to the examples from Sutton Hoo."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1948a|p=6}} It is for this reason that the Gamla Uppsala fragment is particularly interesting;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}}{{sfn|Evans|2001|p=59}} coming from a Swedish royal cremation and with "the dies seemingly cut by the same hand,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} the helmet "may have been very similar to the Sutton Hoo helmet."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=50}}

Whatever its Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian origins, the Sutton Hoo helmet is descended from the Roman helmets of the fourth and fifth century Constantinian workshops.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=220}} Its construction—featuring a distinctive crest, solid cap and neck and cheek guards, face mask, and leather lining—bears clear similarities to these earlier helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–223}} Numerous examples have a crest similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet, such as those from Deurne, [[Concești]], [[Pfersee|Augsburg-Pfersee]], and [[Augst]], and the Berkasovo 1 and 2 and Intercisa 2 and 4 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–222}} Meanwhile, the one-piece cap underneath, unique in this respect among the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203, 214}} represents the end of a Greek and Roman technique.{{sfn|Nickel|2002|p=112}} Primarily used in first and second century helmets of the early [[Roman Empire]]{{sfn|Johnson|1980|p=309}}{{sfn|James|1986|p=113}} before being replaced by helmets with a bipartite construction{{sfn|James|1986|pp=109, 131–132}}—hence the role of the crest in holding the two halves together{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=203}}—the practice is thought to have finally been forgotten around 500 AD.{{sfn|Nickel|2002|p=112}}{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=92}} The solid iron cheek guards of the Sutton Hoo helmet, likewise, derive from the Constantinian style, which was also marked by cutouts towards the back.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=220}} The current reconstruction partly assumes the Roman influence of the cheek guards; Roman practice reinforced the belief that leather hinges were employed,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=171–172, 185}} while the sinister and dexter cheek guards were swapped after an expert on arms and armour suggested that the cutouts should be at the back.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=85–85}} The neck guard similarly assumes leather hinges,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=174, 174 n.1, 185}}{{refn|group=note|In contrast to the Constantinian group, however, the cheek and neck guards on the Sutton Hoo helmet were affixed directly to the bowl.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=203}} Late Roman helmets tended to have an iron band along the bottom of the cap to which the lower pieces were attached, as is seen on the Duerne, Augsburg-Pfersee, and Berkasovo 1 and 2 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=203, 219, 221}}}} and with its solid iron construction—like the one-piece cap, unique among Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–212, 214}}—is even more closely aligned with the Roman examples,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=178–179, 219–220}} if longer than was typical.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=176}} The [[Witcham Gravel helmet]] from the first century AD{{sfn|Kaminski|Sim|2014|pp=71, 75, 79, 81}}{{sfn|British Museum g}} has such a broad and deep neck guard,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=178–179}} and solid projecting guards are found on the Deurne and Berkasovo 2 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–220, 222–223}} Another feature of the Sutton Hoo helmet unparalleled by its contemporaries—its face mask{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}}—is matched by Roman examples.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=223–224}} Among others the [[Ribchester Helmet|Ribchester helmet]] from the turn of the first century AD,{{sfn|British Museum h}} and the [[Emesa helmet]] from the early first century AD,{{sfn|Seyrig|1952a|p=69}}{{sfn|Seyrig|1952b|p=105}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Emesa helmet]] was also restored by [[Herbert Maryon]],{{sfn|Huey|1962a}}{{sfn|Huey|1962b}} who carried out the first reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Maryon|1947}} An account of the restoration was published by [[Harold Plenderleith|H.

Several of the decorative aspects of the Sutton Hoo helmet, particularly its white appearance, inlaid garnets, and prominent rivets, also derive from Roman practice.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–223}} Its tinned surface compares with the Berkasovo 1 and 2 helmets and those from [[Concești]], Augsburg-Pfersee, and Deurne.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–223}}{{sfn|Webster|1998|pp=188–189}} The Berkasovo 1 and Budapest helmets are further adorned with precious or semi-precious stones, a possible origin for the garnets on the Sutton Hoo and Valsgärde 7 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–220}} Finally, the prominent rivets seen on some of the crested helmets, such as those from Valsgärde 8 and Sutton Hoo, may have been inspired by the similar decorative effect achieved by the rivets on Roman helmets like the Berkasovo 2 and Duerne examples.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219, 222–223}}

=== ''Beowulf'' ===
Understandings of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial and ''[[Beowulf]]'' have been intertwined ever since the 1939 discovery of the former. "By the late 1950s, ''Beowulf'' and Sutton Hoo were so inseparable that, in study after study, the appearance of one inevitably and automatically evoked the other. If ''Beowulf'' came on stage first, Sutton Hoo was swiftly brought in to illustrate how closely seventh-century reality resembled what the poet depicted; if Sutton Hoo performed first, ''Beowulf'' followed close behind to give voice to the former's dumb evidence."{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=59}} Although "each monument sheds light on the other,"{{sfn|Frank|2008|p=78}} the connection between the two "has almost certainly been made too specific."{{sfn|Stanley|1981|p=205}} Yet "[h]elmets are described in greater detail than any other item of war-equipment in the poem,"{{sfn|Cramp|1957|p=60}} and some specific connections can be drawn. The boar imagery, crest and visor all find parallels in ''Beowulf'', as does the helmet's gleaming white and jeweled appearance. Though the Sutton Hoo helmet cannot be said to fully mirror any one helmet in ''Beowulf'', the many isolated similarities help ensure that "despite the limited archaeological evidence no feature of the poetic descriptions is inexplicable and without archaeological parallel."{{sfn|Cramp|1957|p=63}}

[[File:Benty grange helm.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Benty Grange helmet, which has a freestanding boar atop its crest|The [[Benty Grange helmet]] exhibits the other style of boar motif mentioned in ''Beowulf'']]
Helmets with boar motifs are mentioned five times in ''Beowulf'',{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=ll. 303–306, 1110–1112, 1286, 1327–1328, 1448–1454}}{{sfn|Hatto|1957a|pp=155–156}}{{sfn|Speake|1980|p=80}}{{sfn|Bateman|1861|p=33}} and fall into two categories: those with freestanding boars and those without.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Davidson|1968|p=354}}{{sfn|Chaney|1970|pp=123–124}} As Beowulf and his fourteen men disembark their ship and are led to see King [[Hrothgar]], they leave the boat anchored in the water:
{{Verse translation|

|
So they went on their way. The ship rode the water,
broad-beamed, bound by its hawser
and anchored fast. Boar-shapes flashed
above their cheek-guards, the brightly forged
work of goldsmiths, watching over
those stern-faced men.{{sfn|Heaney|2000|pp=21–23}}|attr1=|attr2=}}
Such boar-shapes may have been like those on the Sutton Hoo helmet, terminating at the ends of the eyebrows and looking out over the cheek guards.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}} Beowulf himself dons a helmet "set around with boar images"{{sfn|Cramp|1957|p=62}} (''{{lang|ang|besette swin-licum}}''{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=l. 1453}}) before his fight with Grendel's mother; further described as "the white helmet . . . enhanced by treasure" (''{{lang|ang|ac se hwita helm . . . since geweorðad}}''{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=ll. 1448–1450}}), a similar description could have been applied to the tinned Sutton Hoo example.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=7}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=185, 205, 205 n.1}} (The two helmets would not have been identical, however; Beowulf's was further described as "encircled in lordly links"{{sfn|Newton|1993|p=41}}—''{{lang|ang|befongen frea-wrasnum}}''{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=l. 1451}}—a possible reference to the type of chain mail on the Valsgärde 6 and 8 helmets that provided neck and face protection.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=61–62}}{{sfn|Herben Jr.|1937}}) The other style of boar adornment, mentioned three times in the poem,{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=ll. 1110–1112, 1286, 1327–1328}} appears to refer to helmets with a freestanding boar atop the crest.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=59, 62–63}}{{sfn|Davidson|1968|p=354}}{{sfn|Chaney|1970|pp=123–124}} When Hrothgar laments the death of his close friend [[Æschere]], he recalls how Æschere was "my right hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action."{{sfn|Heaney|2000|p=93}}{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=ll. 1326–1328}} These crests were probably more similar to those on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets,{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=59, 62–63}}{{sfn|Davidson|1968|p=354}}{{sfn|Chaney|1970|pp=123–124}} a [[Guilden Morden boar|detached boar]] found in [[Guilden Morden]],{{sfn|Fordham|1904}}{{sfn|Foster|1977a}}{{sfn|Foster|1977b|pp=23, 27}} and those seen in contemporary imagery on the Vendel 1 and Valsgärde 7 helmets and on the [[Torslunda plates]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=208–210, 216–217}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|loc=pl.

Alongside the boar imagery on the eyebrows, the silver inlays of the crest on the Sutton Hoo helmet find linguistic support in ''Beowulf''. The helmet presented to Beowulf as a "victory gift" following his defeat of Grendel is described with identical features:
{{Verse translation|

It was hardly a shame to be showered with such gifts
in front of the hall-troops. There haven't been many
moments, I am sure, when men exchanged
four such treasures at so friendly a sitting.
An embossed ridge, a band lapped with wire
arched over the helmet: head-protection
to keep the keen-ground cutting edge
from damaging it when danger threatened
and the man was battling behind his shield.{{sfn|Heaney|2000|p=69}}|attr1=|attr2=}}
This portion of the poem was thought "probably corrupt" until the helmet was discovered, with the suggestion that "the scribe himself does not appear to have understood it";{{sfn|Arnold|1876|p=70}} the meaning of "the notorious ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'',"{{sfn|Frank|1992|pp=54–55}} in particular, was only guessed at.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=707, 752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=210–213}}{{refn|group=note|In 1882, for instance, ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' was defined as "some part of a helmet," with the particular lines in Beowulf only partially translated as "about the helm's top a 'wal' wire-girt guarded on the outside the head's defense (i.e. the helmet)."{{sfn|Bosworth|Toller|1882|p=1163}} By 1916 it was termed a "rib, comb (of helmet),"{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=342}} and in 1922 it was said that "[t]he exact nature of a wala, which seems to be an ornamental as well as useful part of the helmet, is not known."{{sfn|Klaeber|1922|p=164}} This confusion led to incorrect or speculative translations of the relevant lines, such as (1837) "[a]bout the crest of the helm, the defense of the head, it held an amulet fastened without with wires";{{sfn|Kemble|1837|p=43}} (1855) "[a]round the helmet's roof, the head-guard, with wires bound round";{{sfn|Thorpe|1855|p=69}} (1914) "[r]ound the crown of the helm, as guard for the head, without, ran a rib to which plates were made fast";{{sfn|Hall|1914|p=37}} (1921) "[a]bout the roof of that helmet / his head's safety, With wires ywounden, / a wreath guarded without";{{sfn|Moncrieff|1921|p=39}} and, by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in 1926, "[r]ound the helmet's crown the wale wound about with wire kept guard without over the head."{{sfn|Tolkien|2014|p=42}} Despite the many mistranslations, a correct interpretation of the use of the word ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' was theorized at least twice before the discovery of the Sutton Hoo helmet. With the Vendel 1 helmet, which had a crest with "reminiscences or imitations of actual wire inlays on earlier or richer helmets,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=211}} as his inspiration, [[Knut Stjerna]] suggested in 1912 that the "helmet had a rib or comb running up to it to its whole height and down again at the back, and this must have been the part of the helmet which is spoken of as the ''{{lang|ang|walu}}''."{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=14}} Elizabeth Martin-Clarke posed a similar idea during a 1945 lecture, stating that "probably here we may have a reference to a special part of the helmet also which resists the sword cut . . . well represented in the picture of a reconstructed helmet from Vendel [1]."{{sfn|Martin-Clarke|1947|p=63}}{{sfn|Frank|1992|pp=54–55}}}} The term is generally used in [[Old English]] to refer to a ridge of land, not the crest of a helmet;{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=55}} metaphorically termed ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' in the poem, the crest is furthermore ''{{lang|ang|wirum bewunden}}'', literally "bound with wires."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=158}} It therefore parallels the silver inlays along the crest of the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=707, 752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=210–211}} Such a crest would, as described in ''Beowulf'', provide protection from a falling sword. "A quick turn of the head as the blow fell would enable the wearer to take it across the 'comb' and avoid its falling parallel with the comb and splitting the cap."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=210}} The discovery has led many Old English dictionaries to define ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' within the "immediate context" of ''Beowulf'', including as a "ridge or comb inlaid with wires running on top of helmet from front to back," although doing so "iron[s] out the figurative language" intended in the poem.{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=55}} The specific meaning of the term as used within the poem is nevertheless explicated by the Sutton Hoo helmet, in turn "illustrat[ing] the intimacy of the relationship between the archaeological material in the Sutton Hoo grave and the ''Beowulf'' poem."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=213}}

A final parallel between the Sutton Hoo helmet and those in ''Beowulf'' is the presence of face masks, a feature which makes the former unique among its Anglo-Saxon and East Scandinavian counterparts.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=124–125}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=205}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The uniqueness may reflect that, as part of a royal burial,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} the helmet is "richer and of higher quality than any other helmet yet found."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=210}} In ''Beowulf'', "a poem about kings and nobles, in which the common people hardly appear,"{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=1}} compounds such as "battle-mask" (''{{lang|ang|beadogriman}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=l. 2257}}), "war-mask" (''{{lang|ang|heregriman}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=ll. 396, 2049, 2605}}), "mask-helm" (''{{lang|ang|grimhelmas}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=l. 334}}), and "war-head" (''{{lang|ang|wigheafolan}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=l. 2661}}) indicate the use of visored helmets.{{sfn|Newton|1993|p=33}}{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=63, 63 n.30}} The term "war-head" is particularly apt for the anthropomorphic Sutton Hoo helmet. "[T]he word does indeed describe a helmet realistically. ''{{lang|ang|Wigheafola}}'': complete head-covering, forehead, eyebrows, eye-holes, cheeks, nose, mouth, chin, even a moustache!"{{sfn|Brady|1979|p=90}}

== Discovery ==
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - in fragments before 2nd reconstruction.png|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph taken before the second reconstruction, showing hundreds of fragments laid out individually and randomly on a white background.|The Sutton Hoo helmet in its fragmentary, unreconstructed state]]
The Sutton Hoo helmet was discovered over three days in July and August 1939, with only three weeks remaining in the excavation of the ship-burial. It was found in more than 500 pieces,{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} which would prove to account for less than half of the original surface area.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}} The discovery was recorded in the diary of [[Charles Phillips (archaeologist)|C. W. Phillips]] as follows:

{{quotation|Friday, 28 July 1939: "The crushed remains of an iron helmet were found {{convert|4|ft|spell=in|disp=sqbr}} east of the shield boss on the north side of the central deposit. The remains consisted of many fragments of iron covered with embossed ornament of an interlace with which were also associated gold leaf, textiles, an anthropomorphic face-piece consisting of a nose, mouth, and moustache cast as a whole (bronze), and bronze zoomorphic mountings and enrichments."

Saturday, 29 July: "A few more fragments of the iron helmet came to light and were boxed with the rest found the day before."

Tuesday, 1 August: "The day was spent in clearing out the excavated stern part of the ship and preparing it for study. Before this a final glean and sift in the burial area had produced a few fragments which are probably to be associated with the helmet and the chain mail respectively."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=742–743}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138}}}}

[[File:Excavation diagram of the Sutton Hoo burial chamber.png|thumb|alt=Black and white drawing showing the position of the objects as found in the burial chamber. Whereas fragments of objects such as the shield are individually marked, the helmet is noted only by a circle with the words "nucleus of helmet remains."|The helmet fragments were neither photographed nor recorded ''in situ'', leaving only their general location known.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=13}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=138–140}}]]
Although the helmet is now considered to be one of the most important artefacts ever found on British soil,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=73}} its shattered state caused it to go at first unnoticed. No photographs were taken of the fragments ''in situ'', nor were their relative positions recorded,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138}} as the importance of the discovery had not yet been realised.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{refn|group=note|In a list of thirteen "hard-learned lessons" for the excavation of any future ship-burial that were given in a 1973 lecture, Bruce-Mitford would start the list with "[y]ou cannot take too many photographs" and "[y]ou cannot use too much colour film."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=10}}}} The only contemporary record of the helmet's location was a circle on the excavation diagram marked "nucleus of helmet remains."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=13}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=138–140}} When reconstruction of the helmet commenced years later, it would thus become "a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}} not to mention a jigsaw puzzle missing half its pieces.

Overlooked at first, the helmet quickly gained notice. Even before all the fragments had been excavated, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' spoke of "a gold helmet encrusted with precious stones."{{sfn|Daily Mail|1939a}} A few days later it would more accurately describe the helmet as having "elaborate interlaced ornaments in silver and gold leaf."{{sfn|Daily Mail|1939b|p=10}} Despite scant time to examine the fragments,{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=111}}{{sfn|Kendrick|1940|p=180}} they were termed "elaborate"{{sfn|Phillips|Kendrick|Plenderleith|Godwin|1940|p=163}} and "magnificent";{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=113}} "crushed and rotted"{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=130}} and "sadly broken" such that it "may never make such an imposing exhibit as it ought to do,"{{sfn|Kendrick|1940|p=174}} it was nonetheless thought the helmet "may be one of the most exciting finds."{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=130}} The stag found in the burial—later placed atop the sceptre—was even thought at first to adorn the crest of the helmet,{{sfn|Phillips|Kendrick|Plenderleith|Godwin|1940|pp=163, 168}}{{sfn|Kendrick|1940|p=174}}{{sfn|Phillips|1940|p=14}}{{sfn|Phillips|1941|p=256}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=9 n.34}} in parallel to the boar-crested [[Benty Grange helmet]]. This theory would gain no traction, however, and the helmet would have to wait out [[World War II]] before reconstruction could begin.

Excavations at Sutton Hoo came to an end on 24 August 1939, and all items were shipped out the following day.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=747}} Nine days later, Britain declared war on Germany. The intervening time allowed "first-aid treatment of fragile objects and perishables," and for "the finds to be deposited in security."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1947|p=11}} Throughout World War II the Sutton Hoo artefacts, along with other treasures from the British Museum such as the [[Elgin Marbles]],{{sfn|Lambert|2014}}{{sfn|Cunliffe|2016}} were stored in [[Aldwych tube station]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=xxxvii}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=73}} Only at the end of 1944 were preparations made to unpack, conserve and restore the finds from Sutton Hoo.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}}

The helmet was first reconstructed by [[Herbert Maryon]] from 1945 to 1946.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1946|pp=2–4}}{{sfn|Martin-Clarke|1947|p=63 n.19}} A retired professor of sculpture and an authority on early metalwork, Maryon was specially employed as a Technical Attaché at the [[British Museum]] on 11 November 1944.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=228}} His job was to restore and conserve the finds from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, including "the real headaches – notably the crushed shield, helmet and drinking horns."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}} Maryon's work on the Sutton Hoo objects continued until 1950,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989b|p=14}}{{sfn|Carver|2004|p=25}} of which six continuous months were was spent reconstructing the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1947|p=24}} Stalled for years by World War II and still in the fragmentary state in which it had entered the war, by the time it reached Maryon's workbench the "task of restoration was thus reduced to a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}} and, "as it proved, a great many of the pieces missing."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=140}}

Efforts on the first reconstruction began with a "process of familiarisation"{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=78}} with the various fragments;{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}} each piece was traced and detailed on a "piece of stiff card", until after "a long while" reconstruction could commence.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}} For this, Maryon sculpted "a head of normal size" from plaster, then "padded the head out above the brows to allow for the thickness of the lining which a metal helmet would naturally require."{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=144}} The fragments of the skull cap were then initially stuck to the head with [[Plasticine]], or, if thicker, placed into spaces cut into the head. Finally, "strong white plaster" was used to permanently affix the fragments, and, mixed with brown [[umber]], fill in the gaps between pieces.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=144}} Meanwhile, the fragments of the cheek guards, neck guard, and visor were placed onto shaped, plaster-covered wire mesh, then affixed with more plaster and joined to the cap.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74–75}}

Though visibly different from the current reconstruction, "[m]uch of Maryon's work is valid. The general character of the helmet was made plain."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}} The 1946 reconstruction identified the designs recognised today, and similarly arranged them in a panelled configuration.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}} Both reconstructions composed the visor and neck guards with the same designs: the visor with the smaller interlace (design 5), the neck guard with a top row of the larger interlace (design 4) above two rows of the smaller interlace.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=143–144}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=121, 126}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200, 203}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}} The layout of the cheek guards is also similar in both reconstructions; the main differences are the added length provided by a third row in the second reconstruction, the replacement of a design 4 panel with the dancing warriors (design 1) in the middle row, and the switching of sides.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=143–144}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=121, 126}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200, 203}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}}

=== Reception and criticism ===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - First Restoration - Dexter.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the first reconstruction, dexter side.|Criticisms of the first reconstruction noted its small size, seen by the projecting face mask; the unprotected jaw; the hole left between nose and crest; the plaster used to lengthen the crest; and the fixed neck guard.]]
The first reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was met with worldwide acclaim and was both academically and culturally influential.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} It stayed on display for more than 20 years,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} during which time it became an iconic object of the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=6}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74, 77}} In 1951 the helmet was displayed at the [[Festival of Britain]],{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=23:39}} where an exhibit on Sutton Hoo was curated by [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]].{{sfn|Festival of Britain Catalogue|1951|pp=106, 114}} That same year [[Life magazine|''Life'']] dispatched a 25-year-old [[Larry Burrows]] to the British Museum, resulting in a full-page photograph of the helmet alongside a photograph of Maryon;{{sfn|Life|1951|pp=19, 82–83}}{{sfn|Gerwardus|2011}} five years later, on the strength of his restorations, Maryon was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]].{{sfn|London Gazette|1956|p=3113}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1965}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|p=xliii}} Images of the helmet made their way into television programmes,{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|pp=16–17}} books, and newspapers,{{sfn|Mitchell|1970}}{{sfn|Mitchell|1971}} even as the second reconstruction was worked on.{{sfn|Grohskopf|1970|p=68}} Though the lasting impact of the first reconstruction is as a first, reversible, attempt from which problems could be identified and solutions could be found,{{sfn|Caple|2000|pp=133–134}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|p=xliii}} for two decades Maryon's reconstruction was an icon in its own right.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=6}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74, 77}}

With the helmet on public display and as greater knowledge of contemporary helmets became available,{{sfn|Caple|2000|p=133}} the first reconstruction "was soon criticised, though not in print, by Swedish scholars and others."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=199}}{{refn|group=note|The only published criticism may have been that of [[Sune Lindqvist]], who wrote that the reconstruction "needs revision in certain respects."{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=136}}{{sfn|Green|1963|p=69}} Lindqvist's only specific criticism, however, was that the face mask was "set somewhat awry in the reconstruction."{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=136}} Bruce-Mitford was undoubtedly aware of Lindqvist's criticism when he wrote that the first reconstruction was not criticised in print, for he was the English translator of Lindqvist's article. He was thus likely referring to the more substantial criticisms of the reconstruction, such as its gaps in afforded protection, which indeed do not seem to have been published.}} An underlying issue was the decision to arrange the fragments around the mould of an average man's head, possibly inadvertently predetermining the reconstruction's size.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}} Particular criticisms also noted its exposed areas, and a neck guard that was fixed rather than movable.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=123–124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=201, 204}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} Though envisioned as similar to a "crash helmet of a motor cyclist" with padding of about {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} between head and helmet,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}} its size allowed for little such cushioning;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} one with a larger head would have had difficulty just getting it on.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} The missing portion at the front of each cheek piece left the jaw exposed,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=201}} there was a hole between eyebrows and nose, and the "eye holes were so large" as to "allow a sword to pass through."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} Meanwhile, as noted early on by [[Sune Lindqvist]],{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=136}} the "angle of the face mask looked strange, not least because it rendered the wearer's nose vulnerable in the event of a blow to the face."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}}

A final issue raised by Maryon's construction was the use of plaster to elongate the crest by approximately {{convert|4+1/2|in}}.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}} The crest had largely survived its millennium of interment, perhaps given durability by the inlaid silver wires.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}} The need to replace missing portions was thus questioned;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}} it was thought that either Maryon had reconstructed the crest "to an undue length", or that original portions had been overlooked during the 1939 excavation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}} When the ship-burial was re-excavated in the 1960s, one of the objectives was thus to search for more fragments, the absence of which could be treated as evidence that the crest had originally been shorter.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=232, 278}}

===Re-excavations at Sutton Hoo, 1965–70===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - hinge on cheek guard.png|thumb|alt=Close-up colour photograph of two joining fragments on dexter cheek guard which together complete a hinge. The fragment on the left was discovered in 1967 during re-excavations at Sutton Hoo.|Discovered in 1967, the fragment on the left completed a hinge on the dexter cheek guard]]
Numerous questions were left unanswered by the 1939 excavation at Sutton Hoo, and in 1965 a second excavation began. Among other objectives were to survey the burial mound and its surrounding environment, to relocate the ship impression (from which a plaster cast was ultimately taken{{sfn|Van Geersdaele|1969}}{{sfn|Van Geersdaele|1970}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=280–288, 301–302}}) and excavate underneath, and to search the strata from the 1939 dumps for any fragments that may have been originally missed.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=230–236}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=170–171}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968a|pp=36–37}} The first excavation had been effectively "rescue dig" under the threat of impending war,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=170}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=5}} creating the danger that fragments of objects might have been inadvertently discarded;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=170–171}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=232, 311}} a gold mount from the burial was already known to have nearly met that fate.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232 n.3}} Additional fragments of the helmet could hopefully shed light on the unidentified third figural design, or buttress Maryon's belief that {{convert|4|in}} of the crest were missing.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}} To this end, the excavation sought "both positive and negative evidence."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=171}} New crest fragments could go where Maryon had placed plaster, while their absence could be used to suggest that the crest on the first reconstruction was too long.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=232, 278}}

Four new helmet fragments were discovered during re-excavation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}} The three 1939 dumps were located during the 1967 season, and "almost at once" yielded "fragments of helmet and of the large hanging bowl&amp;nbsp;... as well as fragments of shield ornaments and a tine from the stag."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=170}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968a|p=36}} The finds were so plentiful that a single three foot by one foot section of the first dump contained sixty cauldron fragments.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}} The four pieces of the helmet came from the second dump, which contained only items from the ship's burial chamber.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}} They included a hinge piece from the dexter cheek guard,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}} a "surface flake" from the crest,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}} a small piece of iron with fluted lines, and a small piece of iron edging showing part of the larger interlace design.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}}

The most important helmet finds from the re-excavation at Sutton Hoo were the piece from cheek guard, and the lack of any substantial crest piece. The fragment of the cheek guard joined another found in 1939,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}} together completing "a hinge plate for one of the moving parts of the helmet, which could not be done previously."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=279}} Meanwhile, although a "surface flake" from the crest was discovered, its placement did not affect the overall length of the crest.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=156}} The lack of significant crest finds instead "reinforce[d] scepticism of the long plaster insertions in the original reconstruction."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}}

The current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was completed in 1971, following eighteen months of work by [[Nigel Williams (conservator)|Nigel Williams]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}} Williams had joined the British Museum in his teens after studying at the same [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]] as Maryon,{{sfn|Oddy|1992}}{{sfn|Institution of Mechanical Engineers|1918}}{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011}} yet in contrast to Maryon, who completed the first restoration in his 70s and "with the use of only one eye,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1965}} Williams reconstructed the helmet while in his mid-20s.{{sfn|Oddy|1992}}

In 1968, with problems evident in the first reconstruction that were left unresolved by the re-excavations at Sutton Hoo, the decision was made to reexamine the evidence.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} "After several months' consideration" it was decided to disassemble the helmet and construct it anew.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} The cheek guards, face mask and neck guard were first removed from the helmet and x-rayed, revealing the wire mesh covered in plaster and overlaid by fragments.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74–75}} The wire was then "rolled back like a carpet", and a saw used to separate each fragment.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=75}} The remaining plaster was chipped away with a scalpel and needles.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=75}} The final piece of the helmet, the skull cap, was next cut in half by pushing off the crest with "long pins" inserted through the bottom of the plaster head and then slicing through the middle of the head.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=75–77}} The "central core of plaster" was then removed, and the remaining "thin skin of plaster and iron" separated into individual fragments "in the same way as the ear flaps, neck guard and face mask."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} This process of separation took four months and left the helmet in more than 500 fragments.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} The result was "terrifying" to Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=6}} "One of only two known Anglo-Saxon helmets, an object illustrated in almost every book on the early medieval period, lay in pieces."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}}

After four months of disassembly, work began on a new construction of the helmet.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} This work was advanced largely by the discovery of new joins, marked by several breakthroughs in understanding.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=126–127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=206}} "Almost all" of the new joins were found by looking at the backs of the fragments, which retained "a unique blackened, rippled and bubbly nature,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=206–207}} "wrinkled like screwed up paper and very black in colour."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=78}} The distinctive nature is thought to result from a "disintegrated leather lining permeated with iron oxide"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=207}}—indeed, this is the evidence substantiating the leather lining in the [[Royal Armouries]] replica{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=179}}—and allowed for the fragments' wrinkles to be matched under a microscope.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=80}} In this manner the skull cap was built out from the crest, aided by the discovery that only the two fluted strips bordering the crest were gilded; the six fragments with gilded moulding were consequently found to attach to the crest.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=80}} The cheek guards, meanwhile, were shaped and substantially lengthened by joining three fragments from the sinister side of the first reconstruction with two fragments from the [[dexter and sinister|dexter]] side.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=79}} The exposed areas by the jaw left by the first reconstruction were only eliminated near the end of the second, when an expert on arms and armour advised that the cheek guards should simply switch sides.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=85–86}}

When a "reasonable picture of the original helmet" was in view, more than nine months of work into the second reconstruction, the repositioned fragments were placed against a "featureless plaster dome."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=84}} This dome was itself built outwards with "oil-free [[plasticine]]" to match the original dimensions of the helmet.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=84}} The fragments were held in place with "long pins" until a mixture of [[jute]] and adhesive was molded to the shape of the missing areas, and adhered to the fragments.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=85}} The edges of the fragments were then coated with water-resistant resin,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}} and plaster was spread atop the jute to level and smooth the helmet's surface.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=85}} The plaster was painted light brown to resemble the colour of the fragments while allowing the fragments themselves to stand out;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=251}} lines were then drawn to indicate the edges of the panels.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=86}} The result was a hollow helmet in which the backs of the fragments remain visible.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=251}} On 2 November 1971,{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|p=28}} after eighteen months of time and a full year of work by Williams, the second and current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was put on display.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=201}}{{sfn|Blake|1971}}

=== Cultural impact ===

The 1971 reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was widely celebrated,{{sfn|Oddy|1992}} and in the five decades since it has come to symbolise the [[Middle Ages]], archaeology, and England.{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|p=61}}{{sfn|Richards|1992|p=131}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|pp=301–303}} It is depicted on the covers of novels, textbooks, and scholarly publications, such as [[The Winter King (novel)|''The Winter King'']] by [[Bernard Cornwell]] and ''The Anglo-Saxons'' by [[James Campbell (historian)|James Campbell]], and has influenced artists, filmmakers and designers.{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|pp=59–60}}  At the same time, the helmet has become the face of a time once known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but now recognised for its sophistication—in part because of the finds from Sutton Hoo—and referred to as the Middle Ages.{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|pp=301, 305}}{{sfn|BBC|2010}}{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|p=61}} It gives truth to a period of time known from depictions of warriors and mead halls in ''Beowulf'', once thought fanciful, and personifies the Anglo-Saxons in post-Roman Britain.{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|pp=303–305}} Considered "the most iconic object"{{sfn|Google Arts &amp; Culture}}{{sfn|Davis|2013}} from an archaeological find hailed as the "British Tutankhamen,"{{sfn|Daily Mail|1939b}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|p=303}} in 2006 it was voted one of the 100 cultural icons of England alongside the [[Machin series|Queen's head stamp]], the [[AEC Routemaster|double-decker bus]], and the cup of tea.{{sfn|BBC News|2006}}{{sfn|Culture24}}

=== Errors ===
Although "universally acclaimed,"{{sfn|Oddy|1992}} the current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet left "a number of minor problems unsolved"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=6}} and contains several slight inaccuracies. These are primarily confined to the neck guard, where "very little indeed of the original substance . . . survives that can be positioned with any certainty."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=257}} Two blocks of fragments on the bottom edge, and four blocks of fragments in the middle, are only speculatively placed, leaving some uncertainty about their correct locations.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=259}} The resulting uncertainties relate to the placement of the individual fragments within the larger space, rather than to a problem with the proposed shape of the neck guard.

As currently reconstructed, the Sutton Hoo neck guard has three principal problems. Several fragments of design 5 are placed too high on the neck guard, which "shows more space below the lengths of transverse fluted strips than above them. The space left below is greater than the length of the die, while the space above is less than the length of the die."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=176 n.1}} Corrected on the Royal Armouries replica, the configuration should allow for two full impressions of design 5, of equal length, joined vertically at their ends.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=176, 176 n.1}} Furthermore, the lack of fragments from the neck guard leaves open the question of how many vertical strips of design 5 were used.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=258}} Although seven strips were suggested in the reconstruction,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=144, 148}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|pp=258–259}} "[t]here is no evidence to indicate that there were seven vertical ornamental strips on the lower portion of the neck-guard, and the suggestion . . . that the number should be cut to five is equally possible."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=258}} Even if seven is the accurate number, the current reconstruction shows an "implausible inward tilt" by the two strips flanking the central one; straightening the strips "would have the effect of allowing the ornamental strips to fan out naturally, leaving evenly-expanding wedges of plain surface between them."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=259}} Finally, the neck guard hangs lower on the current reconstruction than it would have when made, for the top of the neck guard originally fitted inside the cap.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}} This leaves the abutting edges of the dexter cheek and neck guards at different levels, and was corrected on the Royal Armouries replica.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}}

== Royal Armouries replica ==
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet (replica).jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Royal Armouries replica of the Sutton Hoo helmet|Royal Armouries replica]]
In 1973 the [[Royal Armouries]] collaborated with the British Museum to create a replica of the newly restored Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c}} The museum provided a general blueprint of the design{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}} along with [[electrotyping|electrotypes]] of the decorative elements—nose and mouth piece, eyebrows, dragon heads, and ''pressblech'' foils—leaving the Master of the Armouries A.

'''''The Oath''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Laura Poitras]].  It tells the cross-cut tale of two men, [[Abu Jandal]] and [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]], whose meeting launched them on juxtaposed paths with [[al-Qaeda]], [[Osama bin Laden]], the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Guantanamo military commission|US military tribunals]] and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].  The film is the second of a trilogy, with the first being ''[[My Country, My Country]]'' (2006), documenting the lives of Iraqi citizens during the U.S. occupation of [[Iraq]]. The third, ''[[Citizenfour]]'' (2014), focuses on the NSA's domestic surveillance programs. ''The Oath'' is distributed both theatrically and non-theatrically in the US by New York-based [[Zeitgeist Films]].

==Overview==
{{main|Salim Ahmed Hamdan}}
{{More plot|date=November 2015}}
The film revolves around Abu Jandal, a taxi driver in [[San'a]], Yemen who had worked as a bodyguard to Osama bin Laden for four years, and Salim Ahmed Hamdan. The latter worked for bin Laden as his driver in [[Afghanistan]], and was captured in 2001 during the US invasion. He was detained as an [[enemy combatant]] and transported in 2002 to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]]. Hamdan was the first defendant to be tried in the U.S. military tribunals established by the United States Department of Defense.

The men became brothers-in-law after marrying sisters. The lives of the two men are explored and challenge viewers' ideas about [[jihad]], loyalty and [[al-Qaeda]].  The filmmaker, Laura Poitras, inter-cuts Hamdan's trial (his military lawyer challenges the tribunals as unconstitutional and takes Hamdan's case to the [[US Supreme Court]]) with Jandal's contradictory conversations with his son and Muslim pupils, and during media interviews.

==Aftermath==
The Supreme Court challenge was decided in Hamdan's favor and Congress passed a new law, the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] to respond to the court's objections. Under that, Hamdan was convicted on one charge but acquitted on another. His sentence gave him credit for time detained and in November 2008, he was transferred to Yemen with one month to serve. He was released but continued to appeal his conviction.

It was upheld in 2011 by the [[Court of Military Commission Review]] and appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. On October 17, 2012, the Court vacated Hamdan's conviction. It ruled that the acts he was charged with under the MCA were not war crimes by international law at the time he committed them. This meant that his prosecution was ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' and unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="AppealAcquit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/us/politics/appeals-court-overturns-terrorism-conviction-of-salim-ahmed-hamdan-bin-ladens-driver.html| title=Appeals Court Overturns Terrorism Conviction of Bin Laden’s Driver | publisher=''New York Times'' | author=John H, Cushman, Jr. | date=2012-10-16 | accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The film premiered at the [[2010 Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the "Excellence in Cinematography Award for U.S. Documentary".

'''Theophilus Parsons Pugh''' (1831–1896) was an Australian journalist, newspaper editor, politician, publisher and public servant, as well as the editor-in-chief of the [[Moreton Bay Courier]], which he in 1861 renamed to ''The Courier'', renamed again in 1864 to the [[Brisbane Courier]].

==Early life==
Pugh was born on [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Turk's Island]] (Caicos group), part of the British West Indies as son of a [[Wesleyan]] minister. Pugh came to [[Brisbane]] from London in 1855.

==Journalist and publisher==
Pugh is well known in [[Queensland]] history honoured as the a journalist and public servant and as the publisher of the still frequently used [[Pugh's Almanac]] of Queensland. Yet the conspiracy of silence on all matters dealing with Aboriginal rights meant that Pugh was never credited for his editorial campaign in the ''Brisbane Courier'' for Aboriginal rights and against Queensland's infamous frontier force the [[Native Police Force]] in the years 1860 to 1861. Pugh's biographers mentions his contribution as a political journalist and as publisher of Pugh's Almanac and critical stands in regards to the [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|kanaka]] trade but not one word about his crucial role in connection to the editorial campaign against the native police in 1860–61 and the Select Committee of 1861. He was also the first publisher of the Queensland Government Gazette from 1861 to 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Dictionary of Biography 1851–1890; Moreton Bay Courier &amp; Brisbane Courier 1859–61; Brisbane Courier 22 June 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

At his death in 1896 the Brisbane Courier wrote:

"Pugh had filled numerous important positions. In the Southern portion of the colony, and at the time of his death was Police Magistrate at Nanango. He had attained the age of 65 years. Mr. Pugh was born at Turk's Island (Caicos group) in 1831. After being educated at Old Kingswood School, near [[Bristol]], and at Wesley College, [[Taunton]], he served a short apprenticeship as a printer, and then joined the "Southern Times" at Weymouth. Subsequently he was connected with the "Mirror" at Salisbury, and the "Herald" at Swansea. Emigrating to Australia, he arrived at Moreton Bay in June 1855. Continuing his Press career, he for a time acted as correspondent to the [[Empire (newspaper)|''Empire'']] of Sydney. He became editor of the ''Moreton Bay Free Press'' in 1855, and occupied the editorial chair of that newspaper for four years, in 1859 he was appointed editor of the "Moreton Bay Courier," then a bi-weekly publication, which was shortly afterwards published three times a week, and daily from May 1861. After leaving what is now the "Brisbane Courier" in 1863, Mr. Pugh was identified with various journalistic ventures, and when the Brisbane "Telegraph" was started in 1872, Mr. Pugh was its first editor, a position which he retained for slightly over a year. "Pugh's Moreton Bay Almanac" appeared in sheet form at the close of 1857, and in book size the following year. In 1860 the scope of the almanac – or, rather, directory – was enlarged, and came out as "Pugh's Queensland Almanac," and its publication has been continued yearly ever since by various publishers. Mr. Pugh was closely identified with the movement for obtaining the [[separation of Queensland]] from [[New South Wales]], and from 1857 to 1859 acted as secretary of the committee. Until the appointment of a Government printer, he was the publisher of the ''Government Gazette''.In 1863 he was elected to represent the [[Electoral district of Town of Brisbane|Town of Brisbane]]&lt;ref name=parl&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in the second Parliament of Queensland. He was re-elected in 1867, and became Chairman of Committees. An election taking place in the following year, Mr. Pugh again secured the confidence of the electors, but almost immediately, thereafter he retired from Parliamentary life. Mr. Pugh entered the civil service, and was appointed Police Magistrate at [[Goondiwindi]] in 1874. He afterwards filled similar positions at [[Rockhampton]], [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]], [[Bundaberg]], and [[Beenleigh, Queensland|Beenleigh]], and latterly at [[Nanango]], Mr. Pugh, at the time of his death, was a patient in a private hospital at [[Toowoomba]]. He underwent an operation on the 7th instant, and never recovered from its effects; gradually sinking until he died on Saturday evening last."&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Troy''''' is a 2004 [[Epic film|epic]] [[Period film|period]] [[war film]] written by [[David Benioff]], directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and co-produced by units in Malta, Mexico and Britain's [[Shepperton Studios]]. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Brad Pitt]], [[Eric Bana]], and [[Orlando Bloom]]. It is loosely based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haase|first=Christine|date=2007|title=When Heimat Meets Hollywood: German Filmmakers and America, 1985-2005|url= |location= |publisher=Camden House|page=90|isbn=1571132791|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' in its narration of the entire story of the decade-long [[Trojan War]]—condensed into little more than a couple of weeks, rather than just the quarrel between [[Achilles]] and [[Agamemnon]] in the ninth year. Achilles leads his Myrmidons along with the rest of the Greek army invading the historical city of [[Troy]], defended by Hector's Trojan army. The end of the film (the sack of Troy) is not taken from the ''Iliad'', but rather from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' as the ''Iliad'' concludes with Hector's death and funeral.

''Troy'' made more than 73% of its revenues outside the United States. Eventually, ''Troy'' made over $497 million worldwide, temporarily placing it in the #60 spot of top box office hits of all time. It was the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|8th highest-grossing film of 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2004&amp;p=.htm |title=2004 Worldwide Grosses |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the late [[12th century BC]], a battle between the armies of King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]] and [[Triopas]] of [[Thessaly]] is averted when the great warrior, [[Achilles]], defeats Thessaly's champion in single combat, forcing Triopas and Thessaly to join Agamemnon's loose alliance of all the Greek kingdoms. Meanwhile, Prince [[Hector]] of [[Troy]] and his younger brother [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] negotiate a peace treaty with [[Menelaus]], King of [[Sparta]]. However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel. Upon learning of this, Menelaus meets with Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy will give him control of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Agamemnon has [[Odysseus]], King of [[Ithaca]], persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles, who strongly dislikes Agamemnon, eventually decides to go, after his mother [[Thetis]] tells him that though he will die, he will be forever glorified.

In Troy, King [[Priam]] is dismayed when Hector and Paris introduce Helen, but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his [[Myrmidons]]. Achilles has the temple of [[Apollo]] sacked, and claims [[Briseis]] — a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector — as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.

The Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy; during a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus personally for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris and almost kills him, but is himself killed by Hector. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and many Greek soldiers fall to the Trojan defenses. On Odysseus' insistence, Agamemnon gives the order to fall back. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles' quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of [[Patroclus]], his cousin and protégé.

Despite Hector's objections, Priam orders him to retake the Trojan beach and force the Greeks home; the attack unifies the Greeks and the Myrmidons enter the battle. Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and cuts his throat, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, Hector euthanizes Patroclus and the armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin's death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife [[Andromache]] a secret tunnel beneath Troy; should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].

The next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector; the two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam, in disguise, sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector's body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve day truce so that Hector's funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.

Agamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a [[Trojan Horse|gigantic wooden horse]] as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Priam orders the horse be brought into the city. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the [[Sack of Troy]]. While Andromache and Helen guide the Trojans to safety through the tunnel, Paris gives the Sword of Troy to [[Aeneas]], instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them a new home. Agamemnon kills Priam and captures Briseis, who then kills Agamemnon. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through [[Achilles' heel]] and then several into his body. Achilles bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying.

In the aftermath, Troy is finally taken and a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus personally cremates his body.

The role eventually went to Rose Byrne.

==Music==
{{Main|Troy: Music from the Motion Picture}}
Composer [[Gabriel Yared]] originally worked on the score for ''Troy'' for over a year, having been hired by the director, Wolfgang Petersen. [[Tanja Carovska]] provided vocals on various portions of the music, as she later would on composer James Horner's version of the soundtrack. However, the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative, and in less than a day Yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thescreamonline.com/film/film4-3/yared.html |title=The Score of Troy - A Mystery Unveiled: by Gabriel Yared |publisher=''TheScreamOnline.com'' |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Horner]] composed a replacement score in about four weeks. He used Carovska's vocals again and also included traditional Eastern Mediterranean music and brass instruments. Horner also collaborated with American singer-songwriter [[Josh Groban]] and lyricist [[Cynthia Weil]] to write an original song for the film's end credits. The product of this collaboration, "Remember" was performed by Groban with additional vocals by Carovska.

The soundtrack for the film was released on May 11, 2004 through [[Reprise Records]].

==Director's cut==
''Troy: Director's Cut'' was screened at the [[57th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 17, 2007 and received a [[limited release]] in [[Germany]] in April 2007. [[Warner Home Video]] reportedly spent more than $1 million for the [[director's cut]], which includes "at least 1,000 new cuts" or almost 30 minutes extra footage (with a new running time of 196 minutes). The DVD was released on September 18, 2007 in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of [[Danny Elfman]]'s theme for ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy.

Various shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, showing much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army. Perhaps most significant was the sacking of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown fully here, depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies. Characters were given more time to develop, specifically [[Priam]] and [[Odysseus]], the latter being given a humorous introduction scene. Lastly, bookend scenes were added: the beginning being a soldier's dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to [[Mount Ida]]. In one of the commentary sequences, the film's writer, David Benioff, said that when it came to deciding whether to follow ''The Iliad'' or to do what was best for the film, they always decided with what was best for the film.

The month names in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] are derived from three languages: either from Latin, Levantine Arabic (which itself took its names from [[Hebrew and Aramaic]]), or from a genuine Turkish word. The Arabic-Hebrew-Aramaic month names themselves originate in the ancient [[Babylonian calendar]], and are therefore akin to the names of months in the [[Hebrew Calendar]], specifically Shevat, Nisan, Tammuz and Elul. The original Babylonian months were actual lunar months, as the Hebrew months of the same names are to this day, much like months in the Islamic calendar. Turkey has used Gregorian AD year numbering officially since 1926, though Gregorian calendar dates were in use since March 1917. The names of the months from February to September had been used in the now abandoned [[Rumi calendar]], with the other four still retaining their old Arabic/Aramaic names. In 1945, these four received names of Turkish origin.

[[File:Heading into Port Stanley.jpg|thumb|250px|Heading into [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] June 1982, The "Yomper," an iconic image of the [[Falklands War]].]]

'''Yomp''' is [[Royal Marines]] [[slang]] describing a long-distance [[loaded march]] carrying full kit.
The origin of the word is unclear (one suggestion would interpret it as an [[acronym]] of ''Your Own Marching Pace''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Own Marching Pace|publisher= The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It was popularized by journalistic coverage in 1982 during the  [[Falklands War]]. 
"Yomp" has been compared to the term ''yump'' used in rally-driving in the sense of "to leave the ground when taking a crest at speed", apparently a variant of ''[[:wikt:jump|jump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayto, John | title=Movers And Shakers: A Chronology of Words That Shaped Our Age|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2006|page= 225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. After disembarking from ships at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] on [[East Falkland]], on 21 May 1982, Royal Marines and members of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering {{convert|56|mi|km}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Lawrence Freedman|Freedman, Lawrence]]|date= 1990|work=Signals of War, The Falklands Conflict of 1982|publisher= Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn= 978-0-571-14116-6|page=Chapter 21|title= The Bridgehead and Beyond}} "There were two considerations. First, the distance between Stanley and San Carlos was some '''56''' miles and given the problems posed by the terrain it would take at least eight days to cover the ground. Movement would be 'under constant enemy fire from the air, in an area without cover, wood, drinking water or means of subsistence'. When his men arrived, worn out by the long trek, they would have to go into immediate action against an enemy well prepared and supported by field artillery."&lt;/ref&gt;  in three days carrying {{convert|80|lb|kg|adj=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Land Combat|date= 1987|author= Bernard Fitzsimons (Editor)|publisher= Salamander Books Ltd.|isbn= 978-1-85501-165-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; loads.

==Synonyms==
[[British Army]] slang for the same concept is "T.A.B.", of equally unknown origin. (One suggestion would interpret it as an [[acronym]] of Tactical Advance to Battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/Tactical-Advance-to-Battle-(TAB).html|website= Acronym Finder |title=TAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[US military|US Military]] slang for this concept is to "ruck" (from the "[[rucksack]]" being carried) or to "hump" from the phrase "humping a pack".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== The Yomper ==
The image of "the Yomper" became one of the iconic images of the [[Falklands War]].
The original photograph was taken by Petty Officer Peter Holdgate, Commando Forces Photographer, whilst working as part of the Commando Forces News Team.  After landing with 40 Commando at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]], Holdgate accompanied British forces across the Falklands War zone taking hundreds of photographs as the Royal Marines proceeded along the Moody Brook track towards [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Yomper Falklands memorial statue, Royal Marines Museum, Portsmouth (1) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|"The Yomper", Royal Marines Museum]]
When news of the [[Falklands War Argentine surrender|surrender of Argentine forces]] was received, Corporal Brennan produced a small Union bunting flag from his [[backpack|bergen]] (Proffed from SS Canberra's bunting locker). Marine Fraser first tied the flag to Corporal Brennan's radio aerial, which eventually blew off. It was then fixed with masking tape to the radio aerial of Corporal Robinson (who was the last man in the patrol).  The photograph itself was entirely spontaneous and not staged. The original Union Flag was returned to Corporal Brennan in Stanley, who has it in his possession to this day.
