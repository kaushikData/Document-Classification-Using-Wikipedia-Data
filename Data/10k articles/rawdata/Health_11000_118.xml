'''Action for Global Health'''

Action for Global Health was formed by 15 [[non-governmental organisations]] and [[charities]] in 2006. Current partners are based in [[Brussels]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and the [[UK]] and has over 30 member NGOs across these countries. [[Interact Worldwide]] provides the overall co-ordination for the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionforglobalhealth.eu] Action For Global Health Official Webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
The overarching goal of Action for Global Health is increased support from [[Europe]] to enable [[developing countries]] to make substantial progress towards the health [[Millennium Development Goals]] by 2015. Action for Global Health's members are monitoring the actions and policies of [[European governments]] for how they affect health in [[developing countries]], influencing decision-makers to improve their practice and be inviting other [[NGO]]s and civil society organisations to join with the Action for Global Health to build a [[Europe]]an campaign. The Action for Global Health wants to see our [[governments]], the [[private sector]] and European institutions fulfill the promises they have made on reducing rates of infant and [[maternal mortality]] and slowing down the spread of [[transmissible diseases]] in the world's poorest countries. In particular, the Action for Global Health wants to see much greater support for the development and strengthening of [[health systems]], through proper financing, retention of staff and ensuring equitable access.

'''Three Main Goals:'''
* Increased commitment and action from European governments – primarily the [[European Union|EU]] institutions, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]] - to support the achievement of the Health [[MDG]]s in low and middle-income countries; including higher and better-focused financial contributions to health and [[health system strengthening]].
* Increased capacity, engagement and effectiveness of European [[NGO]]s’ advocacy in support of the Health [[MDG]]s, with improved policy analysis and networking with the [[NGO]] and development policy community (recognising the role of health as a key lever of development).
* Increased support from European civil society and the private sector for the achievement of the Health [[MDG]]s in low and middle-income countries, including a higher profile for global health in European media.

== Publications ==
In 2007, Action for Global Health partners published their first set of policy reports "Health Warning" in six different versions: [[Brussels]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and the [[UK]]:
* '''Brussels report - Health Warning (EU version)'''
Why [[Europe]] must act now to rescue the health [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Action for Global Health is concerned that [[Europe]] is not yet doing enough to support [[developing countries]] achieve the health [[MDG]]s by 2015. The focus of this first report is on funding provided by European governments for health in [[developing countries]] through their Official Development Assistance (ODA).
* '''French report - Health Warning'''
Le sujet de ce rapport porte sur les financements de l'accès à la santé et aux soins de santé dans les pays en développement. Ce rapport montre que la faiblesse des budgets alloués à la santé par les gouvernements européens accentue les inégalités dans ce domaine entre pays développés pays en développement.
* '''German report - Health Warning'''
Im Mittelpunkt dieses ersten Berichts stehen die von den europäischen Regierungen durch ihre öffentliche Entwicklungshilfe (ODA) bereitgestellten Mittel für Gesundheit in den Entwicklungsländern.
* '''Italian Report - Allarme Salute'''
The [[Italy|Italian]] edition of the Action for Global Health report "Health Warning" was launched in [[Rome]] on 18 September. Allarme Salute presents a study about what [[Italian Government]] has been doing since 2000 on financing [[MDG]]s focusing on health and which are the most important issues to face in this field.
* '''Spanish Report - Health Warning'''
ALERTA DE SALUD: Por qué Europa debe actuar ya para cumplir los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio en materia de salud.
Acción por la Salud Global está preocupada porque Europa no está haciendo lo necesario para que los países en desarrollo cumplan los ODM de salud para 2015. El enfoque de este primer informe se centra en la financiación que los gobiernos europeos están destinando a través de la AOD a la salud para los países en desarrollo. Además, incluye un análisis específico sobre los compromisos de España con los ODM de salud.
* '''UK - Health Warning'''
Why [[Europe]] and the [[UK]] must act now to rescue the health [[Millennium Development Goals]]. This version of the report includes a chapter on the [[UK]]'s role in financing the health [[MDG]]s and calls on the [[UK Government]] to prioritise this area early in order to enable [[developing countries]] achieve the health [[MDG]]s by 2015.

== Funding ==
The network was initiated through a grant from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] as part of their support for global health advocacy. Similar networks on reproductive health, [[Malaria]] and [[Tuberculosis]] have been funded.

== Partners ==
When established in 2006 the grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was administered by Action Aid as the European Network on Global Health. 

At the first meeting of network staff funded by the grant, in Paris in February 2007, the partners established the name '''Action for Global Health''' and a three line tag line to outline its vision and purpose: 
Full Funding, 
Strong Systems, 
Fair Access.

At this time the partners were:

'''EU - Brussels:'''
European Public Health Alliance, 
Marie-Stopes International, 
Stop Aids Alliance

'''France:'''
Médecins du Monde, 
Global Health Advocates

'''Germany:'''
Terre des hommes (Hilfe für kinder in Not), 
Welthungerhilfe

'''Italy:'''
AIDOS, 
CESTAS

'''Spain:'''
Medicos del mundo, 
Spanish Association of Family Planning

'''UK:'''
International HIV AIDS Alliance, 
Interact, 
TB Alert, 

After the first full period of funding from the BMGF for AFGH ended in 2011 it was renewed with Plan Interact administering the grant to the network in place of Action Aid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11634">[[File:Bill of Mortality.jpg|thumb|Annual return for 1665]]
'''Bills of mortality''' were the weekly mortality statistics in [[London]], designed to monitor burials from 1592 to 1595 and then continuously from 1603. The responsibility to produce the statistics was chartered in 1611 to the [[Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks]]. The bills covered an area that started to expand as London grew from the [[City of London]], before reaching its maximum extent in 1636. New parishes were then only added where ancient parishes within the area were divided. Factors such as the use of suburban cemeteries outside the area, the exemption of extra-parochial places within the area, the wider growth of the metropolis, and that they recorded [[Christian burial|burials]] rather than deaths, rendered their data incomplete. Production of the bills went into decline from 1819 as parishes ceased to provide returns, with the last surviving weekly bill dating from 1858. They were superseded by the weekly returns of the [[Registrar General]] from 1840, taking in further parishes until 1847. This area became the district of the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] in 1855, the [[County of London]] in 1889 and [[Inner London]] in 1965.

==History==
Bills of mortality were produced intermittently in the several parishes of the [[City of London]] during outbreaks of plague. The first bill of mortality is believed to date from November 1532.&lt;ref name="Parish Clerks"&gt;{{ cite book | title=The Parish Clerks of London | publisher=Phillimore | author=Reginald H. Adams |year=1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first regular weekly collection and publishing of the number of burials in the parishes of London began on 21 December 1592 and continued until 18 December 1595. The practice was abandoned and then revived on 21 December 1603 when there was another outbreak. In 1611 the duty to produce the bills was imposed on the members of the [[Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks]] by a charter granted by [[James VI and I|James I]]. Annual returns were made on 21 December (the [[feast of St Thomas]]), to coincide with the city calendar.&lt;ref name="Parish Clerks"/&gt; New charters were granted by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1636 and 1639. The bills covered 129 parishes at the granting of the 1639 charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonparishclerks.co.uk/content/view/10/17/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202121627/http://www.londonparishclerks.co.uk/content/view/10/17/ |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1570 the bills included [[baptism]]s; in 1629 the [[cause of death]] was given, and in the early 18th century the age at death.

In 1819 the bills ceased to be published under the authority of the [[Corporation of London]], coming directly from the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks.&lt;ref name="Parish Clerks"/&gt; The clerk of [[St George Hanover Square]] ceased to provide returns from 1823.&lt;ref name="Company"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonparishclerks.co.uk/content/view/34/60/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202130337/http://www.londonparishclerks.co.uk/content/view/34/60/ |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From then until 1858 the practice of producing bills of mortality was in decline, as parishes ceased to provide returns to the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks. The last surviving bill of mortality is believed to be from 28 September 1858.&lt;ref name="Parish Clerks"/&gt;

==Problems with the bills==
The area fixed in 1636, adding only St Mary le Strand in 1726 which was already within the outer boundary of the bills. The area quickly became much smaller than the growing metropolis. The bills recorded burials in [[Church of England]] churchyards and not deaths. The bills did not include the [[English Dissenters]], [[Roman Catholics]] or those of other faiths. From 1830 burials started to take place outside the bills area in the large [[Magnificent Seven cemeteries|suburban cemeteries]]. Extra-parochial places and certain churches within the area failed to give returns because they were outside the normal parish system. For example, the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula]] in the [[Tower of London]] was added in 1729, but was excluded in 1730 because of a successful claim of being [[extra-parochial]].  These defects meant that the bills failed to record approximately a third of deaths in the Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;The Lancet London: A Journal of British and Foreign Medicine, Volume 2, Elsevier, (1840)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places within the bills==
These places were within the boundaries of the bills of mortality:&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fletcher (statistician)|Joseph Fletcher]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2337746 ''The Metropolis: Its Boundaries, Extent, and Divisions for Local Government'', ''Journal of the Statistical Society of London'', Vol. 7, No. 1.

==Registrar General returns==
Under the direction of [[John Rickman]], the Bills of mortality area and the "five villages beyond the Bills" consisting of the parishes of Chelsea, Kensington, Marylebone, Paddington and St Pancras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=London: a social history |publisher=Penguin |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=9780140105933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were designated the "Metropolis" in the 1801 to 1831 censuses. 

From 11 January 1840, the bills were superseded by the Registrar General's weekly returns for the Metropolis, following the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/public-health/Mortality-statistics-in-England-and-Wales/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125652/http://wellcomelibrary.org/using-the-library/subject-guides/public-health/Mortality-statistics-in-England-and-Wales/ |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekly returns were based on death certificates, and therefore much more accurate than the bills of mortality based on burials. When the Registrar General began weekly returns in 1840 to the Metropolis defined in the 1831 census were added the parishes of Bow, Camberwell, Fulham, Hammersmith and the Greenwich Poor Law Union. This area was used for annual returns from 1837 and was the definition of the Metropolis in the 1841 census.

In 1844 the Wandsworth and Clapham Poor Law Union was added and in 1847 the parish of Hampstead and the Lewisham Poor Law Union were added to the weekly returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/SRC_P/4/EW1861GEN |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829013522/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/SRC_P/4/EW1861GEN |archivedate=2016-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the definition of the Metropolis used in the 1851 census. This area, with minor adjustments,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Penge added 1855, Penge removed 1900, South Hornsey added 1900, North Woolwich removed 1965&lt;/ref&gt; became the district of the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] in 1855, the [[County of London]] in 1889 and [[Inner London]] in 1965.

The '''Biomedical Informatics Research Network,''' commonly referred among analysts as  “BIRN” is a national proposed project to assist biomedical researchers in their bioscience investigations  through data sharing and online collaborations. BIRN provides data-sharing infrastructure, advisory services from a single source and software tools and techniques.  This national initiative is funded by NIH Grants, the National Center for Research Resources and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), a component of the United States [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3128398 | pmid=21515543 | doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2010-000032 | volume=18 | title=Enabling collaborative research using the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) | year=2011 | journal=J Am Med Inform Assoc | pages=416–22 | last1 = Helmer | first1 = KG | last2 = Ambite | first2 = JL | last3 = Ames | first3 = J | last4 = Ananthakrishnan | first4 = R | last5 = Burns | first5 = G | last6 = Chervenak | first6 = AL | last7 = Foster | first7 = I | last8 = Liming | first8 = L | last9 = Keator | first9 = D | last10 = Macciardi | first10 = F | last11 = Madduri | first11 = R | last12 = Navarro | first12 = JP | last13 = Potkin | first13 = S | last14 = Rosen | first14 = B | last15 = Ruffins | first15 = S | last16 = Schuler | first16 = R | last17 = Turner | first17 = JA | last18 = Toga | first18 = A | last19 = Williams | first19 = C | last20 = Kesselman | first20 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
To serve the Biomedical community, BIRN is designed to  share significant and intensive data between reaserchers across geographic distance using user driven base software. Participants can transfer data securely and privately, internal and external. All data transfer is designed to be consistent with [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA) &lt;ref&gt; [https://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/HIPAA]&lt;/ref&gt; privacy and security guidelines

BIRN also offers documented best practices, expert advice, data-sharing, and query and analysis software tools specific to biomedical research. Its researchers develops authorization capabilities and new data-sharing and engineering tools to assist researchers in making sense of new information.

==Structure==
BIRN is a collaborative effort between the [[NIGMS]] and a variety of nationwide leadership associations : 

[[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI) at the [[University of Southern California]], 

[[University of Chicago]], [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], 

[[University of California at Irvine]], and the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].

Its interdisciplinary team consists of computer scientists, engineers, physicians, biomedical researchers and other technical experts, including grid computing developers [http://www3.isi.edu/about-isi_profile/about-research_leadership/about-bio_carl_kesselman.htm Carl Kesselman] of USC ISI, and [[Ian Foster]] of Argonne National Laboratories. Co-Principal Investigators are:
* Carl Kesselman, Ph.D., a professor in the University of Southern California (USC) Daniel J. Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and a Fellow of the Information Sciences Institute (ISI), its highest honor;
* Ian Foster, Ph.D., Director of the Computation Institute, a joint project between the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, and Associate Director of Argonne’s Mathematics and Computer Science Division;
* Steven G. Potkin, M.D., a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the University of California at Irvine (UCI) and Director of UCI’s Brain Imaging Center;
* Bruce R. Rosen, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and Health Sciences and Technology at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and Director of the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA;
* Jonathan C. Silverstein, M.D., Associate Director and senior fellow at the University of Chicago-Argonne National Laboratory Computation Institute, and an associate professor of Surgery, Radiology and Biological Sciences at UC;
* Arthur Toga, Ph.D., a professor in the University of Southern California.

==Resources ==
Users range from small research groups to larger researching groups. Like the National consortias such as the Nonhuman Primate Research Consortium (NHPRC) and the Cardiovascular Research Grid (CVRG), both funded by NIH.

By using BIRN's capabilities both to access data and perform research, groups can conduct large-scale data analysis while maximizing their existing technical infrastructure and expertise. Users also can participate in BIRN Working Groups that develop and support key functions, operations, security and data-sharing requirements.

BIRN offers a website, wiki and mailing lists to help users stay current on up to date news and information. The best practices and topics related directly to their data-sharing considerations. Its experts can help biomedical teams select software, data and metadata community standards; set up security mechanisms and sharing protocols to create multi-institutional policies from a potentially overwhelming range of options.

==History==
BIRN  was initially built around serval “testbeds” or selected projects in neurology research and begun as an NCRR initiative. In 2008, its software expanded significantly to including  data-sharing support across the entire biomedical research community. The network, being now open to all biomedical research groups is In belief that BIRN will benefit from its services, regardless of a group's specialty, mandate, size or U.S. location.

BIRN's mission also has shifted from having a central place for data  to a means of supporting efficient data transfer. As a result, BIRN no longer provides hardware, offers or maintain servers (previously called “racks”) for storing user information, or uses participants’ computers as network interchange. 

The user-driven, software-based approach instead supports data sharing on participants’ existing hardware and software. Each user group retains control over, and responsibility for, its own hardware—and for the security and privacy of its own information. Data is stored on users' systems rather than in a central repository, making possible storage of, and access to, vastly greater data quantities than was possible with BIRN “racks” alone.

==Membership==
To become members, groups begin by filling out a contact form on the BIRN website. A BIRN team member responds, and if its services appear to be a good match, s/he typically refers questioners to a BIRN member or WG for more in-depth conversations.

BIRN seeks to aid universities and  institutional based researchers with complex, distributed projects, technologically or geographically. Such as multi-site clinical trials. 

Working Groups (WGs) evaluate candidate projects based on their unique characteristics and use cases. There are no specific project criteria or required sizes, although WGs may consider factors such as research goals, potential impact, technical challenges, host institution and sponsor funding.

WGs typically discuss whether BIRN’s capabilities will address the group's data usage requirements, which BIRN tools and areas of expertise would fit best, and related issues. BIRN strongly encourages inquiries from biomedical research groups nationwide.

Among the characteristics of groups likely to get the most out of BIRN: the need to exchange data between multiple sites on an ongoing basis, not just from one site to another or for a one-time-only project, and/or to make data from multiple sites publicly available.

On a social level, BIRN looks for groups that understand users’ data-sharing problems and can articulate how those issues affect them in day-to-day, real-world ways. Groups aren't expected to be technical wizards, but do need to be able to articulate specific data-sharing needs and problems.

BIRN contributes technical expertise, while users provide the knowledge specific to their fields. For instance, BIRN can advise on how to go about defining user needs and requirements, but only users can determine specifically what those factors should be. Because BIRN isn't a plug-and-play, off-the-shelf product, the network seeks prospective users who are committed to conceiving, designing, building and implementing the best solution for their circumstances.

The '''Black Death''', also known as the '''Great Plague''', the '''Black Plague''', or simply the '''Plague''', was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in [[History of the world|human history]], resulting in the deaths of an estimated {{nowrap|75 to 200 million}} people in [[Eurasia]] and peaking in [[Europe]] from 1347 to 1351.&lt;ref name="ABC/Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |title=Black death 'discriminated' between victims (ABC News in Science)|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |author=ABC/Reuters |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Health.

The Three Great Pandemics]&lt;/ref&gt; The plague created a series of religious, social and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of [[History of Europe|European history]].

The Black Death is thought to have originated in the dry plains of [[Central Asia]], where it travelled along the [[Silk Road]], reaching [[Crimea]] by 1343.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, it was most likely carried by [[Oriental rat flea]]s living on the [[black rat]]s that were regular passengers on [[cargo ship|merchant ships]], spreading throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and Europe.

==Chronology==
{{Globalize|section|Europe|the Middle East|date=October 2018}}
===Origins of the disease===
{{Main|Black Death migration}}
The plague disease, caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', is [[enzootic]] (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground [[rodent]]s, including [[marmot]]s, in various areas including [[Central Asia]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Western Asia]], [[North India]] and [[Uganda]].{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=25}} Due to climate change in Asia, rodents began to flee the dried out grasslands to more populated areas, spreading the disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] graves dating to 1338–1339 near [[Issyk-Kul]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Paleomicrobiology: Past Human Infections |last1=Raoult |last2=Drancourt |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=152 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Nicholas Wade]] |title=Europe’s Plagues Came From China, Study Finds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=1 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th-century [[Mongol conquest of China]] caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the fourteenth&amp;nbsp;century. In the 1330s, a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25&amp;nbsp;million Chinese and other Asians during the fifteen&amp;nbsp;years before it reached [[Constantinople]] in 1347.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = George C. | last = Kohn | title = Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&amp;pg=PA31| publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2008 | page = 31 | isbn = 978-0-8160-6935-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sussman GD | title = Was the black death in India and China? | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–55 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22080795 | doi = 10.1353/bhm.2011.0054 | url = http://contagions.wordpress.com/2011/11/26/did-india-and-china-escape-the-black-death/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease may have travelled along the [[Silk Road]] with [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies and traders or it could have come via ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8102278/Black-Death-may-have-originated-in-China.html |title=Black Death may have originated in China |journal=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 November 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, [[Tartary]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], [[Armenia]] were covered with dead bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hecker|1859|p=21}} cited by Ziegler, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] traders at the port city of [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] in the [[Crimea]] in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted infected corpses over the [[defensive wall|city walls]] of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into [[Sicily]] and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |title=Channel 4 – History – The Black Death |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=3 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625094232/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |archivedate=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.

===European outbreak===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=The seventh year after it began, it came to England and first began in the towns and ports joining on the seacoasts, in Dorsetshire, where, as in other counties, it made the country quite void of inhabitants so that there were almost none left alive.&lt;p&gt;... But at length it came to Gloucester, yea even to Oxford and to London, and finally it spread over all England and so wasted the people that scarce the tenth person of any sort was left alive.|source=[[Geoffrey the Baker]], ''Chronicon Angliae''}}

There appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague reached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys,&lt;ref&gt;Michael of Piazza (Platiensis) ''Bibliotheca scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas retulere'' Vol 1, p. 562, cited in Ziegler, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in [[Pisa]] a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in [[Marseille]].&lt;ref&gt;De Smet, Vol II, ''Breve Chronicon'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at [[Askøy]], then spread to Bjørgvin (modern [[Bergen]]) and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book|title=Iceland's 1100 years: the history of a marginal society |author=Gunnar Karlsson |year=2000 |publisher=London:C. Hurst |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eRLXJpf2EoC |isbn=978-1-85065-420-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the majority of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Zuchora-Walske, Christine, Poland, North Mankato: ABDO Publishing, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welford|first=Mark|last2=Bossak|first2=Brian H.|date=4 June 2010|title=Revisiting the Medieval Black Death of 1347–1351: Spatiotemporal Dynamics Suggestive of an Alternate Causation|journal=Geography Compass|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=561–75|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2010.00335.x|issn=1749-8198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers do not think that the plague ever became endemic in Europe or its rat population. The disease repeatedly wiped out the rodent carriers so that the fleas died out until a new outbreak from Central Asia repeated the process. The outbreaks have been shown to occur roughly 15 years after a warmer and wetter period in areas where plague is endemic in other species such as [[gerbils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bubonic plague was a serial visitor in European Middle Ages|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubonic-plague-was-serial-visitor-european-middle-ages|first= Kate |last=Baggaley|date=24 February 2015|publisher=Science News|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmid|first=Boris V.|year=2015|title=Climate-driven introduction of the Black Death and successive plague reintroductions into Europe|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412887112|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/02/20/1412887112|accessdate=24 February 2015|volume=112|issue=10|pages=3020–25|pmid=25713390|pmc=4364181|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.3020S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Eastern outbreak===
The plague struck various regions in the Middle East during the [[pandemic]], leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. It spread from China with the [[Mongols]] to a trading post in Crimea, called Kaffa, controlled by the [[Republic of Genoa]]. As infected rodents infected new rodents, the disease spread across the region, entering also from southern Russia. By autumn 1347, the plague reached [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, through the port's trade with [[Constantinople]], and ports on the [[Black Sea]]. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and north along the eastern coast to cities in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], including [[Ashkelon]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Sidon]], [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], and [[Aleppo]]. In 1348–1349, the disease reached [[Antioch]]. The city's residents fled to the north, but most of them ended up dying during the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/an-economic-history-of-the-world-since-1400.html|title=An Economic History of the World since 1400|website=English|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mecca]] became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of [[Mosul|Mawsil]] (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of [[Baghdad]] experienced a second round of the disease.

Swollen [[lymph glands]] (''buboes'') often occur in the neck, armpit and groin (''inguinal'') regions of plague victims.]]
Contemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of [[bubo]]es (or ''gavocciolos'') in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/&gt; [[Boccaccio]]'s description:

{{quotation|In men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain [[tumours]] in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg&amp;nbsp;... From the two said parts of the body this deadly ''gavocciolo'' soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the [[malady]] began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the ''gavocciolo'' had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Giovanni Boccaccio|title=Decameron|year=1351|ref=harv|title-link=Decameron}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The only medical detail that is questionable in Boccaccio's description is that the gavocciolo was an "infallible token of approaching death", as, if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|pages=18–19}}

This was followed by acute [[fever]] and [[Hematemesis|vomiting of blood]]. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes,&lt;ref&gt;D. Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1997), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; which could have been caused by [[Pulicosis|flea-bites]], were identified as another potential sign of the plague.

Some accounts, like that of [[Lodewijk Heyligen]], whose master the [[Giovanni Colonna (cardinal, 1295–1348)|Cardinal Colonna]] died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/&gt; and is identified with [[pneumonic plague]].

{{quotation|It is said that the plague takes three forms. In the first people suffer an infection of the lungs, which leads to breathing difficulties.

Medical knowledge had stagnated during the [[Middle Ages]]. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the [[Philip VI of France|king of France]] that blamed the heavens, in the form of a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air".{{sfn|Horrox|1994|p=159}} This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the [[miasma theory]]. The word ''plague'' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.

The importance of [[hygiene]] was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A [[Transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]] will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of [[quarantine]] in [[Dubrovnik]] in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sehdev PS | title = The Origin of Quarantine | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 1071–72 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12398064 | doi = 10.1086/344062 | url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/9/1071.full }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]], after whom the pathogen was named.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005&gt;{{cite book|first=George |last=Christakos |first2=Ricardo A. |last2=Olea |first3=Marc L. |last3=Serre |first4=Hwa-Lung |last4=Yu |first5=Lin-Lin |last5=Wang |title=Interdisciplinary Public Health Reasoning and Epidemic Modelling: the Case of Black Death |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-25794-3 |pages=110–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism by which ''Y. pestis'' was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by [[Paul-Louis Simond]] and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose [[midgut]]s had become obstructed by replicating ''Y. pestis'' several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as [[Host (biology)|hosts]], keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human [[Epidemic typhus|epidemic]].&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

The historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]] wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893{{sfn|Gasquet|1893}} and suggested that "it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague". He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the [[Justinian plague]] that was prevalent in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from 541 to 700&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

An estimate of the [[mortality rate]] for the modern [[bubonic plague]], following the introduction of [[Antibiotic|antibiotics]], is 11%, although it may be higher in underdeveloped regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|author=Centers for Disease Control (CDC)|title= FAQ: Plague|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of the disease include fever of {{convert|38|–|41|°C|°F}}, headaches, [[Arthralgia|painful aching joints]], [[nausea]] and vomiting, and a general feeling of [[malaise]]. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.&lt;ref&gt;R. Totaro ''Suffering in Paradise: The Bubonic Plague in English Literature from More to Milton'' (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 2005), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonic plague]] has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and [[Haemoptysis|blood-tinged sputum]]. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. [[Septicemic plague]] is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ([[purpura]] due to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.{{sfn|Byrne|2004|p=8}}

A number of alternative theories – implicating other diseases in the Black Death pandemic – have also been proposed by some modern scientists (see below – "Alternative Explanations").

===DNA evidence===
[[File:Bubonic plague victims-mass grave in Martigues, France 1720-1721.jpg|thumb|Skeletons in a mass grave from 1720–1721 in [[Martigues]], France, yielded molecular evidence of the ''orientalis'' strain of ''Yersinia pestis'', the organism responsible for bubonic plague. The second pandemic of bubonic plague was active in Europe from&amp;nbsp;1347, the beginning of the Black Death, until 1750.]]

In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal ''[[PLoS Pathogens]]'' published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998. They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) techniques for ''Y. pestis'' from the [[tooth sockets]] in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drancourt M, Aboudharam G, Signoli M, Dutour O, Raoult D | title = Detection of 400-year-old Yersinia pestis DNA in human dental pulp: an approach to the diagnosis of ancient septicemia | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 21 | pages = 12637–40 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9770538 | pmc = 22883 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.21.12637 | ref = harv | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9512637D }} see also{{Cite journal |title=Molecular detection of Yersinia pestis in dental pulp |author1=Michel Drancourt |author2=Didier Raoult |journal=Microbiology |volume=150 |year=2004 |pages=263–64|doi= 10.1099/mic.0.26885-0 |pmid=14766902 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/150/2/263|issue=2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "ends the debate about the cause of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that ''Y. pestis'' was the [[Disease causative agent|causative agent]] of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages".&lt;ref name=Haensch2010/&gt;

The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related [[clade]]s (genetic branches) of the ''Y. pestis'' [[genome]] associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern ''Y. pestis'' strains ''Y. p. orientalis'' and ''Y. p. medievalis'', suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of [[plague pit]] remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed the ''Y. pestis'' genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the [[Low Countries]] from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities or another site.&lt;ref name="Haensch2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haensch S, Bianucci R, Signoli M, Rajerison M, Schultz M, Kacki S, Vermunt M, Weston DA, Hurst D, Achtman M, Carniel E, Bramanti B | title = Distinct Clones of Yersinia pestis Caused the Black Death | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = e1001134 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20949072 | pmc = 2951374 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001134 | editor1-last = Besansky | editor1-first = Nora J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the [[East Smithfield]] burial site in England, Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 "that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of ''Y. pestis'' that may no longer exist."&lt;ref&gt;Schuenemann VJ, Bos K, DeWitte S, Schmedes S, Jamieson J, Mittnik A, Forrest S, Coombes BK, Wood JW, Earn DJD, White W, Krause J, Poinar H (2011): [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/08/24/1105107108.full.pdf+html Targeted enrichment of ancient pathogens yielding the pPCP1 plasmid of Yersinia pestis from victims of the Black Death.] PNAS 2011; published ahead of print 29 August 2011, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1105107108}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in October 2011 sequenced the genome of ''Y. pestis'' from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.&lt;ref name="nature_bos"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bos KI, Schuenemann VJ, Golding GB, Burbano HA, Waglechner N, Coombes BK, McPhee JB, DeWitte SN, Meyer M, Schmedes S, Wood J, Earn DJ, Herring DA, Bauer P, Poinar HN, Krause J | title = A draft genome of Yersinia pestis from victims of the Black Death | journal = Nature | volume = 478 | issue = 7370 | pages = 506–10 | date = 12 October 2011 | pmid = 21993626 | pmc = 3690193 | doi = 10.1038/nature10549 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature10549.html | ref = harv | bibcode = 2011Natur.478..506B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA taken from 25 skeletons from the 14th century found in London have shown the plague is a strain of ''Y. pestis'' that is almost identical to that which hit Madagascar in 2013.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26770334|title=Black Death skeletons unearthed by Crossrail project|last=Morgan|first=James|date=30 March 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=20 August 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative explanations===
{{Main|Theories of the Black Death}}

The plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; In 1984, zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002 and 2013), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

It is recognised that an [[epidemiological]] account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and the year 1377.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=233}} Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.

In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere or [[Replication crisis|were not replicable at all]], despite extensive samples from other mass graves.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

McCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested in the "laborious" processes needed to discover rat remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Michael|date=1 July 2003|title=Rats, Communications, and Plague: Toward an Ecological History|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=34|issue=1|page=6|pages=|doi=10.1162/002219503322645439|issn=0022-1953|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3208221|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walløe complains that all of these authors "take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat → rat flea → human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-[[commensalism|commensal]]) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Monica|date=2014|title=Taking "Pandemic" Seriously: Making the Black Death Global|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&amp;article=1000&amp;context=medieval_globe&amp;type=additional|journal=The Medieval Globe|pages=31ff|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]

A variety of alternatives to ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of [[anthrax]], and [[Norman Cantor]] thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that they characterise as ''hemorrhagic'' plague similar to [[Ebola]]. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that ''Y. pestis'' was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=M.

However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; Many scholars arguing for ''Y. pestis'' as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including [[typhus]], [[smallpox]] and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of "blood poisoning") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9&gt;{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=21–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Public Health England]] announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed in the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

===Death toll===

There are no exact figures for the [[infectious disease#Historic pandemics|death toll]]; the rate varied widely by locality. In urban centres, the greater the population before the outbreak, the longer the duration of the period of abnormal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Olea Ricardo A. |author2=Christakos G. | year = 2005 | title = Duration assessment of urban mortality for the 14th century Black Death epidemic | url = | journal = Human Biology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 291–303 | doi=10.1353/hub.2005.0051|pmid=16392633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It killed some {{nowrap|75 to 200 million}} people in Eurasia.&lt;ref name="ABC/Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Health. De-coding the Black Death"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Black Death's Gene Code Cracked"/&gt; According to medieval historian [[Philip Daileader]] in 2007:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45–50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as Italy, the south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75–80% of the population. In Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-59803-345-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A death rate as high as 60% in Europe has been suggested by Norwegian historian Ole Benedictow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Detailed study of the mortality data available points to two conspicuous features in relation to the mortality caused by the Black Death: namely the extreme level of mortality caused by the Black Death, and the remarkable similarity or consistency of the level of mortality, from Spain in southern Europe to England in north-western Europe. The data is sufficiently widespread and numerous to make it likely that the Black Death swept away around 60 per cent of Europe's population. It is  generally assumed that the size of Europe's population at the time was around 80 million. This implies that around 50 million people died in the Black Death.&lt;ref&gt;Ole J.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Dance of Death (CCLXIIIIv).jpg|thumb|Inspired by the Black Death, ''The Dance of Death'', or ''[[Danse Macabre]]'', an [[allegory]] on the universality of death, was a common painting motif in the late medieval period.]]

Renewed religious fervour and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted "various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims",&lt;ref name=nirenberg&gt;David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-691-05889-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lepers,&lt;ref name=nirenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Moore ''The Formation of a Persecuting Society'', Oxford, 1987 {{ISBN|0-631-17145-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romani people|Romani]], thinking that they were to blame for the crisis. [[Leprosy|Lepers]], and other individuals with skin diseases such as [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or [[psoriasis]], were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt; The governments of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed the epidemic was a punishment by God for their sins. This belief led to the idea that the cure to the disease was to win God's forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/black-death|title=Black Death|last=|first=|date=2010|website=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  On page 22 of the manuscript in [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9078277z/f25.image Gallica], Simon mentions the phrase "''mors nigra''" (Black Death):  "''Cum rex finisset oracula judiciorum / Mors nigra surrexit, et gentes reddidit illi'';" (When the king ended the oracles of judgment / Black Death arose, and the nations surrendered to him;).
*  A more legible copy of the poem appears in:  Emile Littré (1841) [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1841_num_2_1_451584?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard&amp; "Opuscule relatif à la peste de 1348, composé par un contemporain"]  (Work concerning the plague of 1348, composed by a contemporary), ''Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes'', '''2''' (2) :  201–243; see especially p. 228.
*  See also:  Joseph Patrick Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Connecticut:  Greenwood Press, 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yw3HmjRvVQMC&amp;pg=PA1 p. 1.]
&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1908, Gasquet claimed that use of the name ''{{lang|la|atra mors}}'' for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in a 1631 book on Danish history by [[Johan Isaksson Pontanus|J.&amp;nbsp;I. Pontanus]]: "Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death" (''{{lang|la|Vulgo &amp; ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Francis Aidan Gasquet, ''The Black Death of 1348 and 1349'', 2nd ed. (London, England:  George Bell and Sons, 1908), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5wMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7.]
Johan Isaksson Pontanus, ''Rerum Danicarum Historia'' ... (Amsterdam (Netherlands):  Johann Jansson, 1631), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HaExAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA476 p. 476.]&lt;/ref&gt; The name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name.&lt;ref&gt;The German physician [[Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker|Justus Hecker]] (1795–1850) cited the phrase in Icelandic (''{{lang|is|Svarti Dauði}}''), Danish (''{{lang|da|den sorte Dod}}''), etc.  See:  J. F. C. Hecker, ''Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' [The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century] (Berlin, (Germany):  Friedr. Aug. Herbig, 1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LhoqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 page 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, ''{{lang|la|atra mors}}'' is used to refer to a pestilential fever (''{{lang|la|febris pestilentialis}}'') already in the 12th-century ''On the Signs and Symptoms of Diseases'' ({{lang-la|De signis et sinthomatibus egritudinum}}) by French physician [[Gilles de Corbeil]].&lt;ref&gt;See:  Stephen d'Irsay (May 1926) "Notes to the origin of the expression:  atra mors," ''Isis'', '''8''' (2):  328–332.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the term was first used in 1755.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/280254 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Writers contemporary with the plague described the event as "great plague"&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; or "great pestilence".&lt;ref&gt;John of Fordun's ''Scotichronicon'' ("there was a great pestilence and mortality of men") {{Cite book|first=Rosemary|last=Horrox|year=1994|title=Black Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1O_PX2wVD0sC&amp;pg=PA84|isbn=978-0-7190-3498-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brief intervention''' is a technique used to initiate change for an unhealthy or risky behaviour such as smoking, lack of exercise or [[alcohol misuse]]. As an alcohol intervention it is  typically targeted to non-dependent drinkers whose drinking may still be harmful. It is a prevention approach typically carried out by health roles helping at-risk drinkers make an informed choice about their alcohol use.

Crucially brief intervention includes 'screening' or 'identification' whereby a persons drinking risk level is assessed using a validated tool such as the [[Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test]] (AUDIT). Brief intervention may often be referred to as Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI), or in England, 'Identification and Brief Advice' (IBA).

It works in two ways:
*by getting people to think differently about their alcohol use so that they begin to think about or make changes in their alcohol consumption.
*by providing those who choose to drink with skills that allow them to consume alcoholic beverages in a safer way.

==FRAMES==
For alcohol misuse, the following elements have been identified as particularly important, and forming the acromym ''FRAMES'':&lt;ref name="BienMiller1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bien|first1=Thomas H.|last2=Miller|first2=William R.|last3=Tonigan|first3=J. Scott|title=Brief interventions for alcohol problems: a review|journal=Addiction|volume=88|issue=3|year=1993|pages=315–336|issn=0965-2140|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb00820.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''F''eedback on the risk for alcohol problems
*''R''esponsibility: where the individual with alcohol misuse is responsible for change
*''A''dvice: about reduction or explicit direction to change
*''M''enu: providing a variety of strategies for change
*''E''mpathy, with a warm, reflective, empathic and understanding approach
*''S''elf-efficacy of the misusing person in making a change

==Motivational interviewing==
Brief interventions are based on [[motivational interviewing]] techniques.

Motivational interviewing is a technique which aims to be both non-judgmental and non-confrontational. Its success depends largely on the presentation of objective feedback based on information provided by an individual. The technique involves acknowledgement that individuals who attend a counselling session, assessment or prevention program may be at different levels of readiness to change their alcohol consumption patterns, including:

*No perception of any alcohol consumption problem 
*Realisation of alcohol consumption problem with no corresponding action 
*Current active addressing of alcohol consumption problem 
*Ongoing maintenance of reduced consumption

The technique attempts to increase a person's awareness of the potential problems caused, consequences experienced, and risks faced as a result of patterns of alcohol consumption. As feedback is presented, the clinician or program provider may foster the development of discrepancies between the perception that someone has of themselves and the reality of that person's situation.

This technique acknowledges that people may come to a counseling session, an assessment, or a prevention program at different levels of readiness to change their drinking behavior. Some people may have never thought of making changes in their drinking, others may have thought about it but not taken steps to change it, some may be actively trying to cut down, and others may have already cut down, and succeeded in maintaining reduced consumption. Motivational Interviewing attempts to address the specific issues that people are facing at any particular stage.

In short, the strategy seeks to prompt individuals to think differently about their use of alcohol and ultimately consider what might be gained through change.

==Feedback==
When the assessment is complete, people receive personalized feedback about their alcohol consumption and related behaviors. For instance, 'feedback' highlights that the person's drinking may be placing their health at risk, and is above recommended consumption guidelines. In groups (e.g., a social fraternity or sorority), feedback can be given based on data collected from group members prior to an intervention program. Some researchers have used mailed feedback after collecting data on a questionnaire such that no face-to-face interaction actually occurs.

==Skills training==
Skills training programs develop skills for consuming alcohol in a safer way. One of the limitations of information-only programs is that they may raise awareness and information about the effects of a substance, but leave the individual to make behaivoural changes themselves.

Skills training programs can work well with motivational interviewing techniques, as skills training programs work to provide the individual with the skills to make these changes in their drinking behavior, as the motivational interviewing simultaneously works to make the individual aware of their behaviour.

In doing so, they provide harm reduction strategies for those who choose to drink. This means that moderate drinking goals may also be considered, recognising that any steps toward safer alcohol consumption are steps in the right direction. Consequently, while abstinence may be the optimal outcome for some people, skills for drinking in a way that will minimize harm can be considered if abstinence is not viewed as realistic, attainable, or attractive. For example, blood alcohol concentration level estimation training enables people to set limits for moderate goals that are unique to their gender, weight, and time spent drinking. Teaching practical strategies for reaching these limits, such as spacing one's drinks, pacing oneself, alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, consuming food before drinking and drinking for promote success.

Hicks was born in [[Mosgiel]], [[New Zealand]]; his grandmother, [[Adelaide Hicks]], was a community midwife and nurse in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern People: A Dictionary of Otago-Southland Biography|last=Thomson|first=Jane|publisher=Longacre Press|year=1998|isbn=1 877135 11 9|location=Dunedin, New Zealand|pages=225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated first in New Zealand and after being awarded a Beit medical research fellowship in 1923, he travelled to England and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge.  Under the fellowship he also carried out research in Switzerland, Germany and the United States of America.  He took up a fellowship and lectureship at the University of Adelaide in 1926. In January 1927 he was appointed to a new chair of physiology and pharmacology at the University, a post he held until 1957.

In 1972 he published a book on his wartime catering experience under the title, ''Who called the cook a bastard?'' He died in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia]].

In the [[United States]], the '''chargemaster''', also known as '''charge master''', or '''charge description master''' ('''CDM'''), is a comprehensive listing of items billable to a [[hospital]] [[patient]] or a patient's [[health insurance]] provider. In practice, it usually contains highly inflated [[price]]s at several times that of actual [[cost]]s to the hospital.&lt;ref name="NYT-20130731"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Tina |title=Revealing a Health Care Secret: The Price |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/a-new-health-care-approach-dont-hide-the-price/ |date=July 31, 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=August 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130601"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Elisabeth |title=

==Existing legislation and regulations==
In [[California]], a regulation known as the "[[Payers' Bill of Rights]]" (which is unique to the state) requires all hospitals to provide their chargemaster to the state, which then posts them online for the public.&lt;ref name=oshpd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/racs-/-icd-9-/-icd-10/report-surgery-prices-vary-wildly-at-california-hospitals.html |title=Report: Surgery Prices Vary Wildly at California Hospitals |first=Bob |last=Herman |work=Becker's Hospital Review |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2013|publisher=ASC Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chargemaster procedure is generally only regulated in [[Maryland]]; author Peter Reid Kongstvedt notes in ''Essentials of Managed Care'', "Of particular importance, other than in Maryland, hospitals are generally free to charge whatever they want in their chargemaster."&lt;ref name="kongstvedt" /&gt;

==Critical analysis==
Chargemasters gained national attention in early 2013, when in short succession, there were two important publications made. First, there was a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story published February 20, 2013, titled "Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us",&lt;ref name="brill"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/print/ |title=Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us |first=Steven |last=Brill |authorlink=Steven Brill (journalist)|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which reporter [[Steven Brill (journalist)|Steven Brill]] examined the overlooked role that chargemasters played in the American health care system's cost crisis, asserting that they routinely listed extremely high prices "devoid of any calculation related to cost", and were generally regarded as "fiction" in the healthcare industry, despite their significant role in setting prices for both insured and uninsured patients alike.&lt;ref name="brill" /&gt; Then, a couple months later, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published inpatient prices for hospitals across the country in a publicly available format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html |title=Hospital Prices No Longer Secret As New Data Reveals Bewildering System, Staggering Cost Differences |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Young |first2=Chris |last2=Kirkham |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The 'full charges' reflected on hospital Charge Masters are unconscionable", wrote George A. Nation III in a 2005 piece for the ''Kentucky Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obscene Contracts: The Doctrine of Unconscionability and Hospital Billing of the Uninsured |first=George A. |last=Nation III |journal=Kentucky Law Journal |year=2005 |page=101 |volume=94 |publisher=[[University of Kentucky College of Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health care economics|Health care economist]] scholar [[Uwe Reinhardt]] noted in a 2006 article for ''[[Health Affairs]]'' that the approach to chargemasters by hospitals would have to be modified to become more transparent, in order to encourage a form of [[consumer-driven health care]] to help improve the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Uwe|last=Reinhardt|authorlink=Uwe Reinhardt|journal=[[Health Affairs]]|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/25/1/57.short|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.1.57|date=January 2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=57–69|title=The Pricing Of U.S. Hospital Services: Chaos Behind A Veil Of Secrecy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor of [[health economics]] James C. Robinson pointed out prior criticism of the chargemaster, "Much ink has been spilt bemoaning that incomprehensible foundation of hospital cost accounting and prices, the redoubtable chargemaster."&lt;ref name="jamescrobinson" /&gt; Robinson called for greater transparency as well as increased price standardization as steps to help remedy the situation.&lt;ref name="jamescrobinson"&gt;{{cite journal|first=James C.|last=Robinson|url=http://bcht.berkeley.edu/docs/Price-Transparency-Begins-at-Home.pdf|title=Price Transparency Begins at Home|pages=25–28|volume=23|issue=3|journal=Frontiers of Health Services Management|publisher=[[American College of Healthcare Executives]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 article for ''Health Affairs'', Gerard F. Anderson observed, "Without knowing what services they will use in advance, it is impossible for patients to comparison shop."&lt;ref name="gfanderson"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Health Affairs]]|first=Gerard F.|last=Anderson|title=From 'Soak The Rich' To 'Soak The Poor': Recent Trends In Hospital Pricing |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.3.780 |date=May 2007 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=780–789 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/3/780.short |publisher=Project HOPE: The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also noted the esoteric nature of the language on the chargemaster made it difficult for patients and anyone other than hospital administrators to understand.&lt;ref name="gfanderson" /&gt; Anderson emphasized the difficulty of patients' ability to interpret the chargemaster in a subsequent 2012 article: "Furthermore, most of the items on the charge master file are written in code so that only the hospital administrators and a few experts in the field can interpret their meanings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Gerard |last1=Anderson |last2=Chalkidou |first2=Kalipso |last3=Herring |first3=Bradley |title=High US Health-Care Spending and the Importance of Provider Payment Rates |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fhep.2012.15.issue-3/fhep-2012-0007/fhep-2012-0007.xml |date=September 2012 |journal=Forum for Health Economics &amp; Policy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=1–22 |issn=1558-9544 |doi=10.1515/fhep-2012-0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The drug clerk LCCN2002712838.jpg|thumb|Pharmacist compounding a medication using a [[mortar and pestle]] (c. 1923)]]
'''Pharmaceutical compounding''' (done in '''compounding pharmacies''') is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product to fit the unique need of a patient.  To do this, compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using various tools.  This may be done for medically necessary reasons, such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid, to avoid a non-essential ingredient that the patient is allergic to, or to obtain the exact dose(s) needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredient(s).  It may also be done for more optional reasons, such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture.  Compounding is most routine in the case of intravenous/parenteral medication, typically by hospital pharmacists, but is also offered by privately owned compounding pharmacies and certain retail pharmacies for various forms of medication.  Whether routine or rare, intravenous or oral, etc., when a given drug product is made or modified to have characteristics that are specifically prescribed for an individual patient, it is known as '''"traditional" compounding'''.

Due to the rising cost of compounding and the shortage of drugs, many hospitals have shown a tendency to rely more upon large-scale compounding pharmacies to meet their regular requirement, particularly of sterile-injectable medications. When compounding is done on bulk production of a given formulation rather than patient-specific production, it is known as "non-traditional" compounding (which, as discussed below, is arguably not "compounding" but rather "manufacturing"). This development raises concerns about patient safety and makes a case for proper regulatory control and monitoring.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Grady, Denise; Pollack, Andrew and Tavernise, Sabrina (2012-10-07).

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2010}}

{{Main article|History of pharmacy}}
Before [[mass production]] of medications became widespread, compounding was a routine activity among pharmacists.  Community pharmacists who have experience with compounding techniques are now less common.

[[Pharmaceutical]] compounding has ancient roots.  [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies had some knowledge of the medicinal properties of the animals, plants, molds, fungus and bacteria as well as inorganic minerals within their environment.  Ancient civilizations used pharmaceutical compounding for religion, grooming, keeping the healthy well, treating the ill and preparing the dead.  These ancient compounders produced the first oils from plants and animals.  They discovered poisons and the antidotes.  They made ointments for wounded patients and perfumes for customers.

The earliest [[chemist]]s were familiar with various natural substances and their uses.  These [[drug]] artisans compounded a variety of preparations such as medications, dyes, incense, perfumes, ceremonial compounds, preservatives and cosmetics.  Drug compounders seeking gold and the fountain of youth drove the [[alchemy]] movement.  Alchemy eventually contributed to the creation of modern pharmacy and the principles of pharmacy compounding.  In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] in particular, [[Islamic medicine|Muslim pharmacists]] and [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|chemists]] developed advanced methods of compounding drugs. The first [[Pharmacy|drugstores]] were opened by Muslim pharmacists in [[Baghdad]] in 754.&lt;ref name=Hadzovic&gt;Information taken from the abstract of {{Cite journal | issn = 0350-199X | volume = 51 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 47–50 | last = Hadzović | first = S | title = [Pharmacy and the great contribution of Arab-Islamic science to its development]  (Article in Croatian) | journal = Medicinski arhiv | year = 1997 | pmid = 9324574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaf al-Ghazal, Sharif |journal=Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine|year=2004 |volume=3|pages=3–9 [8]|url=http://www.ishim.net/islam/alrazi3.htm|title=The valuable contributions of Al-Razi (Rhazes) in the history of pharmacy during the middle ages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern age of pharmacy compounding began in the 19th century with the isolation of various compounds from [[coal tar]] for the purpose of producing [[synthetic dyes]]. From this one natural product came the earliest [[antibacterial]] [[sulfa drugs]], [[phenol]]ic compounds made famous by [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], and [[plastic]]s.

During the 1800s, pharmacists specialized in the raising, preparation and compounding of [[crude drugs]].  Crude drugs, like [[opium]], are from natural sources and usually contain several [[chemical compounds]].  The compounding pharmacist often extracted these crude drugs using [[water]] or [[alcohol]] to form [[extract]]s, [[concoction]]s and [[decoction]]s.

Pharmacists began isolating and identifying the [[active ingredient]]s contained within these crude drug concoctions.  Using [[fractionation]] or [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], the compounding pharmacist would separate the active ingredients, like [[morphine]], and use it in place of the crude drug.  During this time modern [[medicine]] began.

With the isolation of medications from the [[raw material]]s or crude drugs came the birth of the modern pharmaceutical company. Pharmacists were trained to compound the preparations made by the drug companies, but they could not do it efficiently on a small scale. So [[economies of scale]], not lack of skill or knowledge, produced the modern [[pharmaceutical industry]].

With the turn of the 20th century came greater government [[regulation]] of the practice of medicine.  These new regulations forced the drug companies to prove that any new medication they brought to market was safe. With the discovery of [[penicillin]], modern marketing techniques and [[brand]] promotion, the drug manufacturing industry came of age.  Pharmacists continued to compound most [[medical prescription|prescriptions]] until the early 1950s when the majority of dispensed drugs came directly from the large pharmaceutical companies.

==Roles==

===During research and development===
Pharmaceutical compounding is a branch of pharmacy that continues to play the crucial role of [[drug development]].  Compounding pharmacists and medicinal chemists develop and test combinations of active pharmaceuticals and delivery systems for new [[pharmaceutical formulation]]s so that the active ingredients are effective, stable, easy to use, and acceptable to patients. However, for actual clinical trials, production of drug products is generally considered ''manufacturing'' because ''compounding'' is typically defined as being for small batch or single individual patient production only.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Patients with unique or unusual medication needs===
Physicians may prescribe an individually compounded medication for a patient with an unusual health need.  This allows the physician to tailor a prescription to each individual.  Compounding preparations are especially prevalent for:

*Patients requiring an individualized compounded formulation to be developed by the pharmacist&lt;ref name = "Compounding"&gt;{{cite web|title=What to Expect from a Compounding Pharmacy|url=http://www.trinitypharmacy.com/expect-compounding-pharmacy/|publisher=Trinity Pharmacy|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Patients who cannot take commercially prepared prescriptions&lt;ref name = "Compounding" /&gt;
*Patients requiring limited dosage strengths, such as a very small dose for infants
*Patients requiring a different formulation, such as turning a [[Pill (pharmacy)|pill]] into a liquid or transdermal gel for people who cannot swallow pills due to disability
*Patients requiring an [[allergy|allergen-free]] medication, such as one without [[gluten]] or colored dyes
*Patients who absorb or excrete medications abnormally&lt;ref name="urlInternational Academy of Compounding Pharmacists: Definition of Compounding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iacprx.org/site/PageServer?pagename=What_is_compounding |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207051936/http://www.iacprx.org/site/PageServer?pagename=What_is_compounding |archivedate=2007-02-07 |title=International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists: Definition of Compounding |work= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Patients who need drugs that have been discontinued by pharmaceutical manufacturers because of low profitability
*Patients facing a supply shortage of their normal drug&lt;ref name="urlArmourThyroid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armourthyroid.com/ |title=ArmourThyroid |work= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlOptions for thyroid treatment | Stop The Thyroid Madness"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/options-for-thyroid-treatment/ |title=Options for thyroid treatment |work= stopthethyroidmadness.com |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Children who want flavored additives in liquid drugs, usually so that the medication tastes like candy or fruit
*Veterinary medicine, for a change in dose, change to a more easily administered form (such as from a pill to a liquid or transdermal gel), or to add a flavor more palatable to the animal. In the United States, compounded veterinary medicine must meet the standards set forth in the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA)&lt;ref name="urlInternational Academy of Compounding Pharmacists: Definition of Compounding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urlwww.fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm137148.htm |title=Update on Illegal Compounding of Clenbuterol Veterinary Drug Products |date= January 10, 2002 |work= Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many types of [[bioidentical hormone replacement therapy]]&lt;ref name = Boothby2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boothby LA, Doering PL |title=Bioidentical hormone therapy: a panacea that lacks supportive evidence |journal=Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=400–7 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18660693 |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3283081ae9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personalized medicine and polypharmacy===
While the regulatory boundaries are not always clear (see "Regulation"), there is general acceptance of the need for physicians to have wide discretion to prescribe customized drug products containing unique drug-dosage combinations and/or formulations thereof specifically for individual patients.  Most mass-produced drugs often have only one or two readily available dosage levels (except the most dominant drugs), and [[fixed-dose combination]] products – despite their many benefits – are even less likely to have the optimal combination of drugs and respective dosages for any given patient.  Hence, the opportunity to tailor the drug(s)/dosage(s) in a given drug product as specifically contemplated for individual patients (as deemed optimal by one's physician) is an application of the classic principles underlying compounding.

Some kinds or compositions of ''[[polypill]]s'' or other drug products are more amenable to custom-compounding than others, and most retail pharmacies no longer offer compounding services at all, although hospital pharmacies still commonly compound [[intravenous]] medications. But while fewer pharmacists are trained and experienced in the relevant skills anymore; especially regarding oral dosage forms, which are almost always mass-produced now instead; such compounding pharmacies nevertheless can be found and utilized via mail-order (if not available locally) with sufficient notice and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayviewrx.com/bayview-blog/bid/18766/5-in-1-PolyPill-Treatment-May-Prevent-Heart-Disease |title=5-in-1 PolyPill Treatment May Prevent Heart Disease |publisher=Bayviewrx.com |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies are under development to facilitate production of customized polypills, such as for example by the use of ink-jet printing mechanisms to precisely deposit selected drug substance(s) onto sheets which can then be inserted into capsules, enabling "individualized dosing and automated fabrication of medicines containing multiple drugs," in addition to custom single-drug products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jps.23165/abstract |title=Electrodeless electrohydrodynamic drop-on-demand encapsulation of drugs into porous polymer films for fabrication of personalized dosage units | work=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | publisher= Wiley Online Library |accessdate=2014-02-18 |doi=10.1002/jps.23165 |volume=101 |pages=2523–2533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar technology can also be used to print tablets, more directly. Ink-jet or fluid-jet approaches do require each drug substance to be dissolved in a liquid solvent, but they can be particularly conducive to custom formulation with various possible excipients, in addition to custom drug/dose selections.

==Regulation in Australia==
In Australia the Pharmacy Board of Australia is responsible for registration of pharmacists and professional practice including compounding. Although almost all pharmacies are able to prepare at least simple compounded medicines, some pharmacies undertake further training and education to be able to prepare more complex products. Although pharmacists who have undertaken further training to do complex compounding are not yet easily identified, the Board has been working to put a credentialing system in place. In 2011 the Pharmacy Board convened a Compounding Working Party to advise on revised compounding standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharmacy Board of Australia Nov 2011 Communique|url=http://www.pharmacyboard.gov.au/News/Communiques.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Draft compounding guidelines for comment were released in April 2014. However it should be noted that pharmacists are required to comply with the current Board requirements and if this is not happening the Board can be notified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharmacy Board of Australia - notifications|url=http://www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications/What-is-a-notification.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sterile and non-sterile compounding are legal provided the medicines are provided for a particular patient for therapeutic application to that patient, and the compounded product is supplied on or from the compounding pharmacy premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Therapeutic goods regulations: Exempt goods|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/dr4-appendix-08.pdf|publisher=Australian Government. Department of Health and Aging. Therapeutic Goods Administration|accessdate=2017-02-21|date=December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are additional requirements for sterile compounding. Not only must a laminar flow cabinet [laminar flow hood] be used, but the environment in which the hood is located must be strictly controlled for microbial and particulate contamination and all procedures, equipment and personnel must be validated to ensure the safe preparation of sterile products. In non-sterile compounding, a powder containment hood is required when any hazardous material (e.g. hormones) are prepared or when there is a risk of cross-contamination of the compounded product. Pharmacists preparing compounded products must comply with these requirements and others published in the Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary &amp; Handbook.

==Regulation in the United States==
In the [[United States]], compounding pharmacies are licensed and regulated by their respective states like all other pharmacies. National standards have been created by Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB).&lt;ref name="urlInternational Academy of Compounding Pharmacists: Frequently Asked Questions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iacprx.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FAQs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819002609/http://www.iacprx.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FAQs |archivedate=2006-08-19 |title=International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists: Frequently Asked Questions |work= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, accreditation is not mandatory and inspections for compliance occur only every three years.&lt;ref&gt;Kotz, Deborah (2012-10-11) [http://www.boston.com/dailydose/2012/10/11/how-risky-are-compounding-pharmacies/5qEMXl6fMzSl4fTtolachJ/story.html How risky are compounding pharmacies?]. Boston.com. Retrieved on 2013-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned, some confusion has arisen when the traditionally patient-specific nature of compounding gets blurred by the making the multi-product "batches" such as in anticipation of similar orders. Notably, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has always had authority to regulate "manufacturing" – which is when drug products are not made or modified as to be ''tailored in some way to the individual patient'' – regardless of whether this is done at a factory or at a pharmacy. And conversely, truly legitimate/traditional compounding does not cease to be so merely by having a high ''frequency'' or occurrence – indeed, progressing towards ''more'' prevalent drug product customization is an appealing aspect of [[personalized medicine]] (see above).

In the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) of 2013 (H.R. 3204),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3204/text |title=Text of H.R. 3204: Drug Quality and Security Act (Enrolled Bill version) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= November 21, 2013 |accessdate= 2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to clarify some limits of FDA jurisdiction over traditional (i.e., patient-specific) compounding, and to provide a regulated (albeit optional) pathway for "non-traditional" compounders to operate. So now, Section 503A essentially establishes that pharmacies compounding only "patient-specific" drug products made in response to each prescription (among certain other related situations) cannot be required to obtain FDA approval for such products, as they will remain exclusively under state-level pharmacy regulation. At the same time, Section 503B creates a new category of facilities called "outsourcing facilities" - by which non-traditional compounding facilities (i.e., those whose products include "non-patient-specific" batches) can be explicitly authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under specified circumstances, while being exempted from certain requirements otherwise imposed on mass-producers. Notably, in both cases the compounding cannot encompass a drug product that is "essentially a copy" of a mass-produced drug product, but in 503B the definition of "essentially a copy" is broader than in 503A. (In earlier DQSA drafts the definitions were kept the same for both sections,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.protectmycompounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/GRIFVA_020_xml.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but the final version goes further for "outsourcing facilities" in subsection (d)(2)(B) of 503B, by deeming a compounded drug a "copy" even if it just has an active ingredient that is also present in any mass-produced product.) However, this definition is indicated at the beginning of subsection (d) as applying only for section 503B. For traditional/patient-specific compounding, 503A's definition of "copy" retains its original focus on drug ''products'' or ultimate dosage forms rather than drug substances or active ingredients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhia.org/resource/legislative/503AStatute.cfm |title= Compounding Legislation Action Center - Section 503A |publisher=National Home Infusion Association |year=2010 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in any event it explicitly excludes from its definition any compounded drug product that a given patient's prescribing practitioner determines makes a "significant difference" for the patient. (503B's definition includes a similar but narrower ''safe harbor'' exclusion from the definition; that definition, which applies only to the "outsourcing facilities," defines "copy" based on the active ingredient(s) a drug product contains, rather than the overall drug product or dosage form, and it explicitly excludes situations where the prescribing practitioner determines that the change/difference makes a "clinical difference" for the patient.)

In general, to whatever extent the Food and Drug Administration ever has authority to regulate compounding, the FDA weighs the following (non-exhaustive) mix of factors in deciding whether to "exercise its discretion" to require approval for a custom-compounded drug product, from its 2002 Compliance Policy Guide on the matter:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCompounding/ucm134919.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309060156/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCompounding/ucm134919.htm |archivedate=2010-03-09 |title=Medical Center Pharmacy v. Mukasey |publisher=Food and Drug Administration|date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Compounding in anticipation of receiving prescriptions,
# Compounding drugs removed from the market for safety reasons,
# Compounding from bulk ingredients not approved by FDA,
# Receiving, storing, or using drugs not made in an FDA-registered facility,
# Receiving, storing, or using drugs' components not determined to meet compendia requirements,
# Using commercial-scale manufacturing or testing equipment,
# Compounding for third parties for resale,
# Compounding drugs that are essentially the same as commercially available products,
# Failing to operate in conformance with applicable state law.
Hence, making truly patient-customized products with particular drug(s)/dosage(s) upon receiving valid prescriptions from a physician is likely to be acceptable, especially if the ingredients are FDA approved, etc.

===Outsourcing facilities===

The DQSA amends the FFDCA to create a new class of FDA-regulated entities known as "outsourcing facilities" whose compounded drug products notably "may ''or'' may not" be patient-specific based on individualized prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=11/19/2013 by Michael Werner&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/drug-quality-and-security-act-gives-fda-47575/ |title=Drug Quality and Security Act Gives FDA Authority to Regulate Drug Compounding and Creates Uniform Federal Standards for Distribution |publisher=JDSupra |date=November 19, 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Registered ''outsourcing facilities'', unlike traditional compounding facilities, are subject to the FDA's oversight. Currently this is a voluntary program.

In addition to being subjected to Food and Drug Administration inspections, registration, fees, and specified reporting requirements, other notable requirements of outsourcing facilities include that:

#Drugs are compounded by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist.
#The facility does not compound using "bulk drug substances" (unless certain exceptions apply) and its drugs are manufactured by an FDA-registered establishment.
#Other ingredients used in compounding the drug must comply with the standards of the applicable United States Pharmacopeia or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists.
#The drug does not appear on a list published by FDA of unsafe or ineffective drugs.
#The drug is not "essentially a copy" of one or more marketed drugs (as defined uniquely in section 503B, notably more broadly and with narrower exclusions than for "traditional" compounding).
#The drug does not appear on the FDA list of drugs or categories of drugs that present "demonstrable difficulties" for compounding.
#The compounding pharmacist demonstrates that he or she will use controls comparable to the controls applicable under any applicable risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS).
#The drug will not be sold or transferred by an entity other than the outsourcing facility.
#The label of the drug states that it is a compounded drug, as well as the name of the outsourcing facility, the lot or batch number of the drug, dosage form and strength, and other key information.

===Analogy to "off-label" use===

Regarding traditional/patient-specific compounding, the practice of "off-label use" can be considered a related analogous point regarding the ''broad professional discretion to customize patient care.'' About 20–30% of prescription medications in the US are estimated to be used "off-label," meaning the physician believes the drug to be beneficial for a patient despite its not being approved for that particular use/condition. This too is perfectly legal, subject only to state regulations on the practice of medicine, etc.

The appropriateness of prescribing approved drugs for uses not included in their official labeling is sometimes a cause of concern and confusion among physicians. This has been addressed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in their Statement on the Use of Medications for Unlabeled Uses:&lt;ref name="ASHP Statement on the Use of Medications for Unlabeled Use"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashp.org/DocLibrary/BestPractices/FormStUnlabeled.aspx |title=American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists: Statement on the Use of Medications for Unlabeled Use |work= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act, a drug approved for marketing may be labeled, promoted, and advertised by the manufacturer only for those uses for which the drug's safety and effectiveness has been established and which the FDA has approved. These are commonly referred to as "approved uses." This means that adequate and well-controlled clinical trials have documented these uses, and the results of the trials have been reviewed and approved by the FDA.

The FFDCA does not, however, limit the manner in which a physician may use an approved drug. Once a product has been approved for marketing, a physician may prescribe it for uses or in treatment regimens or patient populations that are not included in the above labeling. Such "unapproved" or more precisely, "unlabeled" uses may be appropriate and rational in certain circumstances, and, may, in fact, reflect approaches to drug therapy that have been extensively reported in medical literature. Thus the term "unapproved uses" is, to some extent, misleading. Valid new uses for drugs already on the market are often first discovered through serendipitous observations and therapeutic investigations. Before such advances can be added to the approved labeling, however, data substantiating the effectiveness of a new use or regimen must be submitted by the manufacturer to the Food and Drug Administration for evaluation. This may take time, and without the initiative of the drug manufacturer whose product is involved, and physicians who are persuaded that a given usage is valid before there is broad scientific consensus, it may never otherwise occur. For that reason, accepted medical practice often includes so-called "off label" uses.

===Drug testing and reporting of incidents===

Poor practices on the part of drug compounders can result in contamination or in products that don't possess the strength, quality, and purity required.  Unless a complaint is filed or a patient is harmed, drugs made by compounders are seldom tested,  In Texas, one of only two states that does random testing, significant problems have been found.  Random tests by the state’s pharmacy board over the last several years have found that as many as one in four compounded drugs was either too weak or too strong. In Missouri, the only other state that does testing, potency varied by as much as 300 percent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Bogdanich, Walt and Tavernise, Sabrina (2012-10-22). [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/health/before-meningitis-outbreak-group-advised-how-to-avoid-fda.html U.S. Concern Over Compounders Predates Outbreak of Meningitis]. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Food and Drug Administration]], concerned about the rising number of accidents related to compounded medications, identified "red flag" factors and issued a guide devoted to human pharmacy compounding,  These factors include instances where pharmacists are:

* Compounding drug products that have been pulled from the market because they were found to be unsafe or ineffective.
* Compounding drugs that are essentially copies of a commercially available drug product.
* Compounding drugs in advance of receiving prescriptions, except in very limited quantities relating to the amounts of drugs previously compounded based on valid prescriptions.
* Compounding finished drugs from bulk active ingredients that aren't components of FDA-approved drugs, without an FDA-sanctioned, investigational new-drug application.
* Receiving, storing, or using drug substances without first obtaining written assurance from the supplier that each lot of the drug substance has been made in an FDA-registered facility.
* Failing to conform to applicable state law regulating the practice of pharmacy.&lt;ref name="SpecialRisks"/&gt;

The DQSA of 2013 recognized and authorized certain non-traditional compounders to operate as "outsourcing facilities," who register with the FDA and become subject to various reporting requirements - including adverse events and supply chain matters.

====New England Compounding Center incident====
{{see also|New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak}}

In October 2012 news reports surfaced of an [[New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak|outbreak of fungal meningitis]] tied to the New England Compounding Center.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/09/meningitis-outbreak-deaths/1622869/ Meningitis outbreak toll: 119 cases, 11 deaths]. Usatoday.com (2012-10-09). Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it was also disclosed that the United States and Massachusetts state health regulators were aware in 2002 that steroid treatments from the New England Compounding Center could cause adverse patient reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=David|title=Health officials knew of problem steroids in 2002: U.S. House panel|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-usa-health-meningitis-congress-idUSBRE89M00820121023|publisher=Reuters|date=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was further disclosed that in 2001–02, four people died, more than a dozen were injured and hundreds exposed after they received back-pain injections tainted with a common fungus dispensed by two compounding pharmacies in California and South Carolina.&lt;ref name = "WSJ2"&gt;Burtin, T.

In August 2013 further reports tied to the [[New England]] compounding center said that about 750 people were sickened, including 63 deaths, and that  infections were linked to more than 17,600 doses of [[methylprednisolone acetate]] [[steroid]] injections used to treat back and [[joint]] pain that were shipped to 23 states. At that time, another incident was reported  after at least 15 people at two [[Texas]] hospitals developed bacterial infections. All lots of  medications dispensed since May 9, 2013,  made by Specialty Compounding, LLC of [[Cedar Park, Texas]] were recalled. The hospitals reported affected  were Corpus Christi Medical Center Bay Area and Corpus Christi Medical Center Doctors Regional. The patients had received intravenous infusions of [[calcium gluconate]], a drug used to treat [[calcium]] deficiencies and too much [[potassium]] in the blood. Implicated in these cases is the [[Rhodococcus]] bacteria, which can cause symptoms such as fever and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57598110/texas-compounding-pharmacy-recalls-drugs-after-15-infections/ |title=Texas compounding pharmacy recalls drugs after 15 infections |publisher=CBS News |date=2013-08-12 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse prompting regulatory changes===
The DQSA of 2013 implements certain statutory changes and clarifications to the authority of the Food and Drug Administration, based in part on growing concerns about "non-traditional" or non-patient-specific compounding—particularly of sterile injectable drug products. Traditional, patient-specific compounding remains essentially unaffected and continues to fall under the domain of state pharmacy practice regulation without controversy.

The FDA and others say that some larger compounding pharmacies were acting like drug manufacturers and yet circumventing FDA regulations under the banner of compounding. Drugs from compounding pharmacies can be cheaper or alleviate shortages, but can pose greater risk of contamination due in part to the lack of oversight. Compounding pharmacies had been regulated by laws that were developed when they solely made custom prescriptions for individual patients, but the FDA has sought additional authority to regulate what they term "non-traditional" compounders who in essence are more like "miniature drug manufacturers" than true pharmacies.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  Such "non-traditional" compounders behave like manufacturers in various ways – such as by having sales teams that market non-personalized drug products or production capability to doctors, and by making drugs that are essentially the same as commercially available mass-produced drug products, and most importantly by ''pre-making large batches of a given drug product in anticipation of additional same prescriptions but before actually receiving them'' (the latter being directly the opposite of patient-specific tailoring).&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ1&gt;{{cite web|title=Outbreak Spurs Calls for New Controls |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443982904578044682649925200?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|author1=Martin, T. W. |author2=Burton, T. M. |author3=Dooren, J. C. |date = 2012-10-09 |work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An FDA spokesperson stated, "The methods of these companies seem far more consistent with those of drug manufacturers than with those of retail pharmacies.  Some firms make large amounts of compounded drugs that are copies or near copies of FDA-approved, commercially available drugs. Other firms sell to physicians and patients with whom they have only a remote professional relationship."&lt;ref name="SpecialRisks"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm107836.htm |title= The Special Risks of Pharmacy Compounding | publisher= Food and Drug Administration |date= 2012-12-03 | accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the FDA has recently requested the following authority from Congress:&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF02/20130416/100668/HHRG-113-IF02-Wstate-HamburgM-20130416.pdf A Continuing Investigation into the Fungal Meningitis Outbreak and Whether It Could Have Been Prevented]. Statement of Margraret A. Hamburg, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs, April 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nontraditional compounding should, because of the higher risk presented, be subject to a greater degree of oversight. Sterile products produced in advance of or without a prescription and
shipped interstate should be subject to the highest level of controls, established by FDA and appropriate to the activity, similar to cGMP standards applicable to conventional drug manufacturers. In addition, FDA believes that with noted exceptions, certain products are not appropriate for compounding under any circumstances. These products would include: 1) what are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs, absent a shortage justification based on the drug appearing on FDA’s shortage list; and 2) complex dosage forms such as extended release products; transdermal patches; liposomal products; most biologics; and other products as designated by FDA. Producing complex dosage forms would require an approved application and compliance with cGMP standards, along with other requirements applicable to manufactured drug products."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement also went on to advocate certain auditing and testing powers, record-keeping and reporting obligations, etc. While the first part (regarding a lack of prior prescription) is indeed consistent with limiting compounding to its traditional domain of ''customization'', it would however be unprecedented for the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to regulate truly individualized drug products solely on the basis of their formulation's "complexity" (although Congress could preempt the states traditional role in this regard).  At the same time, this position statement does suggest perhaps some willingness by the FDA to embrace the occasional "non-traditional compounding" of ''copies'' of FDA-approved drug products – albeit with greater regulation – in cases of specified shortages.

Various ideas have been proposed to continue strengthening federal US regulation in this area, including new laws making it easier to identify misuse or misnomered-use&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-11-14/health/bs-hs-meningitis-hearing-20121114_1_meningitis-outbreak-massachusetts-facility-pharmacies Pikesville man joins push for drug oversight reform after meningitis outbreak – Baltimore Sun].

Species higher up in the food chain survive by consuming other species and can be classified by what they eat and how they obtain or find their food.

== Classification of consumer types ==

===The standard categorization===
Various terms have arisen to define consumers by what they eat, such as meat-eating [[carnivore]]s, fish-eating [[piscivore]]s, insect-eating [[insectivore]]s, plant-eating [[herbivore]]s, seed-eating [[granivores]], and fruit-eating [[frugivores]] and omnivores are meat eaters and plant eaters.  An extensive classification of consumer categories based on a list of [[feeding behaviors]] exists. 

===The Getz categorization===
[[File:ConsumerWikiPDiag.svg|thumb|upright=&lt;!--for legibility--&gt;1.6|Wayne Getz's consumer categories are based on material eaten (plant: green live, brown dead; animal: red live, purple dead; or particulate: grey) and feeding strategy (gatherer: lighter shades; miner: darker shades).&lt;ref name=Getz2011/&gt;]]

Another way of categorizing consumers, proposed by the American ecologist Wayne Getz, is based on a biomass transformation web (BTW) formulation that organizes resources into five components: live and dead animal, live and dead plant, and particulate (i.e. broken down plant and animal) matter.&lt;ref name=Getz2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Getz |first1=Wayne M. |title=Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer-resource modelling |journal=Ecology Letters |date=February 2011 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=113–124 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also distinguishes between consumers that gather their resources by moving across landscapes from those that mine their resources by becoming [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] once they have located a stock of resources large enough for them to feed on during completion of a full life history stage.

In Getz's scheme, words for miners are of Greek etymology and words for gatherers are of Latin etymology. Thus a bestivore, such as a cat, preys on live animals (Latin: bestia=animal) while a sarcophage, such as a [[botfly]] larva mines live flesh and a zontanophage (Greek: zontanos=alive), such as a leaf miner, mines live plant material.  A carcasivore (Latin: carcasium=carcass), such as white-backed vulture, scavenge animal carcasses while a necrophage (Greek: nekros=dead body), such as a [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]], mines dead flesh. Victivores (Latin: victus=living) gather live plant material and thus include frugivores, nectivores, graminivores, granivores and folivores as subcategories.  Lectivores, such as many termites, gather dead plant material (Latin: lectus=bed which is the root of the word litter, as in leaf-litter) and thanatophages (Greek: thanatos=death), such as [[pillbugs]] mine piles of dead plant material. Carnivore and herbivore are generic multigroup categories for gathers respectively of animal and plant material, irrespective of whether live or dead. Croppers, scavengers, and detritivores are gatherers respectively of live, dead, and particulate material. Parasites, saprophages, and decomposers are miners respectively of live, dead, and particulate material.&lt;ref name=Getz2011/&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Dermatomyositis''' ('''DM''') is a [[Chronic condition|long-term]] [[inflammatory disorder]] which affects [[muscles]].&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Its symptoms are generally a [[skin rash]] and worsening muscle weakness over time.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; These may occur suddenly or develop over months.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Other symptoms may include weight loss, fever, lung inflammation, or light sensitivity.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Complications may include [[calcinosis|calcium deposits in muscles or skin]].&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Theories include that it is an [[autoimmune disease]] or a result of a [[viral infection]].&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; It is a type of [[inflammatory myopathy]].&lt;ref name=GHR2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Dermatomyositis|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6263/dermatomyositis|website=GARD|accessdate=13 July 2017|language=en|date=2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705003213/https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6263/dermatomyositis|archivedate=5 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on some combination of symptoms, blood tests, [[electromyography]], and [[muscle biopsy|muscle biopsies]].&lt;ref name=NORD2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Dermatomyositis|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/dermatomyositis/|website=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|accessdate=13 July 2017|date=2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219083233/https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/dermatomyositis/|archivedate=19 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
While there is no cure for the condition, treatments generally improve symptoms.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Treatments may include medication, [[physical therapy]], exercise, heat therapy, [[orthotics]], and assistive devices, and rest.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Medications in the [[corticosteroids]] family are typically used with other agents like [[methotrexate]] or [[azathioprine]] recommended if steroids are not working well.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] may also improve outcomes.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Most people improve with treatment and in some the condition resolves completely.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
About 1 per 100,000 people per year are newly affected.&lt;ref name=NORD2015/&gt; The condition usually occurs in those in their 40s and 50s with women being affected more often than men.&lt;ref name=NORD2015/&gt; People of any age, however, may be affected.&lt;ref name=NORD2015/&gt; The condition was first described in the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dourmishev|first1=Lyubomir A.|last2=Dourmishev|first2=Assen Lyubenov|title=Dermatomyositis: Advances in Recognition, Understanding and Management|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540793137|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Wz4PoRqPhgC&amp;pg=PA5|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908192411/https://books.google.com/books?id=8Wz4PoRqPhgC&amp;pg=PA5|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main symptoms include several kinds of skin [[rash]] along with [[muscle weakness]] in both upper arms or thighs.&lt;ref name=Cal2006/&gt;

=== Skin ===
One form the rashes take is called "[[Heliotrope (color)|heliotrope]]" (a purplish color) or lilac, but may also be [[Erythema|red]]. It can occur around the eyes along with swelling, but also occurs on the upper chest or back what is called the "shawl" (around the neck) or "V-sign" above the breasts and may also occur on the face, upper arms, thighs, or hands.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callen|first=Jeffrey P.|date=2010-06-01|title=Cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis and their management|journal=Current Rheumatology Reports|volume=12|issue=3|pages=192–197|doi=10.1007/s11926-010-0100-7|issn=1534-6307|pmid=20425525}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another form the rash takes is called ''Gottron's sign'' which are red or violet, sometimes scaly, slightly raised [[papules]] that erupt on any of the finger joints (the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s or the [[Interphalangeal joints of the hand|interphalangeal joints]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn2016rev" /&gt; Gottron's papules may also be found over other bony prominences including the elbows, knees, or feet. All these rashes are [[Photosensitivity|made worse by exposure to sunlight]], and are often very itchy, painful, and may bleed.&lt;ref name="Kuhn2016rev" /&gt;

If a person exhibits only skin findings characteristic of DM, without weakness or abnormal muscle enzymes, then he or she may be experiencing amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM, formerly known as "dermatomyositis sine myositis".&lt;ref name="Callender2016rev" /&gt;

=== Muscles ===
People with DM experience progressively worsening muscle weakness in the [[proximal]] muscles (for example, the shoulders and thighs).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalakas|first=Marinos C.|date=2015-04-30|title=Inflammatory Muscle Diseases|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=18|pages=1734–1747|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1402225|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25923553|url=http://jdc.jefferson.edu/neurologyfp/89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks that use these muscles: standing from sitting, lifting, and climbing stairs, can become increasingly difficult for people with dermatomyositis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Other ===
Around 30% of people have swollen, painful joints, but this is generally mild.&lt;ref name="MerckMan2013" /&gt;

In some people the condition affects the lungs, and they may have a cough or difficulty breathing.  If the condition affects the heart, there may be [[arrhythmias]]. If it affects the blood vessels in the stomach or intestines, which is more common in juvenile DM, the person might [[Haematemesis|vomit blood]], have [[Melena|black tarry bowel movements]], or may develop a [[Gastrointestinal perforation|hole somewhere in their GI tract]].&lt;ref name="MerckMan2013" /&gt;

== Causes ==
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
The cause is unknown, but it may result from an initial viral infection or cancer, either of which could raise an [[autoimmune]] response.&lt;ref name=MerckMan2013/&gt;

Between 7 and 30% of dermatomyositis [[paraneoplastic phenomenon|arise from cancer]], probably as an [[autoimmune]] response.&lt;ref name=Di2014/&gt; The most common associated cancers are [[ovarian cancer]], [[breast cancer]], and [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name=Di2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Rollo|first1=D|last2=Abeni|first2=D|last3=Tracanna|first3=M|last4=Capo|first4=A|last5=Amerio|first5=P|title=Cancer risk in dermatomyositis: a systematic review of the literature.|journal=Giornale Italiano di Dermatologia e Venereologia : Organo Ufficiale, Societa Italiana di Dermatologia e Sifilografia|date=October 2014|volume=149|issue=5|pages=525–37|pmid=24975953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  18 to 25% of people with amyopathic DM also have cancer.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2016rev/&gt; Malignancy in association with dermatomyositis is more prevalent after age 60.

Some cases are inherited, and HLA subtypes [[HLA-DR3]], [[HLA-DR52]], and [[HLA-DR6]] seem to create a disposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis.&lt;ref name=MerckMan2013/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Dermatomyocitis.png|thumb|Calcification from dermatomyositis]]
[[File:XRaydermatomyositis.jpg|thumb|X-Ray of the knee in a person with dermatomyositis.]]
[[Image:Dermatomyositis - high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of dermatomyositis. [[Muscle biopsy]]. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
The diagnosis of dermatomyositis is based on five criteria which are also used to differentially diagnose with respect to [[polymyositis]]:&lt;ref name=Callender2016rev/&gt;

# Muscle weakness in both thighs or both upper arms
# Using a [[blood test]], finding higher levels of [[enzymes]] found in [[skeletal muscle]], including [[creatinine kinase]], [[aldolase]], as well as [[Aspartate transaminase|glutamate oxaloacetate]], [[Alanine transaminase|pyruvate transaminase]]s and [[lactate dehydrogenase]]
# Using [[Electromyography|testing of electric signalling in muscles]], finding all three of the following: erratic, repetitive high frequency signals; short, low energy signals between skeletal muscles and [[motor neurons]] that have multiple [[Phase (waves)|phases]]; and sharp activity when a needle is inserted into the muscle
# Examining a [[muscle biopsy]] under a microscope and finding [[agranulocyte|mononuclear white blood cells]] between the muscle cells, and finding abnormal muscle cell degeneration and regeneration, dying muscle cells, and muscle cells being consumed by other cells ([[phagocytosis]])
# [[Rash]]es typical of dermatomyositis, which include heliotrope rash, Gottron sign and Gottron papules

The fifth criterion is what differentiates dermatomyositis from polymyositis; the diagnosis is considered definite for dermatomyositis if three of items 1 through 4 are present in addition to 5, probable with any two in addition to 5, and possible if just one is present in addition to 5.&lt;ref name=Callender2016rev/&gt;

Dermatomyositis is associated with [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]], especially [[antinuclear antibodies]] (ANA).&lt;ref name=MerckMan2013/&gt;  Around 80% of people with DM test positive for ANA and around 30% of people have myositis-specific autoantibodies which include antibodies to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (anti-synthetase antibodies), including antibodies against [[histidine—tRNA ligase]] (also called Jo-1); antibodies to [[signal recognition particle]] (SRP); and [[anti-Mi-2 antibodies]].&lt;ref name=MerckMan2013/&gt;

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] may be useful to guide muscle biopsy and to investigate involvement of internal organs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=JP|last2=Marie|first2=I|last3=Jouen|first3=F|last4=Boyer|first4=O|last5=Martinet|first5=J|title=Autoimmune Myopathies: Where Do We Stand?|journal=Frontiers in Immunology|date=14 June 2016|volume=7|pages=234|pmid=27379096|pmc=4905946|doi=10.3389/fimmu.2016.00234}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[X-ray]] may be used to investigate joint involvement and [[calcification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramos-E-Silva|first1=M|last2=Lima Pinto|first2=AP|last3=Pirmez|first3=R|last4=Cuzzi|first4=T|last5=Carneiro|first5=S|title=Dermatomyositis-Part 2: Diagnosis, Association With Malignancy, and Treatment.|journal=Skinmed|date=1 October 2016|volume=14|issue=5|pages=354–358|pmid=27871347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A given case of dermatomyositis may be classified as amyopathic dermatomyositis if only skin is affected and there is no muscle weakness for longer than 6 months according to one 2016 review,&lt;ref name=Callender2016rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callander|first1=J|last2=Robson|first2=Y|last3=Ingram|first3=J|last4=Piguet|first4=V|title=Treatment of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis in adults: a systematic review.|journal=The British Journal of Dermatology|date=11 May 2016|doi=10.1111/bjd.14726|pmid=27167896}}&lt;/ref&gt; or two years according to another.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2016rev/&gt;

===Classification===
Dermatomyositis is a form of systemic connective tissue disorder, a class of diseases that often involve [[autoimmune]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=MerckMan2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hajj-ali|first1=Rula A.|title=Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis - Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/musculoskeletal-and-connective-tissue-disorders/autoimmune-rheumatic-disorders/polymyositis-and-dermatomyositis|publisher=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|date=June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012015400/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/musculoskeletal-and-connective-tissue-disorders/autoimmune-rheumatic-disorders/polymyositis-and-dermatomyositis|archivedate=12 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICD-10 Systemic connective tissue disorders (M30-M36)|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/M30-M36|publisher=WHO|accessdate=9 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208033519/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/M30-M36|archivedate=8 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been classified as an idiopathic [[inflammatory myopathy]] along with polymyositis, necrotizing autoimmune myositis, cancer-associated [[myositis]], and sporadic [[inclusion body myositis]].&lt;ref name=Cardiac2016rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danieli|first1=MG|last2=Gelardi|first2=C|last3=Guerra|first3=F|last4=Cardinaletti|first4=P|last5=Pedini|first5=V|last6=Gabrielli|first6=A|title=Cardiac involvement in polymyositis and dermatomyositis.|journal=Autoimmunity Reviews|date=May 2016|volume=15|issue=5|pages=462–5|doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2016.01.015|pmid=26826433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a form of this disorder that strikes children, known as [[juvenile dermatomyositis]] (JDM).&lt;ref name="pmid18586175"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feldman BM, Rider LG, Reed AM, Pachman LM |title=Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies of childhood |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9631 |pages=2201–2212 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18586175 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60955-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(08)60955-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for dermatomyositis, but the symptoms can be treated.  Options include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy (including microwave and ultrasound), orthotics and assistive devices, and rest.  The standard treatment for dermatomyositis is a [[corticosteroid]] drug, given either in pill form or intravenously.  Immunosuppressant drugs, such as [[azathioprine]] and [[methotrexate]], may reduce inflammation in people who do not respond well to [[prednisone]].  Periodic treatment using [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] can also improve recovery.  Other immunosuppressive agents used to treat the inflammation associated with dermatomyositis include [[cyclosporine A]], [[cyclophosphamide]], and [[tacrolimus]].  Physical therapy is usually recommended to prevent muscle atrophy and to regain muscle strength and range of motion.  Many individuals with dermatomyositis may need a topical ointment, such as topical corticosteroids, for their skin disorder.  They should wear a high-protection sunscreen and protective clothing.  Surgery may be required to remove calcium deposits that cause nerve pain and recurrent infections.&lt;ref name=NINDSinfo2015/&gt;

[[Antimalarial]] medications, especially [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[chloroquine]], are used to treat the rashes, as they are in similar conditions.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2016rev/&gt;

[[Rituximab]] is used when people don't respond to other treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malik|first1=A|last2=Hayat|first2=G|last3=Kalia|first3=JS|last4=Guzman|first4=MA|title=Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies: Clinical Approach and Management.|journal=Frontiers in Neurology|date=20 May 2016|volume=7|pages=64|pmid=27242652|pmc=4873503|doi=10.3389/fneur.2016.00064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=NA|last2=Vleugels|first2=RA|last3=Callen|first3=JP|title=Cutaneous dermatomyositis in the era of biologicals.|journal=Seminars in Immunopathology|date=January 2016|volume=38|issue=1|pages=113–21|doi=10.1007/s00281-015-0543-z|pmid=26563285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, treatments for amyopathic dermatomyositis in adults did not have a strong evidence base; published treatments included antimalarial medications, [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]], taken or orally or [[topical steroids|applied to the skin]], [[calcineurin inhibitors]] applied to the skin, [[dapsone]], [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG), [[methotrexate]], [[azathioprine]], and [[mycophenolate mofetil]].   None appear to be very effective but among them, IVIG has had the best outcomes.&lt;ref name=Callender2016rev/&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Before the advent of modern treatments such as [[prednisone]], [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], [[plasmapheresis]], [[chemotherapies]], and other drugs, the prognosis was poor.&lt;ref name=squid57squid&gt;Page 285 in: Thomson and Cotton ''Lecture Notes in Pathology'', Blackwell Scientific. Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis may or may not improve with therapy in parallel with the improvement of the myositis. In some people, the weakness and rash resolve together. In others, the two are not linked, with one or the other being more challenging to control. Often, cutaneous disease persists after adequate control of the muscle disease.{{mcn|date=December 2016}}

The risk of death from the condition is much higher if the heart or lungs are affected.&lt;ref name=Cardiac2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NINDSinfo2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Dermatomyositis Information|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dermatomyositis/dermatomyositis.htm|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|date=July 27, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202230955/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dermatomyositis/dermatomyositis.htm|archivedate=2 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disability in China''' is common, and according to the [[United Nations]], approximately 83 million people in [[China]] are estimated to have a [[disability]].&lt;ref name=UN2007&gt;{{Citation |year=2007 |title=United Nations Enable: Development and Human Rights for All |publisher=United Nations Enable |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=255 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Of the total number of disabled individuals, men account for 42.77&amp;nbsp;million (51.55%) and women account for 40.19&amp;nbsp;million (48.45%), making the gender ratio 106.42 disabled men for every 100 disabled women. Furthermore, 20.71&amp;nbsp;million (25.96%) individuals of the disabled community reside in [[urban areas]], whereas 62.25&amp;nbsp;million (75.04%) in [[rural areas]].&lt;ref name=ILO2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on People with Disabilities|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/---ilo-beijing/documents/publication/wcms_142315.pdf|website=International Labour Organization|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[China Disabled Persons' Federation]], approximately 12.33&amp;nbsp;million (14.86%) people have [[visual disabilities]], 20.04&amp;nbsp;million (24.16%) have a [[hearing loss|hearing disability]], 1.27&amp;nbsp;million (1.53%) have a [[speech disorder|speech disability]], 24.12&amp;nbsp;million (29.07%) have a [[physical disability]], 5.54&amp;nbsp;million (6.68%) have an [[intellectual disability]], 6.14&amp;nbsp;million (7.40%) have a [[developmental disability|mental disability]], and 13.52&amp;nbsp;million (16.30%) have multiple disabilities.&lt;ref name=CDPF1&gt;{{cite web|title=Communique on Major Statistics of the Second China National Sample Survey on Disability|url=http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/contactus/content/2008-04/14/content_84989.htm|website=China Disabled Persons' Federation|accessdate=12 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141013223328/http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/contactus/content/2008-04/14/content_84989.htm|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

===Prevalence of disability===
There are currently only two published national sample surveys on disability conducted in China. The First National Sample Survey on Disability was published in 1987, and the Second was published in 2006. Over the past 19 years, there has been an increase in the total number of disabled individuals and in the proportion of disabled people to the total population.&lt;ref name="CDPF1"/&gt;

Using the data from the two surveys, researchers found that the crude disability rate increased 1.5% from 1987 (4.89%) to 2006 (6.39%).&lt;ref name=AGE2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=Xiaoxia|last2=Song|first2=Shige|title=Ageing, the Urban-Rural Gap and Disability Trends: 19 Years of Experience in China - 1987 to 2006|journal=PLoS ONE|date=13 August 2010|volume=5|issue=8|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012129|accessdate=10 October 2014|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012129|pmid=20730089|pages=e12129|bibcode=2010PLoSO...512129P|pmc=2921329}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once the data was adjusted to accommodate modified age structures and the change in [[population pyramid]] with the higher proportion of elderly in 2006, the adjusted disability rate increased by 0.5% over the time period.&lt;ref name=WHO2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Xiaoying|last2=Chen|first2=Gong|last3=Song|first3=Xinming|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/11/11-089730.pdf|title=Twenty-year trends in the prevalence of disability in China|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=14 July 2011|volume=89|issue=11|pages=788–797|accessdate=27 February 2015|doi=10.2471/BLT.11.089730|pmid=22084524|pmc=3209727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the frequency of visual, hearing, speech, physical, and intellectual disabilities did not depend on sex or place of residence (urban vs. rural) over time, there was an increase of mental disability across males, females, and rural residents that did not occur among urban inhabitants.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;

===Language===
There has been a shift in the language used to describe individuals with disabilities, reflecting a gradual increase in social acceptance of disabilities in China. Historically, the general term for people with disabilities was "can fei" (残废), which means "[[crippled]] and useless". Currently, the widely used term is "can ji" (残疾), which means "deformed", although the China Disabled Persons' Federation is advocating the use of "can zhang" (残障), which means "incomplete and obstructed", as a more neutral term. However, many derogatory terms are still utilized in common vernacular to describe people with disabilities, such as "sha zi" (傻子), which means idiot.&lt;ref name=BBC2005&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hallett|first1=Stephen|title=One eye on China: Challenging disability|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/features/one-eye-on-china-challenging.shtml|accessdate=10 October 2014|publisher=BBC|date=6 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
The Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Disabled Persons (1990) states that "a disabled person refers to one who suffers from abnormalities or loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and who has lost wholly or in part the ability to engage in activities in a normal way."&lt;ref name=NPC1990&gt;{{cite constitution |article=2 |section=1 |country=China |language=English |ratified=28 December 1990 |url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/12/content_1383889.htm |accessdate=11 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes individuals with "visual, hearing, speech or physical disabilities, mental retardation, mental disorder, multiple disabilities and/or other disabilities."&lt;ref name=NPC1990/&gt; The Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Disabled Persons upholds the rights of individuals with disabilities in regards to employment opportunities, educational access, legal liability, and sufficient care.&lt;ref name=NPC1990/&gt;

===Protection===
Enacted in 1982 (and later amended), the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] ensured protection for individuals with disabilities: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to material assistance from the State and society when they are old, ill or disabled. The State develops social insurance, social relief and medical and health services that are required for citizens this right… The State and society help make arrangement for the work, livelihood and education of the blind, deaf-mutes, and other handicapped citizens."&lt;ref name=NPC1982&gt;{{cite constitution |article=45 |section= |country=China |language=English |ratified=14 March 2004 |url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Constitution/2007-11/15/content_1372964.htm |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Regulations on the Employment of People with Disabilities promoted the employment of disabled individuals and safeguarded against their discrimination. It stated that the proportion of disabled employees should be at least 1.5%, although the number differed between [[provinces]]. Failure to meet this proportion would result in a fee to the employment security fund for disabled persons.&lt;ref name=CDPF2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations on the Employment of Persons with Disabilities|url=http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/lawsdoc/content/2008-04/10/content_84888.htm|publisher=China Disabled Persons' Federation|accessdate=10 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141013222826/http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/lawsdoc/content/2008-04/10/content_84888.htm|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 1986, the Compulsory Education Law mandated that every child is given the right to nine years of free [[public education]]: six years of [[elementary school]] and three years of [[secondary school]].&lt;ref name=EIU2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kritzer|first1=Jeffrey B.|url=http://castle.eiu.edu/edjournal/Spring_2011/Special_education_China.pdf|title=Special Education in China|journal=Eastern Education Journal|date=Spring 2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=57–63|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities aimed to promote access to education for individuals with disabilities, although according to Human Rights Watch, it "failed to make adequate progress on mainstreaming children with disabilities into regular schools as required by international law."&lt;ref name=HRW2013&gt;{{cite news|title=China: End Discrimination, Exclusion of Children With Disabilities|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/15/china-end-discrimination-exclusion-children-disabilities|accessdate=12 October 2014|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was signed in China and outlined increased educational opportunity for children who had disabilities. The Convention emphasizes a human rights approach to disability and asserts that "inclusive education" is a fundamental human right.&lt;ref name=MAKINGGOOD2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hernandez|first1=Vanessa Torres|url=https://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/557/17PacRimLPolyJ497.pdf|title=Making Good on the Promise of International Law: The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Inclusive Education in China and India|journal=Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Journal Association|date=2008|volume=17|page=497|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
In 1990, the Law on the Protection of the Disabled Persons stated that families and the community share the responsibility for taking care of individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref name=EIU2011/&gt;

In 1999, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) conducted an official [[mental health]] seminar with the Chinese government after which the government pledged to "improve their leadership for and support of mental health care, strengthen inter-sectoral collaboration and cooperation, establish a mental health strategy and action plan, facilitate the enactment of a national mental health law, and protect patients' rights."&lt;ref name=NCBI2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Jin|last2=Ma|first2=Hong|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188776/pdf/wpa030210.pdf|title=Mental health system in China: history, recent service reform and future challenges|journal=World Psychiatry|date=October 2011|volume=10|issue=3|pages=210–216|accessdate=27 February 2015|pmc=3188776|pmid=21991281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the first National Mental Health Plan (2002-2010) was signed by the Ministries of Health, Public Security, and Civil Affairs and China Disabled Persons' Federation. The aims were: "a) establishing an effective system of mental health care led by the government with the participation and cooperation of other sectors; b) acceleration the process of mental health legislation development and implementation; c) improving the knowledge and raising the awareness of mental health among all citizens; d) strengthening mental health services to decrease burden and disability; and e) developing human resources for mental health services and enhancing the capacity of current psychiatric hospitals."&lt;ref name=NCBI2011/&gt;

In 2004, the Proposal on Further Strengthening Mental Health Word was passed and it explicitly outlines means of intervention for psychological issues, treatment for mental disorders, and protecting the rights of disabled individuals. It currently serves as the "de facto [[Mental health in China|Chinese mental health national policy]]."&lt;ref name=NCBI2011/&gt;

In 2012, the Mental Health Law standardized mental health services, required hospitals to have services for counseling, and protected people from being treated against their will in psychiatric wards.&lt;ref name=ILO2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusion of People with Disabilities in China|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_112380.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the 5th National Five Year World Program for People with Disabilities (2005-2010) aimed to improve the [[accessibility]] of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in [[Beijing]] and increase convenience for individuals with disabilities in "100 barrier free model cities".&lt;ref name=WORLD2011&gt;{{cite web|title=National and Regional Strategic Plans on Disability|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1327953883745/National_Disability_Plans_Feb_2013.docx|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main article|Education for disabled people in China}}
Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the government has provided special education services, and the first schools for the blind and deaf were founded at this time. In 1980, the first training for special education teachers was started. In the 1990s, courses on special education were mandatory offerings in teacher training schools.&lt;ref name=EIU2011/&gt;
The majority (75.04%) of individuals with disabilities live in rural areas&lt;ref name=ILO2007/&gt; and it is difficult to access funds for these areas. Thus, the "Learning in the Regular Classroom" model, which integrates children with disabilities in classroom with children without disabilities, has become more popular and in 2003, approximately 67% of individuals with disabilities are in such schools.&lt;ref name=EIU2011/&gt; However, students with disabilities have been "observed sitting alone, isolated from classroom activities, or have even remained at home, despite the fact that their names are on the registration list."&lt;ref name=EIU2011/&gt; Additionally, teachers in rural areas were not generally trained to teach students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=NCEE&gt;{{cite web|title=Instructional Systems|url=http://www.ncee.org/programs-affiliates/center-on-international-education-benchmarking/top-performing-countries/shanghai-china/shanghai-china-instructional-systems/|publisher=Center on International Education Benchmarking|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vocational education]] for children with disabilities is limited to "painting for students with hearing impairment, massage and weaving for students with visual impairments, and sewing for those with mental retardation."&lt;ref name=EIU2011/&gt;

Presently, there are special schools set aside for children with disabilities. According to the China Disabled Persons' Federation, in 2009, there were 1,697 special schools for blind, deaf and intellectually disabled children. There were also 2,801 special classes in public schools. In total, 545,000 students are enrolled in special education.&lt;ref name=CDPF2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical Communique on the Development of the Work for Persons with Disabilities in 2009|url=http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/statistics/content/2008-04/10/content_84890.htm|website=China Disabled Persons' Federation|accessdate=24 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141125145635/http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/statistics/content/2008-04/10/content_84890.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Families with children with disabilities face unique circumstances in raising their children. Parents have reported experiencing blatantly discriminatory behavior from outsiders due to their child's disability. Furthermore, public schools have been known to not accept children with disabilities, thus denying them the opportunity to access their right to education.&lt;ref name=Parent&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCabe|first1=Helen|title=Parent Advocacy in the Face of Adversity: Autism and Families in the People's Republic of China|journal=Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities|date=Spring 2007|volume=22|issue=1|pages= 39–50|doi=10.1177/10883576070220010501}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more expensive to raise children with disabilities compared to children without, and the annual cost burden varied across types of disabilities: around 6,400 RMB more for children with a mental disability, around 16,500 RMB for children with a physical disability, and around 20,000 more RMB for children with autism.&lt;ref name=Investigate&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xiong|first1=Nina|title=Investigation of raising burden of children with autism, physical disability and mental disability in China|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|date=2011|volume=32|issue=1|pages=306–311|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study shows that families with disabled children spend more money on medical and caring costs and less money on education, clothing, and amusement costs when compared with families without children with disabilities.&lt;ref name=Parent /&gt; Parents of children with disabilities also report high levels of stress due to meeting the daily needs of their child, interacting with the rest of society, and dealing with pessimism.&lt;ref name=Stress&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Day|first1=M.S.|last2=Michaels|first2=C.A.|last3=Wang|first3=P.|url=http://www.qc.cuny.edu/Academics/Degrees/Education/Documents/Stress%20and%20Coping%20final%20version.pdf|title=Stresses and coping strategies of Chinese families with children with Autism and other developmental disabilities|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=2011|volume=41|issue=6|pages=783–795|accessdate=27 February 2015|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1099-3|pmid=20859670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
Traditionally, disabled individuals in China were discriminated against and did not have access to assistance.

===Deng Pufang===
The 1980s and 1990s were a period of disability reform as the United Nations took an international stand on this topic. According to the [[College of William and Mary]], "these preliminary efforts in turn were advanced by support from Deng Pufang."&lt;ref name=LAW2006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2185&amp;context=facpubs |title=Book Review of Bodies of Difference: Experiences of Disability and Institutional Advocacy in the Making of Modern China |last1=Stein |first1=Michael Ashley |last2=Stein |first2=Penelope J.S. |date=2006 |publisher=William &amp; Mary Law School Scholarship Repository|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deng Pufang]] is the son of [[Deng Xiaoping]], who is credited for implementing the [[Chinese economic reform]] to raise the living standards of individuals and reduce poverty in China.&lt;ref name=ECON2000&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yao |first=Shujie |date=April 2000 |title=Economic Development and Poverty Reduction in China over 20 Years of Reforms |jstor=10.1086/452606|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change |publisher=University of Chicago Press |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=447–474 |doi=10.1086/452606}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Deng Pufang was detained by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] because his father was considered to be a political critic of Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]. After months of abuse and interrogation, "Deng attempted suicide by throwing himself out of a third-story window."&lt;ref name=BODIES&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohrman |first=Matthew |date=2005 |title=Bodies of Difference: Experiences of Disability and Institutional Advocacy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP-BTvvXzbEC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=deng+pufang+red+guards#v=onepage&amp;q=deng%20pufang%20window&amp;f=false |location=Oakland |publisher=University of California Press |pages=45–46 |isbn=9780520226456 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the fall did not kill him, he became [[paraplegic]] and relied on a wheelchair for mobility.

However, due to his family's position of power, in 1988, Deng Pufang was able to advance the agenda for disabled individuals with the formation of the quasi-governmental organization, [[China Disabled Persons' Federation]]. He stated, "My work has certainly been made more convenient as a consequence of my father. One of the most important ways has been that, whenever I've asked to meet with high-ranking officials, they've met with me. Whereas an average disabled person would not get an audience, I've been able to. That had to do with my father."&lt;ref name=BODIES/&gt;

China has been one of the most successful nations at the [[Paralympic Games]] has it topped the Paralympics medal table from the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]].China has a medal tally of over 1000 at Paralympics history.

====2008 Summer Paralympics====
The [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] were hosted in [[Beijing]], China. Through this event, China modified existing infrastructure to be more convenient for individuals with disabilities, such as adding wheelchair lifts at subway stations, which was a part of a broader shift in attitude to be more accepting of individuals with disabilities. According to Qian Zhiling, professor of special education at [[Beijing Normal University]], "Thanks to the Paralympics, the Chinese public are now actively learning about disabled people, rather than, as previously, being horrified by and rejecting them. I think the impact will be long term: the public has realized they are able to do things and have rights just as everyone else does."&lt;ref name = GUARDIAN2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Branigan |first1=Tania |last2 = Rourke| first2 = Alison| date=21 May 2012 |title=Paralympic Games: London needs to learn from Beijing and Sydney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/21/paralympic-games-london-beijing-sydney |newspaper=The Guardian |location=Beijing and Sydney |accessdate=10 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10936">'''Countess Dorothea of Mansfeld''' (1493–8 June 1578){{r|Mansfelder Blätter 1911}} was a German noblewoman and healer. She was well known around Germany for her medical recipes, mentorship, and generosity towards people of all social classes.

== Early life and family ==
Dorothea of Mansfeld was a noblewoman, and one of the most famous female healers in Germany.{{r|Rankin 2013}} She was born around 1493 and died in 1578. She was one of twelve children born to [[Philip, Count of Solms-Lich|Count Philip of Solms-Lich]] and Adriana of Hanua Munzenberg. Dorothea's passion for medicine was influenced by her elder brother, Count Reinhard I of Solms-Lich, who was educated in medicine. Many of her family members were medical healers. This included her daughter (Dorothea of Schönberg), her niece (Anna of Hohenlohe), her daughter-in-law (Agnes of Solms), and her niece by marriage (Agnes of Solms).{{r|Rankin 2007}} Dorothea married in 1512 to [[Ernest II, Count of Mansfeld-Vorderort|Count Ernst II of Mansfeld-Vorderort]]{{r|Luther2012}} and had thirteen children. She became a widow at the age of 38 in 1531.{{r|Krumhaar 1869}} Dorothea lived in the [[Mansfeld Castle]] with most of her family and children.{{r|Schloss Mansfeld}} While there, she possessed a well-stocked apothecary, a distilling house, and full garden of herbs and plants for her various recipes.{{r|Rankin 2007}} The Mansfeld castle is located in Saxony-Anha, Germany. Before her move to Saxony, her location, much like information on her early life, is unknown. Most documentation on the Mansfeld region before the 19th century has been lost.

== Medical practice ==

Dorothea was commonly known for her selfless service to people of all social classes.{{r|Rankin 2007}} The most important aspect of her medical care was her altruistic acts of kindness towards the poor. She was a very charitable healer and her medical recipes were known to heal thousands of people from near and far.{{r|Rankin 2007}} Despite being a widow, and therefore economically unstable, she used her healing abilities to heal both rich and poor people. She gave many gifts, and would often perform medical healing as an act of charity.{{r|Rankin 2013}} With a humanist upbringing by her father, she learned to create relationships with noble people of both Catholic and Protestant background, she was also supportive to the Jewish community that tried to make a home in the Mansfeld area.{{r|teWOE}}

It was expected for noblewomen to have basic medical knowledge in order to provide assistance to anyone living on their estates.{{r|Rankin 2007}} However, Dorothea extensively researched medical practices, and developed a knowledge that surpassed these narrow expectations.{{r|Rankin 2007}} Her work gained fame when she was almost 80 years old. Many of Dorothea's recipes were referenced in medical recipe books, and her medical advice was sought out by many German princes and noblemen.{{r|Rankin 2013}} Her most prized recipes were for two types of [[aqua vitae]] a white and a yellow version.{{r|Rankin 2007}}  Both were strong alcoholic beverages, the yellow slightly sweeter. These drinks were very popular because they could be used to treat multiple ailments. These recipes made use of distilled water, which was a popular medical treatment for the elite. The distillation process for any medicine took long periods of time from months to years. Dorothea was one of the earliest to create a distilling house on her property, and after her example many noblewomen followed.{{r|Rankin 2007}} These distilleries were not only present on private properties but also at churches, monasteries, and other public locations. The garden at the Mansfeld castle grew many of the common ingredients that Dorothea used for her recipes such as herbs, flowers, fruits, and other plants.{{r|Rankin 2007}}

== Sample recipe ==

Dorothea’s recipe books and any other copied works of hers were treasured not only because of her medical knowledge, but also because she had uniquely beautiful penmanship.  The act of making books during this time period is described as a painstakingly long process that was done with patience, money, and practice.{{r|zU6iP}} To write a book an author must have the time and resources to obtain all necessary supplies.

Example recipe: Plague treatment recipes [Summer 1572]{{r|Rankin 2012}}
* 2 handfuls chopped licorice
* 2 handfuls senna leaves
* 1 handful hart’s tongue
* 1 handful spike lavender
* 2 good handfuls bog bean flowers, very good for this illness
* 2 handfuls pulverized juniper berries
* 1 handful scurvy weed
* 1 handful yellow lily root, chopped finely
* 1 handful gray cress
* 1 handful mint
* 1 handful sage leaves and one-half mab honey
* 1 handful hyssop

== Relationships ==

Dorothea's relationship with [[Anna of Saxony]] was a noteworthy partnership. The two elite women are commonly known for their extensive experimentation with medical remedies {{r|Rankin 2007}} Letters reveal this close relationship, and highlight that the two women in addition to creating medical recipes together, practiced other skills and visited often {{r|Rankin 2007}} [[Anna of Saxony]] was the wife of a politician, and this relationship helped Dorothea financial situation immensely.{{r|Rankin 2007}} Dorothea acted as a mentor and assistant to Anna, in turn Anna helped Dorothea’s recipes live on by passing them on to her children and sharing them long after Dorothea's death. Both noblewomen possessed their own personal distillation houses and gardens in which they grew the necessary herbs to create their medical remedies.{{r|Rankin 2007}}

Dorothea's medical facility was very impressive at the time, and deserving of a detailed description in a book by Cyriacus Spangenber {{r|Spangenber 1578}} Spangenber talked highly of Dorothea's garden, library, and heavily stocked apothecary.{{r|Spangenber 1578}} Many of Dorothea's recipes were referenced in medical recipe books and she extended her medical expertise to German princes and other male medical professionals.{{r|Rankin 2013}} Additionally, [[Anna of Saxony]] notes that Dorothea passed her medical knowledge on to a small group of female medical healers that included Dorothea of Schönberg, Anna of Hohenlohe, Agnes of Solms, and Magdlena of Mansfeld {{r|Rankin 2007}} This group of women commonly visited Mansfeld Castle and referred to Dorothea as the "mother of Mansfeld"{{r|Rankin 2007}} Medicine was often viewed as a feminine practice, therefore creating medical recipes was an acceptable activity for these noblewomen.{{r|Rankin 2007}}

Another noteworthy relationship Dorothea had was with [http://www.history.com/topics/martin-luther-and-the-95-theses Martin Luther]. [[Martin Luther]] had the best care available to him, yet he sought out the medical advice of Dorothea.{{r|Rankin 2013}} By the time of her death, her medical practices were widely known throughout Germany.

The '''Gaza Community Mental Health Programme''' ('''GCMHP''') is the leading [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] non-governmental organization which provides mental health services to the inhabitants of the [[Gaza Strip]]. The organization's stated purpose is committed to aid women, children, and victims of violence, torture, and human rights violations. The organization has over 135 employees, is involved with 18 international, regional and local coalitions and networks, and has treated over 20,000 clients.&lt;ref&gt;Gaza Community Mental Health Programme brochure 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

GCMHP was founded in 1990 by [[Eyad al-Sarraj]]. The head office is located in the [[Sheikh Ijlin|Sheikh Ejleen]] neighborhood, across from the Gaza Municipality Beach Club. In 2008, the premises were damaged by Israeli shelling of a nearby Palestinian police station,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grassrootsonline.org/news/blog/grassroots-grantee-gaza-community-mental-health-program-damaged-attacks Grassroots Grantee Gaza Community Mental Health Program Damaged in Attacks | Grassroots International]. Grassrootsonline.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; forcing  GCMHP to relocate temporarily to the Gaza Community Center.

GCMHP's vision is to secure a Palestinian society that respects human rights and in which people are able to live in freedom and with dignity.

==Community mental health==
GCMHP runs three community centers in [[Gaza City]], [[Deir al-Balah]] and [[Khan Younis]]. The community centers offer psychotherapy for referred cases, rehabilitation, occupational therapy, EEG scans, physiotherapy, intelligence testing and crisis intervention.

GCMHP research has shown that Palestinian children have developed feelings of hostility, anger, fear and frustration which has led to an increase of violence among school students.&lt;ref name=Qoutarelations&gt;Qouta S., Punamaki R., El-Sarraj E. (1995) [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a782379351 The relations between traumatic experiences, activity, and cognitive and emotional responses among palestinian children]. ''[[International Journal of Psychology]]''
Volume 30, Issue 3, 1995, 289 – 304&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, GCMHP has implemented a school mediation program which aims to reduce the level of violence and to educate children in peaceful conflict resolution techniques. The programme also trains school counselors, teachers and parents in mediation techniques.

GCMHP is active in the organization of psychosocially oriented summer camps for children, as well as recreational trips throughout the year.

GCMHP enables Palestinian patients to receive medical treatment abroad by coordinating with Israeli associations that work in the human rights field.  The organization also offers free telephone counseling.

==Education==
GCMHP offers a postgraduate diploma in Community Mental Health and Human Rights, as well as a diploma in Counseling and Psychological Support. Graduates of the diploma are equipped to facilitate the provision of mental health services in Gaza.

==Publications==
In addition to a number of awareness-raising brochures and leaflets, GCMHP publishes a bimonthly magazine called 'Amwaj'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcmhp.org/AmwajList.aspx?years=2011 Amwaj Magazines]. GCMHP (2010-09-28). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine focuses on mental health issues and is distributed to local organizations in the Gaza strip.

==Research==
The Research Department is the first specialized center for research and documentation in the field of mental health in the Gaza Strip. The department has conducted over 68 research studies examining trauma and a variety of psychosocial phenomena. Research papers published in international journals include "The Relations between Traumatic Experiences, Activity, and Cognitive and Emotional Responses Among Palestinian Children,"&lt;ref name=Qoutarelations/&gt; "Relationships between Traumatic Events, Children's Gender, and Political Activity, and Perceptions of Parenting Styles,"&lt;ref&gt;Punamaki R., Qouta S., El-Sarraj E. (1997); Relationships between Traumatic Events, Children's Gender, and Political Activity, and Perceptions of Parenting Styles, ''International Journal of Behavioral Development'',27 (1), 91–109.&lt;/ref&gt; "Home Demolition and Mental Health: Victims and Witnesses,"&lt;ref&gt;Qouta S., Punamaki R., El-Sarraj E. (1997) ''Journal of Social Distress and the Homeless'', 1997, 6 (3), 203–211&lt;/ref&gt; and "Mental Health of Palestinian Women."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabpsynet.com/Associations/GCMHP.ass.htm Arabpsynet Associations – GCMHP]. Arabpsynet.com (2000-09-28). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
GCMHP is funded by a consortium of overseas donors including the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]], the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, the [[Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims]] – Denmark (RCT), and the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA). There are also a number of other non-consortium donors including the Gaza Mental Health Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazamentalhealth.org/ Gaza Mental Health Foundation website]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in the USA in 2001 and Grassroots International (http://www.GrassrootsOnline.org), founded in 1983.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12275">'''Health in Angola''' is rated among the worst in the world. Only a fraction of the population receives even rudimentary medical attention.

From 1975 to 1992, there were 300,000 civil war-related deaths. The overall death rate was estimated at 240 per 1,000 in 2002. 

The HIV/AIDS prevalence was 3.90 per 100 adults in 2003. As of 2004, there were approximately 240,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in the country. There were an estimated 521,000 deaths from AIDS in 2003. 

==Health infrastructure==
USAID has reported that the Angolan government has not had much success in developing an effective health care system since the end of the 27-year-long [[Angolan Civil War]] in 2002. According to USAID, during the War as many as 1 million people were killed, 4.5 million people became internally displaced, and 450,000 fled the country as refugees.&lt;ref name="USAID Background"&gt;http://www.usaid.gov/ao/about.html. Accessed April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Due to lack of infrastructure and rapid urbanization, the government has been unable to promote programs that effectively address some of the basic needs of the people. Health care, specifically, is not available for many of the people in the country.&lt;ref name="USAID Background" /&gt;

Some improvements have been made regarding the health care system in Angola since the end of the Civil War. However, many problems continue to exist. According to UNICEF reports in 2005, 2 percent of the nation's public expenditures were allotted to health care. That number has increased since 2005. Larger problems include the shortage of doctors, the destruction of health care facilities throughout the country, and disparities between rural and urban primary care availability.&lt;ref name="WHO health action in Crisis, Angola"&gt;http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/angola_54038.html. Accessed April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Census data reported by the [[CIA]] reveals that Angola has very few physicians to attend to the medical needs of its population. It is estimated that there are about 0.08 physicians per 1,000 people in Angola.&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html. CIA Factbook] April 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  
Due to the length of the Angolan Civil War, nearly an entire generation of Angolans was not given the opportunity to receive any education. This has led to a dramatic decrease of health workers and added to the poor maternal health problem. In response to the shortage of health workers, Cuban physicians are currently working in the country to improve health overall, as well as to focus on improving maternal health.&lt;ref name="Unicef TV"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA1SnN4N_zo. Accessed 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The health care system has felt the social effects of the War. Due to the large number of people who were unable to receive an education during the War, today, educated medical personnel, administrators, and other needed positions in the governmental system are not able to be filled. The population of Angola has lost nearly an entire generation of educated personnel. This education gap has repercussions that have been felt throughout the society and especially in the health field.

As of 2012, 54% of the population had access to an improved water source and 60% had access to improved/shared sanitation.

In September 2014, the Angolan Institute for Cancer Control (IACC) was created by presidential decree, and it will integrate the National Health Service in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/273191/novo-instituto-oncologico-de-angola-quer-ser-referencia-em-africa Novo instituto oncológico de Angola quer ser referência em África], Notícias ao Minuto (Source: Lusa Agency), September 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this new center is to ensure the health and medical care in [[oncology]], policy implementation, programs and plans for prevention and specialized treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=728577 Novo instituto oncológico de Angola quer ser referência em África], Diário Digital (Source: Lusa Agency), September 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This cancer institute will be assumed as a reference institution in the central and southern regions of [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verangola.net/Artigos/Novo-instituto-oncologico-angolano-quer-ser-instituicao-de-referencia-no-continente=004333 Novo instituto oncológico angolano quer ser instituição de referência no continente], Ver Angola, September 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endemic diseases ===
[[Angola]] lies in the [[yellow fever]] endemic zone. [[Cholera]] incidence is low.

==== Malaria ====
Malaria in Angola is very prevalent in the northern part of the country due to the climate and appears more seasonally in the south. The majority of the population lives in the northern areas, in cities such as Lunada. Malaria is a huge concern for maternal health, contributing about 25 percent of the total maternal mortality alone. In 2009, [[UNICEF]], [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth|NMCP]], [[WHO]], and other organizations partnered together in an effort to reduce the malaria burden.&lt;ref name="AngolaMalaria"&gt;USAID. Angola Malaria Report. President's Malaria Initiative. Angola. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the President of the United States Obama announced the [[Global Health Initiatives]]. One of these Initiatives includes the Malaria Operational Plan, which is a program that allocates funds to be used in order to improve health in Angola and other African countries afflicted with malaria. In Angola, the Malaria Operational Plan was implemented to decrease the number of women suffering from malaria and improve maternal health. Angola was one of the first countries to receive aid and to have programs implemented to reduce the risk of malaria, as well as increase the number of healthy pregnancies.&lt;ref name="AngolaMalaria" /&gt;

===Infectious diseases===
Due to Angola's location, the climate is ideal for many tropical diseases. Angola has a narrow coastal plain that rises into a high plateau in the country's interior. Rain forests are prevalent in the north, and in the south, the land is dry. The CIA reports that [[malaria]] and [[schistosomiasis]] are prevalent in the country.&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook"/&gt;

These diseases and others, such as tuberculosis and especially HIV/Aids, increase the complications and dangers faced by women during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Kathryn. Introduction to Global Health. Jones and Bartlett Publishers,2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of [[tuberculosis]] in 1999 was 271 per 100,000 people.

In 2014, [[Angola]] launched a national vaccination campaign against [[measles]], extended to every child under ten years old in all 18 provinces in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201410010149.html Over 30,000 Children Vaccinated Against Measles in Huíla], All Africa, September 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The measure is part of the Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Measles 2014–2020 created by the Angolan Ministry of Health which includes strengthening routine immunization, proper dealing with measles cases, national campaigns, introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national routine vaccination calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles. This campaign took place together with the vaccination against [[polio]] and [[vitamin A]] supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/277391/angola-lanca-vacinacao-nacional-contra-sarampo Angola lança vacinação nacional contra sarampo], Notícias ao Minuto (Source: Lusa Agency), September 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS in Angola===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Angola}}

[[Angola]] has a large [[HIV/AIDS]] infected population. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ([[UNAIDS]]) estimated adult prevalence at the end of 2003 at 3.9% – over 420,000 infected people. Angola's 27-year [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] (1975–2002), deterred the spread of HIV by making large portions of the country inaccessible. Angola was thus cut off from most contact with neighboring countries that had higher HIV infection rates. With the end of the war, transportation routes and communication are reopening, therefore enabling a greater potential for the spread of HIV/AIDS. Current statistics indicate that the border provinces, especially certain areas bordering [[Namibia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], currently have higher prevalence than the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/angola_04.pdf "Health Profile: Angola"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816141649/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/angola_04.pdf |date=2008-08-16 }}. [[USAID]] (December 2004). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unhealthy individuals and populations pose a higher risk of infections when exposed to pathogens. Sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, are no exception to this rule. Stillwaggon states that many of the populations in Sub-Saharan Africa have a high prevalence of malnutrition, malaria, parasite infections, and schistosomiasis. These health conditions increase an individual's susceptibility of contracting HIV/AIDS. In that region, social conditions also play a major role in HIV transmission.  Poverty, inadequate nutrition, unclean water, poor sanitation, and unsafe health care all play a major role in the prevalence of AIDS.&lt;ref name="Stillwaggon"&gt;Stillwaggon, Eileen. Feminist Economics. Race, Sex, and the Neglected Risks for Women and Girls in Sub-Sahara Africa. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal health===
{{Main|Maternal health in Angola}}

Angola represents one of the highest maternal death rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Kathryn. Introduction to Global Health. Jones and Bartlett Publishers,2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Results vary, but the estimated maternal mortality ratio (MMR) toward the end of the Civil War was between 1,281-1,500 maternal deaths to 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="Pettersson"&gt;Pettersson, Karne. Christensson, Kyllike. Freitas, Engracia da Gloria Gomes de. Johansson, Eva. Adaptation of health care seeking behavior during childbirth: Focus group discussions with women living in the suburban areas of Luanda, Angola. Health Care for Women International, 2004. Accessed April 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the improvements that have been made, the [[Human Development Index]] for 2011 shows a poor level of maternal health in Angola. A high level of adolescent fertility and low use of contraceptives for women of all ages was reported. This is observed by the high [[total fertility rate]]. These factors contribute to an elevated risk of health problems during pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;ref name="Development Report 2011"&gt;Human Development Report 2011 Tables. Human development statistical annex&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the [[infant mortality]] was estimated at 187.49 per 1,000 live births, the highest in the world.  Immunization rates for one-year-old children in 1999 were estimated at 22% for [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], and [[tetanus]] and 46% for [[measles]]. Malnutrition affected an estimated 53% of children under five years of age as of 1989.

[[Image:Indonesian midwives.jpg|thumb|right|Newly certified midwives in [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]]]

==Healthcare provision==
According to data from the [[Ministry of Health (Indonesia)|Ministry of Health of Indonesia]], there are 2454 hospitals around the country, with a total of 305,242 beds - a very low figure of 0.9 bed per 1,000 inhabitants. Most hospitals are in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sirs.buk.depkes.go.id/rsonline/report/report_by_catrs.php RI Health Department Official Site]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wb&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.BEDS.ZS Worldbank]&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, 882 of these hospitals are government owned and 1509 are private hospitals. According to the Worldbank data in 2012, there are 0.2 [[physician]]s per 1,000 people, with 1.2 Nurses and Midwives per 1,000 people in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=wb/&gt; Out of all the 2454 hospitals in Indonesia, 20 have been accredited by Joint Commission international (JCI) as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/about-jci/jci-accredited-organizations/?c=Indonesia JCI Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are 9718 government financed [[Puskesmas]] (Health Community Centre) listed by the [[Ministry of Health (Indonesia)|Ministry of Health of Indonesia]], which provide comprehensive healthcare and vaccination for the population in the sub-district level. Both traditional and modern health practices are employed.  

[[Indonesia]]'s [[community health]] system are organised in three tiers: on top of the chart is [[Puskesmas|Community Health Centre]] (Puskesmas), followed by Health Sub-Centres on the second level, and Village-Level Integrated Posts at the third level.&lt;ref&gt;http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/57.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal Health Coverage==
In 2010, an estimated 56 percent of Indonesians, mainly state employees, low-income earners, and those with private coverage had some form of health insurance. The rate is expected to reach 100 percent by 2019, following the implementation of a system of universal social health insurance coverage that was launched in 2014. The aim is to grant free services for all hospitalisations in basic (class-3 hospital beds).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/02/analysis-indonesia-the-health-nation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare provision in Indonesia has traditionally been fragmented, with private insurance provision for those able to pay for it alongside basic public coverage for the poorest in society and [[NGO]]s working in specialised areas providing services to those not covered by public or private schemes. In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), a scheme to implement [[universal health care]] in Indonesia.   It is expected that spending on healthcare will increase by 12% a year and reach US$46 billion a year by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under JKN, all Indonesians will receive coverage for a range of treatments via health services from public providers as well as those private organisations that have opted to join the scheme. The formally employed pay a premium worth five percent of their salary, with one percent being paid by the employee and four percent being paid by their employer. Informal workers and the self-employed pay a fixed monthly premium of between 25,500 and 59,500 [[Indonesian rupiah|IDR]] (£1.34-£3.12). However, the scheme has been criticised for being over-ambitious, a lack of competency in administration, and a failure to address the need for improving healthcare infrastructure in remote areas. An official for the programme's administering organisation, the social security agency Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial Kesehatan, has stated that JKN exceeded its target for enrolling members in its first year (registering 133.4 million members compared to a target of 121.6 million) and that, according to an independent survey, the customer satisfaction rate was 81 percent, awareness of JKN was 95 percent, and that complaints had been resolved within one and a half days on average. JKN is expected to be implemented in stages. When the initial stages came into effect in January 2014, 48% of the country's population became covered. As of April 2018, the scheme had 195 million enrollees (75% of the population). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/04/06/qa-bpjs-kesehatan-health-for-all-indonesians.html|title=Q&amp;A BPJS Kesehatan, health for all Indonesians |last=Hereyanto |first=Devina |date=7 April 2018|website=[[thejakartapost.com]] |access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that the entire population will be covered in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/may/15/indonesias-universal-healthcare-insurance-verdict |title=Indonesia's universal health scheme: one year on, what's the verdict? |last=Razavi |first=Lauren |author-link=Lauren Razavi |date=15 May 2015|website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2014/0310/Indonesia-launches-world-s-largest-health-insurance-system&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental health policy in Indonesia was most recently revised in 2001. Since then, the nation has gone through enormous changes in all aspects as a country. Indonesia’s economy has been steadily growing in the past decade. Health wise, Indonesia has suffered numerous H5N1 outbreaks, with the highest number of recorded human cases of this virus in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Adisasmito, W. et al (2013). “Human Influenza A H5N1 in Indonesia: Health Care Service-Associated Delays in Treatment Initiation.” BMC Public Health, 13, 571. Doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-13-571&lt;/ref&gt; The nation was severely affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami tragedy in 2004]]. There are still many factors that have altered Indonesians’ lives, ultimately affecting the mental health status of the people greatly since 2001, calling for a more updated mental health policy.

There is very little amount of funding dedicated to mental health. The total health expenditure is 2.36%, and less than 1% of that goes towards mental health.&lt;ref name="WHO Mental Health Atlas 2011"/&gt; Indonesia’s mental health legislation has the same issues mentioned above that Southeast Asia faces as a region. The legislation is far from what can be considered complete and fair, and the articles included are not well practised and reinforced. In 1966, Indonesia was well ahead of other countries in the region by having a mental health law separated from general health laws, providing potentials for expansion of the mental health system. However, the law was repealed in 1993 and integrated into general health laws.&lt;ref&gt;Pols, H. (2006). “The Development of Psychiatry in Indonesia: From Colonial to Modern Times”. [[International Review of Psychiatry]], 18(4), 363-370&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health now only occupies four articles in the current health law.&lt;ref name="Irmansyah, I. 2009"&gt;Irmansyah, I., Prasetyo, Y.A. &amp; Minas, H. (2009). “Human Rights of Persons with Mental Illness in Indonesia: More than Legislation is Needed.” International Journal of Mental Health Systems. 3, 14. Doi: 10.1186/1752-4458-3-14&lt;/ref&gt; The articles are too general, causing difficulties to apply and implement. Article 26 states that almost anybody can request treatment and hospitalisation for persons with mental disorder, yet has no mention of the person's consent. By doing so, Article 26 creates an impression that mentally ill individuals are generally considered dangerous to the community because they need to be forced into treatment.&lt;ref name="Irmansyah, I. 2009"/&gt; This goes along with the negative stigmas associated with mental disorders mentioned above and elaborated later in this paper. Also, Article 27 states that the government will provide a presidential decree for regulations and management of mental health, yet nothing has been done.&lt;ref name="Irmansyah, I. 2009"/&gt;

There are also issues with accessibility and quality of mental health care. Official in-service training is not widely provided to the primary care professionals. WHO (2011) reports that between 2006 and 2011, the majority of primary care doctors and nurses have not received such training. There is also only one mental health hospital per five million people and one psychiatrist working in the mental health sector in ten million people.&lt;ref name="WHO Mental Health Atlas 2011"/&gt; In addition to the unbalanced number of psychiatrists among population, the psychiatrists are also not well distributed in the country. Up until 2011, there were no psychiatrists in the rural area of Indonesia, while half of them are concentrated in the capital city, Jakarta, and the rest in the old capital city, Yogyakarta, and the second largest city, Surabaya.&lt;ref&gt;Dipa, Arya (2011). “Indonesia Lacks Psychiatrists”. The Jakarta Post. Retrieved from http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/10/indonesia-lacks-psychiatrists.html on 9 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a great barrier for mental health patients seeking official help.

'''Hunter B. Shirley''' (December 25, 1927 – November 1, 2010) born '''Hunter Barentine Shirley''', was a longtime licensed clinical [[psychologist]] and a former Associate Professor at [[Wisconsin State University]] where he headed a psychological research laboratory devoted to evaluating the world's first analog model of the mind. He was most recently the Director of the International Division of the American Institute of Applied Behavioral Research and Human Relations Training. Formerly Director of Behavior Analysis, Inc. of St. Louis subsequently he was director of the Counseling and Testing Center at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], and later served as the Chief Clinical Psychologist of the Lafayette Institute of Behavior Therapy and Crisis Management. Author of a number of books, including the trail-blazing book ''Mapping the Mind'', and the popular self-help book ''Your Mind May Be Programmed Against You!''. He is credited with having developed the most sophisticated model of the [[human mind]] currently in existence. With offices in Staré Splavy near Prague,  Shirley was in charge of a "Think tank" performing behavioral science research for NGOs and government agencies. His final work ''The Human Mind: A Guided Tour'', a comprehensive compilation of his theories on the emotional system and the human mind developed over a lifetime of clinical and field studies, is in the final phases of editing in preparation for publication. This book includes over 300 diagrams of the emotional system based on a cybernetics approach as he first presented in his book ''Mapping The Mind'' and in numerous published articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">'''Karadaiyan Nonbu''' is a festival of special moment to married women across [[South India]]. It is celebrated on the first day of Pisces in the southern calendar as it represents the fish like shape of the eyes of Goddess [[Parvati]]. Her Birthday falls on the same day.

==History==
They worship Goddess Gowri and pray for longevity and well-being of husbands. Women try to echo the devotion and love shown by Savitri for her husband Satyavan. Married women fast that day. Before the auspicious time Women put Kolam before their pooja room, take bath and do the ceremony.They prepare a bhog made out of rice powder and jaggery and offer it to Goddess.Savitri's bakthi towards Goddess Gowri gave her the strength and wisdom to win back her Husband's life from Yama, the Lord of death. She won the battle not by arms or ammunition, but by her clever arguments.When Yama asked her to seek boons, she prayed for a thousand sons.After he agreed, Savitri sought the life of her dead Husband back to fulfill this wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arun|first1=Sharma|title=Karva Chauth for South India today|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Karva-Chauth-for-South-India-today/articleshow/5681088.cms|accessdate=15 March 2018|ref=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation of ada==

'''Linda May Bartoshuk''' (born 1938)&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt; is an American psychologist. She is a Presidential Endowed Professor of Community [[Dentistry]] and [[Behavioural sciences|Behavioral Science]] at the [[University of Florida]].  She is an internationally known researcher specializing in the chemical senses of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]].

==Biography==
Bartoshuk grew up in [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=NAS /&gt; She received her B.A. from [[Carleton College]] and her PhD from [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name=ERIC&gt;{{cite web|title=On Blue Tongues, Undergraduates, and Science: An Interview With Linda M.

Her research explores the [[genetic variations]] in taste perception and how taste perception affects overall health. Bartoshuk was the first to discover that [[burning mouth syndrome]], a condition predominantly experienced by postmenopausal women, is caused by damage to the [[taste buds]] at the front of the [[tongue]] and is not a [[Psychosomatic Disorder|psychosomatic condition]].

==Pes anserinus==
A mnemonic to remember the muscles that contribute tendons to the [[Pes anserinus (leg)|pes anserinus]] and the innervations of these muscles is SGT FOT (sergeant FOT)
*S- '''S'''artorius 
*G- '''G'''racilis 
*T- semi'''T'''endinosus  (from anterior to posterior). 
*F- [[femoral nerve]] 
*O- [[obturator nerve]] 
*T- tibial division of the [[sciatic nerve]]. 
Notice the order of the muscles (S, G, T) follows the order of the innervating nerves which correspond to those muscles (F, O, T){{cit|date=February 2015}}

==Femoral triangle==
The [[femoral triangle]] is shaped like the sail of a sailing ship and hence its boundaries can be remembered using the mnemonic, "'''SAIL'''":
*'''S'''artorius
*'''A'''dductor longus
*'''I'''nguinal '''L'''igament.&lt;ref name="LHC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/389/femoral-triangle-boundaries | title = Medical mnemonics | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order of structures in the femoral triangle is important in the embalming of bodies, as the femoral artery is often exposed and used to pump embalming fluids into the body. The order of this neurovascular bundle can be remembered using the mnemonic, "'''NAVY'''":
*'''N'''erve
*'''A'''rtery
*'''V'''ein
*[[briefs#History|'''Y''' -fronts]] (the British term of a style of men's underwear with a "Y" shaped front that acts as a fly). The "Y" is midline (corresponding with the penis) and the mnemonic always reads from lateral to medial (in other words, the [[Femoral Nerve]] is always lateral). 

An alternate to this mnemonic is "'''NAVEL'''" for '''N'''erve, '''A'''rtery, '''V'''ein, '''E'''mpty Space and '''L'''ymph, to include the [[deep inguinal lymph nodes]] located medial to the [[Femoral vein]].{{cit|date=February 2015}}

*'''A: '''artery (popliteal artery) 
*'''V: '''vein (popliteal vein) 
*'''N: '''nerve (tibial nerve) 
*'''B: '''biceps femoris  (superior lateral border).  The lateral and medial heads of gastrocnemius form the inferior border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/popliteal-fossa-anatomy-mnemonic|title=Popliteal fossa anatomy (mnemonic) {{!}} Radiology Reference Article {{!}} Radiopaedia.org|last=Niknejad|first=Mohammad Taghi|website=radiopaedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cranial nerves==

==Extraocular muscles==
A good mnemonic to remember which muscles are innervated by what nerve is to paraphrase it as a molecular equation: LR&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/cgi-bin/lookup.cfm?id1=572|work= Medicalmnemonics.com|title=Extraocular muscles cranial nerve innervation|first=Atul |last=Sing|date=August 22, 2000|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''L'''ateral '''R'''ectus - Cranial Nerve '''VI'''
* '''S'''uperior '''O'''blique - Cranial Nerve '''IV'''
* the '''R'''est of the muscles - Cranial Nerve '''III'''

Another way to remember which nerves innervate which muscles is to understand the meaning behind all the Latin words.
* The ''fourth cranial nerve'', the trochlear, is so named because the muscle it innervates, the superior oblique, runs through a little fascial pulley that changes its direction of pull (the [[trochlea of superior oblique]]). This pulley exists in the superiomedial corner of each orbit, and "trochl-" is Latin for "pulley."
* The ''sixth cranial nerve'', the ''abducens'', is so named because it controls the lateral rectus, which abducts the eye (rotates it laterally) upon contraction.
* The ''third cranial nerve'', the ''oculomotor'', is so named because it is in charge of the movement (motor) of the eye (oculo-). It controls all the other muscles.

*'''E''' – ELECTROLYTE balance
*'''T''' – TOXIN removal
*'''B''' – BLOOD Pressure control
*'''E''' – making ERYTHROPOIETIN
*'''D''' – Vitamin D metabolism

==Lateral geniculate nucleus==
A simple mnemonic for remembering {{clarify span|this|date=September 2018}} is "See I? I see, I see," with "see" representing the C in "contralateral," and "I" representing the I in "ipsilateral." Another is "Emily and Pete meet eye to eye" as in "M and P meet I to I," or again, Magno and Parvo meet Ipsi to Ipsi.

Another way of remembering {{clarify span|this|date=September 2018}} is 2+3=5, which is correct, so ipsilateral side, and 1+4 doesn't equal 6, so contralateral.

The '''Living Human Project''' ('''LHP''') is a project that begun in 2002 to develop a distributed repository of anatomo-functional data and simulation algorithms for the human [[musculoskeletal]] apparatus used to create the [[physiome]] of the human musculoskeletal system. In 2006 the BEL was merged with Biomed Town, a Internet community for those who have a professional interest in biomedical research.

==Living Human Digital Library==
The LHDL project was ended in January 2009, and soon after the LHDL consortium released a biomedical data management and sharing service called ''Physiome Space''. Physiome Space lets individual researchers as well as for large consortia to share with their peers large collections of biomedical data, including medical imaging and computer simulations.

In the [[United States]], the use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for medical purposes is legal in 33 states, plus the territories of [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], as of November 2018.&lt;ref name="ncsl states"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourteen other states have more restrictive laws limiting [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] content, for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis.&lt;ref name="ncsl states" /&gt;  There is considerable variation in medical cannabis laws from state to state, including how it is produced and distributed, how it can be consumed, and what medical conditions it can be used for.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws"&gt;{{citation|title=State-By-State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws-report/|publisher=Marijuana Policy Project|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state to effectively legalize medical cannabis was [[California]] in 1996, when voters approved [[Proposition 215]] by a 56–44 margin.  Several states followed with successful ballot initiatives in 1998, and in 2000 [[Hawaii]] became the first to legalize through an act of state legislature.&lt;ref name="ProCon timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Marijuana as Medicine - 2900 BC to Present|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.timeline.php?timelineID=000026|website=ProCon.org|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2016, legalization of medical cannabis had spread to a majority of states.

At the federal level, cannabis remains a prohibited substance by way of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970.  Under the CSA, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug, determined to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use – thereby prohibiting its use for any purpose.  The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] has enforced this policy through various means, including criminal prosecutions, [[Civil forfeiture in the United States|civil asset forfeiture]], and [[Militarization of police|paramilitary-style]] raids targeting medical cannabis providers, and various penalties threatened or initiated against other individuals involved in state-legal medical cannabis activities (doctors, landlords, state officials and employees).&lt;ref name="ASA WTC"&gt;{{citation|title=What's the Cost? -- The Federal War on Patients|url=https://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/WhatsTheCost.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2017|publisher=Americans for Safe Access|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, however, the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] was signed into law, prohibiting the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws.&lt;ref name="Sullum Rohrabacher"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=The Federal Ban on Medical Marijuana Was Not Lifted|url=http://reason.com/archives/2016/01/04/the-federal-ban-on-medical-marijuana-was|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=Reason|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public support for allowing the medical use of cannabis has remained strong since [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] first polled the subject in 1999, finding 73% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal Drugs|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1657/illegal-drugs.aspx|website=Gallup|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An August 2017 [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute|Quinnipiac]] poll found national support at 94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Washburn|first1=Polly|title=Public support for medical and recreational marijuana legalization hits all-time high|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/08/08/marijuana-legalization-opinion-poll-americans/85562/|accessdate=November 19, 2017|work=The Cannabist|date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early medical use in the U.S.==
The medical use of cannabis dates back thousands of years, to ancient China, India, and Egypt.&lt;ref name="ProCon timeline" /&gt;  It was popularized in Western medicine by the Irish physician [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]], who was introduced to the drug in the 1830s while living abroad in India.&lt;ref name="NAP 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mack|first1=Alison|last2=Joy|first2=Janet|title=Marijuana As Medicine?: The Science Beyond the Controversy|date=2001|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-06531-3|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/9586/chapter/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Shaughnessy documented a number of medical applications for cannabis from the experiments he conducted, noting in particular its [[analgesic]] and [[anticonvulsant]] effects.&lt;ref name="Booth history" /&gt;  He returned to England with a supply of cannabis in 1842, after which its use as medicine quickly spread throughout Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history"&gt;{{citation|last1=Grinspoon|first1=Lester|title=History of Cannabis as a Medicine|date=August 16, 2005|url=http://www.maps.org/research-archive/mmj/grinspoon_history_cannabis_medicine.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old bottle of Parke Davis cannabis pills 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Cannabis pills sold by Parke, Davis &amp; Co.]]
Cannabis was entered into the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] in 1850, as a treatment for [[neuralgia]], [[tetanus]], [[typhus]], [[cholera]], [[rabies]], [[dysentery]], [[alcoholism]], [[Opioid use disorder|opiate addiction]], [[anthrax]], [[leprosy]], [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[snakebite]], [[gout]], [[Convulsion|convulsive disorders]], [[tonsillitis]], [[insanity]], [[menorrhagia|excessive menstrual bleeding]], and [[Vaginal bleeding|uterine bleeding]].&lt;ref name="Booth history" /&gt;  It was widely available in pharmacies and even grocery stores during the latter half of the 19th century, priced affordably relative to other drugs with no requirement for a doctor's prescription.&lt;ref name="Booth history"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Martin|title=Cannabis: A History|date=June 2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42494-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannabis was commonly sold in [[tincture]] form by [[Parke-Davis]], [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons]], and other drug manufacturers.&lt;ref name="MMJ Law"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boire|first1=Richard Glen|last2=Feeney|first2=Kevin|title=Medical Marijuana Law|date=January 26, 2007|publisher=Ronin Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1Tw_UFU2XEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, the use of cannabis in medicine had declined due to a number of factors, including difficulty in controlling dosages and the rise in popularity of synthetic and opium-derived drugs.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;  The advent of the hypodermic syringe also allowed these drugs to be injected for immediate effect, in contrast to cannabis which is not water-soluble and therefore cannot be injected.&lt;ref name="MMJ Law" /&gt;  Additionally, as fears regarding the [[Recreational drug use|recreational use]] of cannabis began to take hold (prompted by [[Yellow journalism|sensationalist media reports]] and [[Propaganda in the United States|government propaganda campaigns]]),&lt;ref name="Booth history" /&gt; states began passing legislation to restrict the sale and possession of cannabis, eliminating its availability as an [[over-the-counter drug]].&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;  By 1936, every state had passed a law of this manner.&lt;ref name="Booth history" /&gt;

The use of cannabis as medicine further declined with the passage of the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]].  The purpose of the act was to prohibit all non-medical use of cannabis in the U.S.; however, it also had the effect of severely curtailing medical use of the drug, due to new fees and regulatory requirements put in place that imposed a significant burden on doctors prescribing cannabis.&lt;ref name="Pacula"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacula|first1=Rosalie Piccardo|title=State Medical Marijuana Laws: Understanding the Laws and Their Limitations|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|date=February 2002|doi=10.2307/3343240|url=http://impacteen.uic.edu/generalarea_PDFs/medicalmarijuanapaper100301.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the [[American Medical Association]] opposed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, but to no avail.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;  Cannabis was removed from the U.S. Pharmacopeia in 1941, at the urging of famed anti-cannabis crusader [[Harry J. Anslinger|Harry Anslinger]].&lt;ref name="MMJ Law" /&gt;

During the 1960s, as large numbers of people began to use cannabis recreationally, the medical utility of cannabis was rediscovered by some as anecdotes began to appear about its effectiveness in treating a variety of medical conditions.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;  It was officially banned for even medical use, however, following the passage of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in 1970.  Despite the strict federal prohibition in place, cannabis continued to gain renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, in particular due to the testimonials of cancer and AIDS patients who reported significant relief from the effects of [[chemotherapy]] and [[Cachexia|wasting syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Joy|first1=Janet E.|last2=Watson|first2=Stanley J.|last3=Benson|first3=John A.|title=Marijuana and Medicine -- Assessing the Science Base|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/IOM_Report.pdf|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The smoking method of consumption –  popularized by recreational users of the drug – offered particular aid to patients who had trouble keeping down oral medication (without vomiting), and also offered advantages in terms of rapid [[onset of action]] and the ability to more carefully control dosages.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;

==Federal policy==
===Controlled Substances Act===
On October 27, 1970, the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]] was signed into law by [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]].  Title II of the act – the [[Controlled Substances Act]] – established a system under which all controlled substances are categorized, varying from Schedule I (the strictest classification) to Schedule V (the least strict).  Cannabis was placed in the Schedule I category, assumed to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use – thereby prohibiting its use for any purpose.&lt;ref name="CRS report"&gt;{{citation|last1=Eddy|first1=Mark|title=Medical Marijuana: Review and Analysis of Federal and State Policies|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/MedicalMarjiuanaStatePolicies040210.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This placement was intended only as a temporary measure, however, pending the results of a commission formed under decree of the CSA to study the dangers of cannabis.&lt;ref name="MMJ Law" /&gt;  Formally known as the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, the [[Shafer Commission]] – led by former Pennsylvania governor [[Raymond P. Shafer]] – determined in its March 1972 report to the President and Congress that the societal harms caused by cannabis were limited, and recommended removal of criminal penalties for possession and distribution of small amounts of the drug.&lt;ref name="AlterNet Nixon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeese|first1=Kevin|title=Once-Secret "Nixon Tapes" Show Why the U.S. Outlawed Pot|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/12666/once-secret_%22nixon_tapes%22_show_why_the_u.s._outlawed_pot|accessdate=May 16, 2017|work=AlterNet|date=March 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the report did not specifically address the scheduling of cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=How Nixon Destroyed the Evidence on Marijuana|url=https://www.marijuana.com/news/2014/08/richard-nixon-was-the-marijuana-antichrist/|accessdate=May 16, 2017|work=marijuana.com|date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not contain any findings that supported continued placement in the Schedule I category, and members of the commission acknowledged that cannabis did not meet the Schedule I criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armento|first1=Paul|title=40 Years Ago Today: Congress Was Told To Tell The Truth About Marijuana; They Didn’t|url=http://blog.norml.org/2012/03/22/40-years-ago-today-congress-was-told-to-tell-the-truth-about-marijuana-they-didnt/|accessdate=May 16, 2017|work=NORML|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was of no consequence, however, as President Nixon firmly rejected the findings of the commission, and no action was taken to move cannabis into a less restrictive category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Patrick|title=High In America: The True Story Behind NORML And The Politics Of Marijuana|date=February 27, 1981|publisher=The Viking Press|isbn=978-0670119905|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/special/anderson/highinamerica.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I]] classification of cannabis remains in place today, alongside other drugs such as [[heroin]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[MDMA]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[peyote]] – none of which can be prescribed.  [[List of Schedule II drugs (US)|Schedule II drugs]] – determined to have a high potential for abuse but also some accepted medical use (thus able to be prescribed) – include [[cocaine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[methamphetamine]], [[oxycodone]], and [[fentanyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DRUG SCHEDULING|url=https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml|website=dea.gov|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEA sched pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Controlled Substances|url=https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf|website=usdoj.gov|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescheduling efforts===
Since enactment of the Controlled Substances Act, there have been a number of efforts seeking to have cannabis [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|placed in a less restrictive category]], but none have succeeded.  The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] is granted authority under the CSA to change the classification of any drug, based upon the recommendation of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] which evaluates all drugs for safety and efficacy.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;  As recently as 2016, the FDA has determined that cannabis has "no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States", in response to a petition filed with the DEA in 2011 by the governors of Washington and Rhode Island.&lt;ref name="NPR rescheduling"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Carrie|title=DEA Rejects Attempt To Loosen Federal Restrictions On Marijuana|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/08/10/489509471/dea-rejects-attempt-to-loosen-federal-restrictions-on-marijuana|accessdate=April 15, 2017|work=NPR|date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous efforts to petition the DEA for rescheduling have also been unsuccessful, spanning the years 1972–1994, 1995–2001, and 2002–2013.&lt;ref name="DPA decades" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookings war" /&gt;  Congressional attempts to reschedule have failed as well, including a 1981 bill introduced by Reps.

The classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug was first challenged by the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML) in a 1972 petition to the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] (which was merged with other agencies to form the DEA in 1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeese|first1=Kevin|title=History of medical marijuana policy in US|journal=International Journal of Drug Policy|date=September 1, 1999|volume=10|issue=4|doi=10.1016/S0955-3959(99)00031-6|url=http://documentslide.com/documents/history-of-medical-marijuana-policy-in-us.html|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a decade of legal battles in which the DEA refused to consider the petition, public hearings were finally held on the matter beginning in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Medical Use Introduction|url=http://norml.org/pdf_files/NORML_medical_use_introduction.pdf|work=NORML|date=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1988, after two years of extensive public hearings,&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt; DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young ruled in favor of moving cannabis to a Schedule II classification, finding that "Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man."&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;  Young concluded: "The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision. It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for [the] DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this record."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Young|first1=Francis L.|title=Opinion and Recommended Ruling, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision of Administrative Law Judge -- In the Matter of: Marijuana Rescheduling Petition|url=https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/Young1988.pdf|publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration|date=September 6, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Young's ruling was only a non-binding recommendation, however, it was rejected by DEA Administrator [[John C. Lawn|John Lawn]] in December 1989.&lt;ref name="MMJ Law" /&gt;  In February 1994, a final ruling on the original 1972 petition was issued when a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision to keep cannabis a Schedule I drug.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;

===Compassionate IND program===
Despite an official policy denying the medical value of cannabis, the federal government began providing the drug to a limited number of patients through the [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug program]] in 1978.  The program was created following a lawsuit filed by [[Robert C. Randall|Robert Randall]], a Washington, D.C. resident who was arrested for cultivating cannabis in 1975.&lt;ref name="PITC"&gt;{{citation|title=Patients in the Crossfire|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/crossfire.pdf|publisher=American for Safe Access|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing the [[glaucoma]] that threatened to take his eyesight, Randall employed a [[medical necessity]] defense at trial to justify his use of cannabis.&lt;ref name="PITC" /&gt;  The charges against Randall were dismissed, and as a result of an ensuing petition filed with the FDA, Randall became the first person to receive cannabis from the federal government in 1976.&lt;ref name="PITC" /&gt;  After his supply was cut off in 1978, he filed a lawsuit to have it restored,&lt;ref name="PITC" /&gt; setting in motion the creation of the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Coning|first1=Lexi|title=Irvin Rosenfeld: Meet the Longest-Surviving U.S. Federal Marijuana Patient|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/irvin-rosenfeld-meet-the-longest-surviving-us-federal-marijuana-patient|accessdate=May 17, 2017|work=MassRoots|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program allowed patients with serious medical conditions to receive a regular supply of cannabis from the federal government; however, only 13 patients ended up participating due to the very complicated and drawn-out application process involved.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;

The Compassionate IND program was closed to new patients in 1992, due to a flood of new applications from AIDS patients and concerns that the program undercut [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush administration]] efforts to discourage illegal drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. to halt distributing 'pot' to ill|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19910619&amp;id=6PkhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9KIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4370,3236411&amp;hl=en|work=The Washington Post|date=June 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James O. Mason]], the head of [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]], explained that keeping the program in place created the perception that "this stuff can't be so bad", and noted that AIDS patients provided with cannabis would be more likely to engage in unsafe sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Martin A.|title=Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana – Medical, Recreational, and Scientific|date=August 2012|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1439102602|url=https://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Signals-Marijuana-Recreational-Scientific/dp/1439102600}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-eight applications that had recently been approved were rescinded, and only the 13 patients who were already receiving cannabis were allowed to do so moving forward.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;  As of 2016, most of the original 13 patients had perished, but at least two were still known to be receiving cannabis from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rabinski|first1=Gooey|title=U.S. Government Supplies Free Medical Cannabis to Select Patients|url=https://www.massroots.com/news/government-provides-medical-cannabis|accessdate=April 22, 2017|work=MassRoots|date=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal enforcement===
====Clinton administration====
Concurrent with the re-election of [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] in November 1996, California voters approved [[Proposition 215]] to legalize the medical use of cannabis, and a similar (but ultimately ineffective) measure was passed in Arizona.  In response, the Clinton administration reiterated its firm opposition to the medical use of cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=20 Years Ago Today: Clinton’s Response to California’s Legalization of Medical Marijuana|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/12/30/20-years-ago-today-clintons-response-to-californias-legalization-of-medical-marijuana/|accessdate=August 19, 2017|work=CounterPunch|date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threatened to revoke the prescription-writing abilities of doctors who recommend or prescribe the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=David G.|last2=Warren|first2=Jennifer|title=U.S. Threatens Penalties if Doctors Prescribe Pot|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-31/news/mn-14152_1_medical-marijuana-initiative|accessdate=August 19, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, threats were made to criminally prosecute physicians, and ban them from participating in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Plan Attacks Medical Marijuana Initiatives, Targets Doctors|url=http://norml.org/news/1997/01/02/clinton-plan-attacks-medical-marijuana-initiatives-targets-doctors|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=NORML|date=January 2, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of physicians challenged this policy as a violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, and in September 2000 prevailed in the case ''[[Conant v. McCaffrey]]'', which affirmed the right of physicians to recommend (but not prescribe) cannabis.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;  Prior to the ruling, an April 1997 [[preliminary injunction]] prevented the administration from taking these actions.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;

Apart from the threatened crackdown on physicians, the administration conducted raids on a number of medical cannabis providers, leading to the filing of civil and criminal charges.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt;  At trial, prosecutors were set to easily secure convictions, as jurors could not be informed that the cannabis was for medical use authorized under state law.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt;  Drug czar [[Barry McCaffrey]] also railed strongly against the medical use of cannabis – deriding it as "[[Cheech &amp; Chong]] medicine" – and worked behind closed doors to coordinate a media campaign to sway public opinion against approving further initiatives.&lt;ref name="Salon McCaffrey" /&gt;

====Bush administration====
Despite previously speaking in support of [[states' rights]] on the issue of medical cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Spencer S.|title=Bush: Marijuana Laws Up to States|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/bush102299.htm|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=October 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] escalated efforts to enforce federal law during his 8 years in office, with more than 260 raids conducted and 84 individuals prosecuted by his administration.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt;  Heavy use of [[paramilitary]] tactics and gear was common in execution of the raids, along with the frequent use of [[Civil forfeiture in the United States|civil forfeiture]], allowing cash and property to be seized without need for criminal conviction.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt; In 2007, the administration began targeting landlords renting to medical cannabis facilities, informing property owners that they faced up to 20 years in prison for violating the "crack house statute" of the CSA, in addition to seizure of their properties.&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;  Drug czar [[John P. Walters]] was particularly active in opposing the medical use of cannabis, campaigning against initiatives in a number of states in what medical cannabis advocates charged was an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars and a violation of the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPP Files Complaints Charging Drug Czar Violated Election Laws|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/266/violation.shtml|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Drug War Chronicle|publisher=StoptheDrugWar.org|date=December 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Bush's second term, in June 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the federal government's ability to enforce federal law in states that have legalized medical cannabis, in the case ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]''.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;

====Obama administration====
The [[presidency of Barack Obama]] was noted for a strong federal crackdown on medical cannabis during his first term in office, despite early indications that his administration would take a more hands-off approach.  During his 2008 campaign for president, Obama expressed support for allowing states to implement their own medical cannabis policies, stating: "I'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue."&lt;ref name="Sullum bummer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=Bummer -- Barack Obama turns out to be just another drug warrior|url=http://reason.com/archives/2011/09/12/bummer/singlepage|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Reason|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These comments were then echoed by the administration in March 2009 when Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] stated that only medical cannabis providers "who violate both federal and state law" would be targeted for prosecution.&lt;ref name="RS Dickinson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickinson|first1=Tim|title=Obama's War on Pot|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obamas-war-on-pot-20120216|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, an October 2009 memo from Deputy Attorney General [[David W. Ogden|David Ogden]] laid out further guidelines for federal enforcement that largely affirmed this earlier-stated hands-off approach.&lt;ref name="RS Dickinson" /&gt;  Despite these pronounced intentions of lessened enforcement from the Obama administration, however, an increasing number of raids were conducted during Obama's first two years in office, surpassing even the Bush administration in frequency.&lt;ref name="Sullum bummer" /&gt;

[[File:San Francisco, Cannabis is Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|"Cannabis is Medicine, Let States Regulate!" protest in San Francisco, April 4, 2012]]
Federal enforcement efforts against medical cannabis were further escalated in early 2011, as a campaign of coercing state and local governments was initiated by the Justice Department.&lt;ref name="RS Dickinson" /&gt;  Letters were sent out by [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorneys]] to a number of state and city officials, threatening to criminally prosecute these individuals if the implementation of new medical cannabis laws moved forward.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt;  Some letters also threatened prosecution of state employees, or even the seizure of state administrative buildings (such as those used for the processing of medical cannabis licenses).&lt;ref name="ASA Cole"&gt;{{citation|title=THIRD TIME THE CHARM? -- State Laws on Medical Cannabis Distribution and Department of Justice Guidance on Enforcement|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/ASA_2013ColeMemo_WhitePaper.pdf|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to outcry and requests for clarification from numerous officials, a new memo was issued by Deputy Attorney General [[James M. Cole]] in June 2011.&lt;ref name="ASA Cole" /&gt;  The Cole memo insisted that the 2009 Ogden memo was being adhered to, and that the Ogden memo's protections applied only to individual patients and not commercial operations.&lt;ref name="Sullum bummer" /&gt;  As the raids continued following release of the Cole memo, U.S. Attorneys sent out hundreds more letters over the next two years, threatening landlords with criminal prosecution and seizure of property for renting to medical cannabis providers.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt;  By June 2013, the total cost of the Obama administration crackdown on medical cannabis had climbed to $289 million, surpassing the previous 8 years of the Bush administration by $100 million.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt;  And the number of raids conducted during Obama's first 4 1/2 years had reached 270, in contrast to 260 during Bush's 8 years.&lt;ref name="ASA WTC" /&gt;

Early in President Obama's second term, in August 2013, the Justice Department issued a [[Cole Memorandum|new Cole memo]] setting forth the conditions under which federal law would be enforced.  The memo was prompted in particular by the recent legalization of non-medical cannabis in Washington and Colorado, but also addressed enforcement in medical cannabis states.&lt;ref name="ASA Cole" /&gt;  Regarding the medical use of cannabis, the memo was considered to take a significantly more deferential approach towards the states (compared to the 2011 Cole memo), similar in nature to how the 2009 Ogden memo was originally widely interpreted.&lt;ref name="ASA Cole" /&gt;  Federal enforcement efforts were further scaled back with the enactment of the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] in December 2014, although the Justice Department initially continued with a number of prosecutions until a pair of court rulings determined it was interpreting the amendment incorrectly.

===Rohrabacher–Farr amendment===
On December 16, 2014, a landmark victory was achieved for medical cannabis at the federal level with the signing into law of the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]].  Initially introduced by Rep. [[Maurice Hinchey]] in 2001, the amendment prohibits the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angell|first1=Tom|title=Federal Medical Marijuana Amendment Author Dies At 79|url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-medical-marijuana-amendment-author-dies-79/|accessdate=November 24, 2017|work=Marijuana Moment|date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It failed 152–273 upon its initial vote in 2003, and was defeated five more times over the next decade until it passed the House by a 219–189 margin on May 30, 2014, as an attachment to the [[Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015|CJS Appropriations bill]] for fiscal year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherer|first1=Steph|title=First major victory in the fight to end federal interference|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/first_major_victory_in_the_fight_to_end_federal_interference|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It did not receive a vote in the Senate, but was inserted into the $1.1 trillion "cromnibus" spending bill during final negotiations, which became law with President Obama's signature on December 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Congress Set to Pass Landmark Medical Marijuana Legislation|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/congress_set_to_pass_landmark_medical_marijuana_legislation|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rohrabacher–Farr amendment passed the House by an even larger margin (242–186) in June 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=June 4, 2015|title=Rohrabacher Hails Passage of Medical Marijuana Amendment|url=https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-hails-passage-of-medical-marijuana-amendment|access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; then won approval in a 21–9 Senate Appropriations Committee vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Senate Committee Approves Mikulski Medical Marijuana Amendment with Strong Bipartisan Support|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/senate_committee_approves_mikulski_medical_marijuana_amendment_with_strong_bipartisan_support|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was signed into law as part of the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016|FY 2016 omnibus appropriations bill]] on December 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liszewski|first1=Mike|title=Congress Set to Reauthorize the Rohrabacher-Farr Medical Cannabis Amendment|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/congress_set_to_reauthorize_the_rohrabacher_farr_medical_cannabis_amendment|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amendment was subsequently included in a series of spending bills with the most recent extension effective through December 7, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Medical Marijuana Protections Included in Senate CJS Appropriations Bill |url=https://www.mpp.org/news/press/medical-marijuana-protections-included-in-senate-cjs-appropriations-bill/ |accessdate=October 8, 2018 |work=Marijuana Policy Project |date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sink |first1=Justin |last2=Wasson |first2=Erik |title=Trump Signs Bill Averting Government Shutdown Before Midterms |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-28/trump-signs-bill-averting-pre-election-government-shutdown |accessdate=October 8, 2018 |work=Bloomberg |date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment offers important protections for state-legal medical cannabis activities, it does not change the legal status of cannabis, and must be renewed each fiscal year in order to remain in effect.&lt;ref name="Sullum Rohrabacher" /&gt;  The Justice Department has also interpreted the amendment in a manner vastly different from the authors' intent, which it has used to justify a number of raids and prosecutions after the law's enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zilversmit|first1=Marc|title=Obama’s Iran-Contra -- The president is spending money that Congress has explicitly told him he can’t spend|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/04/obama_s_medical_marijuana_prosecutions_probably_aren_t_legal.html|accessdate=May 9, 2017|work=Slate|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. District Judge [[Charles R.

==State policy==
===Early laws (late 1970s and early 80s)===
Due to increasing public awareness of the medical benefits of cannabis, and in anticipation of forthcoming changes to federal policy, a number of states passed laws in the late 1970s and early 1980s addressing the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;  [[New Mexico]] was the first to do so in 1978, and by the end of 1982 over thirty states had followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=Steven C.|title=State-by-State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=http://www.procon.org/view.background-resource.php?resourceID=001496|website=ProCon.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of these laws sought to provide cannabis through federally-approved research programs administered by the states, using cannabis supplied by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]].  Only seven states ended up implementing the programs, however,&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt; due to the large bureaucratic and regulatory obstacles imposed by the federal government.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;  Other states passed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe cannabis, or reclassifying cannabis in a state's internal drug scheduling system.  These laws were largely ineffectual though, due to the continued prohibition of medical cannabis at the federal level.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;  A few states passed laws affirming the right of individuals to present a [[medical necessity]] defense at trial.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;  By the mid-80s, however, efforts to pass new medical cannabis laws had ground to a halt, and a number of existing laws were either repealed or allowed to expire.&lt;ref name="Pacula" /&gt;

===California (early and mid-1990s)===
Medical cannabis advocates began to gain ground in the early 1990s with a series of legislative achievements in the state of California.  Proposition P was approved by 79% of [[San Francisco]] voters in November 1991, calling on state lawmakers to pass legislation allowing the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref name="MMJ Law" /&gt;  Additionally, the city board of supervisors passed a resolution in August 1992 urging the police commission and district attorney to "make lowest priority the arrest or prosecution of those involved in the possession or cultivation of [cannabis] for medicinal purposes" and to "allow a letter from a treating physician to be used as [[Prima facie|prima facia]] evidence that marijuana can alleviate the pain and suffering of that patient's medical condition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition P|url=http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/Proposition_P_Nov_1991.html|website=marijuanalibrary.org|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution allowed the open distribution of cannabis to AIDS patients and others throughout the city, most notably through the [[San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club]] which was operated by medical cannabis activist [[Dennis Peron]] (who spearheaded Proposition P and later the statewide [[Proposition 215]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=The Cannabis Buyers Club: How Medical Marijuana Began in California|url=https://www.marijuana.com/news/2014/08/the-cannabis-buyers-club-how-medical-marijuana-began-in-california/|accessdate=May 4, 2017|work=marijuana.com|date=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar clubs appeared outside San Francisco in the ensuing years as other cities passed legislation to support the medical use of cannabis.  The [[Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana]] was founded in 1993 after 75% of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] voters approved Measure A in November 1992.&lt;ref name="Heddleston frontlines"&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Heddleston|first1=Thomas R.|title=From the Frontlines to the Bottom Line: Medical Marijuana, the War on Drugs, and the Drug Policy Reform Movement|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1t7220hj|publisher=UC Santa Cruz Electronic Theses and Dissertations|date=June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/MedicalMarijuanaTheWarOnDrugsAndTheDrugPolicyReformMovement|archive-date=February 16, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And the [[Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]] was founded in 1995 shortly before the city council passed multiple medical cannabis resolutions.&lt;ref name="Heddleston frontlines" /&gt;

Following the lead of San Francisco and other cities in California, state lawmakers passed Senate Joint Resolution 8 in 1993, a non-binding measure calling on the federal government to enact legislation allowing physicians to prescribe cannabis.&lt;ref name="Vitiello 215"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vitiello|first1=Michael|title=Proposition 215: De Facto Legalization of Pot and the Shortcomings of Direct Democracy|url=http://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&amp;context=facultyarticles|accessdate=April 30, 2017|publisher=McGeorge School of Law|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, Senate Bill 1364 was approved by state legislators, to reclassify cannabis as a Schedule II drug at the state level.&lt;ref name="Vitiello 215" /&gt;  And Assembly Bill 1529 was approved in 1995, to create a medical necessity defense for patients using cannabis with a physician's recommendation, for treatment of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, or multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref name="Vitiello 215" /&gt;  Both SB 1364 and AB 1529 were vetoed by Governor [[Pete Wilson]], however, paving the way for the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996.&lt;ref name="Vitiello 215" /&gt;

===Modern laws (1996 to present)===
Frustrated by vetoes of medical cannabis bills in successive years, medical cannabis advocates in California took the issue directly to the voters, collecting 775,000 signatures for qualification of a statewide [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|ballot initiative]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical Marijuana Initiative Qualifies For November Ballot|url=http://norml.org/news/1996/06/06/medical-marijuana-initiative-qualifies-for-november-ballot|accessdate=April 30, 2017|work=NORML|date=June 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Proposition 215]] – the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 – was subsequently approved with 56% of the vote, legalizing the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis by patients with a physician's recommendation, for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or "any other illness for which marijuana provides relief".&lt;ref name="Prop215 text"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 215: Text of Proposed Law|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/california-proposition-215.pdf|website=ProCon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law also allowed patient [[caregiver]]s to cultivate cannabis, and urged lawmakers to facilitate the "safe and affordable distribution of marijuana".&lt;ref name="Prop215 text" /&gt;

Also in 1996, 65% of [[Arizona]] voters approved Proposition 200, a drug policy reform initiative containing a provision allowing the use of cannabis with a doctor's prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug Reform Measure Signed Into Law In Arizona|url=http://norml.org/news/1996/12/09/drug-reform-measure-signed-into-law-in-arizona|accessdate=May 1, 2017|work=NORML|date=December 9, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical cannabis portion of the initiative was then essentially repealed by state legislators a few months later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arizona Bill Delays Medical Marijuana Use|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-04-16/news/mn-49181_1_bill-marijuana-arizona|accessdate=May 1, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|date=April 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the change was rejected by Arizona voters in a 1998 [[Popular referendum|veto referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spivack|first1=Sarah|title=Doctors leery to prescribe marijuana as medication|url=http://wc.arizona.edu/papers/92/57/01_4_m.html|accessdate=May 1, 2017|work=Arizona Daily Wildcat|date=November 12, 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501210231/http://wc.arizona.edu/papers/92/57/01_4_m.html|archive-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately the medical cannabis provision was ineffective, however, due to language that created significant conflict with federal law (use of the word "prescribe" instead of "recommend").&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;

In 1998, medical cannabis initiatives were voted on in the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Alaska]], and [[Nevada]] – all of which passed.&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;  Also, in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Initiative 59]] to legalize the medical use of cannabis passed with 69% of the vote, but a series of amendments introduced by Rep. [[Bob Barr]] and approved by Congress prevented its implementation for over a decade.&lt;ref name="AFSA DCMMJ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress Lifts Ban on Medical Marijuana for Nation's Capitol|url=http://www.safeaccessnow.org/congress_lifts_ban_on_medical_marijuana_for_nations_capitol|accessdate=April 26, 2017|work=Americans for Safe Access|date=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial Barr amendment was enacted prior to the November 1998 election but after ballots had been printed, thereby allowing D.C. residents to vote on the initiative but preventing the results from being made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slevin|first1=Peter|last2=Murphy|first2=Caryle|title=Marijuana Vote Results Kept Secret|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/dcelections/marijuana4.htm|accessdate=April 26, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=November 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amendment was challenged in court by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] on grounds that it violated First Amendment rights, and in September 1999 U.S. District Court Judge [[Richard W.

[[File:Discount Medical Marijuana - 2.jpg|thumb|right|Medical cannabis dispensary in Denver]]
Following the approval of several ballot measures in 1998, [[Maine]] voters passed a medical cannabis initiative in 1999 that was expanded by both state legislature and another ballot initiative in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;  In 2000, medical cannabis initiatives were passed in the states of [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]], with Nevada's initiative passing for a second consecutive election as required to amend the state's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical Marijuana Initiatives Pass In Colorado and Nevada; Californians Pass Initiative To Keep Non-Violent Drug Offenders Out Of Jail|url=http://norml.org/news/2000/11/09/medical-marijuana-initiatives-pass-in-colorado-and-nevada-californians-pass-initiative-to-keep-non-violent-drug-offenders-out-of-jail|accessdate=June 1, 2017|work=NORML|date=November 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2000, [[Hawaii]] became the first state to legalize medical cannabis through an act of state legislature.&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;

In the following years, medical cannabis was legalized by ballot measure in [[Montana]] (2004), [[Michigan]] (2008), [[Arizona]] (2010), [[Massachusetts]] (2012), [[Arkansas]] (2016), [[Florida]] (2016), [[North Dakota]] (2016), [[Oklahoma]] (2018), [[Missouri]] (2018), and [[Utah]] (2018) and by state legislature in [[Vermont]] (2004), [[Rhode Island]] (2006), [[New Mexico]] (2007), [[New Jersey]] (2010), [[Delaware]] (2011), [[Connecticut]] (2012), [[New Hampshire]] (2013), [[Illinois]] (2013), [[Maryland]] (2014), [[Minnesota]] (2014), [[New York (state)|New York]] (2014), [[Pennsylvania]] (2016), [[Louisiana]] (2016), [[Ohio]] (2016), and [[West Virginia]] (2017).&lt;ref name="ncsl states" /&gt;&lt;ref name="procon states"&gt;{{cite web|title=30 Legal Medical Marijuana States and DC|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881|website=ProCon.org|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seventeen states have legalized by ballot measure and 16 have by state legislature, for a total of 33 states according to the [[National Conference of State Legislatures]]&lt;ref name="ncsl states" /&gt; (although some dispute the effectiveness of Louisiana's law, thus considering there to be only 32).

====Low-THC, high-CBD laws====
In addition to states that have passed comprehensive medical cannabis laws, a number of states have passed more restrictive laws that limit the allowable concentration of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), the main [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] component of cannabis.  The purpose of these laws is to allow for the use of [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), a non-psychoactive [[cannabinoid]] that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of seizure disorders, particularly in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 States with Laws Specifically about Legal Cannabidiol (CBD)|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=006473|website=ProCon.org|accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of CBD to treat seizure disorders gained increased attention with a number of media reports in 2012 and 2013, and by the end of 2015 sixteen states had "low-THC, high-CBD" laws in effect.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;  Additionally, two states ([[Indiana]] and [[Kansas]]) have since passed laws to allow the use of CBD without need for a doctor's consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Chris |title=Indiana Legalizes Medical CBD Oil, Again |url=https://merryjane.com/news/indiana-legalizes-medical-cbd-oil-again |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |work=Merry Jane |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Zach |title=Kansas Legalizes CBD Products for Adult-Use Sales |url=https://merryjane.com/news/kansas-legalizes-hemp-derived-cbd-products |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |work=Merry Jane |date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, all but three states explicitly allow the legal use of CBD in some form, whether through doctor's recommendation,&lt;ref name="ncsl states" /&gt; doctor's prescription ([[#Epidiolex|Epidiolex]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State Rescheduling for FDA-approved Therapies Derived from CBD |url=http://advocacy.epilepsy.com/statefdapathway |publisher=Epilepsy Foundation |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or without the need for either.

==Research==
As a Schedule I drug in the U.S., [[clinical research]] on cannabis must be approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and a license (also referred to as a "registration") must be obtained from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] specific to conducting research on Schedule I drugs.  The petition to the FDA is submitted in the form of an [[Investigational New Drug]] application,&lt;ref name="Brookings war"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hudak|first1=John|last2=Wallack|first2=Grace|title=Ending the U.S. government’s war on medical marijuana research|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ending-the-US-governments-war-on-medical-marijuana-research.pdf|work=Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings|publisher=The Brookings Institution|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the FDA has 30 days to respond to.&lt;ref name="ASA obstruction"&gt;{{citation|title=The Obstruction Of Medical Cannabis Research In The U.S.|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Research_Obstruction_Report.pdf|publisher=Americans for Safe Access|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DEA research registrations are issued for Schedule I and Schedule II–V drugs,&lt;ref name="Brookings war" /&gt; with the Schedule I registration mandating stricter compliance requirements such as the manner in which substances are stored and secured.&lt;ref name="ThinkProgress DEA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zielinski|first1=Alex|title=The DEA Hasn’t Made Marijuana Research Any Easier|url=https://thinkprogress.org/the-dea-hasnt-made-marijuana-research-any-easier-cf21c0a9cc83|accessdate=May 15, 2017|work=ThinkProgress|date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DEA licensing process can take over a year to complete.&lt;ref name="APA research" /&gt;

In addition to FDA approval and DEA registration, other requirements have been imposed for cannabis research that do not exist for any other drug, which has had a significant effect in limiting the amount of research conducted.  One such requirement was established in 1999 when it was mandated that all proposed research be submitted to the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]] for approval.&lt;ref name="ASA obstruction" /&gt;  This was of particular burden to researchers as there was no timeline in which PHS was required to respond, with some reviews taking years to complete.&lt;ref name="ASA obstruction" /&gt;  In June 2015 the PHS review was eliminated, however, to better streamline the process for approving medical cannabis research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Steven|title=Major Pot Research Barrier Goes Up in Smoke|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/22/major-pot-research-barrier-goes-up-in-smoke|accessdate=May 15, 2017|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical research on cannabis also requires approval from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], which has had an additional effect in impeding medical cannabis research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferro|first1=Shaunacy|title=Why It's So Hard For Scientists To Study Medical Marijuana|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/why-its-so-hard-scientists-study-pot|accessdate=August 19, 2017|work=Popular Science|date=April 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424064724/http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/why-its-so-hard-scientists-study-pot?single-page-view=true|archive-date=April 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stated mission of NIDA is to support research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of drug abuse and drug addiction, and not the medicinal uses of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Obstruction of Medical Marijuana Research|url=https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/federal-obstruction-of-medical-marijuana-research/|publisher=Marijuana Policy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, many studies on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis are either denied or altered to comply with the limited scope and mission of NIDA.&lt;ref name="ASA obstruction" /&gt;  There is also no timeline in which NIDA is required to respond to proposals (as with the PHS review), which has resulted in delays in getting research approved ranging from months to years.&lt;ref name="DPA decades"&gt;{{citation|title=The DEA: Four Decades of Impeding And Rejecting Science|url=https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA-MAPS_DEA_Science_Final.pdf|publisher=Drug Policy Alliance / Multidisciplinary Associations for Psychedelic Studies|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the cannabis provided by NIDA has been criticized as being inferior to that which is commonly used by medical cannabis patients in states where it is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Breen|first1=Bill|title=Pipe Dream?|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/47962/pipe-dream|accessdate=September 9, 2017|work=Fast Company|date=February 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Jessica|title=Weed control|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/28/weed_control/|accessdate=September 9, 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=May 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|last2=Chappell|first2=Tauhid|title=Government marijuana looks nothing like the real stuff.

===NIDA monopoly===
Since the agency's inception in 1974, NIDA has been the sole provider of cannabis for research purposes in the U.S., contracting with the [[University of Mississippi]] for cultivation of the cannabis.&lt;ref name="DPA decades" /&gt;  The monopoly has been maintained by the refusal of the Drug Enforcement Administration to issue additional licenses for the cultivation and distribution of cannabis, which the DEA has claimed is consistent with the terms of the U.N. [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] that was ratified in 1961.&lt;ref name="ASA obstruction" /&gt;  Others have disputed this interpretation of the treaty however (including the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Angell |first1=Tom |title=State Department Says DEA Is Wrong on Marijuana Monopoly |url=https://www.marijuana.com/news/2016/05/state-department-says-dea-is-wrong-on-marijuana-monopoly/ |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |work=marijuana.com |date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the DEA's interpretation is not consistent with the fact that multiple licenses have been issued for the production of other Schedule I drugs.&lt;ref name="Brookings war" /&gt;  The DEA has also cited the possibility of [[Drug diversion|diversion]] from cultivation facilities as justification for not issuing additional licenses.&lt;ref name="ASA obstruction" /&gt;

====Craker application====
Critics of the NIDA monopoly have pointed to the case of [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] professor [[Lyle Craker]] as an example of the DEA's undue resistance to granting additional cultivation licenses.  Professor Craker's endeavor to obtain a license began in June 2001, when he submitted an application to the DEA, which, later in 2001, the DEA claimed to have lost.&lt;ref name="DPA decades" /&gt;  After a photocopy was resubmitted, the DEA rejected the application in February 2002 because it did not have an original signature.&lt;ref name="MAPS timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=DEA Lawsuit Timeline|url=http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/dea-lawsuit-timeline|website=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2002, the original application was returned to Professor Craker unprocessed, with a date stamp showing it had been received in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: In the matter of Lyle Craker|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/time-line-matter-lyle-craker|website=ACLU|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The application was then resubmitted in August 2002, upon which the DEA confirmed receipt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAPS Medical Marijuana Research|url=http://www.maps.org/research-archive/mmj/|website=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 24, 2003, a notice regarding Craker's application was filed in the [[Federal Register]], with a [[public comment]] period ending on September 23, 2003.&lt;ref name="DPA decades" /&gt;  In October 2003, U.S. Senators [[John Kerry]] and [[Ted Kennedy]] wrote a letter to DEA Administrator [[Karen Tandy]] expressing support for granting Professor Craker a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=U.S. Senators from Massachusetts Send Letter to DEA|url=http://www.maps.org/research-archive/mmj/kennedy&amp;kerry_to_dea_signed_retyped_letter.pdf|publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|date=October 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 10, 2004, however, following a lawsuit filed over unreasonable delay in responding to the application, the DEA rejected Craker's application.&lt;ref name="NIDA 2004"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=DEA Upholds Grower’s Marijuana Monopoly|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2004/12/18/dea-upholds-grower-s-marijuana-monopoly/|accessdate=July 14, 2017|work=CounterPunch|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Craker then filed another lawsuit in response to the rejection, and also requested a hearing on the matter from a DEA Administrative Law Judge, which was granted.&lt;ref name="DPA decades" /&gt;  On February 12, 2007, after almost two years of extensive public testimony and evidence gathering, DEA Administrative Law Judge Ellen Bittner issued an 87-page opinion in favor of granting Professor Craker a license.&lt;ref name="DPA decades" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Phillip|title=Medical Marijuana: DEA Judge Says Let Professor Grow Marijuana for Research Purposes|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2007/feb/16/medical_marijuana_dea_judge_says|accessdate=July 14, 2017|work=StoptheDrugWar.org|date=February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, 45 members of Congress wrote to DEA Administrator Karen Tandy in September 2007 urging that the decision be upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress urges DEA to OK medical cannabis research|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Amherst.House%20Signon.Final.pdf|publisher=Americans for Safe Access|date=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2009, however, Acting DEA Administrator [[Michele Leonhart]] rejected the recommended ruling of Judge Bittner and declined to issue a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush Administration Deals Eleventh Hour Blow To Scientific Freedom|url=https://www.aclu.org/news/bush-administration-deals-eleventh-hour-blow-scientific-freedom|accessdate=July 14, 2017|work=ACLU|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, 16 members of Congress wrote to Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] in February 2009, asking that the Leonhart ruling be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=February 5th letter to Holder from Olver|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Olver_to_Holder_Letter.pdf|publisher=Americans for Safe Access|date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional letter was sent by Sens.

==Cannabinoid drugs==
There are currently four [[cannabinoid]] drugs (Marinol, Syndros, Cesamet, and Epidiolex) available for prescription use in the United States.  Non-Epidiolex CBD is also available for purchase from many online retailers, though the legality of these products is disputed.

===Dronabinol===
Dronabinol is synthetically manufactured [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MARINOL (dronabinol) capsules, for oral use|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/018651s029lbl.pdf|website=fda.gov|accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been approved by the FDA in pill form as Marinol and in oral solution form as the drug Syndros.

====Marinol====
Marinol is a sesame oil suspension of dronabinol encapsulated in a gelatin shell.&lt;ref name="MPP MMJlaws" /&gt;  It received FDA approval in 1985 for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and additionally in 1992 as an appetite stimulant for the treatment of AIDS-related weight loss.&lt;ref name="grinspoon history" /&gt;  Marinol was classified as a Schedule II drug upon its initial introduction, and was moved to Schedule III in 1999.&lt;ref name="CRS report" /&gt;  Marinol was developed by Unimed Pharmaceuticals, although initial research on the drug was mostly funded by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="NAP 2001" /&gt;  Unimed Pharmaceuticals was acquired by [[Solvay S.A.|Solvay Pharmaceuticals]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unimed Approves Acquisition By Solvay|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-06-12/business/9906120035_1_solvay-pharmaceuticals-unimed-pharmaceuticals-solvay-group|accessdate=June 25, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=From Tribune News Services|date=June 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syndros====
Syndros is a liquid oral formulation of dronabinol approved for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as well as AIDS-related weight loss.  Syndros received FDA approval in July 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Insys Therapeutics Announces FDA Approval of Syndros|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/(S(pvdkqo55zqclup455onso4ug))/story/insys-therapeutics-announces-fda-approval-of-syndrostm-2016-07-05-61845527|location=Phoenix|accessdate=June 27, 2017|publisher=MarketWatch|agency=GlobeNewswire|date=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was assigned a Schedule II classification by the DEA in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=A pharma company that spent $500,000 trying to keep pot illegal just got DEA approval for synthetic marijuana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/24/a-pharma-company-that-spent-500000-trying-to-keep-pot-illegal-just-got-dea-approval-for-synthetic-marijuana/|accessdate=June 27, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syndros is manufactured by [[Insys Therapeutics]], which received attention in 2016 for contributing heavily to the defeat of a cannabis legalization measure in Arizona, in an apparent attempt to protect market share for the newly developed drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fang|first1=Lee|title=Pharma Company Funding Anti-Pot Fight Worried About Losing Business, Filings Show|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/pharma-opioid-marijuana/|accessdate=June 27, 2017|work=The Intercept|date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levin|first1=Sam|title=Big Pharma's anti-marijuana stance aims to squash the competition, activists say|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/03/big-pharma-marijuana-competition-insys-arizona|accessdate=June 27, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Syndros became available for prescription use in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=July 31, 2017|title=Insys Announces Availability of SYNDROS, the First and Only FDA-Approved Liquid Dronabinol, by Prescription|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/07/31/1064808/0/en/Insys-Announces-Availability-of-SYNDROS-the-First-and-Only-FDA-Approved-Liquid-Dronabinol-by-Prescription.html|location=Phoenix|agency=GlobeNewswire|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nabilone===
[[Nabilone]] is a synthetic cannabinoid similar in molecular structure to THC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CESAMET (nabilone) Capsules|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2006/018677s011lbl.pdf|website=fda.gov|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is sold in pill form only as the drug Cesamet.

====Cesamet====
Cesamet received FDA approval in 1985 for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref name="Rubin Cesamet"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Rita|title=2nd synthetic marijuana drug OK'd for chemo effects|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-16-marijuana-drug_x.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2017|work=USA Today|date=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was discontinued by its manufacturer [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in 1989 for commercial reasons, and U.S. rights to the drug were sold to [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Rubin Cesamet" /&gt;  In 2006, Valeant received FDA approval to resume sales of the drug.&lt;ref name="Rubin Cesamet" /&gt;  Cesamet has remained a Schedule II drug since it was first introduced for prescription use.&lt;ref name="DEA sched pdf" /&gt;

===Cannabidiol===
[[Cannabidiol]] (CBD) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that is extracted from the cannabis plant.  It has been approved by the FDA as the drug Epidiolex.

====Epidiolex====
Epidiolex is a liquid oral formulation of cannabidiol approved for the treatment of [[Dravet syndrome]] and [[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. approves first marijuana-based drug for seizures |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-approves-epidiolex-first-marijuana-based-drug-for-seizures/ |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |work=CBS News |date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It received FDA approval in June 2018,&lt;ref name="GW Pharma"&gt;{{cite press release|date=June 25, 2018|title=Biosciences Announce FDA Approval of EPIDIOLEX® (cannabidiol) oral solution – the First Plant-derived Cannabinoid Prescription Medicine|url=http://ir.gwpharm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gw-pharmaceuticals-plc-and-its-us-subsidiary-greenwich|publisher=GW Pharmaceuticals|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was assigned a Schedule V classification by the DEA in September 2018.&lt;ref name="epidiolex scheduling"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jaeger |first1=Kyle |title=The DEA Just Placed a Marijuana-Derived Drug In Schedule V |url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/the-dea-just-placed-a-marijuana-derived-drug-in-schedule-v/ |accessdate=September 28, 2018 |work=Marijuana Moment |date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epidiolex is manufactured by Greenwich Biosciences, a U.S. subsidiary of the British firm [[GW Pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref name="GW Pharma" /&gt;  Epidiolex became available for prescription use in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=November 1, 2018 |title=EPIDIOLEX® (cannabidiol) Oral Solution – the First FDA-approved Plant-derived Cannabinoid Medicine – Now Available by Prescription in the U.S. |url=http://ir.gwpharm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/epidiolexr-cannabidiol-oral-solution-first-fda-approved-plant |publisher=GW Pharmaceuticals |access-date=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-prescription use====
In addition to its use for treatment of seizure disorders, cannabidiol is used by some individuals under the belief that it possesses a number of other medical properties – but these claims have yet to be thoroughly studied and proven.  Accordingly, the FDA has not approved CBD for any other medical use, and the DEA's current position is that it considers non-Epidiolex CBD to be a Schedule I drug.&lt;ref name="epidiolex scheduling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Summers|first1=DJ|title=Is CBD Oil Legal?

==Effects of legalizing medical cannabis==
A 2016 study found significant drops in violent crime in states that have legalized medical cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Medical Marijuana and Crime Further Evidence From the Western States|url = http://jod.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/01/12/0022042615623983|journal = Journal of Drug Issues|date = 2016-01-13|issn = 0022-0426|pages = 0022042615623983|doi = 10.1177/0022042615623983|language = en|first = Edward M.|last = Shepard|first2 = Paul R.|last2 = Blackley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 study similarly found that introduction of medical cannabis laws caused a reduction in violent crime in American states that border Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gavrilova|first=Evelina|last2=Kamada|first2=Takuma|last3=Zoutman|first3=Floris|title=Is Legal Pot Crippling Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1503">The '''Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study''' (MACS) is an ongoing [[cohort study]] involving over 6,000 men, including both those infected with [[HIV]], as well as HIV-negative men. The Los Angeles component of the MACS is called the Los Angeles Mens Study or LAMS. LAMS affiliated with UCLA and is supervised by Dr Roger Detels, MD &amp; John Oishi.

The study, a program of the [[Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]], has been ongoing for over 30 years and has resulted in over 1,000 scientific publications. It helped to establish that AIDS was a viral illness and how it was spread.  Participants were quizzed in detail about their sexual behaviour. "They ask you for numbers, how many times did you do what." Some participants who had many sexual partners were not infected, and this led to the realisation that some people had genetic resistance to the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = AIDS Study Marks 25th Year | author = Brenda Wilson | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103469790 | date = April 24, 2009 | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study | author = | url = http://www.statepi.jhsph.edu/macs/macs.html | date = May 2006 | publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Council Against Health Fraud''' ('''NCAHF''') was a not-for-profit, US-based organization, run by Dr. [[Stephen Barrett]], a retired [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[author]], that described itself as a "private nonprofit, voluntary health agency that focuses upon health misinformation, fraud, and [[quackery]] as public health problems."&lt;ref name="NCAHF_website"&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/  National Council Against Health Fraud - official website]&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAHF has been criticized by the supporters of the treatments it opposes, including practitioners of [[alternative medicine]].

== History ==
According to its official website, the NCAHF evolved from three separate organizations. The Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, Inc. (LVCAHF, now called [[Quackwatch]]) was founded in 1969 by Stephen Barrett and H. William Gross, [[Dental degree|D.D.S.]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]. The Southern California Council Against Health Fraud (SCCAHF) had its origin in 1976 at [[Loma Linda University]] with academic colleagues [[William T. Jarvis]] and Gordon Rick as co-founders. [[Thomas H. Jukes]] of [[University of California, Berkeley]] founded the third organization, an unnamed group in northern California.&lt;ref name="NCAHF_history"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ncahf.org/about/history.html
|title=NCAHF's History
|accessdate=2018-01-07
|date=14 March 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time between 1998 and 2000, the NCAHF operated under the name National Council for Reliable Health Information (NCRHI). The organization effectively ceased operations in 2002, and its legal entity was formally dissolved in 2011.&lt;ref name="NCAHF_history"/&gt;

== Mission statement ==

According to NCAHF's mission statement, its activities and purposes include:

* Investigating and evaluating claims made for health products and services.
* Educating consumers, professionals, business people, legislators, law enforcement personnel, organizations and agencies about health fraud, misinformation, and [[quackery]].
* Providing a center for communication between individuals and organizations concerned about health misinformation, fraud, and quackery.
* Supporting sound consumer health laws
* Opposing legislation that undermines consumer rights.
* Encouraging and aiding legal actions against those who violate [[consumer protection]] laws.
* Sponsoring a free weekly e-mail newsletter.&lt;ref name="NCAHF_mission_statement"&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/about/mission.html NCAHF Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCAHF's positions on consumer health issues are based on what they consider ethical and scientific principles that underlie consumer protection law. Required are:

* Adequate disclosure in labeling and other warranties to enable consumers to make proper choices;
* Premarketing proof of safety and efficacy for products and services that claim to prevent, alleviate, or cure any disease or disorder; and
* Accountability for those who violate consumer laws.&lt;ref name="NCAHF_mission_statement"/&gt;

NCAHF states that its funding is primarily derived from membership dues, newsletter subscriptions, and consumer information services. Membership is open to everyone, with members and consultants located all over the world. NCAHF's officers and board members serve without compensation. NCAHF states they unite consumers with health professionals, educators, researchers, attorneys, and others.

== Position on health issues ==

=== Acupuncture ===

The NCAHF asserts that [[acupuncture]] is scientifically unproven as a modality of treatment.  The NCAHF says (as of 1990) that research during the past twenty years has failed to demonstrate that acupuncture is effective against any disease.  Perceived effects of acupuncture are, argues the NCAHF, probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion  and other psychological mechanisms.  The NCAHF points out that acupuncture was banned in China in 1929 but underwent a resurgence in the 1960s.  The organization also advocates that insurance companies should not be required to cover acupuncture treatment, and that licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out.&lt;ref name=humber&gt;{{cite book|last=Humber|first=James M.|title=Alternative Medicine and Ethics|year=1998|publisher=Springer Humana Press|isbn=978-0-89603-440-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E7X7d_DZlLkC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22National+Council+Against+Health+Fraud%22+acupuncture#v=snippet&amp;q=National%20Council%20Against%20Health%20Fraud%20acupuncture&amp;f=false|author2=Robert F. Almeder|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAHF_position_acupuncture&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/acu.html NCAHF position paper on acupuncture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cordón"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cordón|first=Luis|title=Popular psychology: an encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-32457-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uy1gmwcAgg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=9780313324574&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20council%20against%20health%20fraud&amp;f=false|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amalgam fillings ===
{{see also|Dental amalgam controversy}}
There has long been controversy regarding the use of [[amalgam fillings]] by dentists,&lt;ref name=Hyson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hyson JM |title=Amalgam: Its history and perils |journal=[[J Calif Dent Assoc]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=215–29 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16895078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the amalgam contains mercury. Some forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are toxic to humans, but the NCAHF cites the CDC in stating that there is no evidence that "the health of the vast majority of people with amalgam is compromised" or that "removing amalgam fillings has a beneficial effect on health".&lt;ref name=CDC_amalgam&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/publications/factsheets/amalgam.htm CDC Factsheet on amalgam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507021910/http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/publications/factsheets/amalgam.htm |date=May 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCAHF criticizes those who they believe exploit unfounded public fears for financial gain.&lt;ref name=huggins&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/huggins.html Administrative Law Judge's Conclusions about Hal A. Huggins, D.D.S.]&lt;/ref&gt; NCAHF asserts that breath, urine and blood testing for mercury are inaccurate. Other tests for mercury exposure described by the NCAHF as invalid can include skin testing, stool testing, [[hair analysis (alternative medicine)|hair analysis]] and electrodermal testing.&lt;ref name=NCAHF_position_amalgam&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/amalgampp.html NCAHF Position Paper on Amalgam]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chiropractic ===

The NCAHF contends that [[chiropractic]] can be dangerous and lead to injury or permanent disability.&lt;ref name=NCAHF_position_chiropractic_hazardous&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/chirop.html#hazardous NCAHF - Position Paper on Chiropractic - Hazardous Practices]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NCAHF does not categorically oppose the practice. NCAHF differentiates between chiropractors who promote what it considers good and bad chiropractic practices. The former promote methods of diagnosis and treatment which have a scientific basis. For example, NCAHF claims there is no scientific support for [[vertebral subluxation]].&lt;ref name=NCAHF_position_chiropractic_cause&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/chirop.html#cause NCAHF - Position Paper on Chiropractic - Treating "Cause" Versus "Effect"]&lt;/ref&gt; Their view is that chiropractors should restrict their scope of practice to neuromusculoskeletal problems such as muscle spasms, strains, sprains, fatigue, imbalance of strength and flexibility, stretched or irritated nerve tissue, and so forth. Chiropractors should refer cases involving pathology to qualified medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="chiropactor_description"&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/chirop.html#ncahf NCAHF'S Description of a Scientific Chiropractor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, what the NCAHF considers bad are those chiropractors who believe the [[spinal adjustment]] will cure or alleviate a variety of diseases, such as [[infection]], [[arthritis]], [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], [[nutritional deficiencies]] or excesses, [[appendicitis]], blood disorders, or [[kidney disease]].  These practitioners may use unproven, disproven, or questionable methods, devices, and products such as adjusting machines, [[applied kinesiology]], [[chelation therapy]], [[Enema#In alternative medicine|colonic irrigation]], computerized nutrition deficiency tests, [[cranial osteopathy]], cytotoxic food allergy testing, [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[Gerovital]], glandular therapy, [[Hair analysis (alternative medicine)|hair analysis]], herbal crystallization analyses, [[homeopathy]], internal managements, [[iridology]], laser beam acupuncture, [[laetrile]], [[magnetic therapy]],and so forth.&lt;ref name=chiropactor_recommendations&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/chirop.html#recommendations NCAHF - Position Paper on Chiropractic - Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet advice ===

The NCAHF is opposed to dietary recommendations and practices not supported by scientific evidence, including behavior-related claims.&lt;ref name=NCAHF_position_diet&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/diet.html NCAHF Position Paper on Diet and Criminal Behavior, April 17, 1983.]&lt;/ref&gt; Unverified assessment methods such as [[iridology]], [[applied kinesiology]], and routine [[hair analysis (alternative medicine)|hair analysis]] for assessment of nutritional status are criticized. NCAHF and some of its members have long opposed implementation of beliefs that they characterize as unfounded or unscientific.&lt;ref name=wtloss&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/wtloss.html Commercial Weight-Loss Promotions, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCAHF also questions the health claims, marketing, safety, efficacy and labeling of [[dietary supplement|herbal supplements]]. Herbal preparations are regulated as foods, rather than as drugs, in the United States.&lt;ref name=DSHEA&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/dshea.html Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994], Accessed from the [[Food and Drug Administration]] website, 5 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAHF advocates regulations for a special [[Over-the-counter drugs|OTC]] category called "Traditional Herbal Remedies" (THRs) with an adverse reaction surveillance program, product batches marked for identification and tracking, package label warnings about proposed dangers of self-treatment, oversight requirements from outside of the herbal industry, and strong penalties for unapproved changes in herbal product formulations.&lt;ref name="herbal"&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/herbal.html NCAHF Position Paper on Over-the Counter Herbal Remedies, 1995], accessed online 31 Dec 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diploma mills ===

The NCAHF claims that many unqualified practitioners are able to mislead the public by using [[diploma mill]]s or "degree mills" to get "specious degrees".  Diploma mills are not accredited, and frequently  engage in "[[pseudoscience]] and [[food faddism]]".  NCAHF also alleges that "at least some of the 'faculty' or 'academic' advisors at several of these schools have criminal convictions in the area of health fraud". NCAHF considers diploma mills harmful to the "students" and to the public.&lt;ref name=diploma_mills&gt;[http://www.ncahf.org/pp/dipmill.html NCAHF position on diploma mills]&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal ''[[Dynamic Chiropractic]]'', while highly critical of NCAHFs views on chiropractic, has written: "The National Council Against Health Fraud is considered a valuable information source for many agencies nationwide. They are well networked and, as demonstrated by their past history, are able to influence the efforts of various agencies and insurance carriers. The NCAHF's ability to publish its opinions and hold these types of conferences does make them a substantial "player" in the area of health fraud."&lt;ref name="chiroweb"&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=National Council Against Health Fraud |journal=[[Dynamic Chiropractic]] |volume=8 |issue=21 |pages= |date=October 10, 1990 |doi= |url=http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/08/21/09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism from alternative medicine supporters ==
The [[American Chiropractic Association]] (ACA) criticised a 2002 PBS broadcast which included an episode about chiropractic&lt;ref name=PBSVideos&gt;{{Scientific American Frontiers|url=https://www.pbs.org/saf/1210/index.html |season=12 |episode=10 |name=Adjusting the Joints |oldurl=https://www.pbs.org/saf/1210/video/watchonline.htm }} - [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adjusting_the_joints&gt;http://www.chedd-angier.com/frontiers/transcripts/Season12_1210.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which the NCAHF was involved. ACA president, Daryl D. Wills, responded to PBS officials stating (in part): "I find it ironic that a program titled 'Scientific American Frontiers' would completely ignore the scientific foundation of the chiropractic profession. The chiropractic portion of the June 4 episode titled 'A Different Way to Heal?' irresponsibly characterized chiropractic care -- a legitimate, research-based form of health care -- as a fraudulent hoax." and that "[t]he producers of your program could not have expected objectivity" from the NCAHF.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[http://www.chirobase.org/15News/saf.html PBS Broadcast Angers Chiropractors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reply&gt;[http://www.chirobase.org/15News/saf2.html My Reply to the American Chiropractic Association]. - [[Robert S.

This conclusion is entirely justified by both current research and generally accepted views of human anatomy."&lt;ref name="PBS_response"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/saf/1210/forum.htm PBS Producer's response], June 11, 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102081945/http://www.pbs.org/saf/1210/forum.htm |date=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Institute for Health and Care Excellence''' ('''NICE''') is an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="Committee2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Health Committee|title=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: Eighth Report of Session 2012-13, Vol. 1: Report, |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3d-bsIthzCYC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2013|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-05239-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes guidelines in four areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/about|title=About|work=nice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* clinical practice (guidance on the appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions)
* guidance for public sector workers on [[health promotion]] and ill-health avoidance
* guidance for social care services and users.

These appraisals are based primarily on evaluations of efficacy and cost-effectiveness in various circumstances.

It serves both the [[National Health Service (England)|English NHS]] and the [[Welsh NHS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title = The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Establishment and Constitution) Order 1999 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/uksi_19990220_en.pdf |format=PDF| date = 1999-02-02 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up as the '''National Institute for Clinical Excellence''' in 1999, and on 1 April 2005 joined with the '''Health Development Agency''' to become the new '''National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence''' (still abbreviated as NICE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title = The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Establishment and Constitution) Amendment Order 2005 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050497.htm | date = 2005-03-07 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title = The Special Health Authorities Abolition Order 2005 | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050502.htm | date = 2005-03-07 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]], NICE was renamed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on 1 April 2013 reflecting its new responsibilities for social care, and changed from a [[NHS special health authority|special health authority]] to an Executive Non-Departmental Public Body (ENDPB).

NICE was established in an attempt to end the so-called [[postcode lottery]] of healthcare in England and Wales, where treatments that were available depended upon the NHS Health Authority area in which the patient happened to live, but it has since acquired a high reputation internationally as a role model for the development of clinical guidelines. One aspect of this is the explicit determination of cost–benefit boundaries for certain technologies that it assesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Health Technology Assessments by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence | url = https://www.springer.com/public+health/book/978-0-387-71995-5 | last = Schlander | first = Michael | ISBN = 978-0-387-71995-5 | year = 2007 | page = 245 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]] | location = New York | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NICE also plays an important role in pioneering technology assessment in other healthcare systems through NICE International, established in May 2008 to help cultivate links with foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/nice-international|title = NICE International: what we do|date = |accessdate = 8 Oct 2014|website = nice.org.uk|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5be67610-9ce2-11de-ab58-00144feabdc0,s01=1.html?nclick_check=1 | title = Nice approach | date = 2009-09-15 | accessdate = 2009-09-18 | last = Cheng| first = Tsung-Mei| publisher = [[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy history==

The notion of an Institute to determine the clinical effectiveness of interventions first emerged at the end of [[John Major]]'s Conservative Government as moves elsewhere{{where|date=July 2013}} were being made to set professionally agreed standards for clinical care. In 1996, the [[UK National Screening Committee]] (NSC) had been established by [[Kenneth Calman|Sir Kenneth Calman]] and [[Muir Gray]] (now Sir Muir Gray) by the Policy Team led by Dr Tim Riley and latterly Sir Charles Nightingale for the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screening.nhs.uk/history|title=History of the UK NSC|work=screening.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSC aimed to ensure that evidence-based medicine informed policy making on what national screening programmes were approved for funding and what quality assurance mechanisms should be in place. This was a timely action as concerns over screening quality had emerged in breast cancer screening services came under question at Exeter in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hansard|date= November 1997| url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1997/nov/03/breast-cancer-screening|title=Breast Cancer Screening}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed in the wake of the 1995 [[Calman-Hine report|Calman-Hine Report]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4071083 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103025308/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4071083 |date=January 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of what was originally termed a National Institute for Clinical Excellence took root when Labour came to power having in 1997. [[Frank Dobson]] became Secretary of State and was supported by a team of Ministers keen on introducing clinical and health outcome measures to achieve improvements in the quality and delivery of care. The team included [[Alan Milburn]], [[Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington|Baroness Margaret Jay]], and [[Tessa Jowell]]. The name and mission was agreed in a meeting between the Ministerial team, Dr Tim Riley and Dr Felicity Harvey shortly after the election and it was agreed that NICE should be described in the first policy [[white paper]], The New NHS: Modern, Dependable 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The New NHS: Modern, Dependable | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/Browsable/DH_4936272 | publisher = Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riley led the team that developed the policy for NICE and which managed the legislation through Parliament in addition to formalising the new institute as a [[NHS special health authority|Special Health Authority]]. Riley joined [[Michael Rawlins|Sir Michael Rawlins]] (the then recently appointed Chair of NICE) at the [[Health Select Committee]] in February 1999 where questions were raised as to whether NICE was just a means to "ration" healthcare. Sir Michael Rawlins presented a compelling case that positioned NICE as a standards setting body first and foremost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmhealth/222/9020406.htm|title=House of Commons - Health - Minutes of Evidence|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the reality was that although NICE was principally aimed at aligning professional standards through clinical guidelines and audit, the acceptability of drugs, devices and technological interventions in defining those standards, could not be ignored and so the concept of a "fourth hurdle" for drugs accessing the NHS market was invoked. This controversial policy shift meant that NICE was critical for decisions on drug reimbursement. Indeed, the first drug appraisal by NICE was on the drug [[Relenza]] which was turned down amidst criticisms from [[Glaxo Wellcome|Glaxo-Wellcome]] that the appraisal had been fast tracked.&lt;ref&gt;NICE put on defensive as ruling on Relenza ends in row over 'leaks' [[Health Service Journal]], 7 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this policy development whereby the criteria for decision making, the role of costs, and the degree to which decisions of NICE and the secretary of state would be binding on clinicians was analysed by [[Andrew Dillon]], Trevor Gibbs, Tim Riley, and [[Trevor Sheldon|Trevor A. Sheldon]].&lt;ref&gt;Milbank Quarterly, September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology appraisals==
Since January 2005, the NHS in [[NHS England|England]] and [[NHS Wales|Wales]] has been legally obliged to provide funding for medicines and treatments recommended by NICE's technology appraisal board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE): How does it work and what are the implications for the U.S.? | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/8737637/National-Institute-for-Health-and-Clinical-Excellence-NICE-How-Does-it-Work-and-What-are-the-Implications-for-the-US-Executive-Summary | accessdate = 2009-09-18 |author1=Sorenson, C |author2=Drummond, M |author3=Kanavos, P |author4=McGuire, A | publisher = [[National Pharmaceutical Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was at least in part as a result of well-publicised postcode lottery anomalies in which certain less-common treatments were funded in some parts of the UK but not in others due to local decision making in the NHS.

Before an appraisal, the Advisory Committee on Topic Selection (ACTS) draws up a list of potential topics of clinical significance for appraisal. The [[Secretary of State for Health]] or the [[Welsh Assembly]] must then refer any technology so that the appraisal process can be formally initiated. Once this has been done NICE works with the Department of Health to draw up the scope of the appraisal.

NICE then invites consultee and commentator organisations to take part in the appraisal. A consultee organisation would include patient groups, organisations representing health care professionals and the manufacturers of the product undergoing appraisal. Consultees submit evidence during the appraisal and comment on the appraisal documents. Commentator organisations include the manufacturers of products to which the product undergoing appraisal is being compared. They comment on the documents that have been submitted and drawn up but do not actually submit information themselves.

An independent academic centre then draws together and analyses all of the published information on the technology under appraisal and prepares an assessment report. This can be commented on by the Consultees and Commentators. Comments are then taken into account and changes made to the assessment report to produce an evaluation report. An independent Appraisal Committee then looks at the evaluation report, hears spoken testimony from clinical experts, patient groups and carers. They take their testimony into account and draw up a document known as the 'appraisal consultation document'. This is sent to all consultees and commentators who are then able to make further comments. Once these comments have been taken into account the final document is drawn up called the 'final appraisal determination'. This is submitted to NICE for approval.

The process aims to be fully independent of government and lobbying power, basing decisions fully on clinical and cost-effectiveness. There have been concerns that [[lobbying]] by pharmaceutical companies to mobilise media attention and influence public opinion are attempts to influence the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5063352.stm | title = Herceptin: Was patient power key? | date = 2006-06-09 | accessdate = 2008-11-13 | last = Berg | first = Sanchia | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fast-track assessment system has been introduced to reach decisions where there is most pressure for a conclusion.

==Clinical guidelines==

NICE carries out assessments of the most appropriate treatment regimes for different diseases. This must take into account both desired medical outcomes (i.e. the best possible result for the patient) and also economic arguments regarding differing treatments.

NICE has set up several National Collaborating Centres bringing together expertise from the royal medical colleges, professional bodies and patient/carer organisations which draw up the guidelines. The centres are the [[National Collaborating Centre for Cancer]], the [[National Clinical Guideline Centre]], the [[National Collaborating Centre for Women and Children´s Health]], and the [[National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/aboutnice/howwework/developingniceclinicalguidelines/nationalcollaboratingcentres/national_collaborating_centres.jsp%7ctitle=About%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=About%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=About%7cwork=nice.org.uk|title=About|work=nice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Collaborating Centre appoints a Guideline Development Group whose job it is to work on the development of the clinical guideline. This group consists of medical professionals, representatives of patient and carer groups and technical experts. They work together to assess the evidence for the guideline topic (e.g. [[clinical trial]]s of competing products) before preparing a draft guideline. There are then two consultation periods in which stakeholder organisations are able to comment on the draft guideline. After the second consultation period, an independent Guideline Review Panel reviews the guideline and stakeholder comments and ensures that these comments have been taken into account. The Guideline Development Group then finalises the recommendations and the National Collaboration Centre produces the final guideline. This is submitted to NICE to formally approve the guideline and issue the guidance to the NHS.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} To date NICE has produced more than 200 different guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/published?type=guidelines|title = Guidance List|date = |accessdate = 8 October 2014|website = nice.org.uk|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 [[Andy Burnham]] said that a Labour government could reduce variation in access to drugs and procedures by making it mandatory for commissioners to follow NICE clinical guidelines. "We need to look at how you strengthen NICE. Where they have said something is effective and affordable, on what basis does a local commissioner withhold that from somebody? I’m not comfortable with that. I don’t support that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Labour could make NICE guidance mandatory|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-labour-could-make-nice-guidance-mandatory/5076286.article#.VHNoSfmsUk4|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICE has a service called Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) which provides primary care practitioners with a readily accessible summary of the current evidence base and practical guidance.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Smith|title=Guide to the Primary Care Guidelines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzfPI3h4U-AC&amp;pg=PR6|year=2008|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|isbn=978-1-85775-734-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReesSmith2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith A Rees|author2=Ian Smith|author3=Jennie Watson|title=Pharmaceutical Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMGdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|year=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences UK|isbn=978-0-7020-5282-8|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social care guidance==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}

Under the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act]] 2012, NICE was given responsibility for developing guidance and quality standards for [[social care]], using an evidence-based model. This is being delivered by the NICE Collaborating Centre for Social Care (NCCSC), which is hosted by the [[Social Care Institute for Excellence]] (SCIE) and 4 partner organisations - Research in Practice, Research in Practice for Adults, [[Personal Social Services Research Unit]] and the [[EPPI-Centre]].

NICE receives referrals for social care guidance from the Department of Health and the [[Department for Education]], and commission the guidance from the NCCSC. NICE, along with the NCCSC, carries out a scoping exercise with a scoping group and with input from key stakeholders, at both a workshop and a public consultation, to ensure the guidance to be produced is focused and achievable. A [[Chairman|chairperson]] and members of the Guidance Development Group are appointed, and pose review questions which will enable systematic evidence reviews to take place, thus delivering the guidance and subsequent recommendations. Service user and carer involvement takes place throughout, as well as public consultation on the draft guidance.

The Guidance Development Group then finalises the recommendations and the NCCSC produces the final guideline. This is submitted to NICE for formal approval and publication. The entire process from pre-scoping to publication takes approximately 24 months. The guidance is then available to NICE standing committees to develop a quality standard on the topic. The quality standard is developed using the guidance and other accredited sources, to produce high-level concise statements that can be used for quality improvement by social care providers and commissioners, as well as setting out what service users and carers can expect of high quality social care services.

The NCCSC is unique within NICE, in that it is the only collaborating centre to have responsibility for the adoption and dissemination support for guidance and quality standards in the [[Social work|social care arena]]. Drawing on the expertise of SCIE and their partners within the sector, each of the guidance products and quality standards have a needs assessment carried out to determine the requirements for tools to help embed the guidance and quality standards within the sector. These can include tailored versions of guidance for specific audiences, costing and commissioning tools and even training and learning packages.

As of August 2013, NICE and the NCCSC had scheduled guidance delivery for five topics: [[Home care|domiciliary care]], older adults with long-term conditions, transition between health and social care settings, transition from children's to adults' services and child abuse and neglect.

==Cost–effectiveness==

As with any system financing health care, the NHS has a limited budget and a vast number of potential spending options. Choices must be made as to how this limited budget is spent. [[Economic evaluation]]s are carried out within a [[health technology assessment]] framework to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative activities and to consider the [[opportunity cost]] associated with their decisions.&lt;ref name="Health Care Programmes 2005"&gt;Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes, Drummond et al (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing to spend the finite NHS budget upon those treatment options that provide the most efficient results, society can ensure it does not lose out on possible health gains through spending on inefficient treatments and neglecting those that are more efficient.

NICE attempts to assess the cost–effectiveness of potential expenditures within the NHS to assess whether or not they represent 'better value' for money than treatments that would be neglected if the expenditure took place. It assesses the cost–effectiveness of new treatments by analysing the cost and benefit of the proposed treatment relative to the next best treatment that is currently in use.&lt;ref&gt;NICE guidance, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality-adjusted life years===

NICE guidance supports the use of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) as the primary outcome for quantifying the expected health benefits associated with a given treatment regime. By comparing the present value (see [[discounting]]) of expected QALY flows with and without treatment, or relative to another treatment, the net/relative health benefit derived from such a treatment can be derived. When combined with the relative cost of treatment, this information can be used to estimate an [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER), which is considered in relation to NICE's threshold willingness-to-pay value.&lt;ref name="Health Care Programmes 2005"/&gt;

As a guideline rule, NICE accepts as cost-effective those interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than £20,000 per QALY and that there should be increasingly strong reasons for accepting as cost-effective interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of over a threshold of £30,000 per QALY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/niceMedia/pdf/GuidelinesManualChapter8.pdf |format=PDF |title=NICE Guideline Manual: Incorporating health economics in guidelines and assessing resource impact |website=nice.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925050527/http://www.nice.org.uk/niceMedia/pdf/GuidelinesManualChapter8.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, there has been great controversy as to what value this threshold should be set at. Initially, there was no fixed number. But the appraisal teams created a consensus amount of about £30,000. However, in November 2008 [[Alan Johnson]], the then Secretary of State, announced that for end-of-life cancer drugs the threshold could be increased above £30,000. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Johnson lifts NHS ban on top-up treatment | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/04/nhs-health-cancer-topup-treatment |date=4 November 2008| accessdate = 14 September 2014 | last1 = Boseley |first1= S |last2= Sparrow |first2=A | work = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first drug to go through the new process was [[Lenalidomide]], whose ICER was £43,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final appraisal determination: Lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma in people who have received at least one prior therapy |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11937/43868/43868.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-13 |author=Appraisal Committee |publisher=nice.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327103851/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11937/43868/43868.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained===

The following example from NICE explains the QALY principle and the application of the cost per QALY calculation.

A patient has a life-threatening condition and is expected to live on average for 1 year receiving the current best treatment which costs the NHS £3,000. A new drug becomes available that will extend the life of the patient by three months and improve his or her quality of life, but the new treatment will cost the NHS more than three times as much at £10,000. Patients score their perceived quality of life on a scale from 0 to 1 with 0 being worst possible health and 1 being best possible health. On the standard treatment, quality of life is rated with a score of 0.4 but it improves to 0.6 with the new treatment. Patients on the new treatment on average live an extra 3 months, so 1.25 years in total. The quality of life gained is the product of ''life span'' and ''quality rating'' with the new treatment less the same calculation for the old treatment, i.e. &lt;span&gt;(1.25 x 0.6)&lt;/span&gt; less &lt;span&gt;(1.0 x 0.4)&lt;/span&gt; = 0.35 QALY. The marginal cost of the new treatment to deliver this extra gain is £7,000 so the cost per quality life year gained is £7000/0.35 or £20,000. This is within the £20,000-£30,000 that is suggested by NICE to be the limit for drugs to be cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp Measuring effectiveness and quality effectiveness - the QALY] National Institute for clinical effectiveness&lt;/ref&gt;

If the patient was expected to live only one month extra and instead of three then NICE would issue a recommendation not to fund. The patient's [[NHS primary care trust|Primary Care Trust]]{{update inline|date=December 2014}} could still decide to fund the new treatment, but if not, the patient would then have two choices. He or she could opt to take the free NHS standard treatment, or he or she may decide to pay out of pocket to obtain the benefit of the new treatment from a different health care provider. If the person has a private health insurance policy the person could check to see whether the private insurance provider will fund the new treatment. About 8% of the population has some private health insurance from an employer or trade association and 2% pay from their own resources.

===Basis of recommendations===

Theoretically, it might be possible to draw up a table of all possible treatments sorted by increasing the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Those treatments with lowest cost per quality-adjusted life year gained would appear at the top of the table and deliver the most benefit per value spent and would be easiest to justify funding for. Those where the delivered benefit is low and the cost is high would appear at the bottom of the list. Decision makers would, theoretically, work down the table, adopting services that are the most cost effective. The point at which the NHS budget is exhausted would reveal the [[shadow price]], the threshold lying between the CQG gained of the last service that is funded and that of the next most cost effective service that is not funded.

In practice this exercise is not done, but an assumed shadow price has been used by NICE for many years in its assessments to determine which treatments the NHS should and should not fund. NICE states that for drugs the cost per QALY should not normally exceed £30,000 but that there is not a hard threshold,&lt;ref name="Quality Adjusted Life Year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp%7ctitle=News%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=News%7cwork=nice.org.uk%7ctitle=News%7cwork=nice.org.uk|title=News|work=nice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; though research has shown that any threshold is "somewhat higher" than being in the range £35,000 - £40,000.&lt;ref name="Quality Adjusted Life Year"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Does NICE have a cost effectiveness threshold and what other factors influence its decisions?

The [[Health Select Committee|House of Commons Health Select Committee]], in its report on NICE, stated in 2008 that "the (...) cost-per-QALY it uses to decide whether a treatment is cost-effective is of serious concern. The threshold it employs is not based on empirical research and is not directly related to the NHS budget, nor is it at the same level as that used by Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in providing treatments not assessed by NICE, which tends to be lower. Some witnesses, including patient organisations and pharmaceutical companies, thought NICE should be more generous in the cost per QALY threshold it uses, and should approve more products. On the other hand, some PCTs struggle to implement NICE guidance at the current threshold and other witnesses argued that a lower level should be used. However, there are many uncertainties about the thresholds used by PCTs." It went on to recommend that "an independent body should determine the threshold used when making judgements of the value of drugs to the NHS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhealth/27/27.pdf|format=PDF|title=House of Commons Health Committee: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence - First Report of Session 2007-08|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The work that NICE is involved in attracts the attention of many groups, including doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, and patients. NICE is often associated with controversy, because the need to make decisions at a national level can conflict with what is (or is believed to be) in the best interests of an individual patient.

Approved cancer drugs and treatments such as [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] are funded by the NHS without any financial contribution being taken from the patient. Where NICE has approved a treatment, the NHS must fund it. But not all treatments have been assessed by NICE and these treatments are usually dependent on local NHS decision making. In the case of cancer the [[Cancer Drugs Fund]] was set up in 2011 after complaints about NICE decisions on new and expensive cancer drugs with limited benefits.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Treatment for fertility problems are approved but not always funded by [[clinical commissioning group]]s and they may cap the number of rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-cost-nhs.html |title=NHS IVF and Fertility Treatment – Funding Options |publisher=Hfea.gov.uk |date=2015-01-06 |accessdate=2015-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127204213/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-cost-nhs.html |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICE has been criticised for being too slow to reach decisions. On one occasion, the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] said it was outraged over its delayed decision for further guidance regarding two drugs for [[macular degeneration]] that are already approved for use in the NHS. However the Department of Health said that it had 'made it clear to PCTs that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from NICE is unavailable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | title=Media release (14 June 2007) | url = http://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus/mediacentre/mediareleases/media2007/Pages/mediarelease14jun2007.aspx | date = 2007-08-08 | accessdate = 2008-11-13 | publisher = [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more controversial NICE decisions have concerned [[donepezil]], [[galantamine]], [[rivastigmine]] (review) and [[memantine]] for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[bevacizumab]], [[sorafenib]], [[sunitinib]] and [[temsirolimus]] for [[renal cell carcinoma]]. All these are drugs with a high cost per treatment and NICE has either rejected or restricted their use in the NHS on the grounds that they are not cost-effective.

A Conservative shadow minister once criticized NICE for spending more on communications than assessments. In its defence, NICE said the majority of its communications budget was spent informing doctors about which drugs had been approved and new guidelines for treatments and that the actual cost of assessing new drugs for the NHS includes money spent on NICE's behalf by the Department of Health. When these were added to NICE's own costs, the total cost of the technology appraisal programme far outstrips the cost of NICE communications.

A report from the [[University of York]] Centre for Health Economics written by [[Karl Claxton]] in February 2015 suggested that the maximum threshold, currently around £30,000 a year, for judging a medicine cost-effective should be more than halved. They found that any intervention costing more than £13,000 per [[Quality-adjusted life year]] risked causing more harm than good by denying cost effective treatment to other patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expensive drugs cost lives, claims report|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d00c4a02-b784-11e4-981d-00144feab7de.html#axzz3ldCBJUxL|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Financial Times|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's approach to the introduction of new oral therapy for [[Hepatitis C]] has been criticised. [[Sofosbuvir]] was approved in 2015. It costs about £30,000 for 12 weeks treatment. [[NHS England]] established 22 Operational Delivery Networks to roll out delivery and proposes to fund 10,000 courses of treatment in 2016-17. Each has been given a “run rate” of how many patients they are allowed to treat. This is the NHS’ single biggest new treatment investment this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England rollout of ground-breaking drugs 'changes role of NICE'|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/policy-and-regulation/nhs-england-rollout-of-ground-breaking-drugs-changes-role-of-nice/7003752.article|accessdate=14 May 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the North East London network patients with [[cirrhosis]] or [[fibrosis]] go to the front of the queue and three new patients at the Grahame Hayton Unit at the [[Royal London Hospital]] start treatment each month. Those without such complications may faced considerable delays before they start treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Christopher Baldwin: "We need better access to treatment for gay men living with HIV and Hep C"|url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/36173/philip-baldwin-need-better-access-treatment-gay-men-living-hiv-hep-c/|accessdate=14 May 2016|publisher=Gay Times|date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nephritis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[kidneys]] and may involve the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]], [[Mesonephric tubule|tubules]], or [[medullary interstitium |interstitial tissue]] surrounding the glomeruli and tubules.&lt;ref&gt;Keto Acids – Advances in Research and Application 2013 Edition p.220e&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated medical conditions==

===Types===
* [[Glomerulonephritis]] is inflammation of the [[glomeruli]]. Glomerulonephritis is often implied when using the term "nephritis" without qualification.&lt;ref name="nih2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glomerulonephritis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000484.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Interstitial nephritis]] (or tubulo-interstitial nephritis) is inflammation of the spaces between [[renal tubule]]s.&lt;ref name="nih1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interstitial nephritis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000464.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Nephritis is often caused by infections, and toxins, but is most commonly caused  by autoimmune disorders that affect the major organs like kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acute Nephritis; Nephrosis; Nephritic syndrome information. Patient {{!}} Patient|url=http://patient.info/doctor/acute-nephritis|website=Patient|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Pyelonephritis]] is inflammation that results from a [[urinary tract infection]] that reaches the [[renal pelvis]] of the kidney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pyelonephritis: Kidney Infection|url = http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/kidney-disease/pyelonephritis-kidney-infection/Pages/index.aspx|website = www.niddk.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lupus nephritis]] is inflammation of the kidney caused by [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), a disease of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lupus Nephritis|url = http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/kidney-disease/lupus-nephritis/Pages/index.aspx|website = www.niddk.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Athletic nephritis is nephritis resulting from strenuous exercise.&lt;ref name="esagil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nephritis Symptoms|url=http://esagil.org/Nephritis-Description.aspx|website=esagil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloody urine after strenuous exercise may also result from [[march hemoglobinuria]], which is caused by trauma to [[red blood cell]]s, causing [[hemolysis|their rupture]], which leads to the release of hemoglobin into the urine.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Mechanism==
[[File:Renin-angiotensin system in man shadow.svg|150 px|thumb|Renin–angiotensin system]]
Nephritis can produce glomerular injury, by disturbing the glomerular structure with inflammatory cell proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glomerular Diseases|url = http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/kidney-disease/glomerular-diseases/Pages/facts.aspx|website = www.niddk.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to reduced glomerular blood flow, leading to reduced urine output ([[oliguria]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliguria: Background, Etiology, Epidemiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/983156-overview|website=Medscape|publisher=eMedicine|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retention of waste products ([[uremia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = uremia {{!}} accumulation in the blood of constituents normally eliminated in the urine that produces a severe toxic condition and usually occurs in severe kidney disease|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/uremia|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, red blood cells may leak out of damaged glomeruli, causing blood to appear in the urine ([[hematuria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hematuria (Blood in the Urine)|url = http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/urologic-disease/hematuria-blood-in-the-urine/Pages/facts.aspx|website = www.niddk.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low renal blood flow activates the [[renin–angiotensin system|renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system]] (RAAS), causing fluid retention and mild [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Johns Hopkins Internal Medicine Board Review: Certification and Recertification|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m3iwi7Wix8kC&amp;pg=PA51 |publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences|date = 2012-02-20|isbn = 0323087981|language = en|first = Bimal|last = Ashar|first2 = Redonda|last2 = Miller|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Sisson|first4 = Johns Hopkins|last4 = Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the kidneys inflame, they begin to excrete needed protein from the affected individual's body into the urine stream. This condition is called [[proteinuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proteinuria|url = http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/kidney-disease/proteinuria/Pages/facts.aspx|website = www.niddk.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of necessary protein due to nephritis can result in several life-threatening symptoms. The most serious complication of nephritis can occur if there is significant loss of the proteins that keep blood from clotting excessively. Loss of these proteins can result in blood clots, causing sudden stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Lupus Encyclopedia: A Comprehensive Guide for Patients and Families|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8V2RAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 |publisher = JHU Press|date = 2014-05-22|isbn = 9781421409849|language = en|first = Donald E. Thomas|last = Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis depends on the cause of the nephritis, in the case of lupus nephritis, [[blood tests]], X-rays and an ultrasound can help ascertain if the individual has the condition.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=American College of Rheumatology guidelines for screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis. {{!}} National Guideline Clearinghouse|url=https://www.guideline.gov/summaries/summary/36900?|website=www.guideline.gov|accessdate=23 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915235645/https://www.guideline.gov/summaries/summary/36900|archive-date=15 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment (or management) of nephritis depends on what has provoked the inflammation of the kidney(s). In the case of lupus nephritis, hydroxychloroquine could be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroxychloroquine: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601240.html|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Prevalence===
Nephritis represents the ninth most common cause of death among all women in the US (and the fifth leading cause among non-[[Hispanic]] black women).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leading Causes of Death - Women's Health USA 2010|url = http://mchb.hrsa.gov/whusa10/hstat/hi/pages/208lcd.html|website = mchb.hrsa.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''non-communicable disease''' ('''NCD''') is a [[disease]] that is not [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] directly from one person to another. NCDs include [[parkinson's disease]] [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[stroke]]s, most [[heart disease]]s, most [[cancer]]s, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cataract]]s, and others. NCDs may be [[chronic condition|chronic]] or [[acute (medicine)|acute]]. Most are non-[[infection|infectious]], although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as [[parasitic disease]]s in which the parasite's [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] does not include direct host-to-host transmission. 

NCDs are the leading cause of death globally. In 2012, they caused 68% of all deaths (38 million) up from 60% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The top 10 causes of death|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half were under age 70 and half were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/topics/noncommunicable_diseases/en/ |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment increase the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people die because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High cholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because of [[high blood pressure]].

== Risk factors ==
[[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, [[gender]], [[genetics]], exposure to [[air pollution]], and behaviors such as [[smoking]], [[Healthy diet|unhealthy diet]] and [[Sedentary lifestyle|physical inactivity]] which can lead to [[hypertension]] and [[obesity]], in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors.

The WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2002'']] identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised [[cholesterol]], tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the "[social determinants of health]."

It has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and [[type 2 diabetes]] and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs .

==Environmental diseases==
NCDs include many environmental diseases covering a broad category of avoidable and unavoidable [[health|human health]] conditions caused by external factors, such as sunlight, nutrition, pollution, and lifestyle choices.  The [[diseases of affluence]] are non-infectious diseases with environmental causes.  Examples include:
* Many types of [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD)
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) caused by smoking tobacco
* [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]
* [[Lower back pain]] caused by too little exercise
* [[Malnutrition]] caused by too little food, or eating the wrong kinds of food (e.g. [[scurvy]] from lack of [[Vitamin C]])
* [[Skin cancer]] caused by radiation from the sun
* [[Obesity]]

=== Inherited diseases ===
{{See also|List of genetic disorders}}
[[Genetic disorders]] are caused by errors in genetic information that produce diseases in the affected people.
The origin of these genetic errors can be:
* Spontaneous errors or mutations to the [[genome]]:
:* A change in chromosome [[Chromosomal condition|numbers]], such as [[Down syndrome]].
:* A defect in a gene caused by [[mutation]], such as [[Cystic fibrosis]].
:* An increase in the [[Mosaic (genetics)|amount]] of genetic information, such as [[Chimera (genetics)|Chimerism]] or [[Heterochromia iridum|Heterochromia]].

Cystic fibrosis is an example of an inherited disease that is caused by a mutation on a gene. The faulty gene impairs the normal movement of sodium chloride in and out of cells, which causes the mucus-secreting organs to produce abnormally thick mucus. The gene is recessive, meaning that a person must have two copies of the faulty gene for them to develop the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as the sweat glands. The mucus secreted is very thick and blocks passageways in the lungs and digestive tracts. This mucus causes problems with breathing and with the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
* Inherited genetic errors from [[Kinship#Descent and the family|parents]]:
:* [[Dominance (genetics)|Dominant]] genetic diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntingtons]], require the inheritance of [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|one]] erroneous gene to be expressed.
:* [[Recessive]] genetic diseases require the inheritance of erroneous genes to be expressed and this is one reason they work together.

== Global health ==

Referred to as a "lifestyle" disease, because the majority of these diseases are preventable illnesses, the most common causes for non-communicable diseases (NCD) include tobacco use (smoking), alcohol abuse, poor diets (high consumption of sugar, salt, saturated fats, and trans fatty acids) and physical inactivity. Currently, NCD kills 36 million people a year, a number that by some estimates is expected to rise by 17–24% within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‘Epidemic Proportions’ in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm |date=19 September 2011 |website=United Nations |publisher=Department of Public Information |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many NCDs were associated with economic development and were so-called a "[[diseases of affluence|diseases of the rich]]". The burden of non-communicable diseases in developing countries has increased however, with an estimated 80% of the four main types of NCDs — cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes — now occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of non-communicable Diseases and with two-thirds of people who are affected by diabetes now residing in developing nations, NCD can no longer be considered just a problem affecting affluent estimation of the economic impact of chronic non-communicable diseases in selected countries. New WHO report: deaths from non-communicable diseases are on the rise, with developing world hit hardest. As previously stated, in 2008 alone, NCD's were the cause of  63% of deaths worldwide; a number that is expected to rise considerably in the near future if measures are not taken.

If present growth trends are maintained, by 2020, NCDs will attribute to 7 out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, killing 52 million people annually worldwide by 2030. With statistics such as these, it comes as no surprise that international entities such as the World Health Organization &amp; World Bank Human Development Network have identified the prevention and control of NCDs as an increasingly important discussion item on the [[global health]] agenda.

Thus, should policy makers and communities mobilize "and make prevention and targeted treatment of such diseases a priority," sustainable measures can be implemented to stagnate (and eventually even reverse) this emerging global health threat.  Potential measures currently being discussed by the(World Health Organization)-Food and Agriculture Organization includes reducing the levels of salt in foods, limiting inappropriate marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, imposing controls on harmful alcohol use, raising taxes on tobacco, and curbing legislation to curb smoking in public places.

=== United Nations ===
The [[World Health Organization]] is the specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that acts as coordinating authority on international [[public health]] issues, including NCDs. In May 2008, the 193 Member States of the WHO approved a six-year plan to address non-communicable diseases, especially the rapidly increasing burden in low- and middle-income countries. The plan calls for raising the priority given to NCDs in [[international development]] work'.

During the 64th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2010, a resolution was passed to call for a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and treatment NCDs with the participation of heads of state and government. The resolution also encouraged UN Member States to address the issue of non-communicable diseases at the 2010 Review Summit for the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global Non-communicable Disease Network ===
In order to better coordinate efforts around the globe, in 2009 the WHO announced the launch of the ''Global Non-communicable Disease Network'' (NCDnet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New network to combat noncommunicable diseases |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/noncommunicable_diseases_20090708/en/index.html |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCDnet will consist of leading health organizations and experts from around the world in order to fight against diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Ala Alwan, assistant director-general for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health at the WHO, said: "integrating the prevention of non-communicable diseases and injuries into the national and global development agendas is not only achievable but also a priority for developing countries."&lt;ref name="Business"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who's action against non-communicable diseases|author=Alexander Chiejina|newspaper=Business Day Weekend |date=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCD Alliance ===
The NCD Alliance is a global partnership founded in May 2009 by four international federations representing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], and chronic [[respiratory disease]]. The NCD Alliance brings together roughly 900 national member associations to fight non-communicable disease. Long term aims of the Alliance include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdalliance.org/aboutus |title=About Us |author=The NCD Alliance |publisher=The NCD Alliance |accessdate=4 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504050001/http://ncdalliance.org/aboutus |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# NCD/disease [[health policy|national plans]] for all
# A tobacco free world
# Improved lifestyles
# Strengthened [[health system]]s
# Global access to affordable and good quality medicines and technologies
# [[Human rights]] for people with NCDs.

=== United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases (UNIATF) ===
The [[United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs|United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases]] (UNIATF) was established by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] in 2013 in order to provide scaled up action across the UN system to support governments, in particular in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs).

=== Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network ===
The Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network, or commonly referred to as YP-CDN, is a global network of roughly 5000 young professionals across 157 countries. The organization aims to mobilize these young people "to take action against social injustice driven by NCDs.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdaction.org/history|title=History |author=YP-CDN |publisher=YP-CDN |accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Previously, chronic NCDs were considered a problem limited mostly to [[high income economy|high income countries]], while [[infectious diseases]] seemed to affect [[low income countries]]. The burden of disease attributed to NCDs has been estimated at 85% in industrialized nations, 70% in middle income nations, and nearly 50% in countries with the lowest national incomes.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Preventing Chronic Diseases a Vital Investment |journal=Cataloguing-in-Publication Data |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, chronic NCDs accounted for more than 60% (over 35 million) of the 57 million deaths worldwide. Given the global population distribution, almost 80% of deaths due to chronic NCDs worldwide now occur in low and middle income countries, while only 20% occur in higher income countries.

National economies are reportedly suffering significant losses because of premature deaths or inability to work resulting from heart disease, stroke and diabetes. For instance, China is expected to lose roughly $558 billion in national income between 2005 and 2015 due to early deaths. In 2005, heart disease, stroke and diabetes caused an estimated loss in [[international dollar]]s of national income of 9 billion in India and 3 billion in Brazil.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"/&gt;

=== Absenteeism and presenteeism ===
{{main | Absenteeism | Presenteeism}}

The burden of chronic NCDs including [[mental health]] conditions is felt in workplaces around the world, notably due to elevated levels of [[absenteeism]], or absence from work because of illness, and [[presenteeism]], or productivity lost from staff coming to work and performing below normal standards due to poor [[health]]. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a loss of about 175 million days in 2006 to absence from illness among a working population of 37.7 million people. The estimated cost of absences due to illness was over 20 billion pounds in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper C, Dewe P |title=Well-being—absenteeism, presenteeism, costs and challenges |journal=Occup Med (Lond) |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=522–4 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19054749 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn124|last2=Dewe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost due to presenteeism is likely even larger, although methods of analyzing the economic impacts of presenteeism are still being developed. Methods for analyzing the distinct workplace impacts of NCDs versus other types of health conditions are also still being developed.

== Key diseases ==

=== Cancer ===
{{main | Cancer}}

For the vast majority of cancers, risk factors are environmental or lifestyle-related, thus cancers are mostly preventable NCD.&lt;ref name=Danaei&gt;{{cite journal |author= Danaei G, Vander Hoorn S, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Ezzati M |title= Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9499 |pages=1784–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16298215 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2|last2= Vander Hoorn |last3= Lopez |last4= Murray |last5= Ezzati |author6= Comparative Risk Assessment collaborating group (Cancers) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater than 30% of cancer is preventable via avoiding risk factors including: [[tobacco]], being [[overweight]] or [[obesity]], low fruit and vegetable intake, [[physical inactivity]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ |title=Cancer |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infectious agents are responsible for some cancers, for instance almost all [[cervical cancer]]s are caused by [[human papillomavirus]] infection.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
{{main | Cardiovascular disease}}

The first studies on cardiovascular health were performed in 1949 by [[Jerry Morris]] using occupational health data and were published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris JN, Crawford MD |title=Coronary heart disease and physical activity of work; evidence of a national necropsy survey |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5111 |pages=1485–96 |date=December 1958 |pmid=13608027 |pmc=2027542 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5111.1485|last2=Crawford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of [[biomedical research]], with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis. A trend has emerged, particularly in the early 2000s, in which numerous studies have revealed a link between fast food and an increase in heart disease. These studies include those conducted by the Ryan Mackey Memorial Research Institute, Harvard University and the Sydney Center for Cardiovascular Health. Many major fast food chains, particularly McDonald's, have protested the methods used in these studies and have responded with healthier menu options.

A fairly recent emphasis is on the link between low-grade [[inflammation]] that hallmarks atherosclerosis and its possible interventions. [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) is a common inflammatory marker that has been found to be present in increased levels in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20024640|year=2009|last1=Karakas|first1=M|last2=Koenig|first2=W|title=CRP in cardiovascular disease|volume=34|issue=8|pages=607–13|doi=10.1007/s00059-009-3305-7|journal=Herz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also [[osteoprotegerin]] which involved with regulation of a key inflammatory transcription factor called [[NF-κB]] has been found to be a risk factor of cardiovascular disease and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20448212|year=2010|last1=Lieb|first1=W|last2=Gona|first2=P|last3=Larson|first3=MG|last4=Massaro|first4=JM|last5=Lipinska|first5=I|last6=Keaney Jr|first6=JF|last7=Rong|first7=J|last8=Corey|first8=D|last9=Hoffmann|first9=U|last10=Fox|first10=C.

=== Diabetes ===
{{main | Diabetes}}

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition which is largely preventable and manageable but difficult to cure.  Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal ("euglycemia") as possible without presenting undue [[patient]] danger.  This can usually be with close dietary management, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin only in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Oral medications may be used in the case of type 2 diabetes, as well as insulin).

Patient education, understanding, and participation is vital since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Intensive diabetes treatment and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=353 |issue=25 |pages=2643–53 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16371630 |pmc=2637991 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052187 |last1=Nathan |first1=DM |last2=Cleary |first2=PA |last3=Backlund |first3=JY |last4=Genuth |first4=SM |last5=Lachin|first5=JM|last6=Orchard|first6=TJ|last7=Raskin|first7=P|last8=Zinman|first8=B|author9=Diabetes Control Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Group  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The effect of intensive diabetes therapy on the development and progression of neuropathy.

Wider health problems may accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and lack of regular [[exercise]].

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
{{main|Chronic kidney disease}}

Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not currently identified as one of WHO's main targets for global NCD control, there is compelling evidence that CKD is not only common, harmful and treatable but also a major contributing factor to the incidence and outcomes of at least three of the diseases targeted by WHO (diabetes, hypertension and CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang |first=Q.L. |last2=Rothenbacher |first2=D. |title=Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in population-based studies: systematic review|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-117 |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |pages=117 |year=2008 |pmid=18405348 |pmc=2377260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CKD strongly predisposes to hypertension and CVD; diabetes, hypertension and CVD are all major causes of CKD; and major risk factors for diabetes, hypertension and CVD (such as obesity and smoking) also cause or exacerbate CKD. In addition, among people with diabetes, hypertension, or CVD, the subset who also have CKD are at highest risk of adverse outcomes and high health care costs. Thus, CKD, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are closely associated conditions that often coexist; share common risk factors and treatments; and would benefit from a coordinated global approach to prevention and control.

=== Chronic respiratory disease ===
''Main Article: [[Respiratory disease#Chronic respiratory disease|Chronic respiratory disease]]''

Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the lungs and airways.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) hundreds of millions of people suffer daily from CRDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/about_topic/en/|title=WHO {{!}} About chronic respiratory diseases|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common CRDs are: [[Asthma]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[Occupational lung disease]], and [[Pulmonary hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/en/|title=Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While CRDs are not curable, various treatments are available to help improve quality of life for individuals who have them.  Most treatments involve dilating major airways to improve shortness of breath among other symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The main risk factors for developing CRDs are: tobacco smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens, and occupational risks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WHO helped launch the [[Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases]] (GARD) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GARD is voluntarily composed of national and international organizations and works toward "reducing the global burden of chronic respiratory diseases" and focus mainly on vulnerable populations and low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis''' (OOKP) (also known as "tooth in eye" surgery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.ndc.com.sg/Newsroom/MediaRelease/OOKP25May05.htm| title = TOOTH-IN-EYE (OOKP) SURGERY HELP 8 REGAIN SIGHT| publisher = www.ndc.com.sg| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080304115141/http://www.ndc.com.sg/Newsroom/MediaRelease/OOKP25May05.htm| archivedate = 2008-03-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a medical procedure to restore vision in the most severe cases of corneal and ocular surface patients. It includes removal of a tooth from the patient or a donor.&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/health/lastest-news/sons-tooth-helps-save-dads-sight-1301197.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Anita | last=Guidera | title=Son's tooth helps save dad's sight | date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; After removal, a lamina of tissue cut from the tooth is drilled and the hole is fitted with optics. The lamina is grown in the patients' cheek for a period of months and then is implanted upon the eye.&lt;!--

--&gt; The procedure was pioneered by the Italian ophthalmic surgeon Professor Benedetto Strampelli in the early 1960s. Strampelli was a founder-member of [[The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC)|the International Intra-Ocular Implant Club]] (IIIC) in 1966.&lt;!--

== Medical uses ==

An operation to graft the OOKP is undertaken in severe [[pemphigoid]], [[chemical burn]]s, [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[trachoma]], [[Toxic epidermal necrolysis|Lyell syndrome]] and multiple [[corneal graft]] failure.&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18706878"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Viitala R, Franklin V, Green D, Liu C, Lloyd A, Tighe B |title=Towards a synthetic osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis |journal=[[Acta Biomater]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=438–52 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18706878 |doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2008.07.008 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1742-7061(08)00191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;

There is a significant risk of anatomical failure of lamina in the long term, estimated at about 19% in a small study,&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18511541"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu C, Okera S, Tandon R, Herold J, Hull C, Thorp S |title=Visual rehabilitation in end-stage inflammatory ocular surface disease with the osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis: results from the UK |journal=[[Br J Ophthalmol]] |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=1211–7 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18511541 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2007.130567 |url=http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18511541}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt; with the main risks being laminar [[resorption]], particularly in [[allograft]]s, and [[glaucoma]].

Another, bigger study comparing OOKP with the lesser known osteo-keratoprosthesis (OKP) in 145 and 82 patients and follow-up terms up to 10 years yielded following statistics:

* 10-year anatomical survival: 66% for OOKP and 47% for OKP
*  2-year functional survival: 63% for OOKP and 49% for OKP
* 10-year functional survival: 38% for OOKP and 17% for OKP

with functional survival defined as best corrected visual acuity above 0.05.&lt;!--

--&gt;

Another long-term study of 181 patients puts the chances of retaining an intact OOKP after 18 years at 85%.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16219722"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Falcinelli G, Falsini B, Taloni M, Colliardo P, Falcinelli G |title=Modified osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis for treatment of corneal blindness: long-term anatomical and functional outcomes in 181 cases |journal=[[Arch.

==Procedure==
OOKP is a two-stage operation:&lt;ref name="pmid1390492"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ricci R, Pecorella I, Ciardi A, Della Rocca C, Di Tondo U, Marchi V |title=Strampelli's osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis. Clinical and histological long-term features of three prostheses |journal=[[Br J Ophthalmol]] |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=232llll–4 |date=April 1992 |pmid=1390492 |pmc=504235 |doi= 10.1136/bjo.76.4.232|url=http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1390492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 1''' of the surgery involves five separate procedures:

# The eye is opened up and the entire inner surface of the eyelids, corneal surface and all scar tissue is removed
# Inner mucosal lining of the cheek is transplanted onto the new surface of the eye
# A [[canine tooth|canine]] or [[premolar]] tooth and part of the adjacent bone and ligaments are removed
# A bolt-shaped structure is fashioned from the tooth-bone complex which is fitted with a plastic optical cylinder
# The tooth-bone-cylinder complex is implanted into the patient's cheek to grow a new blood supply

'''Stage 2''' (about 4 months later) involves two separate procedures:

# The cheek mucosal lining over the eye is opened and the inner contents of the eye are removed
# The tooth-bone-cylinder complex is removed from the cheek and inserted into the eye, the mucosal cheek lining is replaced over the implant.

At the end of the procedure, light can now enter through the plastic cylinder, and the patient is able to see through this cylinder with good vision.&lt;ref name="NDC"/&gt;

== History ==

The procedure was pioneered by the Italian ophthalmic surgeon Professor [[:it:Benedetto Strampelli|Benedetto Strampelli]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Benedetto Strampelli]]&lt;/ref&gt; in Rome in the early 1960s.

The son of the geneticist and agronomist [[Nazareno Strampelli]], Benedetto Strampelli held the chair of ophthalmic surgery at Rome's Ospedale di San Giovanni in Laterano where he was one of the first surgeons in Italy to transplant cornea. In 1953 he was the first Italian to implant [[intraocular lens]] which were manufactured to his own design by [[Rayner (company)|Rayners]] in UK. Strampelli was a founder-member with [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Harold Ridley]] and Peter Choyce of [[The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC)|the International Intra-Ocular Implant Club]] (IIIC) in 1966.

'''[[Organic farming]]''' &amp;ndash; alternative agricultural system that relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as [[compost]], [[manure]], [[green manure]], and [[bone meal]] and places emphasis on techniques such as [[crop rotation]] and [[companion planting]]. [[Biological pest control]], mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. In general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2012/01/25/organic-101-allowed-and-prohibited-substances/|title=USDA Blog  » Organic 101: Allowed and Prohibited Substances|website=blogs.usda.gov|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pagophagy''' or '''pagophagia''' is eating of [[ice]].

The term has the two major usages: 
* [[pagophagia]] : an [[eating disorder]], a particular case of [[pica (disorder)|pica]]
* normal feeding behavior of some animals

The pagophagic disorder is among the unexplained [[clinical sign]]s of [[iron deficiency anemia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Anemia", by Ed Uthman, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1998, {{ISBN|1578060397}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2yBl75DJ8_kC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=pagophagia&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=pagophagia&amp;f=false p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Non-invasive cardiac diagnostic service and medical management is provided to patients from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (NWFP), [[FATA]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Preventive community based activities include the School Health Program (SHP), and Man, Mountain and Medicine (MMM).

==Cardiac care==
Over the last 35 years, out outreach  projects have built a data-base of cardiac patients, which with Afghanistan, is one of the world's largest backlog of operable pediatric cardiac cases.

==Location==
In order to enhance its [[humanitarian]] service a charitable cardiac center is on the anvil, on 1.2 acres plot of  land, along with the existing block of building of the MH-IMRC. This project is located on the main boulevard of the new town of [[Hayatabad]], outside the main City of [[Peshawar]], next to the [[Jamrud]] Town, on way to the Pak-Afghan border.

==Training==
The teaching multi-media resource (free downloads and online publications) are in use for professional training programs, with willingness to actively associate with other communities and welfare organizations across the world.

==Affiliations==
Pakistan Heart Foundation is the National Member of the
[[World Heart Federation]], [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldheart.org |title=World Heart Federation: Home |publisher=Worldheart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikimapia.org/17759132/ur/Pakistan-Heart-Foundation-PHF-MH-IMRC |title=Pakistan Heart Foundation [PHF,MH, IMRC&amp;#93; پشاور |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an International Medical Research Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakheart.org/IMRC-1998/IMRC-Introduction.htm |title=D |publisher=Pakheart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a School Health Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakheart.org/School%20Health/SH-introduction.htm |title=1970 |publisher=Pakheart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Mountain Medicine Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakheart.org/MMM/MMM%20Introduction.htm |title=Mountain Medicine Program |publisher=Pakheart.org |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a proposed Mountain Medicine Markaz, [[Chitral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=latAhCfLaZ4 |title=Mountain Medicine Markaz-PHF.mpg |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Pediatrics|pediatric]] intensive care unit''' (also '''paediatric'''), usually abbreviated to '''PICU''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|k|j|uː}}), is an area within a [[hospital]] specializing in the care of critically ill infants, children, and teenagers.  A PICU is typically directed by one or more pediatric [[intensivist]]s or PICU [[consultant (medicine)|consultants]]&lt;ref name="frankel03"&gt;{{cite book| last1  = Frankel | first1 = Lorry R| last2  = DiCarlo | first2 = Joseph V| editor1-last = Bernstein | editor1-first = Daniel| editor2-last = Shelov | editor2-first = Steven P| title  = Pediatrics for Medical Students| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wqt2qGdbulIC| edition = 2nd| year   = 2003| publisher    = Lippincott illiams &amp; Wilkins| location     = Philadelphia| isbn   = 978-0-7817-2941-3| page   = 541| chapter = Pediatric Intensive Care| chapterurl   = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wqt2qGdbulIC&amp;pg=PA541| ref    = frankel03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and staffed by [[Physician|doctor]]s, [[nurse]]s, and [[respiratory therapist]]s who are specially trained and experienced in pediatric intensive care.  The unit may also have [[nurse practitioner]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, [[physiotherapist]]s, [[social worker]]s, [[child life specialist]]s, and [[clerk (position)|clerk]]s on staff, although this varies widely depending on geographic location.

==History of the PICU==
Goran Haglund is credited with establishing the first pediatric ICU in 1955. The PICU was located at Children’s Hospital of Goteburg in Sweden.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=David|last2=Brill|first2=Judith E|date=2005-11-01|title=A History of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine|journal=Pediatric Research|language=en|volume=58|issue=5|pages=987–996|doi=10.1203/01.pdr.0000182822.16263.3d|pmid=16183804|issn=1530-0447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first PICU in the united states, although commonly thought to be the unit at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in 1967 by John Downes,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; was established at Kings County Hospital, East Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY by Dr. Ramon Rodriguez-Torres in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's Medical Center of Brooklyn Kings County Hospital Ctr., University Hospital of Brooklyn: a historical profile.|last=Milman|first=Doris|publisher=Barbara Janice Graphics|year=1989|isbn=|location=Ft. Lauderdale, Florida|pages=39-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;The establishment of these  units would eventually lead to hundreds of PICUs being developed across North American and Europe. This number is still increasing in present day.

There were a variety of factors that lead to the development of PICUs. John Downes identified five specialties of medicine that aided in the development. These specialties included adult respiratory ICUs, neonatal intensive care, pediatric general surgery, pediatric cardiac surgery, and pediatric anesthesiology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Between 1930 and 1950 the [[poliomyelitis]] epidemic had created a greater need for adult respiratory intensive care, including the iron lung. There were times when children would contract polio and would have to be treated in these ICUs as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This contributed to the need for a unit where critically ill children could be treated. Respiratory issues were also increasing in children because neonatal intensive care units were increasing the survival rates of infants. This was due to advances in [[mechanical ventilation]]. However, this resulted in children developing chronic lung diseases, but there was not a specific unit to treat these diseases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Advancements in pediatric general surgery, cardiac surgery, and [[anesthesiology]] were also a driving factor in the development of the PICU. The surgeries that were being performed were becoming more complicated and required more extensive postoperative monitoring. This monitoring could not be performed on the regular pediatric unit, which led to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s development of the first PICU.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Advancements in pediatric anesthesiology resulted in anesthesiologist treating pediatric patients outside of the operating room. This caused pediatricians to obtain skills in anesthesiology in order to make them more capable of treating critically ill pediatric patients. These pediatric anesthesiologists eventually went on to develop run PICUs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== PICU Characteristics ==
There are a variety of PICU characteristics that allow the healthcare providers to deliver the most optimal care possible.  The first of these characteristics is the physical environment of the PICU. The layout of the unit should allow the staff to constantly observe the patients they are caring for. The staff should also be able to rapidly respond to the patients if there is any change in the patient’s clinical status.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmalenberg|first=Claudia|last2=Kramer|first2=Marlene|date=September 2007|title=Types of intensive care units with the healthiest, most productive work environments|journal=American Journal of Critical Care|volume=16|issue=5|pages=458–468; quiz 469|issn=1062-3264|pmid=17724243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Correct staffing is the next vital component to a successful PICU. The nursing staff is highly experienced in providing care to the most critical patients. The nurse to patient ratio should remain low, meaning that the nurses should only be caring for 1-2 patients depending on the clinical status of the patients. If the patient's clinical status is critical, then they will require more monitoring and interventions than a patient that is stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In most cases, the nurses and physicians are caring for the same patients for a long period of time. This allows the providers to build [[rapport]] with the patients, so that all of the patient’s needs are fulfilled. The nurses and physicians must work together as a collaborative team to provide optimal care. The successful collaboration between nurses and physician has resulted in lower mortality rates not just in PICUs, but all [[intensive care units]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Levels of care ==
As medicine has matured over time, the development of the pediatrics intensive care unit has expanded to maintain a level one and a level two PICU. Among these two different levels, they are able to provide critical care and stabilization for each child before transferring to a different acuity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 1993|title=Guidelines and levels of care for pediatric intensive care units. Committee on Hospital Care of the American Academy of Pediatrics and Pediatric Section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine|journal=Pediatrics|volume=92|issue=1|pages=166–175|issn=0031-4005|pmid=8516070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the level one PICU, health care team members must be capable of providing a wide variety of care that typically involves intensive, rapidly changing, and progressive approach. In the level two PICU, patients will present with less complex acuity and will be more stable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Conditions Requiring the PICU ==
Respiratory issues including [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), [[asthma]], [[apnea]], [[sepsis]], [[Major trauma|trauma]] (may include abuse), [[congenital heart defects]], [[mechanical ventilation]], and complications of [[diabetes]] [[(ketoacidosis)|ketoacidosis]]. Gastrointestinal conditions include [[gastrointestinal perforations]], [[cancer]] / [[chemotherapy]], [[organ transplants]] (kidney, heart), [[seizures]], and [[poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brennerchildrens.org|title=Brenner Children's Hospital - Pediatric Hospital in North Carolina|website=www.brennerchildrens.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PICU Nurse Skills and Certifications ==
As a PICU nurse, extended knowledge and certifications may be required. Recognition and interpretation are two of the many required skills for a PICU nurse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This allows nurses to be able to detect any changes in the patient's condition and to respond accordingly. Other skills may include route of administration, [[resuscitation]], respiratory and cardiac interventions, preparation and maintenance of patient monitors, and psycho-social skills to ensure comfort of patient and family.

There are a variety of certificates that are required for registered nurses to acquire in order to work in the PICU. One of these certifications is the Critical Care Registered Nurse (pediatric) certificate. This certificate allows nurses to care for critically ill pediatric patients in any setting, not just the PICU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aacn.org/certification/get-certified/ccrn-peds|title=CCRN Pediatric Certification|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aacn.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other certificates include [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], [[pediatric basic life support]], and pediatric advance life support.

== Hospital Team ==
In the PICU, it is important that all team members hold a wide variability of training and experience in order to provide high quality care. Due to different priorities among inter-professionals, the PICU care team includes many different roles. (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, child life, intensivists, cardiologists, physical / occupational therapists, social workers) Each member of the inter-professional team are highly skilled and trained to deliver the best care for each and every child. It is important for each one to introduce themselves to the family and to explain their role to hopefully expand understanding to family members.

== Factors Leading to Poor Outcomes in PICU Patients ==
The patients in the PICU are the most critically ill children in the hospital setting. There are times where these children do not have the best outcomes, which may result in permanent deficits or even death. There are times where nothing more could have been done to improve the outcome for these patients. However, there are times where care could have differed and the end result may have been better.

There are a variety of factors that have led to poor outcomes in PICU patients. The main factor that leads to inadequate care for PICU patients is improper [[health assessment]] by the healthcare providers. This may include not observing a change in the patient’s clinical status, delayed [[resuscitation]] efforts, delayed decision making, or a combination of any of these factors. If any of these factors do occur, it may result in permanent deficits in the most critical patients.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Peter|last2=Argent|first2=Andrew|last3=Wallis|first3=Lee|last4=Reid|first4=Steve|last5=Perera|first5=Rafael|last6=Harrison|first6=Sian|last7=Thompson|first7=Matthew|last8=English|first8=Mike|last9=Maconochie|first9=Ian|date=2016-01-05|title=Pathways to Care for Critically Ill or Injured Children: A Cohort Study from First Presentation to Healthcare Services through to Admission to Intensive Care or Death|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|pages=e0145473|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0145473|pmid=26731245|pmc=4712128|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures may be taken to prevent improper assessments from occurring. Proper education on how to conduct a proper assessment and how to recognize a critically ill pediatric patient can improve patient outcomes. This includes being able to recognize signs of deteriorating clinical status and perform proper triage of patients.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This education is not only for the PICU staff, but also for [[emergency medical services]], the [[emergency department]] staff, and staff of the pediatric unit.

== Challenges of Working ]working  in the PICU result may in emotional stress and/or [[occupational burnout]] of the staff. For patients that do get discharged from the unit, often times they are not free of chronic conditions or disabilities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are other factors that lead to stressful work conditions for the staff of the PICU. The staff often work for long periods of time in order to stabilize the most critically ill pediatric patients. They must collaborate with other members the healthcare team in order to develop the best plan of care. Once a plan of care is developed, then the staff must communicate the plan with the patient's family in order to see if it matches their beliefs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If the plan of care does not match the family's beliefs, then it must be modified the plan causing more stress on the staff. All of this causes the staff a great deal of stress and each member of the unit must develop their own coping mechanisms in order to prevent burnout.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6255">'''The Restroom Access Act''', also known as '''Ally's Law''', is legislation passed by several U.S. states that requires retail establishments that have toilet facilities for their employees to also allow customers to use the facilities if the customer has an [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or other medical condition requiring immediate access to a toilet.

==Background==
The law is named for Ally Bain, a 14-year-old girl from Illinois who had a flare-up of her [[Crohn's disease]] while shopping at a large retail store and was subsequently denied use of the employee-only restroom, causing  her to soil herself. Bain's mother vowed it would never happen to anyone else. The two met with Illinois State Representative [[Kathy Ryg]], helped her draft a bill, and testified before a committee at the state capital. The  bill was signed into law in August 2005, making Illinois the first U.S. state to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forwardisapace.com/2011/09/turning-an-embarrassing-situation-upside-down/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801212706/http://www.forwardisapace.com/2011/09/turning-an-embarrassing-situation-upside-down/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-08-01|title=Ally’s Law: Turning an Embarrassing Situation Upside Down|work=Forward is a Pace|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Where in force==
As of April 2013, at least 14 U.S. states had passed versions of the law. They include Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Washington.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-68/chapter-15/part-3/68-15-303 Tennessee Code Annotated, 68-15-303, subsection C.]&lt;/ref&gt; A Virginia bill, which would have levied fines of $100 for non-compliance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+HB1375 2013 SESSION: HOUSE BILL NO. 1375], Virginia General Assembly Legislative Information System&lt;/ref&gt; was shelved due to concerns about exposing businesses to lawsuits, as well as concerns about security and intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitalnews.vcu.edu/2013/01/22/restroom-access-act-killed-by-subcommittee/ Restroom Access Act Killed by Subcommittee], VCU Capital News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

There is support for a federal version of the act, but some small-business people object to the public using their employee bathrooms.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/Glossary/g/The-Restroom-Access-Act.htm The Restroom Access Act], [[about.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2013/01/bathroom-bill-ends-where-it-belongs-down-drain Bathroom bill ends up where it belongs - down the drain], ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
In general, each state requires that the customer present a document signed by a medical professional attesting that the customer uses an [[ostomy]] device or has [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], or other [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or medical condition requiring access to a toilet facility without delay. In at least two states, Oregon and Tennessee, the customer can present an identification card issued by a national organization advocating for the eligible medical condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregon.gov/dhs/spd/adv/odc/docs/faq-sb277.pdf Frequently Asked Questions for the Customer and Place of Public Accommodation], Oregon Disabilities Commission&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-68/chapter-15/part-3/68-15-303]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states also include pregnancy as a covered medical condition.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Sample law==
The Restroom Access Act of [[Illinois]] states:

:Sec. 10. Retail establishment; customer access to restroom facilities. A retail establishment that has a toilet facility for its employees shall allow a customer to use that facility during normal business hours if the toilet facility is reasonably safe and all of the following conditions are met:

::(1) The customer requesting the use of the employee toilet facility suffers from an eligible medical condition or utilizes an ostomy device.

::(2) Three or more employees of the retail establishment are working at the time the customer requests use of the employee toilet facility.

::(3) The retail establishment does not normally make a restroom available to the public.

::(4) The employee toilet facility is not located in an area where providing access would create an obvious health or safety risk to the customer or an obvious security risk to the retail establishment.

::(5) A public restroom is not immediately accessible to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/illinois/410ilcs39/10.html Illinois Compiled Statutes 410 ILCS 39 Restroom Access Act. Section 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtesy card==
In Australia, the association Crohn's &amp; Colitis Australia (CCA) encourages businesses to support people with such medical conditions by recognizing the [[Can't Wait Card]] issued by the CCA. The CCA states:
:Crohn's &amp; Colitis Australia  (CCA) is inviting retailers, business owners and venue operators to show their support for people with the medical condition Crohn's and colitis, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), by displaying a window sticker recognising the Can't Wait Card in their store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantwait.net.au/ Welcome to the Can't Wait Program], Crohn's &amp; Colitis Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries including the UK have similar programs of voluntary participation by businesses, one such program in the UK is the Bladder &amp; Bowel Community's Just Can't Wait Card [https://www.bladderandbowel.org/help-information/just-cant-wait-card/]

A card with no country specific indications is available through [http://www.theibdlife.com/access www.theibdlife.com/access] explaining the possibility of legislation and the gravity of the card holders disability and need for restroom access.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theibdlife.com/access&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RDA logo green.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''Riding for the Disabled Association''', also known as the '''RDA''' is a [[United Kingdom]] based charity&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|244108|Riding for the Disabled Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on providing [[horse-riding]] and [[Driving (horse)|carriage driving]] lessons to people with both developmental and physical disabilities.

In addition to running international operations, the RDA is also a member of the international umbrella group, the [[Federation Riding for the Disabled International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frdi.net/ |title=Federation of Horses in Education and Therapy International (HETI) |work=Riding for the Disabled International |accessdate=2014-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK, the association is one of 16 members that make up the [[British Equestrian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Bodies|publisher=British Equestrian Federation|url=http://www.bef.co.uk/About_the_BEF/Member_Bodies.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403010448/http://www.bef.co.uk/About_the_BEF/Member_Bodies.html|archivedate=2010-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ancient Greeks as early as 600 B.C. and later the Romans recognised the therapeutic value of horseback riding. In Europe, France in particular, had documented the therapeutic use of horse riding as early as 1875. More recently, in the United Kingdom, Dame [[Agnes Hunt]] at the Orthopaedic Hospital at [[Oswestry]] during 1901 employed similar techniques. Later Miss Olive Sands MCSP took her horses to the Oxford Hospital to provide riding for the rehabilitation of Soldiers wounded in the trenches during the First World War.

The achievements of [[Lis Hartel]] of [[Denmark]] are generally regarded as the impetus for the formation of [[therapeutic horseback riding]] centres throughout Europe. [[Polio]] had impaired Hartel’s mobility but not her spirit. In 1952 she won the silver medal for Individual [[Dressage]] during the Helsinki Olympics. Medical and equine professionals took notice and very soon centres for therapeutic horseback riding began to form throughout the United Kingdom and Europe.

In 1951 Elsbet Bodtker, having met Liz Hartel, was inspired to give lessons to young patients on her son’s ponies. She was uniquely qualified as an international rider and a [[Mensendieck]] physiotherapist, and so had the respect and approval of the doctors.

In the United Kingdom Mrs. Norah Strang, a member of the British Polio Fellowship, organized riding for children disabled by polio, at a local riding centre.  Her riders won the first national competition at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] sports centre. In 1957 another remarkable lady, Mrs. Jacques, made contact with a physiotherapist in Copenhagen.  By this time she had organized a team of helpers and ponies, and was offering riding to a local orthopaedic hospital. She also met Mrs. Regester who had returned from Malaya where she had been teaching disabled children to ride for some years at the request of their doctors.

Although the British medical profession was still cautious, after watching a demonstration by Mrs. Jacques and her riders at the Knightsbridge Barracks, the senior physiotherapist at St. Thomas’ Hospital was impressed.  This was the start of a long and successful partnership.

Mrs. Jacques had so many enquiries that she was convinced they should start their own riding centre. The result was Grange Farm in Chigwell. A number of groups were set up by the British Red Cross Society, all of these eventually coming under the RDA umbrella.

The Princess Anne opened Hadleigh RDA on 13 June 1985. The original formation of the organisation came about during 1965, but the Charity, The Riding for the Disabled Association did not come into being until 1969. At that time Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk was president, with HRH The Princess Anne as Patron. The RDA became a Limited Company during 2004.

The RDA is in effect a Federation of some 500 small independent groups, such as The Shelley Centre, and currently supports over 26,500 adults and children by providing riding, carriage driving and vaulting each year.

In 1996 equestrian became a [[Paralympic sport]] at the Games in [[Atlanta]]
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/equestrian |title=Official website of the Paralympic Movement |work=Equestrian |accessdate=2014-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest event in Paralympics history, with 122 countries participating and it is now possible for those coming into the RDA who have the right ability and skill to eventually represent their Country as Paralympic competitors by progression through organised RDA events both regionally and nationally with the likes of Competitions held annually at [[Hartpury College]].

From simple beginnings the organisation has progressed in sophistication and has benefited greatly from the advice, training and guidance given by specialist Physiotherapists where planning and treatment programmes are developed for individuals, both children and adults alike. This, together with the introduction and evolution of special Saddles, Stirrups and Reins and the use of formal and protective riding clothing have added further to the development process and professionalism of the organisation. The organisation, at a few locations, now has in place sophisticated computerised mechanical horses, one of which is at The Shelley Centre, which can emulate the walk, trot and canter paces of a real horse thus enabling riders who for various reasons cannot ride an actual horse to experience the therapeutic benefits of horse riding.

The Riding for the Disabled Association is not confined to the UK. That vision has spread around the world. 
RDA Centres now operate in over 45 countries in Europe, Asia, The Americas, and Oceania. Countries include: Australia (130 centres),&lt;ref name="Official website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Riding for the Disabled Association of Australia|website=http://www.rda.org.au/|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasil, Canada (80 centres),&lt;ref name="Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association"&gt;{{cite web | title=Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association (CanTRA) | accessdate=1 November 2014 | website=http://www.cantra.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand (55 centres),&lt;ref name="New Zealand Riding for the Disabled"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Riding for the Disabled|website=http://www.rda.org.nz/|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, UAE, and USA to name a few.

==Biography==
Tubaigy is a professor in the criminal evidence department at Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in [[Riyadh]], and is known for pioneering rapid and mobile [[autopsy|autopsies]]. He has taught and published papers on gathering [[DNA]] evidence and dissecting human bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scfhs.org.sa/en/MESPS/ListOfResearcharSupervisors/Pages/doctor116.aspx |title=doctor116 |accessdate=2018-10-21 |website = Saudi Commission For Health Specialties |quote=Forensic Pathologist 2004-2009, investigating the cause of death by gathering the background information, medical history, death surrounding supported with autopsy for general identification features, postmortem changes and other external and internal findings }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MadadinEldosary2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madadin|first1=Mohammed|last2=Eldosary|first2=Mohamed|last3=Almoghaniem|first3=Salah|last4=Hafez|first4=Ahmed Yasser|last5=Mourad|first5=Mohamed Abdel Salam|last6=Tubaigy|first6=Salah|title=Homicidal deaths In Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|journal=Egyptian Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=1|issue=3-4|year=2011|pages=114–117|issn=2090536X|doi=10.1016/j.ejfs.2011.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has had a prominent role in Saudi Arabia’s state security apparatus and scientific community for around 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi forensic expert is among 15 named by Turkey in disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/saudi-forensic-expert-is-among-15-named-by-turkey-in-disappearance-of-journalist-jamal-khashoggi/2018/10/11/e62d6dd4-cd6a-11e8-ad0a-0e01efba3cc1_story.html?utm_term=.4e60a2ea4aa9 |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=Washington Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a mobile autopsy lab to accompany Muslims on the [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]], and said it can "provide the dissection service to the security authorities in a record time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspects in disappearance of Khashoggi linked to Saudi security services |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/suspects-in-disappearance-of-khashoggi-linked-to-saudi-security-services/2018/10/16/8171e734-d199-11e8-a4db-184311d27129_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9601eb124317 |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=Washington Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 [[Al Jazeera]] reported that Tubaigy was involved in the murder and [[Dismemberment|dismembering]] of [[Murder of Jamal Khashoggi|Jamal Khashoggi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Khashoggi was beaten to death in front of Saudi consul general, then dismembered: sources |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/investigations/2018/10/16/khashoggi-was-beaten-to-death-in-front-of-saudi-consul-general-then-dismembered-sources |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=[[Daily Sabah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A source said "Tubaigy began to cut Khashoggi’s body up on a table in the study while he was still alive... As he started to dismember the body, Tubaigy put on earphones and listened to music. He advised other members of the squad to do the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jamal Khashoggi Dismembered Alive, Saudi Killer Listened To Music During Murder, 'Middle East Eye' Reports |url=https://www.inquisitr.com/5119410/jamal-khashoggi-dismembered-alive-saudi/ |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=The Inquisitr |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jamal Khashoggi's killing took seven minutes, Turkish source tells MEE |url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-khashoggi-829291552 |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=Middle East Eye |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tubaigy was traveling under a special(S052512) passport issued by the Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia Ministry Of Foreign Affairs according to the 2D barcode provided by Turkish authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

An official cited by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reportedly described a quick assassination, and dismemberment by a team of Saudi agents, with a [[bone saw]] brought for the purpose. "It is like ''[[Pulp Fiction]],''" the official said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-journalist-cut-up-with-bone-saw-in-pulp-fiction-murder-inside-consulate-in-a3958256.html|title=Missing Saudi journalist ‘cut up with bone saw in Pulp Fiction murder’|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tubaigy served on the editorial board to the [[King Fahd Security College]]. In late October 2018, his name was removed from the publication’s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Does Saudi Forensic Doctor Who Allegedly Dismembered Khashoggi Have Ties to University of New Haven? |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/10/26/does_saudi_forensic_doctor_who_allegedly |publisher=Democracy Now! |date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text "Serving suggestion" can be seen on the lower border of the serving suggestion image.]]
'''Serving suggestion''' is a [[disclaimer]] used on [[food packaging]]. The phrase is used as legal [[fine print]] with a picture of the product.  The picture attempts to portray the manufacturer's food in the most favorable or appetizing way possible, sometimes including other foods that the package does not contain. For example, the labeling on a box of [[cereal]] may feature a picture of a cereal bowl filled with that cereal, milk and a fruit [[Garnish (food)|garnish]], or a jar of [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] may picture a [[hot dog]] in a bun with mustard on it. The serving suggestion may portray the [[serving size]] of the food used, but just as often a much larger serving is shown as part of the [[marketing]] of the item. As a disclaimer a serving suggestion also serves to remove any legal obligation on the part of the manufacturer to provide the other items pictured with their product.
In Ireland this is an illegal practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

When used with a [[cooking recipe]], it is a recommendation from the author as a way to serve the dish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">Brazil has some of the strictest smoking laws in the Americas. '''Smoking in Brazil''' is forbidden in all enclosed public spaces  except for specifically  designated smoking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil/LEIS/L9294.htm |title=Article 2 of Brazil Federal law no. 9294 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 15 December 2011, Federal Law 12546 (article 49) forbids smoking in enclosed spaces in the entire country, including restaurants and bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.inca.gov.br/wps/wcm/connect/observatorio_controle_tabaco/site/status_politica/ambientes_livres_tabaco INCA (National Cancer Institute)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the legal age for sale and consumption of [[tobacco]] is 18. [[Tobacco advertising]] is restricted to posters in shops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCIVIL/leis/L9294.htm |title=Law 9294, 15&amp;nbsp;July 1996 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is banned on television and radio. All cigarette packs contain advertisements against smoking and government warnings about possible adverse [[health effects of smoking]].

==Usage of descriptors==
In 2001, Brazil is one of the first countries to outlaw the usage of descriptors, such as "light", "low tar" and "ultra-light". In 2012, Brazil also became the first country to outlaw flavored cigarettes, including menthol cigarettes, although such prohibition has been revogued in 2013 by Rosa Weber, a judge of the Supreme Court.

==São Paulo==
[[São Paulo]]  became the first state in Brazil to adopt the most comprehensive ban, being followed by [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leiantifumo.sp.gov.br/usr/share/documents/legislacao.pdf Lei Antifumo (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new regulation there are no smoking sections in any place around the state. The law became effective from 7 August 2009 with smoking forbidden in all indoor and enclosed public spaces such as bars and restaurants, clubs, shopping malls, movie theatres, banks, supermarkets, bakeries, chemist shops, health places, government offices and schools.

Smoking is also no longer allowed in São Paulo in work and study places, libraries, buses, cabs, commercial and residential common areas, hotels and inns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leiantifumo.sp.gov.br/ |title=Portal da Lei Antifumo – Governo do Estado de São Paulo |publisher=Leiantifumo.sp.gov.br |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The São Paulo government has trained 500 specialised agents to make sure the rule is respected at all times. The first team was trained to measure ambient smoke in an area and to warn smokers about the risks for their health.

Anybody violating the law is charged with a fine. Public sites can be punished with a maximum fine of [[R$]] 1,585  (Brazilian currency, ~$[[USD]] 478). If there is a second infraction the site is closed. According to surveys, 88% of São Paulo’s inhabitants support the smoke-free law.

'''Sukkur Barrage''' ({{lang-sd|'''سکر بئراج'''}}, {{lang-ur|{{nq|'''سکھر بیراج'''}}}}) is a [[Barrage (dam)|barrage]] on the [[River Indus]] near the city of [[Sukkur]] in the [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]]. The Barrage was built during the [[British Raj]] from 1923 to 1932 and was named '''Lloyd Barrage'''. The Sukkur Barrage, is the pride of Pakistan’s Irrigation system as it is the largest single Irrigation network of its kind in the world. It irrigates from [[Sukkur]] District in the North, to [[Mirpurkhas]]/ [[Tharparkar]] and [[Hyderabad]] districts in the South of [[Sindh]], almost all parts of the Province except few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sindhirrigation.com.pk/index.php/daily-discharges Sindh Irrigation Department] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204055007/http://www.sindhirrigation.com.pk/index.php/daily-discharges |date=2016-02-04 }} Canal Network (map)&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated about 300 miles North East of Karachi, 3 miles below the Railway Bridge, or the Sukkur Gorge. The introduction of barrage-controlled irrigation system resulted in more timely water supplies for the existing cultivated areas of [[Sindh]] Province of [[Pakistan]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sindh.gov.pk/dpt/Irrigation/sukkur%20barrage.htm Sukkur Barrage] &lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[Sindh]] survives almost entirely on the water of the [[River Indus]] as there is very limited groundwater available. Rainfall in the province averages between 100 and 200 mm per year, while the evaporation rate is between 1,000 and 2,000 mm. Thus, Sindh is arid and it is only the Indus which irrigates otherwise barren lands of Sindh. Regular surveys have not been carried out to assess the availability of groundwater in the province. Various sources estimate that its volume is between three and five MAF scattered in 28 per cent of the geographical area of Sindh. However, some experts suggest it to be less than these estimates. This water is found mainly along the Indus water channels and in the few natural underground streams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/654422/the-future-of-sukkur-barrage The future of Sukkur Barrage] THE EXPRESS TRIBUNE &gt; OPINION By Nasir Ali Panhwar Published: January 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Sukkur Barrage was conceived by Mr. C.A. Fife, in the year 1868. However, the project was finally sanctioned in 1923. It was constructed under the overall direction of [[Sir Charlton Harrison]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]], as chief engineer, while [[Arnold Musto|Sir Arnold Musto]], CIE, was the architect and engineer of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/671984/renovated-museum-takes-visitors-on-a-walk-through-sukkur-barrage-history Renovated: Museum takes visitors on a walk through Sukkur Barrage history] THE EXPRESS TRIBUNE &gt; PAKISTAN &gt; SINDH By Sarfaraz Memon Published: February 15,  2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Head Works and Canals were completed by 1932. On its completion it was opened by [[Excellency|His Excellency]] [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|The 1st Earl of Willingdon]], [[Viceroy of India]]. The scheme had been launched by the [[Governor of Bombay]], [[George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd|Sir George Lloyd]] (later known as [[Lord Lloyd]]), and it was named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742985,00.html INDIA: Lloyd Barrage] Time 25 January 1932. Retrieved 20 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Syed Ghulam Mustafa of the Imperial Service also played an instrumental role in the design and construction of the barrage. 

To revitalise its water storage capacity and distribution efficiency, the [[Government of Pakistan]] embarked upon a massive rehabilitation work of Sukkur Barrage. The work was started by [[Pakistan Army Engineering Corps]] and [[Frontier Works Organisation]] (FWO) on 22 November 2004, and was completed ahead of the deadline in July 2005, with the cost of just 15 million US$ (US Dollars). Experts believe that the rehabilitation of the barrage has enhanced its efficiency for another 60 to 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonyatravels.net/sukkur-tours-and-excursions.php Sukkur Tours &amp; Excursions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130225820/http://www.sonyatravels.net/sukkur-tours-and-excursions.php |date=2016-01-30 }} Sukkur Barrage&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plaque at the Lloyd-Barrage (Sukkur-Barrage).jpg|thumb|Plaque at the Lloyd Barrage (Sukkur Barrage)]]

==Functioning==

Sukkur Barrage is used to control water flow in the [[River Indus]] for the purposes of irrigation and flood control. This Barrage which is the backbone of the economy of the entire Country enables water to flow through what was originally a network of seven canals {{convert|6166|mi|km}} long, feeding the largest [[irrigation]] system in the world, with more than 7.63 million acres of irrigated land which forms approximately 25% of total canal irrigated area of the country. The retaining wall of the Barrage has 66 spans (outfall  gates), each {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide and weighing 50 tons.  

The [[Nara canal]] which is one of the 7 Canals off taking from this Barrage is the longest canal of this country, carrying discharge almost equal to that of Thames River at London and its bed width which is 346 ft. is 1 ½ (one and half) times as big as of Suez Canal. In fact Nara Canal is not a man-made canal as it was the southernmost part of Hakro River which emanated from the foot hills of Sutlej which after traversing through the Punjab and Bhawalpur Plains joined Nara through Raini River, the remnants of which are still exiting in [[Ghotki]] Taluka. This Canal caters for an area of 2.3 million acres.

The next largest canal is [[Rohri]] Canal which though slightly shorter in length than Nara Canal is yet taking discharge much more than the former. It has cultivable area of 2.6 million acres settled for Irrigation. Cotton, wheat and sugar-cane are the main crops grown on this canal system. All the four canals on the left and two canals on the right bank of River Indus are perennial canals, delivering Irrigation supplies all the year round. The seventh canal namely, Rice Canal on the right side is a seasonal canal which flows only in Kharif Season and is designed for rice cultivation. The N.W. Canal on the right bank provides perennial Irrigation for an area of 965,000 (0.965 million) acres out of which 184,000 acres are situated in [[Baluchistan]] Province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sindh.gov.pk/dpt/Irrigation/sukkur%20barrage.htm The Government of Sindh] Irrigation Department: Sukkur Barrage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
[[Indus River dolphin]]s are occasionally seen upstream of the barrage.

==History==

===1960s===
The charity was established in 1964 by eminent obstetrician Professor Will Nixon, who was touched by the grief of a young man whose wife died during childbirth. It was originally called The Childbirth Research Centre. He gathered a group of illustrious founder members including Lord Brain, a neurologist who cared for Winston Churchill on his deathbed in 1965; Sir John Peel, the surgeon-gynaecologist to the Queen; Professor Dugald Baird and Sir George Pinker, an obstetrician who delivered nine royal babies including Princes William and Harry. The founders’ aim was to reduce the number of women and babies who died during pregnancy and childbirth.

An early donation established that a deficiency in folic acid was a factor in malformed babies.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/research/success-stories/?menu=11c |title=Our achievements |publisher=Wellbeing of Women |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant women across the world now take folic acid supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Vitamin-B.aspx |title=Vitamins and minerals - B vitamins and folic acid - NHS Choices |website=Nhs.uk |date=2015-02-18 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity also funded crucial research into epidurals&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt; which means that millions of women now benefit from a relatively pain-free birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural-anaesthesia/pages/introduction.aspx |title=Epidural anaesthesia - NHS Choices |website=Nhs.uk |date=2016-11-24 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In 1972 the charity was renamed Birthright.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/?menu=2c |title=Our history |publisher=Wellbeing of Women |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research projects they funded created the ground rules that mean many thousands of women have safe laser treatment to treat cervical cancer. They also enabled breakthroughs into monitoring babies in the womb. One early pieces of research into the diagnosis of Down’s Syndrome in pregnant women helped make the amniocentesis test more accurate. The charity also discovered a link between smoking and pre-eclampsia and babies being born underweight.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

===1980s===
HRH Diana, Prince of Wales, became the patron of Birthright in 1984.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

She was devoted to the charity, explaining: "To long for a baby and not to be able to have one must be devastating. I don't know how I would cope with that. And if my work for Birthright can alleviate that suffering for just one couple, it will have been all worthwhile."

During her time as patron, the charity funded work into IVF and also investigated HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer leading to the cervical cancer screening programme. The charity’s research into recurrent miscarriage also meant that, out of a research group of 2000 women who had been told they would never have children, 79% went on to have babies.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt; Professor Stuart Campbell of King’s College, London, received funding from the charity for a project that developed an ultrasound that would identify babies at risk of stillbirth by finding out if they had abnormal blood flow.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

===1990s===
During the 1990s, the charity funded research which discovered that ultrasound could be used to detect abnormalities in early pregnancy. This resulted in pre-natal screening for Down's Syndrome. The charity enabled breakthroughs in IVF, by funding research into the optimum time for embryo transfer, and by looking at how eggs mature in the ovary. This was described at the time as ‘the biggest advance in fertility treatment’. They also funded research into gynaecological cancers; contraception; and the bone density of post-menopausal women.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

===2000s===
The charity was renamed ‘Wellbeing of Women’, in 2004.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Wellbeing of Women partnered with 100 Women in Hedge Funds to fund a project which advanced our understanding of the genetics of Cerebral Palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100womeninhedgefunds.org/100WHFGenevaGardenParty2008Programme.pdf |title=100 WHF Late Summer Garden Party |website=100womeninhedgefunds.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity also funded research that helped reverse brain damage in newborn babies and a project that helped women suffering from recurrent miscarriage go on to have a successful pregnancy, by identifying ‘Natural Killer cells’ in the mother’s immune system.&lt;ref name="wellbeingofwomen.org.uk"/&gt;

In 2007, then British Prime Minister's wife Sarah Brown became patron of Wellbeing of Women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2008, Wellbeing of Women was announced as one of the beneficiary charities of the Lord Mayor’s Appeal, along with ORBIS.&lt;ref name="princeofwales.gov.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160308040919/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/press-releases/prince-william-become-patron-of-the-2008-lord-mayors-appeal] &lt;/ref&gt; Prince William was Patron of the appeal.&lt;ref name="princeofwales.gov.uk"/&gt; Funds raised from the appeal enabled Wellbeing of Women to establish the Baby Bio Bank, a unique international resource storing genetic data from ‘family trios’ of mother, father and baby. This bank of genetic information will facilitate on-going research into the persistent complications of pregnancy and birth, including miscarriage, premature birth and pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/tapb/sample-and-data-collections-at-ucl/biobanks-ucl/baby-biobank |title=Baby Biobank |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6989">The '''World Federation for Mental Health''' (WFMH) is an international, multi-professional [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), including citizen volunteers and former patients. It was founded in 1948 in the same era as the United Nations (UN) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1414666 | pmid=16633456 | volume=3 | title=The World Federation for Mental Health: its origins and contemporary relevance to WHO and WPA policies | date=February 2004 | journal=World Psychiatry | pages=54–5 | author=Brody EB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The goal of this international organization includes; 
*The prevention of mental and emotional disorders;
*The proper treatment and care of those with such disorders;
*And the promotion of mental health &lt;ref&gt;http://wfmh.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation, through its members and contacts in more than 94 countries on six continents, has responded to international mental health crises through its role as the only worldwide grassroots advocacy and public education organization in the mental health field. Its organizational and individual membership includes mental health workers of all disciplines, consumers of mental health services, family members, and concerned citizens. At its very outset the WFMH was concerned with educating both the public and influential professionals, and with human relations, with a view both to the health of individuals and that of groups and nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1414666 | pmid=16633456 | volume=3 | title=The World Federation for Mental Health: its origins and contemporary relevance to WHO and WPA policies | date=February 2004 | journal=World Psychiatry | pages=54–5 | author=Brody EB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WFMH founding document, "Mental Health and World Citizenship", understood "world citizenship" in terms of a "common humanity" respecting individual and cultural differences, and declared that "the ultimate goal of mental health is to help [people] live with their fellows in one world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1414666 | pmid=16633456 | volume=3 | title=The World Federation for Mental Health: its origins and contemporary relevance to WHO and WPA policies | date=February 2004 | journal=World Psychiatry | pages=54–5 | author=Brody EB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members include mental health service providers and service users. In 2009, the World Fellowship for Schizophrenia and Allied Disorders, an international network of families of people with serious mental illness, merged with the World Federation. The World Federation has close ties with the World Health Organization. For many years after its founding, the WFMH was the only NGO of its kind with a close working relationship with UN agencies, particularly the WHO. In recent decades, though, a number of international mental health organizations, often limited to members of particular professions, have developed. In varying degree they have filled needs formerly addressed mainly by WFMH &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1414666 | pmid=16633456 | volume=3 | title=The World Federation for Mental Health: its origins and contemporary relevance to WHO and WPA policies | date=February 2004 | journal=World Psychiatry | pages=54–5 | author=Brody EB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WFMH envisions a world in which mental health is a priority for all people. Public policies and programs reflect the crucial importance of mental health in the lives of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1414666 | pmid=16633456 | volume=3 | title=The World Federation for Mental Health: its origins and contemporary relevance to WHO and WPA policies | date=February 2004 | journal=World Psychiatry | pages=54–5 | author=Brody EB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first Director General of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], G. [[Brock Chisholm]], who was a psychiatrist, was one of the leaders in forming the federation with the goal of creating a representative organization that could consult with the UN on mental health issues.

The mission of the World Federation for Mental Health is to promote the advancement of mental health awareness, prevention of mental disorders, advocacy, and best practice recovery focused interventions worldwide. Mental health day is celebrated at the initiative of the World Federation of Mental Health and WHO supports this initiative through raising awareness on mental health issues using its strong relationships with the Ministries of health and civil society organizations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mental_health/world_mental_health_day/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Mental Illness Awareness Week (MIAW) is an annual national public education campaign designed to help open the eyes of Canadians to the reality of mental illness. The week was established in 1992 by the Canadian Psychiatric Association, and is now coordinated by the Canadian Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health (CAMIMH) in cooperation with all its member organizations and many other supporters across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://camimh.ca/mental-illness-awareness-week-english/about-miaw/&lt;/ref&gt;
