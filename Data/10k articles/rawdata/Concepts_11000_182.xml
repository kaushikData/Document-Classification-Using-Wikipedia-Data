== Themes ==

Every year, the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign either introduces a new theme, or continues an old theme. The theme focuses on one particular area of gender inequality and works to bring attention to these issues and make changes that will have an impact. The Center for Women's Global Leadership sends out a "Take Action Kit" every year, detailing how participants can get involved and campaign in order to make a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://16dayscwgl.rutgers.edu/about/the-annual-themes|title=The Annual Themes|last=|first=|date=|website=The Center for Women's Global Leadership|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first campaign theme in 1991 was entitled ''Violence Against Women Violates Human Rights,'' and women from around the world came together with the Center for Women's Global Leadership at the first International Women's Leadership Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= |title=16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence – Violence Against Women Violates Human Rights |last= |first= |date= |website=The Center for Women's Global Leadership |publisher= |access-date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was used again in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= |title=Second Annual Campaign of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence |last= |first= |date= |website=The Center for Women's Global Leadership |publisher= |access-date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Ball''' '''[[Membership of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland|MRCS]], [[Royal College of Physicians|LRCP]], [[OBE]]''' (13 June 1924-13 March 2011) was a [[Bermudians|Bermudian]] physician, politician and social activist. She was the first woman physician to practice in Bermuda and took both black and white patients, an unusual event in the 1950s. During the time that [[Racial segregation|segregation]] was rigidly enforced, Ball actively ignored the social norms, actively fighting for the civil rights of [[Afro-Bermudian|black Bermudians]]. She served as a member of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]] and represented black workers through her work with the [[Bermuda Industrial Union]]. In 1963, at a [[United Nations]] meeting regarding [[colonialism]], Ball brought the situation of black workers on the island to the table. In 2000, she was honoured as an officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]].

==Early life==
Barbara Bertha Ball was born on 13 June 1924 in Bermuda to Jessie Alice (née Clap) and Carlton Ball. Her mother was a native Bermudian and her father was an English carpenter who came to Bermuda to work at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Garrison]]. Ball's younger brother Walter was physically disabled and would later become well-known newspaper vendor. After completing her secondary education at the all-white [[Bermuda High School for Girls]], she won a government scholarship to attend medical school in Liverpool.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}} In 1942, she entered [[Liverpool University]],{{sfn|Simmons|2010}} and also studied [[judo]], graduating with her medical degree seven years later.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}}{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}}

==Career==
Ball began her career in England and spent the next five years working as a physician at hospitals in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]] and [[Westmorland]].{{sfn|Simmons|2010}} In 1954, Ball returned to Bermuda and joined an existing medical practice,{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}} Bermuda Medical Associates (BMA). Though the third woman to train as a physician, she was the first Bermudian-born practitioner. She quickly became known for taking and providing equal care to patients without regard to their race. Her actions caused the other physicians at BMA to ask her to withdraw from the practice. She withdrew, rented a small office space on Cedar Avenue from the St. Theresa’s Catholic Cathedral, and continued treating patients from all races.{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}} She simultaneously began teaching judo classes in the evenings, but after receiving warnings from the police that she could not teach black Bermudians, she formed her own judo club, which was one of the first integrated sports centres in the country.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}} 

In 1959, during the [[Bermuda Theatre Boycott]], Ball publicly supported black Bermudians in their quest for equality.{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}} She was well aware of the difficulties many of her black patients had in paying for medical treatment and felt that lack of income should not impact one's health. The following year, speaking at a public meeting, she supported the abolition of the property requirement as a qualifier to being able to vote, instead expressing support for [[universal suffrage]] for all adults upon attaining the age of 21. Her radical stance was that wealth should be equally distributed among society. Her support of blacks and workers, caused a rift with her church causing her conversion from Anglicanism to Catholicism that same year.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}} 

Ball joined the [[Bermuda Industrial Union]] (BIU) in 1961.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}} The BIU had been formed in 1946 to represent the working class, which was predominantly black and [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]].{{sfn|Alexander|Parker|2004|p=104}} By the following year, she became the BIU's General Secretary.{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}} In 1963, Ball and Walton Brown attended a [[United Nations]] subcommittee meeting regarding [[colonialism]]. She stressed that the racism in the country created unequal opportunity for black Bermudians and pressed for self-determination. British representatives dismissed the idea.{{sfn|Swan|2009|p=18}} 

Ball's work with the union caused her to be unpopular with those whites who thought she was a "traitor to her race".{{sfn|Alexander|Parker|2004|p=104}} In 1964, she lost admitting privileges at King Edward VII Memorial Hospital and was dismissed as [[Choir|choirmistress]] and organist of her church, St. Michael's in Paget.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}}{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}}{{sfn|Burchall|2011}} The following year Ball was threatened with a prison sentence for her participation in the Bermuda Electrical Light Company (BELCO) strike.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}} She gained respect from the underground civil rights workers during the BELCO strike because she used her skill with judo to avoid police detention.{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}}{{sfn|Swan|2009|pp=20–21}} Charged with inciting a riot, Ball and six other accused strike leaders, were tried in the Supreme Court. Four of the accused men were found guilty of obstruction and incitement, while Ball and the other defendant were acquitted.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}}

Under Ball's leadership, the BIU expanded its base of labourers, seeking construction workers and hotel workers as members. After her trial, union membership grew and the BIU became the largest union in the country.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}}{{sfn|Alexander|Parker|2004|p=102}} 
In 1968 and again in 1972, Ball was a successful candidate for the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] (PLP), as a member of the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda]].{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}} The 1968 race was the first general election in Bermuda after the passage of the universal suffrage law.{{sfn|''Bermuda Sun''|2011}} She resigned as General Secretary of BIU in 1974, but continued to remain active negotiations for pay increases and benefits, like pensions and insurance as well as paid maternity and sick leave until 2005.{{sfn|Ebbin|2011}}{{sfn|Burchall|2011}} In 2000, Ball was honoured as an officer in the [[Order of the British Empire]].{{sfn|''The Independent''|2000}}

==Death and legacy==
Ball died on 13 March 2011 at the Sylvia Richardson Care Facility in [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], Bermuda.{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}}{{sfn|Pearman|2011}} She was buried on St Paul’s Anglican Cemetery in Paget on 19 March 2011, after her funeral service which was widely attended by noted politicians and trade unionists.{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011b}} While she is remembered as a pioneering doctor in Bermuda, her legacy was in her fight for the civil rights of Bermuda's black residents.{{sfn|''Bernews''|2011a}} The government established the Dr. Barbara Ball Public Health Scholarship in her honour.{{sfn|''Bermuda Sun''|2011}} [[Ottiwell Simmons]], with whom Ball had worked at BIU, published a biography of Ball's life, ''Our Lady of Labour'' in 2010.{{sfn|Simmons|2010}}{{sfn|Pearman|2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10127">Countries regulate the marketing and sale of [[beef]] by observing criteria of [[Cattle]] [[Cadaver|Carcasses]] at the [[Abattoir]] and classifying the carcasses. This classification, sometimes optional, can suggest a market demand for a particular animal's attributes and therefore the price owed to the producer.

== United States grading system ==
In the United States, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA's) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) operates a voluntary beef grading program that began in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United States Standards for Grades of carcass Beef|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meat processor pays for a trained AMS meat grader to grade whole carcasses at the [[abattoir]]. Such processors are required to comply with Food Safety and Inspection Service ([[FSIS]]) grade labeling procedures. The official USDA grade designation can appear as markings on retail containers, individual bags,  or on USDA shield stamps, as well as on legible roller brands appearing on the meat itself.  

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] grading system uses eight different grades to represent various levels of marbling in beef: Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner. The grades are based on two main criteria: the degree of marbling ([[intramuscular fat]]) in the beef, and the maturity (estimated age of the animal at [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]).  Prime has the highest marbling content when compared to other grades, and is capable of fetching a premium at [[restaurant]]s and [[supermarket]]s. As of June 2009, about 2.9% of carcasses grade as Prime.&lt;ref&gt;Salvage, B. (2009) "Leading the Herd", Meat Processing, June 2009, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Choice is the most common grade sold in retail outlets, and represents roughly half of all graded beef.  Select is sold as a cheaper, leaner option in many stores and is the lowest grade typically found for consumer purchase as a steak. Younger cattle (under 42 months of age) tend to be graded as Prime, Choice, Select or Standard, while older cattle are more likely to be graded Commercial, Utility, Canner or Cutter.  These latter grades of beef are used for ground products rather than for consumer sale or food service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beef inspection USDA.jpg|thumb|Inspected carcasses tagged by the USDA]]
Some [[meat science|meat scientists]] {{Who|date=September 2010}} object to the current scheme of USDA grading since it is not based on direct measurement of tenderness, although marbling and maturity are indicators of tenderness. Most other countries' beef grading systems mirror the U.S. model, except for those in the European Union (EU). The EU employs a grading scheme that emphasizes carcass shape and amount of fat covering&lt;ref&gt;Council Regulation (EEC) No 1208/81 of 28 April 1981 determining the Community scale for the classification of carcases of adult bovine animals (OJ L 123, 7 May 1981, p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; instead of marbling and aging. The differences in grading yield incompatible value judgments of beef value in the United States and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrasting appraisals of quality and value of beef carcasses in Spain and the United States|author=Beriain, M. J. |journal=Revue Méd. Vét. Vét.|year= 2013|volume= 164|issue= 7|pages= 337–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most beef offered for sale in [[supermarket]]s in the United States is graded U.S. Choice or Select. U.S. Prime beef is sold to hotels and upscale restaurants, and usually marketed as such.

In 1997, the official standards were revised to restrict the Select grade to A maturity carcasses, and to raise the minimum marbling score to qualify for Choice to modest for B maturity cattle.  These changes were implemented to improve the uniformity and consistency of the grading system.
Yield grades are intended to estimate the pounds of boneless closely trimmed retail cuts from the carcass. Closely trimmed refers to approximately ¼ inch of external fat. Yield grade is determined by considering 4 carcass characteristics: external fat, Kidney, pelvic and heart fat (KPH), Ribeye area (REA), and Hot carcass weight (HCW). The amount of external fat is measured at the ribbed surface between the 12th and 13th ribs. The ribbing of carcasses is described in the U.S. standards for beef grading.  External fat is measured at a distance of ¾ the length of the ribeye from the chine bone end.  This initial number can be adjusted up or down depending on any abnormal fat deposits. As the amount of external fat increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases.

Kidney fat is assessed subjectively and is expressed as a percentage of the carcass weight. As the percentage of KPH increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases. The ribeye area is measured at the ribbed surface, it can be estimated subjectively or measured with a device approved by the AMS.  As ribeye area increase, percent retail cuts increases.  Hot carcass weight is used to determine yield grade. As carcass weight increases, percent retail cuts decrease. The following equation is used to determine yield grade:

:&lt;math&gt;{\text{YG} = 2.5
+ \left(2.5 \times \text{adjusted fat thickness}\right)
+ \left(0.2 \times \text{percent KPH}\right)
+ \left(0.0038 \times \text{HCW}\right)
- \left(0.32 \times \text{REA}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

There are five grades, 1-5.  Yield grade one carcasses are of the highest cutability, while yield grade 5 yields the lowest cutability.

Beef sold in U.S. restaurants and supermarkets is usually described by its USDA grade; however, in the early twenty-first century many restaurants and retailers began selling beef on the strength of [[brand name]]s and the reputation of a specific breed of cattle, such as [[Angus cattle|black Angus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== European Union EUROP Classification ==
The  [[EUROP grid]] method of carcass classification was implemented in 1981. European Economic Community Regulations (EEC) No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R1208:19910429:EN:PDF 1208/81] and No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R2930:19910730:EN:PDF 2930/81] were enacted to facilitate the application of a community scale for the classification of carcases of adult bovine animals. This was to ensure the uniform classification of the carcases of adult bovine animals in the EEC and make the definitions of conformation classes and fat classes more precise. The need arose for a common grading scale when member states of the EEC began operating in the common beef market in 1968 (EEC) No. 805/68 and price reporting to the EC became mandatory.

In the UK, the Meat and Livestock Commission ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101127052714/http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/ MLC Services Ltd]) is responsible for the classification of over 80% of the cattle slaughtered in Britain. The EUROP grid consists of a 5-point scale in which each conformation and fat class is subdivided into low medium and high classes resulting in 15 classes. In the UK, the fat classes range from 1-5 with classes 4 and 5 having a high and low sub-class which results in a seven-point scale for fatness (figure 1). It is argued by the MLC that this subdivision allows a more precise description of the carcase.

The price a farmer receives for a beast sent for slaughter is calculated by multiplying the carcase weight by the classification price for a particular category of animal (heifer, steer, bull, cow etc.). This classification is subjectively assigned by the meat grader according to the EUROP system where E is excellent, U is Very Good, R is Good, O is Fair and P is Poor. Likewise for the fat class, where 1 is Low, 2 is Slight, 3 is Average, 4 is High, and 5 is Very High. A typical classification would be R4L where the R refers to a "Good” carcass with an “Average” to “High” covering of fat according to the [http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/pdf/Beef%20Carcase%20Classification%2021Apr.pdf MLC].

The grader is usually an independent classifier who also monitors carcass dressing specification. Most classifiers are employed by MLC services and they are audited quarterly by the [[Rural Payments Agency|Rural Payments Agency (RPA)]] which is a government organisation. More recently Video [[Image analysis]] has been used to classify beef carcasses according to the EUROP scale. There are several machines that can do this, several of which were [http://www.teagasc.ie/research/reports/foodprocessing/4659/eopr-4659.asp trialled in Ireland]. The [[Republic of Ireland]] has used video image analysis for assignment of the EUROP classification grid since 2004.

Two main problems that are often cited in reference to the EUROP grid are its subjective application and its lack of consideration for meat eating quality.{{Citation needed |date= August 2013}}

'''Bike rage''' refers to acts of verbal or gestural anger or physical aggression between [[cyclists]] and other users of bike paths or roadways, including pedestrians, other cyclists, motorcyclists, or drivers. Bike rage can consist of shouting at other road users, making obscene gestures or threats, hitting or punching, or in rare cases, even more violent acts. The term can refer either to acts committed by cyclists&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles |last=Montogomery |date=July 1, 2008 |title=Bike Rage |work=Momentum |url=http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220214828/http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by drivers.&lt;ref name=Creagh2008&gt;{{cite news |first=Sunanda |last=Creagh |date=August 2, 2008 |title=Sydney's drivers 'worst' for bike rage |work=The Sydney Morning Herald

==Causes==
[[File:Traffic jam Rio de Janeiro 03 2008 28.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Some transportation experts argue that traffic congestion may be a contributing factor to driver frustration and bike rage.]]
A bike rage incident can start because a cyclist, driver, or pedestrian believes that another road user was being discourteous, breaking traffic rules, or in many cases because someone felt that their safety was being compromised by the actions of another road user. According to University of Hawaii professor of psychology Leon James, "bike rage is a common occurrence, and quite predictable", because urban commuting causes "tension, anxiety, and anger – in drivers as well as cyclists".&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt; Montogomery claims some cyclists hit cars using a "classic U-lock bash-and-run" tactic. He argues that "some cyclists consider such attacks acts of driver education". Montogomery claims the "...problem is that city planners have mixed bikes and cars together in ways that offer little certainty about how each should operate, and lots of chances for conflict". As such, "cyclists feel threatened in traffic" and "...hard done by and under attack."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;
 
An article in ''Toronto Life'' magazine argues that the "...source of the problem [bike and road rage] is neither the arrogance of drivers nor the militancy of cyclists, but the environment in which they interact." The article claims that the "...urban grid, already congested with cars, is being flooded with cyclists...intensifying competition for road space." One issue is that "[d]rivers are not sufficiently alert to the presence and the quickness of cyclists". A possible explanation for all of the aggression that occurs between cyclists and drivers is the anonymity of the big city: "...they know they will never run into that person again."&lt;ref name="torontolife.com"&gt;All the Rage
The tension between drivers and cyclists has escalated to swearing, punching, bird-flipping hysteria. City hall thinks additional bike lanes will calm everybody down. What if they’re wrong? By Philip Preville. In ''Toronto Life'' magazine. Available at: http://www.torontolife.com/features/all-rage/?pageno=1&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the S.F. Bicycle Coalition argues that "Road rage is a symptom of a contradiction between the image and promise of cars and the reality," because "You never see a car ad showing someone stuck in traffic." After an altercation between cyclists and police, an observer noted that "The sheep -- like the man who was just riding to the gym and decided to join and have a little fun -- were bewildered, angry, defiant. Turned into wolves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307074318/http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html |date=March 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''New York Times'' article stated that "...overwhelmingly, on blogs and Web sites nationwide, drivers and cyclists routinely describe shouted epithets, flung water bottles, sprays of spit and harrowing near-misses of the intentional kind." The article noted that there is "a whiff of class warfare in the simmering hostility, too. During morning rush, the teeth-gritting of drivers is almost audible, as superbly fit cyclists, wearing Sharpie-toned spandex and riding $3,000 bikes, cockily dart through the swampy, stolid traffic to offices with bike racks and showers."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/fashion/10bikewars.html|title=Moving Targets|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bike rage may also be caused by confusion about how the rules of the road apply to cyclists. In some jurisdictions, cyclists are allowed to ride on the sidewalk, whereas in other places, this is against the law. In all fifty U.S. states, bicycles are classified as vehicles and cyclists have many of the same rights and responsibilities as other drivers&lt;ref&gt;https://bikeleague.org/content/traffic-laws&lt;/ref&gt;; however, other jurisdictions may place restrictions on where citizens may operate bicycles. These differences in rules may lead drivers to believe that a cyclist is violating the law by cycling on a roadway, even if local laws require cyclists to be on the road. Many citizens are also ignorant of their localities' laws concerning bicycles.  {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Examples==

===Drivers attacking cyclists===
In Toronto in January 2006, a driver tossed his lunch out the window of his car in a traffic jam. A 26-year-old bike courier threw the food back into the car. The driver tossed two cups of hot coffee at the courier, and then, after they exchanged insults, the driver attacked the woman and her bike.&lt;ref name="torontolife.com" /&gt;
[[Image:SaoPaulo PrestesMaia.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Urban land use is often dominated by automobiles. Pictured: [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]
In 2009 in Los Angeles, a 59-year-old man was "charged with two felony counts each of reckless driving causing injury, battery with serious bodily injury and the special allegation of causing great bodily injury". After the man had an argument with two cyclists, he "allegedly stopped short and caused one [bike] rider to go through the rear window of Dr. Thompson's Infiniti and other rider to crash onto the pavement. The driver, who admitted slamming on his brakes, was later sentenced to 10 years in prison."&lt;ref&gt;Brentwood driver charged in bike rage
Kevin Roderick • July 11, 2008. Available at: http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2008/07/brentwood_driver_charged.php&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' story stated a 41-year-old cyclist, Dan Cooley was injured by a driver who became angry at him after an exchange of swear words. The incident began when the driver came out of a driveway in front of Mr. Cooley. Angered, Mr. Cooley cursed at the driver, who responded in kind. As Mr. Cooley moved off the road, the car drove into him, and knocked him to the ground with the vehicle, and then the driver got out of the car and attacked him, leaving him with a concussion and a torn ligament. Mr. Cooley thinks that the anger between cyclists and drivers might be due to the relatively new arrival of bikes on city streets: “We’ve had a [[car culture]] for so long and suddenly the roads become saturated with bicyclists trying to save gas"; however, he added,“No one knows how to share the road.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

According to the ''UK Guardian'', a cyclist named Jefferey Guffey from Indiana told a driver to slow down. The driver attacked Guffey and bit part of his ear off. After the incident, police charged the attacker with battery. In Oxford, "police investigated a spate of attacks on cyclists motivated, apparently, by hatred of bicycles and their riders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/5171552.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Oxfordshire &amp;#124; Drivers accused of cycle rage |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Wolmar]], an international expert on transportation, stated that Sydney "drivers are more hostile towards cyclists than motorists of any other country".&lt;ref name=Creagh2008/&gt;

===Cyclists attacking drivers===
In Toronto in 2007, "... after being cut off by a driver just after morning rush hour in Toronto, a cyclist caught up to the car, reached inside the window, and stabbed the driver in the face and neck with a screwdriver."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;

A 2004 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' article states that a Pennsylvania bicyclist shot a truck driver in the arm after an altercation. The truck driver, William Nicoletti, 51, drove past the cyclist, who made an obscene gesture. Mr. Nicoletti stated that when he turned his truck around and drove toward the cyclist, man on the bike drew a pistol and shot Mr. Nicoletti. The man on the bicycle, Robert Urick, 41, was "charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons offenses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=February 10, 2004 |title=Bike rage: Cyclist allegedly insults, shoots driver |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1517999.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''Newsweek'' article entitled "Pedal vs. Metal: A surge in bike ridership spurs a new kind of road rage" described an altercation which began after a driver named Patrick Schrepping told cyclist Adam Leckie to wear a helmet. Following this conversation, Leckie "allegedly responded by keying Schrepping's car", and then Schrepping struck Leckie with a metal object. Both men were arrested and charged with assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/149224 |title=Road Rage in Portland: Bikes, Cars Clash |publisher=Newsweek |date=July 27, 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Bryant]] (born April 13, 1966) is a former public administrator and former [[politician]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] who was involved in an incident with a cyclist. After an altercation with a cyclist on August 31, 2009, in which Bryant's car struck a bike courier, Bryant was charged with criminal negligence causing death and [[Causing death by dangerous driving|dangerous driving causing death]]. On May 25, 2010, all charges against Bryant were withdrawn, with prosecutors describing the cyclist as the aggressor in the incident.&lt;ref name="Withdrawn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/charges-against-bryant-in-fatal-crash-withdrawn-1.898818|title=Charges against Bryant in fatal crash withdrawn |last=|first=|accessdate=2014-05-26|newspaper=CBC News | date=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclists attacking cyclists===

Bike rage does not only involve altercations between drivers and cyclists. In some cases, there have been fights between cyclists. In an incident in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], a 51-year-old cyclist suggested to a 28-year-old cyclist that he should get a bike light so that others could see him. After hearing this comment, the younger cyclist felt "extremely insulted" and allegedly tried to force the older man off the road. The 51-year-old was followed to his home, at which point the 28-year-old "clamped his hands around O'Brien's head" and then "... twisted O'Brien to the ground and kicked him in the ribs." Police indicated that they planned to charge the younger man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christians |first=Lindsay |url=http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/317158 |title=Cap Times : Ct |publisher=Madison.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Branko Cvetkovic''' (born 1951), a Slovenian [[photographer]] known for his philosophically conceptualized approach to photography. Working mostly with [[Large format (photography)|large-format cameras]], his architecture photography is minimalistically structured. From symmetry he opens up the space perspective to [[deconstructivism]], and in art there is a transition to a non-perspective suprematist plane, thus coinciding with [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dejan Sluga, director and curator of Photon Gallery {{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}, in his opinion of Cvetkovic`s artwork&lt;/ref&gt; Besides space, his main concern is the phenomenon of light itself, the two basic postulates in photography.

==Biography==

Branko Cvetkovic was born on April 15, 1951 in [[Novo Mesto]], Slovenia, former [[Yugoslavia]]. He graduated in political economics under the mentorship of one of the best known Yugoslavian economists, France Cerne, at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Ljubljana. After working for various research institutions he served as an expert for manpower   for the government of the Republic of  [[Seychelles]].  He was also appointed as an expert for the United Nations organization Habitat.

He started to become involved with photography in 1986 and 1987 in the Seychelles. This coincidental beginning and later obsession was triggered by his fascination with light – a reminiscence of a childhood awareness of the light on the houses of his birthplace – and an emerging sensitivity to fine art, dating from his student years.  Nevertheless, his first two independent, and still amateur, projects were the [[Creole House|Creole houses]] and a continuous conceptual recording of the light above the [[Silhouette Island|island Silhouette]]. After his return home he abandoned his work as an economist and went on to work as an artist, a profession in his belief of greater importance and of greater and lasting value. He started to work professionally in photography; upgrading his technical skills and perception of fine art. Since 1990 he has been a free-lance photographer working mainly in architecture, industry and art; in the early years he also dealt with creative and artistic management and design.

In the years 1992 – 98 the several works were awarded, where Cvetkovic played a role as creative, conceptual or art director, co-designer and photographer.&lt;ref name="Golden MM for the 1992 calendar for UBK Bank entitled The Rocks" &gt;(from the cycle "The rocks and the sea").

Branko Cvetkovic resides in Ljubljana.

==Artistic work==

Initially, his approaches had evolved intuitively, then there was a [[Cognition|cognition process]] of photography and art, involving analyses of [[conceptual art]] and minimalistic expression in [[Bauhaus]] modernism and avant-garde upgraded by [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivism]]. In architectural photography he radicalized certain conceptual and functionalist approaches which can be compared with or are similar to those of the Bechers’ Düsseldorf school. He  worked conceptually and was particularly devoted to defining spatial light and transmitting and upgrading the form or architecture of space. In spite of his highly objective aspirations in this period he could be considered a constructivist.

In his late period he established a philosophical idea of Non-Space as a totality of abstract space. In the fine art sense he transformed space into an abstract expressive image of the (suprematist) plane as the ultimate transformation of three-dimensional space into nil or zero dimension. Therefore, he discovered his artistic ambitions in the field of abstract expressionism.

==Bauhaus period==

In his early studies Cvetkovic found himself mainly occupied with the issue of the complexity of light and image, its disintegration into layers with various depths of field, in order to envisage a new image and to formulate or to frame it on the Bauhaus modernist plane.

In this period (1990-1995) he dealt with minimalistic and conceptual topics summed up in projects: Rocks and Water, Light within Seashells, Waves and Series of Seawater Abstractions.  His projects continued with almost abstract cycles in the Bauhaus constructivist manner: Lux  Plantarum (1997) and Light of Shadow – Drawing of Form (1998), both exhibited in Ljubljana.

This was the introduction leading to his most complex  opus of industrial photography, still defined  by the Bauhaus spirit and undertaken at the industrial premises of the Akrapovic firm in the years 1997 and 1998, continuing in 2002 and 2003: Tubes, Chinese Cosmos, Abstractions and Bauhaus . His final creation in this field was in 8x10 inches LF and was named Locomotives (2005).

==Architecture: from minimalist structuralism to deconstructivism==

In architectural photography Cvetkovic has made his  way from [[structuralism]] to [[deconstructivism]]. At his early stage of involvement in photography, Cvetkovic had been posing himself the  question of the construction  of  the constructivist frame  on the one hand and on the other  the problem of defining or constructing light within space.&lt;ref&gt;Cvetkovic develops his concept in his text for the catalogue "The Construction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces" publisher Mestna galerija, {{COBISS|ID=214121984}}{{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, his architectural photography is minimalistic, rationalized and architecturally schematic. A reading of light is defined by the architectural shell itself. With this approach he autonomously developed modernist functionalist architectural photography and only in this way did he find himself side by side with the developing Düsseldorf school.

===Old industrial architecture – archeology of light===

His first exhibition The Old Power Station in Ljubljana in 1992, was the first in this series, as well as the continuation of his project of old industrial buildings, namely Rog and the old brick factory of Ljubljana, which were exhibited in 1997 under the title Past Spaces. In the old power station Cvetkovic did not only make a so-called archeological inventory of the building, he also introduced the archeology of spatial light. He had researched light, as one of the critics &lt;ref&gt;Catalogue for the Fine Arts Exhibitions "Past Spaces", European Cultural Month, Ljubljana 1997, {{COBISS|ID=1679470}}&lt;/ref&gt; put it. In Past Spaces (1997), he had already presented architecture by sequencing the framing and "new" construction of the perspective by overturning the areas or planes of a picture similar to Russian constructivism.

===Concept of symmetry and minimalism – Plecnik˙s Marketplace===

Radical in his concept, Cvetkovic was presented as an architectural photographer in the full complexity of his work in 1996, with his exhibition of [[Ljubljana Central Market|Plecnik`s Marketplace]]. In this exhibition he broke with the contemporary [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] tradition of representing architecture in Slovenia by replacing it with a functionalist overview. The scheme and the structure of the photographic work were outlined by him during the period of the renovation of Plecnik’s buildings. He shaped the Plecnik’s architecture in doctrinaire typology by using the symmetrical minimalist concept, perspective-corrected images of the architectural structures, consistently outlined only by a diffused non-shadow light, which became the light of an object itself. This was the method the photographer strictly implemented during the period coinciding with the emerging Düsseldorf school. The whole exhibition took place at the Municipal Gallery of Ljubljana and was accompanied by the artist’s monograph.&lt;ref&gt;Artist monograph "The market in Ljubljana designed by the architect Joze Plecnik", Ljubljana 1996, Rokus, {{ISBN|961-209-033-5}}. Text on photography "Multifaceted photographs of Branko Cvetkovic" written by Aleksander Bassin. Other texts on architecture by Asja Krecic, Peter Krecic.&lt;/ref&gt; It paved the way for him to the most important cultural and professional Slovenian institutions, whilst he became distinguished with his interpretation of the architecture of their home buildings, their reconstructions and renovations. The collections of his photographs are represented as the core of the archives of the National University Library, Cankar Cultural Centre, Slovenian Philharmonic Hall, Slovenian National Opera and Ballet, Municipal Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana, the Institution for Public Health, House of Constitutional Law, etc.

===Plecnik˙s National University Library in Ljubljana===

Cvetkovic completed extensive work on Plecnik`s architecture of the [[National and University Library of Slovenia]] (NUK) in the years 1998–1999 and 2003. The originals were taken by large format 4x5 inch and 13x18 cm [[Sinar]] P2 and [[Hasselblad]] 6x6. The lead and the principle of the photography and composition are based on the Düsseldorf school doctrine. In some cases sequential photographing was also taken into account. Truly exceptional is the photograph of the main entrance façade; for the first time in the history of the NUK this is seen and established in one perspective-corrected picture, actually amalgamated from three vertically positioned originals in 13x18 cm format. Because of the narrow street and the extent of the façade, this had hitherto been an unattainable, a constant enigmatic frustration never to be overcome.

Cvetkovic has approached Plecnik not only in his creative aspiration, but also ethically in his unconditional aspiration to perfection. In each of the photographed spaces his interest was also in its symbolic meaning. For him, in his picturing the Plecnik`s architecture, the basic message was the fine art transmittance of architecture with the sequential construction of the planes with the typical reduction of the light and the maximal objectivistic and plastic construction of the space, thus positioning the Plecnik`s sequencing of the classical, almost renaissance architectural space.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt;

===Opera House in Ljubljana===

Almost the contrary has been achieved with Cvetkovic`s architectural photography in his introspective survey of the [[Slovenian National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] in Ljubljana as a paradigmatic amphitheatric space. This extensive work was accomplished in the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2007-2011.

===deKons===

In 2004 Cvetkovic exhibited his new de-constructivist series entitled Deconstruction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces, shortly deKons.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Bassin, director of the City Art Museum Ljubljana, Catalogue of the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; The oeuvre started to emerge during the renovation of the Auersperg palace Turjaska palaca. The author departed from the Düsseldorf school presentation. He radicalized the classical upright perspective; he controlled the architectural image by framing it in the sense of Russian constructivism, thus opening up the way to abstraction. This transformation enabled Cvetkovic to be liberated from the classical principle.

Indirect recording of light within the shell of the architecture as an analytical tool necessarily makes it possible to create a new abstract quality – the quality of the light as a means of the sequential decomposition of spatial framings. The author gives the explanation himself: "Therefore we do not only achieve the effect of constructing the perspective by overturning planes in two-dimensional space (in constructivist sense) but deconstruction of perspective and disintegration of planes by the act of deconstruction of light. Inversely that means creation or construction of a new abstract deconstructed space." &lt;ref&gt;Branko Cvetkovic in his conceptual guideline in "The Construction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces", publisher Ljubljana City Museum (Mestni muzej Ljubljana) 2004 {{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backstage===

Another constructivist project entitled Backstage was recorded in [[Cankar Hall|Cankar Cultural Centre]] (Cankarjev dom) in 2004 and 2005. Cvetkovic develops his idea of abstract space as a dynamic construction never defined, yet firmly built on its groundwork base, but varied in its contingency forms upon the physical optics of various projects. These are the spaces of Backstage, which  both serve and  model the creativity. The static picture of a construction-based form is varied to a dynamic deconstructed space, decomposed into planes; the planes that host the people as creative figures and momentary actors.

Beside the main opus, there are two special series in Backstage, denoting solely the Stage as a Podium and as a Hall. The first is designed to comply with the idea of Stage as [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]’s fine art image plane. Cvetkovic’s photographic plane is marked by unnumbered timeless coloured traces that physically mark and embody human action on the stage for ever. The other series denotes a hall as a deconstructed space of a [[Suprematism|suprematist Malevich square]] plane. Each is determined and sponsored by the unique colour of the square plane. Both series are initiated and denoted by a black square – seven minutes exposure in the totally dark space of the stage – as a prelude to an abstract image of indefinable expectation on the part of the spectator.

===En Face===

According to several art critics, Cvetkovic reached the heights in the programmed course with the En Face exhibition in the  [[National Gallery of Slovenia]] (Narodna galerija) in 2005, accompanied with the monograph – catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Artist monograph – catalogue "En Face", Branko Cvetkovic, 2005, {{ISBN|961-236-952-6}}. Texts by Peter Gulic, Boris Gorupic&lt;/ref&gt; 
Large format photographs with substantial enlargements, some of them digitally composed into one unified frame enlargement, speak of the façade and its embodying the technical, cultural, social and historical artefact. The façade shows itself as a connotation and determiner of the place. Quoting the author, "the only one building of certain space is the unicum of that place and that place alone becomes the only one place of that certain building". From this intentionally prefixed [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] it may be established that in his work, Cvetkovic, who has been constantly loyal to his conceptual reasoning in the photographic sense of the matter, wider in the fields of fine art and theory, has approached the Düsseldorf school most closely.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"&gt;written by Ph.D. Peter Krecic for the author`s nomination for the National Artist Award – [http://www.krecic.si/predlog-za-presernovo-nagrado-za-leto-2014-fotograf-branko-cvetkovic.html/ Presernova nagrada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Dejan Sluga, curator, for the catalogue of the exhibition City Perspectives, Photon Gallery, Ankerbrotfabrik, Vienna, 2014, {{ISBN|978-961-92744-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To finalize the representation of Cvetkovic oeuvre attention should be drawn to his outstanding management of space and perspective correction and his ability to impart to the image   in his photography the archetypes, the timelessness and  the entireness of the structured  spaces as a whole or things as architectures by themselves.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt;

==The field of abstract expressionism==

===Non-Space / ZeroSpace===

In the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 Cvetkovic concluded his complex and extensive project entitled NON-SPACE / ZeroSPACE. The author goes through abstraction to the field of abstract expressionism, both conceptually and philosophically, both in the elaboration and execution of his work on 5x7 and 8x10 large format film originals.
His philosophical reductionist idea of non-space is presented as an antithesis of real space.&lt;ref&gt;The author`s philosophical and fine art discourse on space and its antithesis non-space - [http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ Photon galerija] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |date=May 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real space has converged into anti-space, into a totality of absolute abstraction of space which in terms of fine art, after the exclusion of perspective, light and real time, denotes an abstract expressive plane as a final transformation of space. In this way the basic three fine art issues are once again introduced into modernist art discourse. These are: perspective, light and the concept of space.  The transformation of space into plane confirms and challenges the idea of a black and white square plane. Cvetkovic is radical in developing his thesis. He confronts his conception of the basic fine art principles with the most human abstract and universal experience; the human comprehension of death.&lt;ref&gt;"The recipe of work of art...There must be a clear preoccupation with death – intimations of mortality...Tragic art, romantic art, etc. deals with the knowledge of death." Mark Rothko, Address to Pratt Institute, 1958, published by Robert Rosenblum, The Abstraction of Landscape From Northern Romanticism to Abstract Expresionism, Fundacion Juan March, 2007. {{ISBN|978-84-7075-549-1}}. Cvetkovic develops his thesis in elaboration of NON-SPACE / ZeroSPACE in [http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ Photon galerija] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |date=May 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this conceptual context, with utmost consistency and vigorousness, the author elaborates his exceptional frames of vast seascapes, transforming these huge spaces into vast abstract minimalistic planes; the screens and the images are ones that have not yet been encountered in Slovenian art.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt; 
 
The main idea is the gradual elimination of perspective and sublime transition of space to plane – "screen". Series called Screens, with many derivations, colours and transformations, accentuate abstraction of space to an expressive two-dimensional plane. The last are those of the "Black and white plane" as the final synthesis of denomination to NON-SPACE│ZeroSPACE, concluded as a total abstraction with no dimension.

===White lights as heaven lights===

In spite of total reduction and final darkness, the definitive will towards total liberation, as the idea of huge space in open sky and light, emerges. It could be termed heaven`s light or simply the big magic light, which outlasts and illuminates everything in all its material transformations. This light is the symbol of human mental eternal space.

White lights; open ocean spaces with vast light ruptures and immense light rays, and even bigger light chasms that literally swallow and dematerialize everything by colouring  it into white dazzling lights, are the founding idea for the project that also opens up for the terminating idea of the Heaven Lights.

Much earlier than impressionists, and later abstract expressionists, [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]] was the first  painter of romantic and symbolic heritage, who was mainly preoccupied with the idea of light. In his paintings: [[Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps]], 1812, Shade and Darkness – the Evening of the Deluge, 1843, Light and Colour – the Morning after the Deluge, 1843, he tried to introspect and consume the light as a spiritual category in its mysticism and abstraction of its highest spiritual elevation. In the first painting, the light and the sun rest under the firmament of clouds shaped like a cathedral vault. Respectively, in other above-mentioned paintings, the light is embodied in the circle that reflects the gaze into a dome. Turner`s approach gave to the phenomenon of light the power for elevation that absorbs the spectator.

In the author’s opinion, these are fantastic grounds for deviation into abstract, non-material, non-objective matter; confrontation of photography with the essential and most basic constitutional matter, Light. This is the reason why his project, based on introspection of sublime light, elevation from darkness into the light, and spiritual absorption, a voyage that is traced by light, could be handled and tracked by photography and its basic tool, Light.

Cvetkovic’s work is based on the movement of the large format 8x10 in. camera which, with its resolution power of 8x10 in. film and long exposures, can absorb the light in its abstract images.

===Reading of photography===

Photography is rigorously objectivistic. Symmetries are their basic orientation points. The notion of expressiveness is accentuated by perspective and the absence of it, respectively. The series of Screen and Plane coincide with abstract expressionism. In addition, the presentiment and sensation of huge minimalistic planes with expressive supernatural connotation have to possess monumental momentum. Their modem is an abstract pattern which we, unawares, inhibit in ourselves. White Lights is mainly based on symmetries and very strong reflective light on the ocean.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4427">'''Chekhov's gun''' ({{lang-ru|Чеховское ружьё}}) is a [[drama]]tic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed; elements should not appear to make "false promises" by never coming into play. The statement is recorded in letters by [[Anton Chekhov]] several times, with some variation:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chekhov's art, a stylistic analysis|author=Petr Mikhaĭlovich Bit︠s︡illi|year=1983|publisher=Ardis|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Literature 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Novelists, Playwrights, and Poets of All Time|author=Daniel S. Burt|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marble"&gt;{{citation|title=Chekhov: The Silent Voice of Freedom|author=Valentine T. Bill|year=1987|publisher=Philosophical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there."&lt;ref name="marble" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|date=1911|year=|title=Из воспоминаний об А.П. Чехове|trans-title=Memoirs|url=|journal=Русская Мысль [Russian Thought]|volume=|page=44|pages=|via=|author=С.Н. Щукин [Sergius Shchukin]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep." Chekhov, letter to Aleksandr Semenovich Lazarev (pseudonym of A. S. Gruzinsky), 1 November 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/lists/quotations/quotations_by_ib.html|title=Quotations by Berlin|work=ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://chehov.niv.ru/chehov/letters/1888-1889/letter-707.htm|author=Чехов А.

* "If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there." From Gurlyand's ''Reminiscences of A. P. Chekhov'', in ''Teatr i iskusstvo'' 1904, No. 28, 11 July, p.&amp;nbsp;521.&lt;ref&gt;In 1889, 24-year-old Ilia Gurliand noted these words down from Chekhov's conversation: "If in Act I you have a pistol hanging on the wall, then it must fire in the last act". Donald Rayfield, ''Anton Chekhov: A Life'', New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8050-5747-1}}, 203. Ernest. J. Simmons says that Chekhov repeated the point later (which may account for the variations). Ernest J. Simmons, ''Chekhov: A Biography'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962, {{ISBN|0-226-75805-2}}, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note the difference between Chekhov's Gun and [[foreshadowing]]. Foreshadowing only vaguely implies that an event will take place in the future, meanwhile, the Chekhov's Gun principle guarantee's that an event will happen further along in the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Chekhov's Gun and How to Use It • The Reedsy Blog |url=https://blog.reedsy.com/chekhovs-gun/ |website=Reedsy |date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==See also==
* [[Foreshadowing]], a plot device where what is to come is hinted at, to arouse interest or to guard against disappointment
* [[MacGuffin]], a plot motivator with little or no narrative explanation
* [[Occam's razor]], a [[Razor (philosophy)|philosophical razor]] that states that, all things being equal, the explanation with fewest assumptions should be considered the most likely
* [[Red herring]], drawing attention to a certain element in order to mislead
* [[Shaggy dog story]], a long-winded anecdote designed to lure the audience into a false sense of expectation, only to disappoint them with an anticlimactic ending or punchline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11532">British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] formulated three [[adage]]s that are known as '''Clarke's three laws''', of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited. They were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Physics of Invisibility: A Story of Light and Deception|last=Beech|first=Martin|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9781461406150|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called laws include:

#{{Anchor|Clarke's first law}} When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's second law}} The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's third law}} Any sufficiently advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].

== Origins ==
One account claimed that Clarke's "laws" were developed after the editor of his works in French started numbering the author's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When|last=Keyes|first=Ralph|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2006|isbn=9780312340049|location=New York|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three laws appear in Clarke's essay "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination", first published in ''Profiles of the Future'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;"'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'" in the collection ''Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not published at the same time. Clarke's first law was proposed in the 1962 edition of the essay, as "Clarke's Law" in ''Profiles of the Future''.

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. It was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became Clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the 1973 revision of ''Profiles of the Future,'' which included an acknowledgement''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths|last=Shermer|first=Michael|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|year=2011|isbn=9780805091250|location=New York|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Clarke wrote about the third law in these words: "As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there".

The third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the "Hazards of Prophecy" essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|publisher=Popular Library|year=1973|isbn=9780330236195|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: "Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned".&lt;ref&gt;"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon", ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) by [[Charles Fort]]: "...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic," and in the short story ''[[The Hound of Death]]'' (1933) by [[Agatha Christie]]: "The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood."

Clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he "would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic", referring to his memory of "seeing and hearing [[Lynotype|Linotype]] machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’".&lt;ref name="Gooden2015"/&gt;

== Proposed fourth law ==
A fourth law has been proposed for the canon, despite Clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws. [[Geoff Holder]] quotes: "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,"&lt;ref&gt;Holder, Geoff (2009). ''101 Things to Do with a Stone Circle''. The History Press, 2009. Holder offers as his source Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' (Millennium Edition, 1999, paperback edition page 143, {{ISBN|0-575-40277-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of American economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert, but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact", from his 1995 book ''[[The Vision of the Anointed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[ Massimo Pigliucci]], ''Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk'', 2010, {{ISBN|0226667871}}; an epigraph to Chapter 12, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;pg=PA279 p. 279]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants of the third law ==

The third law has inspired many [[snowclone]]s and other variations:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4629">In proving results in [[combinatorics]] several useful '''combinatorial rules''' or '''combinatorial principles''' are commonly recognized and used.

The [[rule of sum]], [[rule of product]], and [[inclusion–exclusion principle]] are often used for [[Enumerative combinatorics|enumerative]] purposes. [[Bijective proof]]s are utilized to demonstrate that two sets have the same [[cardinality|number of elements]]. The [[pigeonhole principle]] often ascertains the existence of something or is used to determine the minimum or maximum number of something in a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] context. Many [[combinatorial identities]] arise from [[Double counting (proof technique)|double counting]] methods or the [[method of distinguished element]]. [[Generating function]]s and [[recurrence relation]]s are powerful tools that can be used to manipulate sequences, and can describe if not resolve many combinatorial situations.

== Rule of sum ==

{{main|Rule of sum}}

The rule of sum is an intuitive principle stating that if there are ''a'' possible outcomes for an event (or ways to do something) and ''b'' possible outcomes for another event (or ways to do another thing), and the two events cannot both occur (or the two things can't both be done), then there are ''a + b'' total possible outcomes for the events (or total possible ways to do one of the things). More formally, the sum of the sizes of two [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] sets is equal to the size of their union.

== Rule of product ==

{{main|Rule of product}}

The rule of product is another intuitive principle stating that if there are ''a'' ways to do something and ''b'' ways to do another thing, then there are ''a''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''b'' ways to do both things.

== Inclusion–exclusion principle ==

[[File:Inclusion-exclusion.svg|thumb|Inclusion–exclusion illustrated for three sets]]

{{main|Inclusion–exclusion principle}}

The inclusion–exclusion principle relates the size of the union of multiple sets, the size of each set, and the size of each possible intersection of the sets. The smallest example is when there are two sets: the number of elements in the union of ''A'' and ''B'' is equal to the sum of the number of elements in ''A'' and ''B'', minus the number of elements in their intersection.

Generally, according to this principle, if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are finite sets, then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\biggl|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr| &amp; {} =\sum_{i=1}^n\left|A_i\right|
-\sum_{i,j\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\right| \\
&amp; {}\qquad +\sum_{i,j,k\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j &lt; k \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k\right|-\ \cdots\ + \left(-1\right)^{n-1} \left|A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n\right|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Bijective proof ==

{{main|Bijective proof}}

Bijective proofs prove that two sets have the same number of elements by finding a [[bijective function]] (one-to-one correspondence) from one set to the other.

== Double counting ==

{{main|Double counting (proof technique)}}

Double counting is a technique that equates two expressions that count the size of a set in two ways.

== Pigeonhole principle ==

{{main|Pigeonhole principle}}

The pigeonhole principle states that if ''a'' items are each put into one of ''b'' boxes, where ''a'' &gt; ''b'', then one of the boxes contains more than one item. Using this one can, for example, demonstrate the existence of some element in a set with some specific properties.

== Method of distinguished element ==

{{main|Method of distinguished element}}

The method of distinguished element singles out a "distinguished element" of a set to prove some result.

== Generating function ==

{{main|Generating function}}

Generating functions can be thought of as polynomials with infinitely many terms whose coefficients correspond to terms of a sequence. This new representation of the sequence opens up new methods for finding identities and closed forms pertaining to certain sequences. The (ordinary) generating function of a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;G(a_n;x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n.&lt;/math&gt;

== Recurrence relation ==

{{main|Recurrence relation}}

A recurrence relation defines each term of a sequence in terms of the preceding terms. Recurrence relations may lead to previously unknown properties of a sequence, but generally [[closed-form expression]]s for the terms of a sequence are more desired.

'''Community reinforcement approach and family training''' ('''CRAFT''') is a [[behavior therapy]] approach for treating [[addiction]]. The original '''community reinforcement approach''' ('''CRA'''), developed by Nate Azrin in the 1970s, uses [[operant conditioning]] to help people learn to reduce the power of their addictions and enjoy healthy living. CRAFT combines CRA with family training, which equips families and friends with supportive techniques to encourage their loved ones to begin and continue treatment, and provides defenses against addiction's damaging effects on loved ones.

The ''community reinforcement approach'' (CRA) was "originally developed for individuals with alcohol use disorders, [but] has been successfully employed to treat a variety of [[substance use disorders]] for more than 35 years. Based on [[operant conditioning]] [a type of learning], CRA helps people rearrange their lifestyles so that healthy, drug-free living becomes rewarding and thereby competes with alcohol and drug use."&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyers |first=Robert J. |last2=Roozen |first2=Hendrik G. |last3=Smith |first3=Jane Ellen |year=2011 |title=The Community Reinforcement Approach: An Update of the Evidence |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh334/toc33_4.htm |journal=Alcohol Research &amp; Health |publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism |volume=33 |issue=4 |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

''Community reinforcement and family training'' (CRAFT) is CRA that "works through family members."&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt; It "is designed to increase the odds of the substance user who is refusing treatment to enter treatment, as well as improve the lives of the concerned family members.&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt; CRAFT "teaches the use of healthy rewards to encourage positive behaviors.

''[[Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach]]'' (A-CRA) is CRA that "targets adolescents with substance use problems and their caregivers."&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt;

== Description ==

CRAFT is a [[motivation]]al model of [[family therapy]].&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foote |first=Jeff |last2=Manuel |first2=Jennifer K. |year=2009 |title=Adapting the CRAFT approach for use in group therapy |journal=Journal of Behavior Analysis in Health, Sports, Fitness and Medicine |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1037/h0100378|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reward-based&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;—that is, based on positive reinforcement. CRAFT is aimed at the families and friends of treatment-refusing individuals who have a substance abuse problem.&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt; "CRAFT works to [[wiktionary:affect#Verb|affect]] [influence] the substance users’ behavior by changing the way the family interacts with them."&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;

In the model, the following terms are used:

* ''Identified Patient'' (IP)&amp;nbsp;– the individual with the substance abuse problem who is refusing treatment, and
* ''Concerned Significant Others'' (CSOs)&amp;nbsp;– the relevant family members and friends of the IP.&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;

"CRAFT grew out of the understanding that although individuals who truly need help with substance use problems often are strongly opposed to treatment. On the other hand, the concerned significant others (CSOs) of the substance abuser are commonly highly motivated to get help for them."&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt;

=== Three goals ===

When a loved one is abusing substances and refusing to get help, CRAFT is designed to help families learn practical and effective ways to accomplish these three goals:

# Move their loved one toward treatment,
# Reduce their loved one’s alcohol and drug use, and
# Simultaneously improve their own lives.&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;

=== Comparisons ===

One experiment compared CRAFT with Al-Anon and Nar-Anon facilitation therapies for their impacts on addicts to enter treatment. The finding was that concerned significant others who participated in Al-Anon and Nar-Anon facilitation therapy engaged 29.0% of addicts into treatment, whereas those who went through CRAFT engaged 67.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyers | first=Robert J. | last2=Miller | first2=William R. | last3=Smith | first3=Jane Ellen | last4=Tonigan | first4=J.

The study found that all of these approaches were associated with similar improvements in the functioning of concerned significant others and improvements in their relationship quality with the addicts. However, the CRAFT approach was more effective in engaging initially unmotivated problem drinkers in treatment (64%) as compared with the Al-Anon (13%) and Johnson interventions (30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=William R. | last2=Meyers | first2=Robert J. | last3=Tonigan | first3=J.

=== Family influence ===

Robert J. Meyers, PhD wrote about the influence that concerned family members have in treatment of the substance user, and the benefits for themselves:
{{ quote
|The Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) intervention ... method was developed with the belief that since family members can, and do make important contribution[s] in other areas of addiction treatment (i.e. family and couples therapy), that the CSO can play a powerful role in helping to engage the substance user who is in denial to submit to treatment. In addition, it is often the substance user who reports that family pressure or influence is the reason [they] sought treatment. Also, CSOs who attend the CRAFT program also benefit by becoming more independent and reducing their depression, anxiety and anger symptoms even if their loved one does not enter treatment.&lt;ref name="MeyersWebCRAFT"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.robertjmeyersphd.com/craft.html | title = CRAFT | publisher = Robert J.

Studies in the 1960s clearly demonstrated that even chronically dependent drinkers with access to alcohol could regulate their drinking given sufficient incentives to do so, at least under controlled laboratory conditions (Heather &amp; Robertson, 1983).&lt;ref name="MINT_Miller98" /&gt;

|Interviewer: "So, if you can, explain [to] us a little bit about how the CRAFT technique works. What's it all about?"

Dr. Bob Meyers: "Well, the CRAFT technique is a process. We bring in a family member, and what we do is we teach them how to interact differently with the drinker or the drug user. Instead of yelling and screaming when they're using drugs, we tell them to kind of just stay away from them, leave that person alone. But, then when they're sober—when they're not using drugs—we talk to them ... to tell them how much you love them, how much you care about them, how important they are to the family, and we try to help them pick their spots: when do you talk to them, when do you stay away from them.

"So, it takes a little bit of time, but we've been very successful here, being funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the [[University of New Mexico]] to run a couple of scientific studies, where we've actually proven that my CRAFT intervention is much more powerful than anything that is used out there currently."&lt;ref name="KRQE120"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dr. Bob Meyers, PhD: "CRAFT Technique" Creator&lt;!-- and unknown interviewer--&gt; |year=2007 |title=Craft Video Clip |medium=video |url=http://www.robertjmeyersphd.com/videos/krqe.wmv |accessdate=January 23, 2014 |format=wmv (Windows Media Video) |location=[[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] |publisher=KRQE News |website=krqe.com}} Time: 1:20 to 2:09&lt;/ref&gt;

With CRAFT, families/friends (CSOs) are trained in various strategies, including positive reinforcement, various communication skills, and natural consequences. "One of the big pieces that has a lot of influence over all the other strategies is positive communication.&lt;ref name="YOUTUBECMCCOMM1"&gt;{{cite AV media

# Accept Partial Responsibility&amp;nbsp;– This step "is really designed to decrease defensiveness on the part of your loved one. ...

# Offer to Help

"The overarching goals for the strategies for communicating are to help decrease defensiveness on the part of the loved one that you are speaking to, and increase the chances that your message is really going to be heard—so, increasing the ability that you have to really get across the message that you want."&lt;ref name="YOUTUBECMCCOMM1" /&gt; In fact, the title of Robert J.

|Dr. Nicole Kosanke: "Of course, all of us get to the point of frustration, ... it's pretty hard not to if you're dealing with a situation like this with your child. So, at times, yes, you're going to be frustrated and put your hands up. But, as a general rule, staying engaged and managing your feelings, asking people for help, asking people to give feedback directly to [your child]—all of that communicates a sense of engagement, rather than detaching. And, it also communicates a sense of love and caring for your child, which ultimately&amp;nbsp;— even when you're detaching&amp;nbsp;— that's what you have inside, and that's a real ingredient for helping impact someone [to] change."

Dr. Josh King: "I would say this [engagement] is almost the opposite of detaching. ... [Detachment] is either you can give them the feedback or not [as if] the best thing you can do is step away, which I don't agree with. I think when you step away, you have no impact on the ability to make change."

Dr. Nicole Kosanke: "In [the example] situation, you're also inviting the community to have an impact on your child. CRAFT stands for '''Community'' Reinforcement and Family Training.'

Al-Anon does not currently adopt, hold, or promote the view that concerned significant others (CSOs) can, with any certainty, make a positive, direct, and active contribution to arrest compulsive drinking. However, Al-Anon says that by CSOs improving their own attitudes, and offering support and encouragement to the user, the "family situation is bound to improve." On the other hand, the premise of CRAFT is that deliberate, positive interactions can increase willingness and decrease resistance of users to treatment.  Al-Anon recognizes that while increased willingness and decreased resistance may be a happy by-product of detaching from the adverse behaviors of alcoholics, there are no guarantees that this will occur.  [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] is a fellowship with a focus on helping families and friends, themselves, without promoting a direct intervention process for alcoholics ''(see [[Al-Anon/Alateen]])''. Because "no one ever graduates" from [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]],&lt;ref name="PCFGrad"&gt;{{cite news|last=Broughton |first=June B. |title=Alanon: Help, But 'No One Graduates' |url=http://news.nnyln.net/potsdam-courier-freeman/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july%20-%200565.pdf |format=pdf |department= |newspaper=Potsdam Courier and Freeman |location=Potsdam, N.Y., Lawrence, N.Y. |publisher=Northern New York Historical Newspapers |publication-date=July 1978 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203104740/http://news.nnyln.net/potsdam-courier-freeman/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july%20-%200565.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Anon can be viewed as an open-ended program, not time-limited, whereas CRAFT is more specific.

=== Al-Anon view ===

Regarding the CSO's relationship to [[alcoholism]] and sobriety, the view from the [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] organization can be summarized:

# ''Powerlessness''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]'s First Step promotes a powerless view for families and friends, "We admitted we were powerless over [[alcohol]]—that our lives had become unmanageable."&lt;ref name="HIW45"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Disease]]''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] writes, "As the [[American Medical Association]] will attest, [[alcoholism]] is a [[disease]]."&lt;ref name="HIW17" /&gt; [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] also states, "Although it can be arrested, [[alcoholism]] has no known cure."&lt;ref name="HIW17"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
One member writes, "I have been affected by a terrible disease,"&lt;ref name="HIW158" /&gt; which embraces the "disease model" of [[alcoholism]]. As an [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] reflects on that step, "By ourselves, we can do nothing to overcome the effects of this disease. In fact, our attempts to exert power over alcohol have made our lives unmanageable."&lt;ref name="HIW4546" /&gt; These statements are based on the First Step of [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], which is, "We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable."&lt;ref name="HIW4546"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | pages = 45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;
# ''Three C's''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] has a dictum called "the Three C's—I didn't cause [[alcoholism]]; I can't control it; and I can't cure it."&lt;ref name="HIW158"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Detach with Love.'' [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] "advocates 'loving detachment' from the substance abuser" (see sidebar: Engaging v. Detaching).
# ''Family illness''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] writes, "[[Alcoholism]] is a family [[disease]],"&lt;ref name="Detachment_S19"&gt;{{cite web | author = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | url = http://www.al-anon.org/members/pdf/S19.pdf | title = Detachment | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | accessdate = January 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "we believe [[alcoholism]] is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery."&lt;ref name="Al-Anon_Preamble"&gt;{{cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/the-twelve-steps | title = Suggested Al-Anon Preamble to the Twelve Steps | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = January 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This family-illness view may appear contradictory to the individual-disease view, except that [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]'s focus is to help the family members and friends of [[alcoholics]].--&gt;&lt;!--

They write, "The family situation is bound to improve as we apply the Al-Anon ideas. Without such spiritual help, living with an alcoholic is too much for most of us."&lt;ref name="Meeting_On_Wheels"&gt;{{ cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/members/pdf/guidelines/G22.pdf | title = Al-Anon Guideline: A Meeting on Wheels, G-22 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = April 26, 2010 | pages = 1}}, "Suggested Al-Anon/Alateen Welcome"&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

Regarding [[alcoholics]], the [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]-recommended approach for CSOs (families/friends) is "detachment with love"
&lt;ref name="Hartman2007"&gt;{{cite web | first=Rosemary |last=Hartman|title=Detachment with Love Gains New Meaning | website=Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation | date=2007 | url=http://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/detachment-with-love-gains-new-meaning | accessdate=February 16, 2017|quote="Al-Anon, a mutual-help group for people with alcoholic friends or family members, pioneered the idea of detachment with love."}}&lt;!-- Note: Earliest archived version from Feb 2007, but it may be earlier.

==== No direct impact ====
As far as the CSOs having a direct and positive impact on another's sobriety, [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] asks and answers itself:
{{quote
|"But surely," we argue, "sobriety is desirable, and there must be something we can do to help! There has to be something we can say that will make a difference, or some sort of help or support or information we can provide that will convince our [[alcoholic]] loved ones to get the help they need or to make sure they continue on the path to recovery!"&lt;ref name="HIW17"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholism]] is a disease. Would the right word stop the spread of [[cancer]] or make [[chemotherapy]] more effective? Would our help, good looks, higher income, or cleaner house overcome the progression of [[Alzheimer's Disease]]? Our compassion and support might make a loved one's struggle with illness easier to bear, but it is simply not within our power to cure someone else's [[disease]]. We are powerless over another's [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="HIW17" /&gt;|sign=|source=}}This answer has these three characteristics:&lt;!--, except they "believe that [[alcoholism]] is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery."&lt;ref name="Al-Anon_Preamble" /&gt; Aside from the ''[[wiktionary:non sequitur|non sequitur]]'' that [[alcoholism]] is a disease—therefore we do not have the power to cure others and we are powerless over another's alcoholism, esp. as it relates to the CRA and CRAFT premise that CSOs can have a positive impact--&gt;

# ''Absolute outcomes''. Regarding ''help'', Al-Anon's answer tends toward complete and total outcomes, such as the ability for someone to ''convince'', ''cure'' or ''overcome'' someone else's [[alcoholism]], or that they could guarantee ''(make sure)'' that someone continues on the path to recovery. Although this answer may help dispel the notion that someone has permanent, guaranteed power over another's sobriety, it does not answer the question that someone could provide ''any'' measure of direct help or support toward someone else's sobriety or treatment of someone else's addiction, which is the basis of CRAFT.
# ''Incomplete analogies''. Al-Anon wrote that ''the right word'' can neither make [[chemotherapy]]—a [[bio-chemical]] process—more effective ''nor stop'' [[cancer]]. However, the answer does not address the ''help'' or ''support'' or ''information'' that could make [[cancer treatment]] more effective or that could have a positive impact against [[cancer]]. &lt;!-- removed, probabaly unnecessary: In a CRAFT analogy, ''words'' and behavior could have a direct and positive impact on someone partaking in [[cancer treatment]], with a successful outcome.--&gt;
# ''Medical opinion''. Modern contrary assessments exist that [[alcoholism|alcohol]] (and [[drug addiction|drug]]) [[addiction]] are ''not'' (progressive, incurable) [[diseases]], coming from Dr. Gene Heyman&lt;ref name="HEYMAN"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heyman |first=Gene M. |year= 2010 |title= Addiction: A Disorder of Choice |url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057272|format= paperback|location= [[Cambridge, MA|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts|MA]] |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |publication-date= October 2010|isbn= 978-0-674-05727-2|accessdate= January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others ''(see [[disease theory of alcoholism]])''. In 1960, [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]]—the co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous|A.A.]] (his wife [[Lois W.|Lois]] was co-founder of [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]])—called [[alcoholism]] a ''malady or illness'' and did not view it as a [[disease]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccatoday.org/conversation.htm NCCAtoday.org]&lt;/ref&gt; ''(see [[Alcoholics Anonymous#Disease concept of alcoholism|Alcoholics Anonymous § Disease concept of alcoholism]])''. The diagnostic assessment of [[alcoholism]] in someone can include an assessment of [[co-morbidity]], [[mental illness]], and [[domestic violence]]. &lt;!-- unnecessary, and could be harmful to Al-Anon:; and [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] does not claim to be a medical or therapy organization.--&gt;
&lt;!--Perhaps germane, [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] has this disclaimer in their suggested meeting materials: "Take what you like and leave the rest."&lt;ref name="Meeting_On_Wheels_Closing"&gt;{{ cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/members/pdf/guidelines/G22.pdf | title = Al-Anon Guideline: A Meeting on Wheels, G-22 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = January 22, 2014 | pages = 2}}, "Al-Anon/Alateen Closing"&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
&lt;!--
[[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] is a fellowship founded on [[twelve steps]]. It is not a medical, therapy, or direct [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] society ''(see [[Al-Anon/Alateen]])''.
--&gt;
&lt;!-- Omitted, may confuse the issue:
As far as positive effect, a premise they hold is that "the family situation is bound to improve as we apply the Al-Anon ideas. Without such spiritual help, living with an alcoholic is too much for most of us."&lt;ref name="Meeting_On_Wheels"&gt;{{ cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/members/pdf/guidelines/G22.pdf | title = Al-Anon Guideline: A Meeting on Wheels, G-22 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = April 26, 2010 | pages = 1}}, "Suggested Al-Anon/Alateen Welcome"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] does not practice or teach active, direct [[interventions]]. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] is a support fellowship offering a [[twelve-step]] program of recovery for families and friends of [[alcoholics]] for the families and friends, themselves. Their focus is on the families and friends. ''(See [[Al-Anon/Alateen]])''.
--&gt;

=== CRAFT view ===

''From [[SMART Recovery#Family &amp; Friends|SMART Recovery, section: Family &amp; Friends]]:''

{{ quote
|The work of Robert Meyers' CRAFT Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training program ... differs significantly from [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] in that it is a behavioral program which advocates that the CSO ''[Concerned Significant Other]'' can have a positive impact on the substance abuser. The CRAFT program has been demonstrated in Meyers' research to be more effective than the [[Vernon Johnson]] type [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] or [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]], with less negative side-effects and better outcomes, whether or not the substance abuser enters treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.E. &amp; Meyers, R.J. (2004) Motivating Substance Abusers to Enter Treatment: Working with Family Members; Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, RJ &amp; Wolfe, B. (2004) Get Your Loved One Sober: Alternative to Nagging, Pleading and Threatening by Meyers, Hazelden Press&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The CRAFT program uses a variety of interventions based on functional assessment including a module to prevent [[domestic violence]].

== Intervention ==

"There are questions about the long-term effectiveness of interventions for those addicted to drugs or alcohol.  A study examining addicts who had undergone a standard intervention (called the Johnson Intervention) found that they had a higher relapse rate than any other method of referral to outpatient Alcohol and Other Drug treatment"&lt;ref&gt;"The Johnson intervention and relapse during outpatient treatment".  American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse 22.n3 (August 1996): pp36&lt;/ref&gt;''(see [[Intervention (counseling)#Controversy|Intervention, section: Controversy]])''.

Smith, Campos-Melady and Meyers describe the Johnson Institute [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] as a "surprise party" that is uncomfortable for many CSOs (families/friends):

{{quote
|The [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] approach’s emphasis upon detaching from the substance abuser is unappealing to many CSOs. On the other end of the spectrum is the Johnson Institute [[Intervention (counseling)|Intervention]]: a “surprise party” in which the IP is confronted by family members and a therapist with the objective of getting the IP to enter treatment. When the [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] is actually carried out, it often results in a high rate of engagement in treatment, and yet only a small number of CSOs who begin the program ever follow through with the [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] (Liepman, Nirenberg, &amp; Begin, 1989; Miller et al., 1999), and many report feeling uncomfortable with its confrontational nature (Barber &amp; Gilbertson, 1997).&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt;{{rp|22}}
}}

Research suggests that CRAFT has had significantly greater success than the Johnson [[Intervention (counseling)|Intervention]] method or [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], as far as engaging loved ones in treatment.

|70% of people who use CRAFT are likely to get their loved into treatment as opposed to 30% of people using an intervention ... . And then, for Al-Anon, you've got like 12% of people getting their loved one into treatment. Now, that's sort of not a fair comparison because Al-Anon is not designed to get someone else to do something. Al-Anon is specifically designed to help the family member feel better, and that it does quite well, but in terms of influencing change in the loved one [—the substance user], not so well. And, the only reason to make those comparisons ... is simply because there are no other options in our society. So, if you go to a therapist or a clergyman or something and say "my kid is smoking too much pot, and I don't know what to do about it," they are going to send you to Al-Anon or a therapist, or talk to you about getting an intervention [not CRAFT]. So, those are the options [to CRAFT] we have in the world.

==== Outpatient ====

"The Community Reinforcement Approach has been found to be extremely effective in outpatient settings as well. In one study, clients treated with CRA and the [[disulfiram]] compliance component were abstinent an average of 97% of the days during the last month of the 6-month followup, whereas clients treated with a combination of a [[12-step]] program and the CRA [[disulfiram]] compliance training were
abstinent an average of 74% of the days. For those clients who received a [[12-step]] program and a prescription for [[disulfiram]], an average of only 45% of the comparable days were abstinent (Azrin, Sisson, Meyers, &amp; Godley, 1982)."&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== CRAFT (and Al-Anon, intervention, etc.) ===

An offshoot of the community reinforcement approach is the community reinforcement approach and family training.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt; This program is designed to help family members of substance abusers feel empowered to engage in treatment.

From an article on the American Psychology Association (APA) website about the success of CRAFT in substance abuse treatment and intervention,&lt;ref name="APACRAFT" /&gt; these are the success outcomes for engaging drinkers into treatment:

# 64%&amp;nbsp;– CRAFT
# 23%&amp;nbsp;– Johnson [[Intervention (counseling)|Intervention]]
# 13%&amp;nbsp;– [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]

From the article:

{{ quote
|Sisson and Azrin (1986) recruited 12 adult women with an [[alcoholic]] husband, brother, or father and randomly assigned them either to an early version of CRAFT or to a traditional [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]. Results indicated that CRAFT was considerably more successful in getting the persons with substance abuse into treatment and reducing their alcohol consumption in comparison to the [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] group. Miller et al. (1999) conducted a controlled comparison of CRAFT, the Johnson Intervention, and [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] facilitation (TSF) that randomized 130 caregivers of problem drinkers to receive 12 hours of contact in one of the three conditions. CRAFT and TSF had better retention than the Johnson Intervention. Consistent with previous studies, participants tended to drop out of the latter intervention in order to avoid the family confrontation with the drinker. The CRAFT intervention also engaged substantially more drinkers into treatment (64% vs 23% Johnson and 13% TSF).&lt;ref name="APACRAFT"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/intervention/community-reinforcement.aspx | title = CRAFT | publisher = American Psychology Association | accessdate = 20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drug abusers intervention ====

From the same article on the American Psychology Association (APA) website about the success of CRAFT in substance abuse treatment and intervention,&lt;ref name="APACRAFT" /&gt; these are the success outcomes for persons abusing drugs to enter treatment (the success outcomes were nearly the same as the [[alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] outcomes):

# 64%&amp;nbsp;– CRAFT
# 17%&amp;nbsp;– Caregivers' [[Twelve-step]] Self-help Group (TSG)

From the article:

{{ quote
|Kirby et al. (1999) randomly assigned 32 caregivers of drug users to CRAFT or a [[twelve-step|12-step]] self-help group (TSG). Caregivers who were assigned to CRAFT attended more sessions than those in TSG and were more likely to complete a full course of counseling during which the persons abusing drugs were far more likely to enter treatment (64% vs 17%). Reductions in drug use occurred during the study, but there was no group x time interaction. Meyers et al. (2002) replicated and extended those findings with drug users with similar positive effects on engagement of the drug abusing family members in treatment.&lt;ref name="APACRAFT" /&gt;
}}

Note: When the articles states "there was no group x time interaction," it simply means the CRAFT outcome (64%) and the TSF outcome (17%) remained the same over time, even though there was a reduction in drug use during the study.

|Interviewer: "Tell me how big of a problem addiction is in this country."

Dr. Bob Meyers: "Well, the reason I got started in the CRAFT technique is because it seems like almost ''everybody'' you know has a brother, a cousin, a family member who has problems with alcohol or some other drug, and just doesn't want to get help. And, my specific technique—the CRAFT model—has helped people to try to get those individuals, who really don't want help, into treatment."&lt;ref name="KRQE37"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dr. Bob Meyers, PhD: "CRAFT Technique" Creator&lt;!-- and unknown interviewer--&gt; |year=2007 |title=Craft Video Clip |medium=video |url=http://www.robertjmeyersphd.com/videos/krqe.wmv |accessdate=January 23, 2014 |format=wmv (Windows Media Video) |location=[[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] |publisher=KRQE News |website=krqe.com}} Time: 0:37 to 0:59&lt;/ref&gt;

CRA was designed by Nate Azrin in the early 1970s:

{{ quote
|The most influential behaviorist of all times, [[B. F. Skinner]], largely considered [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] to be an ineffective method for modifying human behavior ([[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] 1974). Thus it was no surprise that, many years later, research discovered that [[substance use disorder]] treatments based on confrontation were largely ineffective in decreasing the use of alcohol and other substances (Miller and Wilbourne 2002, Miller et al. 1998). Nate Azrin already was convinced of this back in the early 1970s, when he designed an innovative treatment for [[alcoholism|alcohol problems]]: the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA). Azrin believed that it was necessary to alter the environment in which people with [[alcoholism|alcohol problems]] live so that they received strong reinforcement for sober behavior from their community, including family, work, and friends. As part of this strategy, the program emphasizes helping clients discover new, enjoyable activities that do not revolve around alcohol, and teaching them the skills necessary for participating in those activities.&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt;
}}

The origin of CRAFT:

{{ quote
|Drs. Robert J. Meyers and Jane Ellen Smith of the [[University of New Mexico]] developed the CRAFT program to teach families how to impact their loved one while avoiding both detachment and confrontation, the respective strategies of [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] (a [[12-Step]] based approach), and traditional (Johnson Institute-style) interventions in which the substance user is confronted by family members and friends during a surprise meeting. While all three approaches have been found to improve family members' functioning and relationship satisfaction, CRAFT has proven to be significantly more effective in engaging loved ones in comparison to the Johnson Institute Intervention or [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]/[[Nar-Anon]] facilitation therapy.&lt;ref name="CMCWISCRAFT"&gt;{{cite web |title= What Is CRAFT|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher= The Center for Motivation and Change (CMC)|url=http://www.motivationandchange.com/family-services/what-is-craft|website=www.motivationandchange.com|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 ===

Up to 2009, CRAFT and CRA programs were not widespread amongst [[addiction]] counselors. Instead, many [[addiction]] counselors were tied to a [[Twelve-step program|twelve-step]] model that had much less research support. Recent trends by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) have been to help deploy these intervention techniques.&lt;!-- Removed, sounds promotional and predictive: Several successful programs are underway.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purvis, G., and MacInnis, D.M.

In [[logic]], the '''comprehension''' of an object is the totality of [[intension]]s, that is, attributes, characters, marks, properties, or qualities, that the object possesses, or else the totality of intensions that are [[relevance|pertinent]] to the  context of a given discussion.  This is the correct technical term for the whole collection of intensions of an object, but it is common in less technical usage to see 'intension' used for both the composite and the primitive ideas.

In [[statistical process control|statistical quality control]], the '''EWMA chart''' (or '''exponentially weighted moving average chart''') is a type of [[control chart]] used to monitor either variables or attributes-type data using the monitored [[Business process|business]] or [[List of industrial processes|industrial process]]'s entire history of output.&lt;REF name="NISTEWMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc324.htm|title=EWMA Control Charts|accessdate=2009-08-10|work=[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm NIST/Sematech Engineering Statistics Handbook]|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/REF&gt;  While other control charts treat rational subgroups of samples individually, the EWMA chart tracks the [[EWMA|exponentially-weighted moving average]] of all prior sample means.  EWMA weights samples in geometrically decreasing order so that the most recent samples are weighted most highly while the most distant samples contribute very little.&lt;REF name="Montgomery2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Montgomery | first = Douglas | title = Introduction to Statistical Quality Control | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. | date = 2005 | location = [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]| url = http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | isbn = 978-0-471-65631-9 | oclc = 56729567}}&lt;/REF&gt;{{rp|406}}

Although the [[normal distribution]] is the basis of the EWMA chart, the chart is also relatively robust in the face of [[Normal distribution|non-normally distributed]] quality characteristics.&lt;REF name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|412}} There is, however, an adaptation of the chart that accounts for quality characteristics that are better modeled by the [[Poisson distribution]].&lt;REF name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|415}} The chart monitors only the process mean; monitoring the process variability requires the use of some other technique.&lt;REF name = "Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|414}}

The EWMA control chart requires a knowledgeable person to select two parameters before setup:
#The first parameter is λ, the weight given to the most recent rational subgroup mean.  λ must satisfy 0 &lt; λ ≤ 1, but selecting the "right" value is a matter of personal preference and experience.  One source recommends 0.05 ≤ λ ≤ 0.25,&lt;REF name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|411}} while another recommends 0.2 ≤ λ ≤ 0.3.&lt;REF name="NISTEWMA"/&gt;
#The second parameter is L, the multiple of the rational subgroup standard deviation that establishes the control limits.  L is typically set at 3 to match other control charts, but it may be necessary to reduce L slightly for small values of λ.&lt;REF name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|406}}

Instead of plotting rational subgroup averages directly, the EWMA chart computes successive observations z&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt; by computing the rational subgroup average, &lt;math&gt;\bar x_i&lt;/math&gt;, and then combining that new subgroup average with the running average of all preceding observations, z&lt;SUB&gt;i - 1&lt;/SUB&gt;, using the specially–chosen weight, λ, as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;z_i = \lambda \bar x_i + \left ( 1 - \lambda \right)z_{i - 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The control limits for this chart type are &lt;math&gt;T \pm L\frac {S}{\sqrt n}\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{2 - \lambda}\lbrack 1 - \left ( 1 - \lambda \right )^{2i} \rbrack}&lt;/math&gt; where T and S are the estimates of the long-term process mean and standard deviation established during control-chart setup and n is the number of samples in the rational subgroup.  Note that the limits widen for each successive rational subgroup, approaching &lt;math&gt;\pm L\frac {\hat \sigma}{\sqrt n}\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{2-\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;REF name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|407}}

The EWMA chart is sensitive to small shifts in the process mean, but does not match the ability of Shewhart-style charts (namely the [[Xbar and R chart|&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and R]] and [[Xbar and s chart|&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and s chart]]s) to detect larger shifts.&lt;REF name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|412}} One author recommends superimposing the EWMA chart on top of a suitable Shewhart-style chart with widened control limits in order to detect both small and large shifts in the process mean.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Exponentially weighted moving variance (EWMVar) can be used to obtain a significance score or limits that automatically adjust to the observed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/2623330.2623740| title = SigniTrend: scalable detection of emerging topics in textual streams by hashed significance thresholds| conference = Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining - KDD '14| pages = 871–880| year = 2014| last1 = Schubert | first1 = E. | last2 = Weiler | first2 = M. | last3 = Kriegel | first3 = H.

The '''European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages''' ('''ECRML''') is a European [[treaty]] (CETS 148) adopted in 1992  under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]] to protect and promote historical [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language]]s in [[Europe]]. The preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe|Congress of Local and Regional Authorities]], the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential. The actual charter was written in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] based on the Congress' Recommendations. It only applies to [[language]]s traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties (thus excluding languages used by recent [[immigrant]]s from other states, see [[immigrant language]]s), which significantly differ from the majority or [[official language]] (thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language) and that either have a territorial basis (and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole (thereby including such languages as [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Lemko language| Lemko]], which are used over a wide geographic area).

Some states, such as Ukraine and Sweden, have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities, which are defined by ethnic, cultural and/or religious criteria, thereby circumventing the Charter's notion of linguistic minority.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Languages that are official within regions, provinces or federal units within a State (for example [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in [[Spain]]) are not classified as official languages of the State and may therefore benefit from the Charter. On the other hand, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has not been able to sign the Charter on behalf of the [[Irish language]] (although a minority language) as it is defined as the first official language of the state. The [[United Kingdom]] has ratified the Charter in respect to (among other languages) [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Wales]], [[Scots language|Scots]] in Scotland, and [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|Irish]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. [[France]], although a signatory, has been constitutionally blocked from ratifying the Charter in respect to the [[languages of France]].

The charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages. There are two levels of protection&amp;mdash;all signatories must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages. Signatories may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection, which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35.

==Protections==
Countries can ratify the charter in respect of its minority languages based on Part II or Part III of the charter, which contain varying principles. Countries can treat languages differently under the charter, for example, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Welsh language]] is ratified under the general Part II principles as well as the more specific Part III commitments, while the [[Cornish language]] is ratified only under Part II.

===Part II===
Part II of the Charter details eight main principles and objectives upon which States must base their policies and legislation. They are seen as a framework for the preservation of the languages concerned.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/aboutcharter/default_en.asp|title=The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is the European convention for the protection and promotion of languages used by traditional minorities.|website=European Charter for Regional &lt;br&gt;or Minority Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recognition of regional or minority languages as an expression of cultural wealth.
*Respect for the geographical area of each regional or minority language.
*The need for resolute action to promote such languages.
*The facilitation and/or encouragement of the use of such languages, in speech and writing, in public and private life.
*The provision of appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of such languages at all appropriate stages.
*The promotion of relevant transnational exchanges.
*The prohibition of all forms of unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference relating to the use of a regional or minority language and intended to discourage or endanger its maintenance or development.
*The promotion by states of mutual understanding between all the country’s linguistic groups.

===Part III===
Part III details comprehensive rules across a number of sectors, that states agree to abide by. Each language to which Part III of the Charter is applied must be specifically named by the government. States must select at least thirty-five of the undertakings in respect of each language. Many provisions contain several options, of varying degrees of stringency, one of which has to be chosen “according to the situation of each language”.  The areas from which these specific undertakings must be chosen are as follows:&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;
*Education
*Judicial authorities
*Administrative authorities and public services
*Media
*Cultural activities and facilities
*Economic and social life
*Transfrontier exchanges

==Languages protected under the Charter==

Zillmann, D. (1998). Connections between sexuality and aggression (Second ed.). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;(cf. Zillmann, 1983, 1996, 1998). For example, when watching a movie, a viewer may be angered by seeing the hero wronged by the villain, but this initial excitation may intensify the viewer's pleasure in witnessing the villain's punishment later. Thus, although the excitation from the original stimulus of seeing the hero wronged was cognitively accessed as anger, the excitation after the second stimulus of seeing the villain punished is [[cognition|cognitively]] assessed as pleasure, though part of the excitation from the second stimulus is residual from the first.  
&lt;br /&gt;However, the excitation-transfer process requires the presence of three conditions. One: the second stimulus occurs before the complete decay of residual excitation from the first stimulus &lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, P. H., &amp; Zillmann, D. (1975).

New York: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g., Tannenbaum &amp; Zillmann, 1975). Two: there is the [[misattribution of arousal|misattribution]] of excitation, that is, after exposure to the second stimulus, the individual experiencing the excitation attributes full excitation to the second stimulus &lt;ref&gt;Cantor, J.

==The Origins of Excitation-Transfer Theory==

&lt;br /&gt;Dolf Zillmann began developing excitation-transfer theory in the late 1960s/ early 1970s, and through the start of the 21st century, Zillmann continued to refine it&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; (Bryant &amp; Miron, 2003). Excitation-transfer theory is based largely on [[Clark Hull|Clark Hull's]] notion of residual excitation (i.e., [[drive theory]]) and Stanley Schachter's [[two factor theory of emotion]]. As Bryant and Miron (2003) stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zillmann collapsed and connected Hull's drive theory and Schachter's two-factor theory, which posited an excitatory and a cognitive component of emotional states. In contrast to Hull's hypothesis that excitatory reactions "lose" their specificity under new stimulation, Schachter claimed that emotional [[arousal]] is nonspecific, and the individual cognitively assess the emotion he is experiencing for the purpose of behavioral guidance and adjustment. Zillmann adopted and modified Schacter's view on this.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(p. 35)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In other words, excitation-transfer theory is based on the assumption that excitation responses are, for the most part, ambiguous and are differentiated only by what emotions the brain assigns to them. As Zillmann (2006) stated, "Residual excitation from essentially any excited emotional reaction is capable of intensifying any other excited emotional reaction. The degree of intensification depends, of course, on the magnitude of residues prevailing at the time" &lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (2006). Dramaturgy for emotions from fictional narration. In J. Bryant &amp; P. Vorderer (Eds.), Psychology of entertainment (pp. 215-&lt;br /&gt;238). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;223). Hence, excitation transfer theory helps to explain the fickleness of emotional arousal (i.e., how it is possible for fear to be transferred into relief, anger into delight, etc.), and how the reaction to one stimulus can intensify the reaction to another. 
&lt;br /&gt;Although excitation-transfer theory was based heavily on [[psychology]], [[psychophysiology]], and [[biochemistry]], it has been often applied to [[media influence|effects studies]] in the field of [[communication]] &lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(Bryant &amp; Miron, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;31).  As Bryant and Miron explained, "Growing concern about the increasingly [[media violence research|violent media content]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s spurred debate over the possible effects of such content on the real-life behavior of media consumers" &lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;32). Eventually, excitation-transfer theory became one of the dominant theoretical underpinnings for predicting, [[Experiment|testing]], and explaining the effects of such [[mass media|media]] (e.g., violent movies/ television shows, pornography, music etc.). Zillmann (1971) stated that "Communication-produced excitation may serve to intensify or 'energize' post-exposure emotional states"&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (1971). Excitation transfer in communication-mediated aggressive behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 7, 419-434. &lt;br /&gt; {{doi|10.1016/0022-1031(71)90075-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;431). However, excitation transfer is not limited to face-to-face [[communication stimuli]], but can occur from an array of stimuli, including [[mediated messages]]. Tannenbaum and Zillmann (1975) argued: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most people probably do not consider arousal from media exposure to be pronounced enough to warrant any attention, and hence they do not expect it to affect their behavior. Dismissing such arousals as trivial, the individual will tend to attribute any accumulating residues not to the preceding communication events [which are, in this instance, mediated messages] but to the new stimulus situations in which he finds himself. Moreover, by virtue of their very "unreal" and symbolic (possibly-fantasy encouraging) content, communication messages are generally not related to the person's real and immediate problems and concerns. This should further encourage misattribution of accruing arousal and hence make the person all the more vulnerable to transfer effects in his postcommunication behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, P. H., &amp; Zillmann, D. (1975). Emotional arousal in the facilitation of aggression through communication. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), &lt;br /&gt;Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 8, pp 149-192). New York: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; (p. 187)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In short, stimuli, whether they be in real-life, on a television or movie screen, or a combination of the two, can elicit excitation-transfers. Today, excitation-transfer theory remains a key component of the [[theoretical framework]] of studies focusing on communication and emotion.

An '''explanation''' is a set of [[Statement (logic)|statements]] usually constructed to [[description|describe]] a set of facts which clarifies the [[causality|cause]]s, [[wiktionary:context|context]], and [[Logical consequence|consequences]] of those facts. This description of the facts et cetera may establish [[rule of inference|rule]]s or [[axiom|law]]s, and may clarify the existing rules or laws in relation to any objects, or phenomena examined.  The components of an explanation can be [[wikt:implicit|implicit]], and interwoven with one another.

An explanation is often underpinned by an [[understanding]] or norm that can be represented by different media such as music, text, and graphics. Thus, an explanation is subjected to [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], and discussion.

In [[scientific research]], explanation is one of several purposes for empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Babbie, Earl (2007) ''The Practice of Social Research.'' (11th edition) Belmont, CA: Thompson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Remler, D.K. and Van Ryzin, G (2011). ''Research Methods in Practice.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Explanation is a way to uncover new knowledge, and to report relationships among different aspects of studied [[phenomena]]. Explanation attempts to answer the "why"  and "how" questions. Explanations have varied [[explanatory power]]. The formal [[hypothesis]] is the theoretical tool used to verify explanation in empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Patricia M.|last1=Shields|authorlink1=Patricia M.

Shields, Hassan Tajalli (2006). "Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship". ''Journal of Public Affairs Education'' 12 (3): 313–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments ==
{{Main|Argument}}

While arguments attempt to show that something is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try to show ''why'' or ''how'' something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of ''whether'' or not Fred's cat has fleas, Joe may state: "Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe the cat is scratching right now." Joe has made an ''argument that'' the cat has fleas. However, if Fred and Joe agree on the fact that the cat has fleas, they may further question ''why'' this is so and put forth an ''explanation'': "The reason the cat has fleas is that the weather has been damp." The difference is that the attempt is not to settle whether or not some [[claim (logic)|claim]] is true, but to show ''why'' it is true.

In this sense, arguments aim to contribute ''knowledge'', whereas explanations aim to contribute ''understanding''.

Arguments and explanations largely resemble each other in [[rhetoric]]al use. This is the cause of much difficulty in [[critical thinking|thinking critically]] about [[proposition|claims]]. There are several reasons for this difficulty.

* People often are not themselves clear on whether they are arguing for or explaining something.
* The same types of words and phrases are used in presenting explanations and arguments.
* The terms 'explain' or 'explanation,' et cetera are frequently used in arguments.
* Explanations are often used within arguments and presented so as to serve ''as arguments''.

== Justification ==
{{Main|Theory of justification}}

Justification is the reason why someone properly holds a [[belief]], the explanation as to why the belief is a true one, or an account of how one knows what one knows. In much the same way arguments and explanations may be confused with each other, so too may explanations and justifications. Statements which are justifications of some action take the form of arguments. For example, attempts to justify a theft usually explain the motives (e.g., to feed a starving family).

It is important to be aware when an explanation is ''not'' a justification. A criminal profiler may offer an explanation of a suspect's behavior (e.g.; the person lost their job, the person got evicted, etc.). Such statements may help us understand why the person committed the crime, however an uncritical listener may believe the speaker is trying to gain sympathy for the person and his or her actions. It does not follow that a person proposing an explanation has any sympathy for the views or actions being explained. This is an important distinction because we need to be able to understand and explain terrible events and behavior in attempting to discourage or prevent them.

== Types ==
There are many and varied events, objects, and facts which require explanation. So too, there are many different types of explanation. [[Aristotle]] recognized at least [[Four causes|four types]] of explanation. Other types of explanation are [[Deductive-nomological model|Deductive-nomological]], Functional, Historical, Psychological, Reductive, Teleological, Methodological explanations.

== Meta-explanation ==
The notion of meta-explanation is important in behavioral scenarios that involve conflicting agents. In these scenarios, implicit or explicit conflict can be caused by contradictory agents' interests, as communicated in their explanations for why they behaved in a particular way, by a lack of knowledge of the situation, or by a mixture of explanations of multiple factors. In many cases to assess the plausibility of explanations, one must analyze two following components and their interrelations: (1) explanation at the actual object level (explanation itself) and (2) explanation at the higher level (meta-explanation). Comparative analysis of the roles of both is conducted to assess the plausibility of how agents explain the scenarios of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Galitsky, Boris, de la Rosa, Josep-Lluis  and Kovalerchuk, Boris ''Assessing plausibility of explanation and meta-explanation in inter-human conflict'' [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2047062 Engineering Application of AI] V 24 Issue 8, pp 1472-1486, (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Object-level explanation assesses the plausibility of individual claims by using a traditional approach to handle argumentative structure of a dialog. Meta-explanation links the structure of a current scenario with that of previously learned scenarios of multi-agent interaction. The scenario structure includes agents' communicative actions and argumentation defeat relations between the subjects of these actions. The data for both object-level and meta-explanation can be visually specified, and a plausibility of how agent behavior in a scenario can be visually explained. Meta-explanation in the form of machine learning of scenario structure can be augmented by conventional explanation by finding arguments in the form of defeasibility analysis of individual claims, to increase the accuracy of plausibility assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Galitsky, B.,  Kuznetsov SO ''Learning communicative actions of conflicting human agents'' [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1451477 J. Exp. Theor. Artif. Intell.] 20(4): 277-317 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A ratio between object-level and meta-explanation can be defined as the relative accuracy of plausibility assessment based on the former and latter sources. The groups of scenarios can then be clustered based on this ratio; hence, such a ratio is an important parameter of human behavior associated with explaining something to other humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">{{for|a broader discussion of faux pas in China|etiquette in Asia}}
The following faux pas are derived from [[homonym]]s in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] and [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]].  While originating in   [[Greater China]], they may also apply to [[Chinese language|Chinese-speaking]] people around the world. However, most homonymic pairs listed work only in some varieties of Chinese (for example, Mandarin only or Cantonese only), and may appear bewildering even to speakers of other varieties of Chinese.

Certain customs regarding good and bad [[luck]] are important to many [[Chinese people]].  Although these might be regarded as  [[superstition]]s by people from other cultures, these customs are often tied to [[religion|religious traditions]] and are an important part of many people's [[World view|belief systems]], even among well-educated people and affluent sectors of society.

==Clocks==
[[Clock#Purposes|Giving a clock]] (送鐘/送钟, sòng zhōng) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act is a homophone with the term for the act of attending another's funeral (送終/送终, sòngzhōng).&lt;ref name="Brown(2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 别人过节喜庆的时候，不送钟表。送终和送钟谐音。&lt;/ref&gt; A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|website=[[BBC]]|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cantonese people]] consider such a gift as a curse.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Kurth Clot deBroissia [http://www.netique.com/giftsearch/international.html#anchor317728 ''International Gift Giving Protocol'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called "''zhong''", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.

However, should such a gift be given, the "unluckiness" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'送'}} ("give") expression of the phrase.

==Fans and umbrellas==
It is undesirable to give someone a [[Fan (implement)|fan]] or an [[umbrella]] as a gift. The words fan "shàn" ({{lang|zh|扇}}) and umbrella "sǎn" ({{zh|t=傘|s=伞}}) sound like the word "sǎn/sàn" ({{lang|zh|散}}), meaning to scatter, or to part company, to separate, to break up with someone, to split.&lt;ref name="gifts_in_chinese_culture.htm"&gt;Wong Yee Lee [http://www.chinatownconnection.com/gifts_in_chinese_culture.htm Gifts in Chinese Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

These homonymic pairs work in Mandarin and Cantonese, though Cantonese has a more idiomatic term for umbrellas ("ze1" in Cantonese, {{lang|zh|遮}}) to avoid precisely this association.

==Books==
As a book ({{zh|t=書|s=书|p=shū}}) is a Mandarin homophone of "loss, to lose" ({{zh|t=輸|s=输|p=shū}}), carrying or looking at a book ({{zh|t=帶書, 看書|s=带书, 看书|p=dài shū, kàn shū}}) where  people are taking a risk, such as gambling or investing in stocks, may be considered to invite bad luck and loss ({{zh|t=帶輸, 看輸|s=带输, 看输|p=dài shū, kàn shū}}). This bad luck does not apply to carrying or reading newspapers ({{zh|t=帶報, 看報|s=带报, 看报|p=dàibào, kànbào}}) as newspapers ({{zh|t=報紙|s=报纸|p=bàozhǐ}}) are not books.&lt;ref name="gifts_in_chinese_culture.htm"/&gt;

This homonymic pair works in Mandarin.

==Pears==
Sharing a pear with friends or loved ones can be a mistake. "Sharing a pear" ({{lang|zh|分梨}}) is a homophone of "to separate, to part, to leave" ({{zh|t=分離|s=分离}}), both pronounced "fēnlí" in Mandarin. Sharing with distant friends is okay.

This homonymic pair works in Mandarin.

==Shoes==
It is also thought to be bad luck to give [[shoes]] as a gift. "Shoes" ({{lang|zh|鞋}} xié) in Mandarin is a homophone of "evil" ({{lang|zh|邪}} xié).&lt;ref name="giving-gifts-to-chinese-what-to-give-and-what-to-avoid"&gt;Gift Canyon [http://giftcanyon.com/giving-gifts-to-chinese-what-to-give-and-what-to-avoid/  Chinese Gifts to Give and Avoid]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Chinese people believe that gifting shoes equips a person to "walk away" from a relationship.

This homonymic pair works in Mandarin only and, other than part of northern China, there is no such superstition in any other part of China.

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Generalization, corollaries, usage ==
There are many [[corollary|corollaries]] to Godwin's law, some considered more [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] (by being adopted by Godwin himself)&lt;ref name="Godwin95canonical version" /&gt; than others.&lt;ref name="GL FAQ" /&gt; For example, there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that, when a Hitler comparison is made, the thread is finished and whoever made the comparison loses whatever [[debate]] is in progress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6408927/Internet-rules-and-laws-the-top-10-from-Godwin-to-Poe.html "Internet rules and laws: the top 10, from Godwin to Poe"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is itself frequently referred to as Godwin's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=North Korea|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tMQs-5SD8|access-date=7 November 2017|series=Last Week Tonight|network=HBO|date=13 August 2017|transcript="There honestly aren't that many instances in modern American politics where you can honestly think: that guy really should have mentioned the nazis, but this is emphatically one of them. It's like the reversed Godwin's law - if you fail to mention Nazism, you lose the argument."|language=English|last=Oliver|first=John (host)}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law itself can be abused as a distraction, diversion or even as [[censorship]], fallaciously miscasting an opponent's argument as [[hyperbole]] when the comparisons made by the argument are actually appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;David Weigel, [http://www.reason.com/news/show/32944.html "Hands Off Hitler! It's time to repeal Godwin's Law"] ''Reason'' magazine, July 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://no-pasaran.blogspot.com/2012/05/adolf-hitler-and-double-standards.html Mitt Hitler and Double Standards: Godwin's Law Applies to Thee, But Not to Me], [[No Pasarán]], May 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticisms of the "law" (or "at least the distorted version which purports to prohibit all comparisons to German crimes") have been made by the American  lawyer, journalist, and author [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]] (July 1, 2010) [http://www.salon.com/2010/07/01/godwin/ The odiousness of the distorted Godwin's Law], [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law does not claim to articulate a [[fallacy]]; it is instead framed as a memetic tool to reduce the incidence of inappropriate hyperbolic comparisons. "Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of [[mathematics]]," Godwin wrote, "its purpose has always been [[Rhetorics|rhetorical]] and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]]: I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler to think a bit harder about [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/post/i_seem_be_verb_18_years_godwins_law|title=I Seem To Be A Verb: 18 Years of Godwin's Law|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=Jewcy.com|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mike Godwin June08 B recrop 5 to 7.jpg|thumb|Mike Godwin in 2008]]

Godwin has stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in [[memetics]].&lt;ref name="Godwin94" /&gt;

In 2012, "Godwin's law" became an entry in the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/340583?redirectedFrom=Godwin%27s+law#eid|title=Godwin's law|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Godwin commented on the Nazi and fascist comparisons being made by several articles about [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], saying: "If you're thoughtful about it and show some real awareness of history, go ahead and refer to Hitler when you talk about Trump, or any other politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godwin|first1=Mike|title=Sure, call Trump a Nazi.

In October 2018, Godwin made a similar statement when someone asked him, via [[Twitter]], if it would be OK to call Brazilian presidential candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] a "nazi", answering a direct question ("So, just to be clear, is it OK to call Bolsonaro a nazi?") with the [[Portuguese language|portuguese]] word "Sim!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/criador-da-lei-de-godwin-diz-que-e-ok-chamar-bolsonaro-de-nazista.shtml|title=Criador da Lei de Godwin diz que é ok chamar Bolsonaro de nazista|date=2018-10-17|work=Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2018-11-11|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/sfmnemonic/status/1052371927552135168|title=Mike Godwin #EleNão on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (meaning "yes" in English).

'''Hip hip hooray''' (also '''hippity hip hooray'''; ''Hooray'' may also be spelled and pronounced '''hoorah''', '''hurrah''', '''hurray''' etc.) is a [[cheering|cheer]] called out to express congratulation toward someone or something, in the [[English language|English speaking]] world and elsewhere.

By a sole speaker, it is a form of [[interjection]]. In a group, it takes the form of [[call and response]]: the cheer is initiated by one person exclaiming "Three cheers for...[someone or something]" (or, more archaically, "Three times three"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dlfPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA410 ''Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country, Volume 9'']. 1834, James Fraser.

==History==
The call was recorded in England in the beginning of the 19th century in connection with making a [[Toast (honor)|toast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/453841| issn = 0003-1283| volume = 36| issue = 2| pages = 83–92| last = Read| first = Allen Walker| title = The Rebel Yell as a Linguistic Problem| journal = American Speech| date = 1961-05-01| jstor = 453841}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteenth century dictionaries list "Hip" as an attention-getting interjection, and in an example from 1790 it is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Times (London)| date= 1790-11-27| page = 2}} 'Sir Charles engag'd one day at dice / Hip! hip! come hither John, he cries;'&lt;/ref&gt;"Hip-hip" was added as a preparatory call before making a toast or cheer in the early 19th century, probably after 1806.  By 1813, it had reached its modern form, hip-hip-hurrah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Peter Jensen|title=Three Cheers, Hip-Hip-Hurrah and Tom and Jerry|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/05/three-cheers-hip-hip-hurrah-and-tom-and.html|work=Early Sports 'n Pop-Culture Blog|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the word "hip" stems from a [[medieval]] [[Latin]] [[acronym]], "''H''ierosolyma ''E''st ''P''erdita", meaning "Jerusalem is lost",&lt;ref&gt;Gabay's Copywriter's Compendium, Jonathan Gaby, pub. (Elsevier) 2006, {{ISBN|0-7506-8320-1}}, p.669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Ebenezer Cobham|title=Dictionary of phrase and fable|year=1898|publisher=[[Henry Altemus Company]]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1-58734-094-1|url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/8296.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term that gained notoriety in the German [[Hep hep riots]] of August to October 1819.   Cornell's Michael Fontaine disputes this etymology, tracing it to a single letter in an English newspaper published August 28, 1819, some weeks after the riots.  He concludes that the "acrostic interpretation ... has no basis in fact.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fontaine|first=Michael|title=On the Acronym Origin of the English Phrase Hep! Hep!|url=https://www.academia.edu/9305194/On_the_Acronym_Origin_of_the_English_Phrase_Hep_Hep_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritchie Robertson also disputes the "false etymology" of the acronym interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ritchie|last=Robertson|title=The 'Jewish Question' in German Literature, 1749-1939 : Emancipation and its Discontents|year=1999|isbn= 9780191584312}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing Katz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacob|last=Katz|title=Die Hep-Hep-Verfolgungen des Jahres 1819|year=1994|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory about the origin of "hurrah" is that the Europeans picked up the Mongol exclamation "hooray" as an enthusiastic cry of bravado and mutual encouragement. See [[Jack Weatherford|Jack Weatherford's]] book ''[[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Joseph W. (November 21, 2005 ).

'''Historical dynamics''' broadly includes the scientific modeling of history.  This might also be termed computer modeling of history, historical simulation, or simulation of history - allowing for an extensive range of techniques in simulation and estimation.  Historical dynamics does not exist as a separate science, but there are individual efforts such as [[long range planning]], [[population modeling]], [[economic forecasting]], [[demographics]], [[global modeling]], [[country modeling]], [[regional planning]], [[urban planning]] and many others in the general categories of [[computer modeling]], [[planning]], [[forecasting]], and [[simulations]].

Some examples of "large" history where historical dynamics simulations would be helpful include; [[global history]], large structures, [[:category:histories of empires|histories of empires]], long duration history, [[philosophy of history]], [[Eurasian history]], [[comparative history]], long-range [[environmental history]], [[world systems theory]], non-Western political and economic development, and [[historical demography]].
 
==Information sources for simulations==
With the rise of technologies like wikis, and internet-wide search engines, some historical and social data can be mined to constrain models of history and society.  Data from social media sites, and busy sites, can be mined for human patterns of action.  These can provide more and more realistic behavioral models for individuals and groups of any size.  [[Agent-based model]]s and [[microsimulation]]s of [[human behavior]] can be embedded in larger historical simulations.  Related subfields are [[behavioral economics]] and [[human behavioral ecology]].

* [[Crowd computing]] has been applied to [[crowd computing#History|history]], and offers another tool for historical verification and validation.

==Sectoral databases==
In every sector of human activity, there are extensive databases for [[North american transportation statistics interchange|transportation data]], [[urban development]], [[health statistics]], [[education data]], [[social data]], [[economic data]]—along with many projections.  See [[:Category:economic databases]], [[:Category:statistical data sets]], [[:Category:social statistics data]], [[:Category:social statistics]] and [[:Category:statistics]].

Some examples of database activity include [[Asian Development Bank]] statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/data/statistics |title=Asian Development Bank - Statistics |publisher=Adb.org |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]] data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/ |title=World Bank - Data |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Monetary Fund]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/data.htm |title=International Monetary Fund - Data |publisher=Imf.org |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time series analysis]] and [[econometrics]] are well established fields for the analysis of trends and [[forecasting]]; but, survey data and microdatasets can also be used in forecasts and simulations.
&lt;!-- This section can be expanded considerably. Many relevant datasets --&gt;

==Global, country, and sectoral models in international development==

The United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ |title=United Nations Population Division, Economic and Social Affairs |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations routinely project the population of individual countries and regions of the world decades into the future.  These demographic models are used by other organizations for projecting demand for services in all sectors of each economy.

Each country often has their corresponding modeling groups for each of these major sectors.  These can be grouped in separate articles according to sector.  Groups include government departments, [[List of development aid agencies|international aid agencies]], as well as nonprofit and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

A broad class of models used for economic and social modeling of countries and sectors are the [[Computable general equilibrium]] (CGE) model - also called [[applied general equilibrium]] models.  In the context of time based simulations and policy analysis, see [[dynamic stochastic general equilibrium]] models.

==Linked economic, social, and climate models==
Partly because of the controversy over [[global climate change]], there is an extensive network of global climate models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WMO Webteam |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_models.php |title=World Meteorological Organization models |publisher=Wmo.int |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/projects/gcm/ |title=NASA global climate models |publisher=Giss.nasa.gov |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related social and economic models.  These seek to estimate, not only the change in climate and its physical effects, but also the impact on human society and the natural environment.  See [[global economic models]], [[social model]], [[microsimulation]], [[climate model]], [[global climate models]], and [[general circulation model]].

The relationship between the environment and society is examined through [[environmental social science]].  [[human ecology]], [[political ecology]], and [[ecology]], in general, can be areas where computer and mathematical modeling over time can be relevant to historical simulation.

==Historical simulations==
Web-based historical simulations, [[simulations of history]], interactive historical simulations, are increasingly popular for entertainment and educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialstudiescentral.com/?q=content/online-interactive-simulations |title=Social Studies Central, Interactive History Simulations |publisher=Socialstudiescentral.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field is expanding rapidly and no central index seems to be available.  Another example is &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wadsworth.cengage.com/history_d/special_features/ext/hist_sims/ |title=History Simulations |publisher=Wadsworth.cengage.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several computer games allow players to interact with the game to model societies over time. The [[Civilization (series)]] is one example.  Others include [[Age of Empires]], [[Rise of Nations]], [[Spore]], [[Colonization]], [[Alpha Centauri]], [[Call to Power]], and [[CivCity: Rome]].  A longer list of games in historical context, which might include degrees of simulation, are found at [[:Category:Video games with historical settings]].

[[Military simulation]] is a well-developed field and increasingly accessible on the internet.

==Simulating society==
Computer models for simulating society fall under [[artificial society]], [[social simulation]], [[computational sociology]], [[computational social science]], and [[mathematical sociology]].  There is an interdisciplinary [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] for computer simulation of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/ |title=Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation |publisher=Jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Social Simulation Association]] promotes social simulation research in Europe; it is the publisher of JASSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essa.eu.org/ European Social Simulation Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a corresponding [[Computational Social Science Society of the Americas]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computationalsocialscience.org/ |title=Computational Social Science Society of the Americas |publisher=Computationalsocialscience.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/ |title=Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PAAA lists some related Japanese associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/related-associations/ |title=Related social simulation associations |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SimSoc ([[Simulated Society]] tool) is in its fifth edition.

==Cities==
There has been extensive research in [[urban planning]], [[environmental planning]] and related fields: [[regional planning]], [[land-use planning]], [[transportation planning]], [[urban studies]], and [[regional science]].  Journals for these fields are listed at [[List of planning journals]].

[[SimCity]] is a game for simulations of artificial cities.  It has spawned a range of "sim" games.  The planning groups try to simulate changes in real cities.  The game groups allow experiments with artificial cities.  And the two are merging in such efforts as Vizicities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2013/09/simcity-with-real-data-modeling-real-cities-in-3d-in-a-web-environment.html |title=SimCity with real data: modeling real cities in 3D in a Web environment |publisher=Geospatial.blogs.com |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
The profiling of industries is well developed, and most industries make forecasts and plans.  See [[industrial history]], [[history of steel]], [[history of mining]], [[history of construction]], [[history of the petroleum industry]], and many other histories of specific industries.  See [[cyclical industrial dynamics]] for modeling of industries in the sense of "historical dynamics of industries".  Some related terms are [[industrial planning]], [[history of industry]], [[industrial evolution]], [[technology change]], and [[technology forecasting]]. An example of "history friendly" industrial models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=F Malerba a |author2=R Nelson b |author3=L Orsenigo |author4=S Winter d |url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/3.abstract |title='History-friendly' models of industry evolution: the computer industry |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the journal, Industrial and Corporate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/ |title=Journal: Industrial and Corporate Change |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economy-wide models must take into account the interactions between industry and the rest of the economy.  See [[Input–output model]], [[economic planning]], and [[social accounting matrix]] for some relevant techniques.

==Futures==
Many of the techniques from [[futures studies]] are applicable to historical dynamics.  Whether projecting forward from a point in the past to the present for validation studies, or projecting backwards from the present into the past - many of the techniques are useful.  Likewise, simulations of the past, or alternative pasts, provide a groundwork of techniques for futures studies.

'''Homesteading''' is a lifestyle of [[self-sufficiency]]. It is characterized by [[subsistence agriculture]], home preservation of food, and may also involve the small scale production of textiles, clothing, and craftwork for household use or sale. Pursued in different ways around the world—and in different historical eras—homesteading is generally differentiated from rural village or [[commune]] living by isolation (either socially or physically) of the homestead.  Use of the term in the [[United States]] dates back to the [[Homestead Act]] (1862) and before. In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], particularly in nations formerly controlled by the [[British Empire]], a homestead is the household compound for a single extended family. In the UK, the term '[[Smallholding|smallholder]]' or '[[Crofters|crofts]]' is the rough equivalent of 'homesteader'.

Modern homesteaders often use [[renewable energy]] options including [[Solar power|solar electricity]] and [[wind power]]. Many also choose to plant and grow [[Heirloom plant|heirloom vegetables]] and to raise heritage livestock. Homesteading is not defined by where someone lives, such as the city or the country, but by the lifestyle choices they make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niemann|first1=Deborah|title=Homegrown and Handmade: A Practical Guide to More Self-Reliant Living|date=2011|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=978-0-86571-702-2|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As historical governmental policy==

{{further|Homestead Acts|Dominion Lands Act}}
Historically, homesteading has been used by governmental entities (engaged in national expansion) to help populate and make habitable what were previously little-desired areas; especially in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Guided by legal ''[[homestead principle]]s'', many of these "homestead acts" were instituted in the 19th and 20th centuries in order to drive the populating of specific, national areas; with most being discontinued after a set time-frame or goal were achieved.

Renewed interest in homesteading was brought about by U.S. President  [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s program of [[Subsistence Homesteads Division|Subsistence Homesteading]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a social movement==

The attractiveness of [[back-to-the-land]] movements dates from the Roman era, and has been noted in Asian poetry and philosophy tracts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/1340/article/69/vital.cities.an.interview.with.jane.jacobs|title=Vital Cities: an interview with Jane Jacobs - Tools Ideas Environment - Whole Earth Catalog|website=www.wholeearth.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of modern homesteading proponents, such as [[Ralph Borsodi]], gained in popularity in the 1960s in the United States. Self-sufficiency movements in the 1990s and 2000s began to apply the concept to urban and suburban settings, known as [[urban homesteading]]. According to author [[John Seymour (author)|John Seymour]], "urban homesteading" incorporates small-scale, [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[homemaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Why_homestead__63__/|title=Why homestead?|last=Anna|website=www.waldeneffect.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As economic choice==

In homesteading, social and government support systems are frequently eschewed in favor of [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]] and relative deprivation, in order to maximize independence and self-determination. The degree of independence occurs along a spectrum, with many homesteaders creating foodstuffs or crafts to appeal to high-end niche markets in order to meet financial needs. Other homesteaders come to the lifestyle following successful careers which provide the funding for land, [[housing]], [[taxes]], and specialized equipment such as [[Solar panel|solar panels]], [[Agricultural machinery|farm equipment]] and [[Electric generator|electricity generators]].

Modern government regulation—in the form of building codes, food safety codes, zoning regulations, minimum wage and social security for occasional labor, and town council restrictions on landscaping and animal keeping— can increase the marginal cost of home production of food in areas affected by these restrictions. Careful choice of homesteading location is essential for economic success.

Actual financial savings from adopting a homesteading lifestyle can be significant if planned and executed properly. Many homesteaders express deep satisfaction with their standard of living and feel that their lifestyle is healthier and more rewarding than more conventional patterns of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theelliotthomestead.com/2014/01/great-benefits-of-homesteading/|title=Great Benefits of Homesteading. - The Elliott Homestead|work=The Elliott Homestead|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.offthegridnews.com/how-to-2/3-priceless-benefits-of-modern-homesteading/|title=3 Priceless Benefits Of Modern Homesteading  {{!}} Off The Grid News|website=www.offthegridnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human shields''' may be civilians used against their will to deter attacks on military targets during an international armed conflict or they may be civilians who voluntarily protect either military or civilian targets from attack. The use of human shields is forbidden by ''[[Protocol I]]'' of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It is also a [[specific intent]] [[war crime]] as codified in the ''[[Rome Statute]]'', which was adopted in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(ICC), art.8(20)(f) July 17, 1998, 2187 U.N.T.S. 3; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the ''Rome Statute'' prohibits "utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas, or military forces immune from military operations."&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the law of armed conflict only applied to sovereign states. Non-international conflicts were governed by the domestic law of the State concerned. Under the current terms of the ''Rome Statute'' the use of human shields is defined as a war crime only in the context of an international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of World War II, non-international armed conflicts have become more commonplace. The ''Customary International Humanitarian Law'' guide suggests that rules prohibiting use of civilians as human shields are "arguably" customary in non-international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Henckaerts |first=Jean-Marie | last2=Doswald-Beck | first2=Louise |title=Customary International Humanitarian Law |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf |date=2005}};[hereinafter CIHL]&lt;/ref&gt;  The development and application of humanitarian law to modern asymmetric warfare is currently being debated by legal scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website| last=Marauhn |first=Thilo |title=Armed Conflict, Non-International |publisher=MPEPIL |url=http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e243?result=1&amp;rskey=gZ7eSJ&amp;prd=OPIL |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Human shield}}
The laws of war first began to develop the [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] between military and civilian targets at The Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, the concept of total war permitted most actions that supported the war effort. In "total war" targeting civilians was allowed, if it would support a military objective to demoralize the enemy. Indiscriminate bombing was considered an acceptable method to achieve the military advantage of defeating enemy morale and eroding popular support for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.,''{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand.

World War II was also fought within the framework of the total war concept.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,''{{Smallcaps|Horst Boog, Et al.,7 Germany and the Second World War 10 (2006).}}(quoting the Casablanca Directive, which described Allied strategy as "the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened")&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geneva Conventions of 1949 were the first significant protections for civilians in war. These protections were expanded by the Additional Protocols in 1977. Protocol I requires that attacks be limited to military objectives, which are defined as targets that make an "effective contribution to military action" where the destruction of the target provides a "definite military advantage" to the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Protocol I, art. 52(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Military necessity can justify the use of force in certain circumstances, where there is a military advantage to be gained by an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the use of force is excessive relative to its anticipated military advantage it is said to be disproportionate. Disproportionate force is prohibited under international law.

Risk to civilians does not bar military action, but the principle of proportionality requires that precautions be taken to minimize the harm to these protected persons. This analysis includes considerations like whether circumstances permit the attacker to time a military action to minimize the presence of civilians at the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Bartels |first=Rogier |title=Dealing with the Principle of Proportionality in Armed Conflict in Retrospect: The Application of the Principle in International Criminal Trials |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/israel46&amp;start_page=271&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=275 |year= |volume=46 |journal=Israel Law Review |page=271}}, at 303&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Rome Statute using protected persons as shields in an international armed conflict is a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently debate amongst legal scholars about whether traditional proportionality analysis should be modified to take into account the culpability of actors who use human shields to gain a strategic advantage. In modern asymmetric warfare it has become difficult to distinguish between military targets and civilians, but State actors still rely on traditional principles that present challenges when applied to asymmetric conflicts. Non-state forces, like guerillas and terrorists, conceal themselves among civilian populations and may take advantage of this position to launch attacks. When military action targeting these unconventional combatants results in civilian deaths, State actors may blame the deaths on enemy forces who use human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proportionate proportionality analysis ===

Some scholars, including Ammon Rubinstein and Yaniv Roznai, argue that the use of human shields should be a factor in determining whether the use of force was justifiable under the guiding principles of [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. In their view, the use of human shields undermines an attackers right to self defense because the military necessity of self-defense must be a consideration in the excessive force analysis. Rubinstein and Roznai have described this analysis as a "proportionate proportionality."&lt;ref&gt;''See''{{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan.

Rubinstein and Roznai argue that an attack that would be disproportionate ought to be considered proportionate, if the presence of civilians is due to the wrongful actions of the enemy.  They use the term "impeded party" to describe the burden placed on the attacking party under International Humanitarian Law norms. They point out that "attacking party" has traditionally been synonymous with the aggressor, but that it is often the attacker who is "defending democracy" and acting in self-defense when they use force in response to a prior attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan.

Douglas Fischer believes that the increase of civilian casualties that began with the Vietnam War is partially due to an increased use of "illegal and perfidious" tactics in modern warfare, including the use of civilians as human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Fischer |first=Douglas H. |title=Human Shields,a Homicides, and House Fires: How a Domestic Law Analogy Can Guide International Law Regarding Human Shield Tactics in Armed Conflict |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aulr57&amp;start_page=479&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=492 |year=2007 |volume=57 |journal=Am.

=== Voluntary and involuntary ===
Combatants in an armed conflict are prohibited from using protected civilians as involuntary human shields to support an unjust war effort. Civilians who are used as involuntary human shields by unlawful combatants do not lose their basic rights.&lt;ref name=OHEW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Haque |first=Adil Ahmed |editor-last=Lazar |editor-first=Seth  |encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Ethics and War |title=Human Shields |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-994341-8|}}; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of involuntary human shields does not release the other party from legal obligations to not target civilians or inflict excessive collateral damage.

Voluntary human shields may be considered "direct participants in hostilities," if they shield targeted personnel or properties. This could also be considered treason. However, if they are shielding protected personnel or properties, they may still retain their protected status. This debated area of customary international law has not yet been codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-122&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and the European Union are considered the main sources for voluntary human shields. In 2003, human rights activists travelled to Baghdad to serve as human shields and protest the unpopular U.S. invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2003, American peace activist [[Rachel Corrie]] was killed after she was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer in [[Rafah]] while volunteering with the [[International Solidarity Movement]] as a human shield to prevent the demolition of homes in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Maalouf |first=Kristina |title=The Political Question Doctrine in the Ninth Circuit and Why it Should not have Barred the Adjudication of ''Corrie v.

Rev |page=35}}, at 36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current limitations of IHL ===
While IHL does prohibit attacks on civilians, the precautions a power must take before an attack remain ill-defined. Proportionality remains a nebulous standard that does not set a predictable standard of when a military action would be considered lawful. There is a lack of enforcement, and the increasing role of private actors and contractors on the battlefield presents new challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. law ===
During the Civil War, the United States adopted the [[Lieber Code]], recognized by many scholars as the first detailed code governing conduct in war. Dr. [[Francis Lieber]] articulated an early version of the principle of proportionality: that civilians were not to be targeted, but were also not immune in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand. J. Transnat'l L. |page=1447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of human shields is prohibited and defined as a war crime by several U.S. military manuals. It is also defined as a crime triable by military commission under the US Military Commissions Act (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |title=Customary IHL – Practice Relating to Rule 97. Human Shields |publisher=International Committee for the Red Cross |url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule97 |date= 12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern warfare tactic ==
If the belligerent attacks in areas where human shields are used, this can weaken international and domestic support by exploiting harmed civilians. For nations that are particularly sensitive to collateral damage, an enemy's use of shields may effectively deter or delay military actions.

There have been numerous documented incidents where this tactic has not been successful in deterring attacks, including the [[Amiriyah shelter bombing]] during the [[Persian Gulf War|First Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 122&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of two Western activists serving as voluntary human shields in Gaza, Véronique Dudouet wrote that human shields have become less effective, since bad media publicity no longer deters soldiers from using lethal force against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Véronique Dudouet, People Power: Unarmed Resistance and Global Solidarity 131 (2000).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plato]], one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims that many of Plato's views were [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] in origin.]]
In [[philosophy]], '''ideas''' are usually taken as [[mental representation]]al images of some [[object (philosophy)|object]]. Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met. Copyright in such a case protects the particular literary or pictorial expression chosen by the author. But it gives the copyright owner no exclusive rights concerning the idea, method or system involved. ''CIT : [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ31.pdf US Copyright Office], circular 31 reviewed: 01 ⁄ 2012 P&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In the case of copyright law, it is the work that realizes the idea that is protected (i.e. a document), and it is the act of recording that work that fixes copyright in the item itself.'' – CIT : [https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/protect/p21_protecting_ideas The UK Copyright Service], Issued: 17th May 2007, Last amended: 17th May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''(…) there is likely to be an infringement of copyright if the way the information is expressed in the copyrighted work used without the permission of the copyright owner and no exception to infringement applies to the use.

&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectual property consists of products, work or processes that you have created and which give you a competitive advantage. There are 3 subcategories : '''Industrial property''' : inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs, new varieties of plants and geographic indications of origin '''Artistic work''' protected by copyright: original literary and artistic works, music, television broadcasting, software, databases, architectural designs, advertising creations and multimedia '''Commercial strategies''' : trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements, or rapid production.'' – CIT : [https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/start-grow/intellectual-property-rights/index_en.htm Intellectual property rights], [https://europa.eu/ European Union], Updated 22/01/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17402">'''Ideomotor phenomenon''' is a [[psychological]] phenomenon wherein a subject makes motions [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]ly.

[[File:Tables tournantes 1853.jpg|thumb|An example of [[table-turning]] in 19th century France. A circle of participants press their hands against a table, and the ideomotor effect causes the table to tilt in such a way as to produce a written message, in a manner similar to a ouija board.]]

The '''ideomotor response''' (or '''ideomotor reflex'''), often abbreviated to '''IMR''', is a concept in [[hypnosis]] and psychological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shin|first1=Yun Kyoung|title=A review of contemporary ideomotor theory|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycarticles/2010-18185-001|website=PsycNET|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the terms "[[wikt:ideo|ideo]]" (idea, or [[mental representation]]) and "[[wikt:motor|motor]]" (muscular action). The phrase is most commonly used in reference to the process whereby a thought or mental image brings about a seemingly "reflexive" or automatic [[muscular]] reaction, often of minuscule degree, and potentially outside of the awareness of the subject. As in reflexive responses to pain, the body sometimes reacts reflexively with an '''ideomotor effect''' to ideas alone without the person consciously deciding to take action. The effects of [[automatic writing]], [[dowsing]], [[facilitated communication]], and [[ouija|Ouija board]]s have been attributed to the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Heap, Michael. (2002). ''Ideomotor Effect (the Ouija Board Effect)''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 127-129. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The associated term "ideo-''dynamic'' response" (or "reflex") applies to a wider domain, and extends to the description of all bodily reactions (including ideo-motor and ideo-sensory responses) caused in a similar manner by certain ideas, e.g., the salivation often caused by imagining sucking a lemon, which is a secretory response. The notion of an ideo-dynamic response contributed to James Braid's first neuro-psychological explanation of the principle through which [[suggestion]] operated in [[hypnotism]].

With the rise of [[Spiritualism]] in 1840s, [[mediums]] devised and refined a variety of techniques for communicating, ostensibly, with the spirit world including [[table-turning]] and [[planchette]] writing boards (the precursor to later [[Ouija]] boards). These phenomena and devices quickly became the subject of scientific investigation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Planchette; or, The Despair of Science|date=1869|pages=1–20|publisher=Roberts Brothers|location=Boston|url=https://archive.org/details/despairofscience00sargrich|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=John Henry|title=The Fashionable Science of Parlour Magic|date=1885|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UypbAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=magic&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Ideomotor was first used in a [[scientific paper]] discussing the means through which these spiritualistic phenomena produced effect, by [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] in 1852,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sgipt.org/medppp/psymot/carp1852.htm |title=On the influence of Suggestion in Modifying and directing Muscular Movement, independently of Volition | author=[[William Benjamin Carpenter]] | journal = | volume = | issue = | date=March 12, 1852 |accessdate=2010-02-27 |quote= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the alternative term '''Carpenter effect'''. (Carpenter derived the word ''ideomotor'' from the components ''[[wikt:ideo|ideo]]'', meaning "idea" or "mental representation", and ''[[wikt:motor|motor]]'', meaning "muscular action"). In the paper, Carpenter explained his theory that [[muscular]] movement can be independent of [[conscious]] desires or emotions.

Carpenter was a friend and collaborator of [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], the founder of modern hypnotism. Braid soon adopted Carpenter's ideo-motor terminology, to facilitate the transmission of his most fundamental views, based upon those of his teacher, the philosopher [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], that the efficacy of hypnotic suggestion was contingent upon the subject's concentration upon a single (thus, "dominant") idea. In 1855, Braid explained his decision to abandon his earlier term "mono-ideo-motor", based on Carpenter's (1852) "ideo-motor principle", and adopt the more appropriate and more descriptive term "mono-ideo-dynamic". His decision was based upon suggestions made to Carpenter (in 1854) by their friend in common, [[Daniel Noble (physician)|Daniel Noble]], that the activity that Carpenter was describing would be more accurately understood in its wider applications (viz., wider than pendulums and ouija boards) if it were to denominated the "ideo-dynamic principle":&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jBVAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA642#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Noble (1854), Lecture III, p.642.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In order that I may do full justice to two esteemed friends, I beg to state, in connection with this term ''monoideo-dynamics'', that, several years ago, Dr. W. B. Carpenter introduced the term ''ideo-motor'' to characterise the reflex or automatic muscular motions which arise merely from ideas associated with motion existing in the mind, without any conscious effort of volition. In 1853, in referring to this term, [[Daniel Noble (physician)|Daniel Noble]] said, "''Ideo-dynamic'' would probably constitute a phraseology more appropriate, as applicable to a wider range of phenomena." In this opinion I quite concurred, because I was well aware that an idea could ''arrest'' as well as ''excite'' motion automatically, not only in the muscles of voluntary motion, but also as regards the condition of ''every other function of the body''. I have, therefore, adopted the term ''monoideo-dynamics'', as still more comprehensive and characteristic as regards the true mental relations which subsist during all dynamic changes which take place, in every other function of the body, as well as in the muscles of voluntary motion.&lt;ref&gt;Braid, (1855), footnote at p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Scientific tests by the English scientist [[Michael Faraday]], Manchester surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Braid's letter to Michael Faraday (22 August 1853).&lt;/ref&gt; the French chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], and the American psychologists [[William James]] and [[Ray Hyman]] have demonstrated that many phenomena attributed to spiritual or paranormal forces, or to mysterious "energies", are actually due to ideomotor action. Furthermore, these tests demonstrate that "honest, intelligent people can unconsciously engage in muscular activity that is consistent with their expectations".&lt;ref name="hyman"&gt;{{cite journal

Some operators claim to use ideomotor responses to communicate with a subject's "[[unconscious mind]]" using a system of physical signals (such as finger movements) for the unconscious mind to indicate "yes", "no", "I don't know", or "I'm not ready to know that consciously".&lt;ref&gt;Cheek (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple experiment to demonstrate the ideomotor effect is to allow a hand-held pendulum to hover over a sheet of paper. The paper has keywords such as YES, NO and MAYBE printed on it. Small movements in the hand, in response to questions, can cause the pendulum to move towards key words on the paper. This technique has been used for experiments in [[extrasensory perception]], lie detection, and ouija boards. This type of experiment was used by [[Kreskin]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1stingames.com/rules/kreskinsesp/index.pdf see how kreskin used this pendulum&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used by illusionists such as [[Derren Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Derren. (2007). ''Tricks of the Mind''. Transworld Publishers. p. 48. {{ISBN|978-1905026357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Responding to questions ===
&lt;!-- These are not "ideomotor questions"; and the process is not "ideomotor questioning". The questions that are delivered by the operator are couched in normal language, and are presented to the subject in a completely normal way. It is the subject's responses that involve "ideomotor" activity, displayed through (usually predetermined) sets of "ideomotor signals". --&gt;
It is strongly associated with the practice of [[hypnotherapy|analytical hypnotherapy]] based on "uncovering techniques" such as [[John G. Watkins|Watkins']] "Affect Bridge",&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, (January 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a subject's "yes", "no", "I don't know", or "I don't want to answer" responses to an operator's questions are indicated by physical movements rather than verbal signals; and are produced ''per medium'' of a pre-determined (between operator and subject) and pre-calibrated set of responses.&lt;ref&gt;LeCron, (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[In-situ]]'' conservation''' is the on-site [[Conservation movement|conservation]] or the conservation of genetic resources in natural populations of [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]], such as [[forest genetic resources]] in natural populations of Teagan species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC|title=Biodiversity and Its Conservation in India|last=Negi|first=Sharad Singh|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788185182889|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process of protecting an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]] in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], either by protecting or restoring the habitat itself, or by defending the species from [[Predation|predators]]. It is applied to conservation of [[agricultural biodiversity]] in [[agro ecosystem]]s by farmers, especially those using unconventional farming practices.


==Methods==
About 4% of the total geographical area of the country is used for ''in situ'' conservation. The following methods are presently used for ''in situ'' conservation.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! In-situ conservation !! Number available
|-
| Biosphere reserves || 18
|-
| National parks || 104
|-
| Wild-life sanctuaries || 543
|-
| Biodiversity hotspots || 4
|-
|}

===Biosphere reserve===
Biosphere reserves cover very large areas, often more than 5000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They are used to protect species for a long time. Currently, there are 18 Biosphere Reserves in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! State
|-
| Nanda Devi || Uttarakhand
|-
| Nokrek || Meghalaya
|-
| Manas || Assam
|-
|Sundarban || West Bengal
|
|}

===National parks===
A national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. It is usually a small reserve covering an area of about 100 to 500 square kilometers. Within biosphere reserves, one or more national parks may also exist. Currently, there are 103 national parks in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! State !! Important wildlife
|-
| Kaziranga National Park || Assam || One-horned rhino
|-
| Gir National Park || Gujarat || Asiatic lions
|-
| Bandipur || Karnataka || Tiger, Elephant
|-
| Dachigam || J &amp; K || Hangul
|-
| Kanha || M.P || Tiger
|-
| Periyar || Kerala || Tiger, elephant
|-
| Ranthambore National Park || Rajasthan || Tiger
|}

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
A wildlife sanctuary is an area which is reserved for the conservation of animals only. Currently, there are 543 wild sanctuaries in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! State !! Major wildlife
|-
| Hazaribagh sanctuary || Jharkhand || Tiger, leopard
|-
| Ghana Bird sanctuary || Rajasthan || 300 species of Birds
|-
| Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary || Haryana || Migratory birds
|-
| Abohar Wild life Sanctuary || Punjab || Black buck
|-
| Nal sarovar Bird Sanctuary || Gujarat || Water birds
|-
| Mudumalai Wild life Sanctuary || Tamil Nadu || Tiger, elephant, leopard
|-
| Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary || Tamil Nadu || Water birds
|}
{| class="wikitable"

===Biodiversity Hotspots===
According to Conservation international, to qualify as a hotspot a region must meet two strict criteria :
 
• it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (∆ 0.5% of the world's total) as endemics,

• it has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.

|-
|}

===Gene sanctuary===
A gene sanctuary is an area where plants are conserved.
It includes both biosphere reserves as well as national parks.
India has set up its first gene sanctuary in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya for wild relatives of citrus. Efforts are also being made to set up gene sanctuaries for banana, sugarcane, rice and mango.

===Community reserves===
It is the type of protected area introduced in Wildlife Protection Amendment Act 2002 to provide legal support to community or privately owned reserves which cannot be designated as national park or wildlife sanctuary.

===Sacred groves===
They are tracts of forest set aside where all the trees and wildlife within are venerated and given total protection.

==Benefits==
One benefit of ''in situ'' conservation is that it maintains recovering populations in the environment where they have developed their distinctive properties. Another benefit is that this strategy helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within their environments. As a last resort, [[ex-situ conservation]] may be used on some or all of the population, when ''in situ'' conservation is too difficult, or impossible. The species gets adjusted to the natural disasters like drought, floods, forest fires and this method is very cheap and convenient.

==Reserves==
Wildlife and livestock conservation is mostly based on nothing. This involves the protection of wildlife habitats. Also, sufficiently large reserves are maintained to enable the target species to exist in large numbers. The population size must be sufficient to enable the necessary [[genetic diversity]] to survive within the population, so that it has a good chance of continuing to [[Adaptation (biology)|adapt]] and [[evolution|evolve]] over time. This reserve size can be calculated for target species by examining the population density in naturally occurring situations. The reserves must then be protected from intrusion or destruction by man, and against other catastrophes.

==Agriculture==
In [[agriculture]], ''in situ conservation'' techniques are an effective way to improve, maintain, and use traditional or native varieties of agricultural crops. Such methodologies link the positive output of scientific research with farmers' experience and field work.

First, the accessions of a variety stored at a [[germplasm]] bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses. Thus, the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced. Later, the best tested accessions are crossed, mixed, and multiplied under replicable situations. At last, these improved accessions are supplied to the producers. Thus, farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties, instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop. This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas, where commercial varieties are not expedient, due to climate and [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] constraints. Or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;G. Avila, L. Guzmán, M. Céspedes 2004.

Around the start of the 19th century, various factors led to a more positive image of the [[Jews]] in England. As the century went on, [[German Jews|Jews of German origin]] acquired greater social status. Despite powerful opposition, there was a gradual move towards [[Religious intolerance#Historical perspectives|religious toleration]] and full [[civil rights]] for the Jews. 

==Improvement of Jewish relations==

One reason for an improvement in the public image of the Jews at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th can be found in positive attitudes towards Jewish [[pugilist]]s. A further cause for kindlier feeling on the part of at least the [[middle class]]es of [[England|Englishmen]] toward the Jews was supplied by the revival of [[Religious conversion|conversionist]] hopes at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Misled doubtless by the tendency to desertion shown by not a few of the [[Sephardim]], many [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians anticipated the conversion ''en masse'' of the Jewish population, and on the initiative of [[Lewis Way]] the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|London Society for the Promotion of Christianity Among the Jews]] was founded in 1809. This and kindred societies wasted large sums of money with indifferent results but, politically, they helped to increase sympathy for the Jews among the [[non-conformist]]s, who formed the bulk of their contributors and were at the same time becoming a leading factor in the formation of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] policy.

==British Israelism==
Similarly, at a much later period the craze of [[British Israelism]] made many of the narrower [[Bible Christian]]s more sympathetic toward the Jews. On the other hand, the great influence of Dr. [[Thomas Arnold]] in the Liberal ranks was ultimately directed against the Jewish hopes. The more [[Erastian]] he was, the more he desired to see the legislature exclusively Christian.

==Rise of German Jewish community==
In the meanwhile the lead among the English Jews was passing from the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish]] to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|German]] section of the community. The bankers Goldsmid acquired both influence and culture, and their efforts to raise the community were soon to be supplemented by those of [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan Rothschild]], the ablest of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Mayer Rothschild]]'s sons, who had settled first in [[Manchester]] and afterward in [[London]]. The times were in a measure propitious for a new effort to remove the civil [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] of the Jews. The example of [[France]] had not been without its effect. The rising tide in favour of religious liberty, as applied to dissenters generally and to [[Roman Catholic]]s in particular, might have been expected to carry with it more favourable conditions for the Jews; but a long struggle was to intervene before "Englishmen of the Jewish persuasion" were to have equal [[rights]] with other Englishmen.

'''John Preston Davis''' (January 19, 1905 &amp;ndash; September 11, 1973) was an American journalist, lawyer and activist intellectual, who became prominent for his work with the [[Joint Committee on National Recovery]]. He co-founded the [[National Negro Congress]] in 1935, which was affiliated with the Communist Party of America.

He founded ''Our World'' magazine in 1946, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine edited for African-American readers. He also published the ''American Negro Reference Book,'' covering virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.

==Biography==
John P. Davis was born in Washington, D.C., the son of [[Dr. William Henry Davis]] and Julia Davis. His father was a graduate of [[Howard University]] and served as principal of Armstrong High School. During [[World War I]], Dr. Davis was appointed as Secretary to Dr. [[Emmett Jay Scott]], Special Assistant to the [[United States Secretary of War]]. In the 1920s, Dr. Davis served as Secretary to the Presidential Commission investigating the economic conditions in the [[Virgin Islands]].

==The early years==
Davis attended segregated schools in Washington, D.C., graduating from the elite Dunbar High School, which stressed an academic curriculum. In 1922 he enrolled in [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. He graduated in 1926, earning an A.B. and double honors in English and Psychology. At Bates, Davis was president of [[Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha#Delta Sigma Rho|Delta Sigma Rho]], an honorary debating fraternity, and editor of the student publication ''The Bobcat''.

Davis toured Europe with the Bates College debating team. He was among the first African-American men to be sent overseas under the auspices of the American University Union to engage in international debate; his team from Bates met and defeated Cambridge University. While he was an undergraduate at Bates College, Davis was nominated for a [[Rhodes scholarship]]. He contributed short stories to the magazines, ''[[The Crisis]]'' and ''Opportunity,'' published by the [[NAACP]].
 
With his literary interests, Davis was drawn into the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. After college, he moved to New York City, where for a time, he replaced the celebrated scholar [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] as literary editor of ''The Crisis''. During this period, Davis joined with other young black writers &amp;ndash; [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Gwendolyn Bennett]], [[Wallace Thurman]], [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Richard Bruce Nugent|Richard Bruce]] &amp;ndash; to produce ''[[Fire!!]]'', a magazine devoted to young African-American artists.

==Harvard University==
Davis had a fellowship to Harvard University from 1926 to 1927, and earned his master's degree in Journalism. He left Harvard to join the staff of [[Fisk University]], a [[historically black college]] in Nashville, where he served as Director of Publicity from (1927 to 1928). He returned to [[Harvard University]] and earned an LLB degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1933.

At Harvard, Davis cemented lifelong friendships with a small core of black students, including fellow Dunbar High School alumni [[Robert C. Weaver]], later appointed as the first black member of a Presidential cabinet; [[William H. Hastie|William Hastie]], later appointed as the first black federal judge; and [[Ralph Bunche]], later a statesman and diplomat who was awarded a [[Nobel Prize for Peace]].

These friends remained important throughout his career. During their student years, the men discussed race and politics, especially the inadequacy of the black Republican leadership. When the [[Great Depression]] intensified the social and economic problems confronting black America, Davis and his colleagues looked to the example of Reconstruction, when federal power was used to redress the plight of former slaves. They called on the federal government to ensure black civil and political rights. The [[New Deal]] of Franklin D. Roosevelt seemed to offer the possibility of federal intervention for economic justice.

==Marriage and family==
Davis married Marguerite DeMond, the daughter of [[Reverend Abraham Lincoln DeMond]] and Lula Watkins (Patterson) DeMond. She had attended Avery Normal Institute in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], operated by the [[American Missionary Association]] and the Congregationalist Church. Even before the Civil War, Avery Normal Institute's racially integrated faculty was providing quality educations for African Americans. She attended [[Syracuse University]] in 1931 and came to Washington, D.C., with her mother in 1932, after the death of her father.

Marguerite DeMond went to work as a researcher for African-American historian [[Carter G. Woodson]]'s [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]]. After a one-year courtship, she and Davis were married. They had four children, including [[Michael DeMond Davis]], who became a journalist who authored Black American Women in Olympic track and Field and the [[Thurgood Marshall]] biography.

==Joint Committee for National Recovery==
In the summer of 1933 John P. Davis, a law graduate, and Robert C. Weaver, a doctoral student at Harvard, acted to ensure that African-American interests were represented in government programs. The two men returned to Washington, D.C. and established an office on Capitol Hill, where they fought successfully against the racial wage differential and for the integration of Negro families into the program of the Homestead Subsistence Division in the first recovery program.

Davis and Weaver organized the [[Negro Industrial League]] to pressure New Deal agencies to address the needs of blacks. They monitored the hearings of the [[National Recovery Administration]] to ensure that blacks benefited from the program.

Their efforts led to the establishment of the [[Joint Committee on National Recovery]], a group of twenty-six national groups, including the [[YWCA]], [[National Urban League]] (NUL), and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Davis became Executive Secretary of the JCNR, a position he held until 1936, serving as a legislative lobbyist. The committee lobbied for fair inclusion of African Americans in government-sponsored programs. It publicized incidents and patterns of racial discrimination. The implementation of a National Recovery Program promised to have immediate and long-term consequences for African Americans. While Davis and Weaver worked, more established African-American leaders deliberated about how to respond to the flurry of New Deal legislation.

==National Negro Congress==
In May 1935 a conference on the economic status of the Negro was held at [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., out of which emerged a major civil rights coalition that was active in the late 1930s and 1940s. The National Negro Congress—whose sponsors included Davis, [[Ralph J. Bunche]] and [[Alain Locke]] of Howard University, [[A. Philip Randolph]] of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], [[James W. Ford|James Ford]] of the [[Communist Party]], [[Lester Granger]] and Elmer Carter of the Urban League, and [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] of the NAACP—was significant in two respects.&lt;!--what two?--&gt; Davis was one of the original founders; he served as Executive Secretary until 1942.

The NNC represented one of the first efforts of the 20th century to bring together under one umbrella black secular leaders, preachers, labor organizers, workers, businessmen, radicals, and professional politicians, with the assumption that the common denominator of race could weld together such divergent segments of black society. It was the Communist Party’s effort to build support among activists in the black mainstream. The evolution of the [[National Negro Congress]] dramatized the growing convergence of outlook between Communists and activist black intellectuals that had taken shape in the protests of the early Depression years and reached full fruition during the years of the [[Popular Front]].

In 1943 Davis brought the first lawsuit challenging segregated schools in Washington, D.C., in the name of his five-year-old son Michael D. Davis, who was rejected from his neighborhood's Noyes School, a white elementary school. The ''Washington Star'' criticized the African-American lawyer for legally challenging the District's dual segregated school system after the principal of Noyes School refused to admit Mike Davis. The ''Washington Star'' paper said that District citizens had long accepted separate schools for blacks and whites, and that the suit brought by John P. Davis would cause deeper racial divisions in the nation's capital.

In response to Davis' suit, the US Congress appropriated federal funds to construct the Lucy D. Slowe elementary school, for African-American children, directly across the street from his [[Brookland, Washington, D.C.|Brookland]] neighborhood home. At that time, a committee of Congress directly administered District government.

==''Our World'' magazine==
After World War II, in 1946 Davis was founding publisher of ''Our World'' magazine, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine to appeal to African-American readers. Its first issue, with singer-actress [[Lena Horne]] on the cover, appeared on the nation's newsstands in April 1946. ''Our World'' was a premier publication, covering contemporary topics from black history to sports and entertainment, with regular articles on health, fashion, politics and social awareness. It was based in New York City, the publishing capital of the country.

''Our World'' portrayed a thriving black America; its covers featured entertainers such as [[Lena Horne]], [[Marian Anderson]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Nat King Cole]].

==''The American Negro Reference Book''==
In 1964 Davis served as editor of special publications for the [[Phelps-Stokes Fund]]. He compiled in a single volume a reliable summary on the main aspects of Negro life in America, presenting it with historical depth to provide the reader with a true perspective. ''The American Negro Reference Book'' covered virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.

==Papers and collections==
The largest collection of Davis' papers is in the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]], [[New York Public Library]]. Insight into Davis' political and social views can be found in his own writings. ''The Papers of the National Negro Congress'' reproduces all of the organization’s records that are housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, including the voluminous working files of Davis and successive executive secretaries of the National Negro Congress. Beginning with papers from 1933 that predate the formation of the National Negro Congress, the wide-ranging collection documents Davis’ involvement in the Negro Industrial League. It includes the "Report Files" of Davis’ interest in the "Negro problem."

The most extensive overview of Davis' life is by Hilmar Jenson in an edition of his writings, John Preston Davis, ''The Forgotten Civil Rights'' (1996). Much of the scholarly writing about Davis focuses on his experiences in the National Negro Congress.

Artifacts and papers of Davis are being acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.

{{Terrorism}}
'''Left-wing terrorism''' (sometimes called '''Marxist–Leninist terrorism''' or '''revolutionary/left-wing terrorism''') is [[terrorism]] meant to overthrow conservative or [[capitalism|capitalist systems]] and replace them with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]], [[socialist state|socialist]], or [[anarchist]] societies. Left-wing terrorism also occurs within already socialist states as activism against the current ruling government.&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"&gt;Aubrey, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moghadam, p. 56"&gt;Moghadam, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; It has taken vivid manifestations across the world and presented diverging dynamics and relationships with national governments and political economies.

==Ideology==
Left-wing terrorists have been influenced by various communist and socialist currents, including Marxism.&lt;ref name="Moghadam, p. 56"/&gt; [[Narodnaya Volya]], a 19th-century terrorist group that killed tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1881&lt;ref name="Czar trial"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Trial of the Czar's Assassins |newspaper=Wanganui Herald |volume=XV |issue=4132|date=7 May 1881 |page=2 |agency=[[United Press Association]] |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=WH18810507.2.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed the concept of [[propaganda by the deed]], is a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Moghadam, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sarah Brockhoff]], [[Tim Krieger]] and [[Daniel Meierrieks]], while left-wing terrorism is ideologically motivated, nationalist-separatist terrorism is ethnically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the revolutionary goal of left-wing terrorism is non-negotiable, whereas nationalist terrorists are willing to make concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggest that rigidity of the demands of left-wing terrorists may explain their lack of support relative to nationalist groups.&lt;ref name="Brockhoff p. 17"&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, many on the revolutionary left have showed solidarity for [[national liberation]] groups employing terrorism, such as [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]], the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the South American [[Tupamaros]], seeing them as engaged in a global struggle against capitalism.&lt;ref name="Brockhoff p. 17"/&gt; Since nationalist sentiment is fueled by socio-economic conditions, some separatist movements, including the Basque [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] incorporated communist and socialist ideology into their policies.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Left-wing terrorism has its roots in 19th and early 20th century [[anarchist terrorism]] and became pronounced during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern left-wing terrorism developed in the context of the [[Protests of 1968|political unrest of 1968]].  In Western Europe, notable groups included the West German [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), the Italian [[Red Brigades]], the French [[Action directe (armed group)|Action Directe]] (AD), and the Belgian [[Communist Combatant Cells]] (CCC). Asian groups have included the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], although the latter organization later adopted [[nationalist terrorism]].  In Latin America, groups that became actively involved in terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s included the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]], the Peruvian [[Shining Path]], and the Colombian [[19th of April Movement]].&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Front de libération du Québec]] was a Marxist-Leninist group active in Canada in the 1960s and '70s, promoting socialist insurrection and an independent Quebec. They are known for over 160 bombings and other violent incidents that killed eight, and for the kidnap-murder of Quebec politician [[Pierre Laporte]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Pelletier. The October crisis. McClelland and Stewart, 1971. Pp. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Terrorism in the United States}}
Modern left-wing terrorist groups in the United States developed from remnants of the [[Weather Underground]] and extremist elements of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. Between 1973 and 1975, the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] was active, committing bank robberies, [[murder]]s, and other acts of violence. Most notably, the group kidnapped heiress [[Patty Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/index.html|title=American Experience {{!}} Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, both the [[May 19th Communist Organization]] (M19CO) and the smaller [[United Freedom Front]] were active. A 1994 study found that in the 1980s "the actual number of acts of terrorism committed by left-wing groups accounted for about three-fourths of all officially designated acts of domestic terrorism in America. About half of these leftist acts were committed by Puerto Rican groups, while the rest were committed by traditional leftist terrorist groups like M19CO".&lt;ref&gt;Brent L. Smith (1994). "[https://archive.org/details/Terrorism_in_America_Brent_Smith Terrorism in America]", accessed 18 April 2018&lt;/REF&gt; After 1985, following the dismantling of both groups, one source reports there were no confirmed acts of left-wing terrorism by similar groups.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of left-wing terrorism dropped off at the end of the Cold War (circa 1989), partly due to the loss of support for communism.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, pp. 13, 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Latin America===
Stefan M. Audrey describes the [[Sandinistas]], [[Shining Path]], [[19th of April Movement]], and [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) as the main organizations involved in left-wing terrorism in Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s. These organizations opposed the United States government and drew local support, as well as receiving support from the Soviet Union and Cuba.&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/&gt;

====FARC====
The [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) is a Marxist–Leninist organization in Colombia which has engaged in vehicle bombings, gas cylinder bombs, killings, landmines, kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, as well as guerilla and conventional military. The United States Department of State includes the FARC-EP on its list of foreign terrorist organizations, as does the European Union.

Businesses operating in rural areas, including agricultural, oil, and mining interests, were required to pay "vaccines" (monthly payments) which "protected" them from subsequent attacks and kidnappings. An additional, albeit less lucrative, source of revenue was highway blockades in which guerrillas stopped motorists and buses in order to confiscate jewelry and money. An estimated 20 to 30 percent of FARC combatants are under 18 years old, with many as young as 12 years old, for a total of around 5000 children.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]].

==== Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) ====
The [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] has been responsible for hundreds of attacks on government and civilian targets.
After the [[United People's Front of Nepal]] (UPF)'s Maoist wing, CPN-M, performed poorly in elections and was excluded from the 194 election, the Maoists turned to [[insurgency]]. They aimed to overthrow Nepal's monarchy and parliamentary democracy, and to change Nepalese society, including a purge of the nation's elite class, a state takeover of private industry, and collectivization of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3531 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/nepal/terroristoutfits/index.html Nepal Terrorist Groups - Maoist Insurgents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], attacks against civilian populations occurred as part of Maoist strategy, leading [[Amnesty International]] to state: &lt;blockquote&gt;The CPN (Maoist) has consistently targeted private schools, which it ideologically opposes. On the 14 April 2005 the CPN (Maoist) demanded that all private schools shut down, although this demand was withdrawn on 28 April. Following this demand, it bombed two schools in western Nepal on 15 April, a school in Nepalganj, Banke district on 17 April and a school in Kalyanpur, Chitwan on 21 April. CPN (Maoist) cadres also reportedly threw a bomb at students taking classes in a school in Khara, Rukum district.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051107070737/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA310542005?

In 1970, they hijacked a plane to North Korea, where nine of their members were interned. Fourteen members were killed during an internal purge. In 1971, the renamed JRA formed a connection with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and established a base in Lebanon. Their major terrorist acts included an armed attack on the Tel Aviv airport, highjacking planes to Libya and Bangladesh, kidnapping the French ambassador to the Hague, and bombing a [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) nightclub in Naples, Italy. By the mid-1990s, their level of activity had declined and the US State Department no longer considered them a terrorist threat. In 2001, their leader announced the dissolution of the group, although some of its members were in prison and others were still wanted by police.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, pp. 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-Vedanta''', also called '''Hindu modernism''',{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} '''neo-Hinduism''',{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} '''Global Hinduism'''{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=265}} and '''Hindu Universalism''',&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ Frank Morales, ''Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; are terms to characterize interpretations of [[Hinduism]] that developed in the 19th century. Some scholars argue that these modern interpretations incorporate western ideas{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} into traditional Indian religions, especially [[Advaita Vedanta]], which is asserted as central or fundamental to [[Hindu culture]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

The term "Neo-Vedanta" was coined by Paul Hacker, in a somewhat pejorative way, to disntinguish modern developments from "traditional" Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Madaio|2017}} Other scholars have pointed out that a '''Greater Advaita Vedānta'''{{sfn|Madaio|2017}}{{refn|group=note|Madaio refers to Allen, Michael S. 2013. The Ocean of Inquiry: A Neglected Classic of Late Advaita Vedānta. Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.}} developed since medieaval times, in the Muslim period of India, when Hindus responded to Muslim rule and domination.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} When Muslim rule was replaced by British rule, Hindu religious and political leaders and thinkers responded to this western [[colonialism]] and [[orientalism]], contributing to the [[Indian freedom struggle]] and the modern national and religious identity of [[Hindu]]s in the [[Republic of India]]. This societal aspect is covered under the term of [[Hindu reform movements]].

Among the main proponents of such modern interpretations of Hinduism were [[Vivekananda]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]], who to some extent also contributed to the emergence of [[Neo-Hindu movements in the West]].

Neo-Vedanta has been influential in the perception of Hinduism, both in the west and in the higher educated classes in India. It has received appraisal for its "solution of synthesis",{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}} but has also been criticised for its Universalism. The terms "Neo-Hindu" or "Neo-Vedanta" themselves have also been criticised for its polemical usage, the prefix "Neo-" then intended to imply that these modern interpretations of Hinduism are "inauthentic" or in other ways problematic.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=587}}

==Definition and etymology==
According to Halbfass, the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" refer to "the adoption of Western concepts and standards and the readiness to reinterpret traditional ideas in light of these new, imported and imposed modes of thought".{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} Promiment in Neo-Vedanta is Vivekananda, who's theology, according to Madaio, is often characterised in earlier scholarship as "a rupture from 'traditional' or 'classical' Hindusim, particularly the 'orthodox' Advaita Vedanta of the eight century Samkara."{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=2}}

The term "Neo-Vedanta" appears to have arisen in Bengal in the 19th century, where it was used by both Indians and Europeans.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} According to [[Wilhelm Halbfass|Halbfass]] the term was invented by a Bengali, [[Brajendra Nath Seal]] (1864–1938), who used the term to characterise the literary work of [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] (1838–1894).{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}}

The term "neo-Vedanta" was used by Christian missionaries as well as Hindu traditionalists to criticize the emerging ideas of the [[Brahmo Samaj]], a critical usage whose "polemical undertone [...] is obvious".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9,21(n33)}}

The term "neo-Hinduism" was used by a Jesuit scholar resident in India, [[Robert Antoine]] (1914–1981), from whom it was borrowed by Paul Hacker, who used it to demarcate these modernist ideas from "surviving traditional Hinduism,"{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} and treating the Neo-Advaitins as "dialogue partners with a broken identity who cannot truly and authentically speak for themselves and for the Indian tradition".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9}} Hacker made a distinction between "Neo-Vedanta" and "neo-Hinduism",{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} seeing nationalism as a prime concern of "neo-Hinduism".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}}

==History==
Although neo-Vedanta proper developed in the 19th century in response to western colonialism, it has got deeper origins in the Muslim period of India.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

===Islamic rule – Unifying Hinduism===
{{main article|Unifying Hinduism}}
With the onset of Islamic rule, hierarchical classifications of the various orthodox schools were developed to defend Hinduism against Islamic influences.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} According to Nicholson, already between the twelfth and the sixteenth century,
{{quote|... certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}}}

The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions"  has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24-33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26-27}} Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term "Hinduism" in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}

Within these so-called ''[[Doxology|doxologies]]'' Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} [[Vijnanabhiksu]], a 16th-century philosopher and writer, is still an influential representant of these doxologies. He's been a prime influence on 19th century Hindu modernists like Vivekananda, who also tried to integrate various strands of Hindu thought, taking Advaita Vedanta as its most representative specimen.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

===Western colonialism and Hindu reform movements===
{{See also|Orientalism|Hindu nationalism|Hindu reform movements}}

====Western colonialism====
With the colonisation of India by the British, a darker era in the history of India began. Prior to this, Muslim rule over North India had had a drastic effect on [[Hinduism]] (and [[Buddhism]]) through systematic [[Persecution of Hindus#Persecution by Muslim Rulers|persecution]]. While the Indian society was greatly impacted, its [[Economic history of India|economy]] however continued to remain one of the largest in the World.{{sfn|Maddison|2006}} Muslim rule over Southern India was also relatively short-lived before the 17th century. In contrast to the Muslim rulers, the British actively engaged in destroying the Indian economy as well.{{sfn|Maddison|2006}}{{sfn|Dharampal|1971}} The economic destruction wrought by restrictive British policies and [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial revolution]] in Europe, led to the dismantling of the prevailing decentralized education systems in India in the 18th century.{{sfn|Dharampal|1971}} The British state-supported education system, after the [[English Education Act 1835|English Education Act]] of 1835, emphasized western religions and thoughts at the cost of indigenous ones.

The British also nurtured and were involved, post 1813, in the aggressive propagation of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]].{{sfn|King|2002}} This was concomitant with the British [[Political warfare in British colonial India|propaganda]] machine's involvement in the spreading [[Anti-Indian sentiment#Colonialists|anti-Hindu]] sentiments.

====Hindu reform movements====
In response to the British rule and cultural dominance, [[Hindu reform movements]] developed,{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} propagating societal and religious reforms, exemplifying what [[Percival Spear]] has called
{{quote|... the 'solution of synthesis'—the effort to adapt to the newcomers, in the process of which innovation and assimilation gradually occur, alongside an ongoing agenda to preserve the unique values of the many traditions of Hinduism (and other religious traditions as well).{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=319-320}}{{refn|group=note|[[Percival Spear]] (1958), ''India, Pakistan and the West'', pp 177–91. In :{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=319-320}} "Spear develops a typology of behavioral responses that appeared among the people of India with the coming of the British. This typology is to some degree still relevant for formulating how Indic religion and philosophy may begin to play an innovative role in the intellectual discourses
of our time. Spear identifies five types of distinctive responses:
# a "military" or openly hostile response—taking up arms against the intruders;
# a "reactionary" response—the attempt to reconstitute the older political order, for example, the North Indian Rebellion (formerly called the "mutiny") in 1857–58;
# a "westernizing" response—assimilating to the new values;
# an "orthodox" response—maintenance of the older religion with appropriate reform; and
# the "solution of synthesis"—the effort to adapt to the newcomers, in the process of which innovation and assimilation gradually occur, alongside an ongoing agenda to preserve the unique values of the many traditions of Hinduism (and other religious traditions as well)."}}}}

Neo-Vedanta, also called "neo-Hinduism"{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a central theme in these reform-movements.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} The earliest of these reform-movements was Ram Mohan Roy's [[Brahmo Samaj]], who strived toward a purified and monotheistic Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005}}

==Major proponents==
Neo-vedanta's main proponents are the leaders of the Brahmo Samaj, especially [[Ram Mohan Roy]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=190-192}} while [[Vivekananda]], [[Gandhi]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] are the main proponents of neo-Hinduism.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}}

===Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj===
{{Main article|Ram Mohan Roy|Brahmo Samaj|Brahmoism}}

The Brahmo Samaj was the first of the 19th century reform movements. Its founder, Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833), strived toward an [[Universalism|universalistic]] interpretation of Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} He rejected Hindu mythology, but also the Christian trinity.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} He found that [[Unitarianism]] came closest to true Christianity,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} He founded a missionary committee in Calcutta, and in 1828 asked for support for missionary activities from the American Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=7-8}} By 1829, Roy had abandoned the Unitarian Committee,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=15}} but after Roy's death, the Brahmo Samaj kept close ties to the Unitarian Church,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268-269}} who strived towards a rational faith, social reform, and the joining of these two in a renewed religion.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} The Unitarians were closely connected to the [[Transcendentalists]], who were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}}

Rammohan Roy's ideas were "altered ... considerably" by [[Debendranath Tagore]], who had a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the ''Vedas''.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46-47}} Tagore also brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} Sen was influencded by [[Transcendentalism]], an American philosophical-religious movement stringly connected with Unitarianism, which emphasized personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen strived to "an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality", introducing "lay systems of spiritual practice" which can be regarded as proto-types of the kind of Yoga-exercises which Vivekananda populurized in the west.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=49}}

The theology of the Brahmo Samaj was called "neo-Vedanta" by Christian commentators,{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} who "partly admired [the Brahmos] for their courage in abandoning traditions of polytheism and image worship, but whom they also scorned for having proffered to other Hindus a viable alternative to conversion".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} Critics accused classical Vedanta of being "cosmic self-infatuation" and "ethical nihilism".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} Brahmo Samaj leaders responded to such attacks by redefining the Hindu path to liberation, making the Hindu path available to both genders and all castes,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} incorporating "notions of democracy and worldly improvement".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=193}}

===Vivekananda (1863–1902)===
{{Main article|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}

According to Gavin Flood, Vivekananda (1863–1902){{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} (Narendranath Dutta) "is a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} He played a major role in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].{{refn|group=note|His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called "Neo-Vedanta".{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

In 1880 Vivekananda joined [[Keshub Chandra Sen]]'s ''[[Nava Vidhan]]'', which was established by Sen after meeting [[Ramakrishna]] and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Narendranath (a.k.a. Narendra) became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge "at some point before 1884"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshub Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}}{{sfn| Sen|2006|pp=12–14}}{{sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=20}} From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen's [[Band of Hope]], which tried to discourage the youth from smoking and drinking.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of [[idolatry]],{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=5}}{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=29}} and a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the ''Upanisads'' and of the Vedanta".{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=46}} He propagated the idea that "the divine, the absolute, exists within all human beings regardless of social status",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that "seeing the divine as the essence of others will promote love and social harmony".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}}

During this period, he came in contact with [[Ramakrishna]], who eventually became his guru, and fitted into his broadening views on spirituality and liberation.

Vivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}} An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yoga's model, which includes [[Raja yoga]], his interpretation of Patanjali's [[Yoga sutras]],{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=123-126}} which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism.{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}} In 1896 his book ''[[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]]'' was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the western understanding of Yoga.{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=125-126}}{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=149-180}}

In line with Advaita vedanta texts like ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka]]'' (14th century) and ''[[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)]]'' (15th century), Vivekananda saw [[samadhi]] as a means to attain liberation.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

===Gandhi===
{{Main article|Mahatma Gandhi}}

Gandhi (1869–1948) has become a worldwide hero of tolerance and striving toward freedom. In his own time, he objected to the growing forces of [[Indian nationalism]], [[communalism]] and the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] response.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=8-10}}{{refn|group=note|"Subaltern" is the social group who is socially, politically, and geographically outside of the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Hierarchy|power structure]] of a country. In the Indian colonial and post-colonial context this entails the hegemony of upper-class visions on Indian history, such as the ''Vedic'' origins of Hinduism, and the alternative visions{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=9}} such as [[Dravidian nationalism]] and the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]].}} Gandhi saw religion as an uniting force, confessing the equality of all religions.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} He synthesized the ''[[Astika]]'', ''Nastika'' and ''Semitic religions'', promoting an inclusive culture for peaceful living.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} Gandhi pled for a new hermeneutics of Indian scriptures and philosophy, observing that "there are ample religious literature both in ''Astika'' and ''Nastika'' religions supporting for a pluralistic approach to religious and cultural diversity".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}}

The orthodox Advaita Vedanta, and the heterodox Jain concept [[Anekantavada]] provided him concepts for an "integral approach to religious pluralism".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=10}} He regarded Advaita as a universal religion ("dharma"{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}) which could unite both the orthodox and nationalistic religious interpretations, as the subaltern alternatives.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} Hereby Gandhi offers an interpretation of ''Hindutva'' which is basically different from the ''[[Sangh Parivar]]''-interpretation.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} The concept of ''anekantavada'' offered Gandhi an axiom that "truth is many-sided and relative".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} It is "a methodology to counter exclusivism or absolutism propounded by many religious interpretations".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} It has the capability of synthesizing different percpetions of reality.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} In Gandhi's view,
{{quote|...the spirit of 'Synthesis' essentially dominated Indian civilization. This spirit is absorption, assimilation, co-existence and synthesis.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}}}

Anekantavada also gives room to an organic understanding of "spatio-temporal process",{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}} that is, the daily world and its continued change.{{refn|group=note|Compare Gier (2012), who pleads for a [[Process philosophy|process-philosophy]] instead of a [[Substance theory|substance-philosophy]].{{sfn|Gier|2012}}}} The doctrine of anekantavada is a plea for ''samvada'', "dialogue", and an objection against proselytizing activities.{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=11}}

===Sarvepalli Radhakrisnan===
{{Main article|Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan}}

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was a major force in the further popularization of Neo-Vedanta.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194-196}} As a schoolboy, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was inspired by Vivekananda's lectures, in which he found "an ennobling vision of truth and harmony as well as a message of Indian pride".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=194}} He was educated by Christian missionaries, and wrote a master thesis on Vedanta and ethics.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} In later life, he became vice-president and president of India.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} According to Rinehart, he presented his view of Hinduism as ''the'' view of Hinduism.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} Central in his presentation was the claim that religion is fundamentally a kind of experience,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} ''anubhava'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEP-Radhakrishnan"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#SH3b Michael Hawley, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan'']&lt;/ref&gt; reducing religion "to the core experience of reality in its fundamental unity".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}}{{refn|group=note|The notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p = 47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular citique.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} The term was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p = 271}}}} For Radhakrishnan, Vedanta was the essence and bedrock of religion.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196}}

===Religion===

====Unity of Hinduism====
Neo-Vedanta aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} It presents
{{quote|... an imagined "integral unity" that was probably little more than an "imagined" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality "on the ground," as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

Neo-Vedanta was influenced by Oriental scholarship, which portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.{{sfn|King|1999|p=135}}{{refn|group=note|The same tendency to prefer an essential core teaching has been prevalent in western scholarship of Theravada Buddhism,{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and has also been constructed by D.T.

He argues for "an increased emphasis on non-scriptural sources and a focus on regional traditions".{{sfn|White|2006|p=104}}}}

====Universalism====
{{Main article|Universalism}}
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}

Following Ramakrishna, neo-Vedanta regards all religions to be equal paths to liberation, but also gives a special place to Hinduism, as the ultimate universal religion.

====Vedanta and nondualism====
{{Main article|Nondualism}}

According to Benavides, neo-Vedanta is closer to Ramanuja's [[Vishishtadvaita|qualified non-dualism]] than it is to Shankara Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Benavides|1993}} Nicholas F. Gier notes that neo-Vedanta does not regard the world to be illusionary, in contrast to Shankara's Advaita.{{sfn|Gier|2012|p=268-269}}{{refn|group=note|Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K.

According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formless and form.{{sfn|Taft|2014}} Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive.&lt;ref group=web name="GM" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Ramakrishna: "When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor preserving nor destroying - I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God.

The Neo-Vedanta is also Advaitic inasmuch as it holds that Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is one without a second, ''ekamevadvitiyam''. But as distinguished from the traditional Advaita of Sankara, it is a synthetic Vedanta which reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism and also other theories of reality. In this sense it may also be called concrete monism in so far as it holds that Brahman is both qualified, saguna, and qualityless, nirguna (Chatterjee, 1963 : 260)."{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}}}

Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda|Bhedabheda-Vedanta]] than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world.

Gandhi endorsed the Jain concept of [[Anekantavada]],{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=190-191}} the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.{{sfn|Dundas|2004|p=123–136}}{{sfn|Koller|2004|p=400–407}} This concept embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes [[Substance theory|substances]] but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes [[Process philosophy|process]] but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (''dravya'') and process (''paryaya'').{{sfn|Burch|1964|p=68–93}}

According to Sarma, who stands in the tradition of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], Advaitavāda means "spiritual non-dualism or absolutism",{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1}} in which opposites are ''manifestations'' of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}{{refn|group=note|Sarma: "All opposites like being and non-being, life and death, good and evil, light and darkness, gods and men, soul and nature are viewed as manifestations of the Absolute which is immanent in the universe and yet transcends it."{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}}}

A central concern in Neo-Vedanta is the role of ''[[sruti]]'', sacred texts, versus (personal) experience. Classical Advaita Vedanta is centered on the correct understanding of ''sruti'', the sacred texts. Correct understanding of the ''sruti'' is a ''pramana'', a means of knowledge to attain liberation.{{sfn|Myers|2013|p=104-105}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1984}}{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=22}} It takes years of preparation and study to accomplish this task, and includes the mastery of Sanskrit, the memorisation of texts, and the meditation over the interpretation of those texts.{{sfn|Dubois|2013}} Understanding is called ''[[anubhava]]'',{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=5}} knowledge or understanding derived from (personal) experience.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.0:100.apte V.S.Apte, ''The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary]}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Myers|2013|p=105}} ''Anubhava'' removes ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]'', ignorance, regarding Brahman and Atman, and leads to ''[[moksha]]'', liberation.

==Smarta Tradition==
{{Main article|Smarta Tradition}}

According to Ninian Smart, Neo-Vedanta is "largely a smarta account."{{sfn|Smart|2009|p=186}} In modern times Smarta-views have been highly influential in both the Indian{{sfn|Smart|2009|p=186}}&lt;ref group=web name="iskon-smarta"&gt;[http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1204.htm iskcon.org, ''Heart of Hinduism: The Smarta Tradition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113092719/http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1204.htm |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and western&lt;ref group=web name="hinduism-guide.com-Hinduism"&gt;[http://www.hinduism-guide.com/hinduism/hinduism.htm Hinduism-guide.com, ''Hinduism'']&lt;/ref&gt; understanding of Hinduism.

{{quote|Many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers.&lt;ref group=web name="iskon-smarta" /&gt;}}

Vaitheespara notes adherence of Smartha Brahmans to "the pan-Indian Sanskrit-Brahmanical tradition":{{sfn|Vaitheespara|2010|p=91}}
{{quote|The emerging pan-Indian nationalism was clearly founded upon a number of cultural movements that, for the most part, reimagined an 'Aryo-centric', neo-brahmanical vision of India, which provided the 'ideology' for this hegemonic project.

The majority of members of Smarta community follow the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Shankara.&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta" /&gt; Smarta and Advaita have become almost synonymous, though not all Advaitins are Smartas.&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta" /&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] was a Smarta,&lt;ref group=web name="Hinduism-guide.com-smarta"&gt;[http://www.hinduism-guide.com/hinduism/smarta.htm Hinduism-guide.com, ''Hinduism: Details about "Smarta"'']&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Radhakrishnan]].{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=179}}{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=3}} Smartas believe in the essential oneness of five ([[panchadeva]]) or six ([[Shanmata]] deities as personifications of the Supreme.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to Smartism, supreme reality, Brahman, transcends all of the various forms of personal deity.{{sfn|Espin|2007|p=563}} God is both [[Saguna brahman|Saguna]] and [[Nirguna Brahman|Nirguna]]:&lt;ref group=web name="WiseGeek" /&gt;

Lola Williamson further notes that "what is called Vedic in the smarta tradition, and in much of Hinduism, is essentially Tantric in its range of deities and liturgical forms."{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=89}}

==Influence==
Neo-Vedanta was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]],{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and western orientalists who regarded Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

===Vedanticization===
Neo-Vedanta has become a broad current in Indian culture,{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} extending far beyond the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], the Advaita Vedanta [[Sampradaya]] founded by [[Adi Shankara]]. The influence of Neo-Vedanta on Indian culture has been called "Vedanticization" by [[Richard E. King|Richard King]].{{sfn|King|2011|p=69}}

An example of this "Vedanticization" is [[Ramana Maharshi]], who is regarded as one of the greatest Hindu-saints of modern times,{{refn|group=note|A comparable change of reception can be seen in the status of [[Meister Eckhart]], who has come to be celebrated the most noted western mystic.}}, of whom Sharma notes that "among all the major figures of modern Hinduism [he] is the one person who is widely regarded as a ''[[jivanmukti]]''".{{sfn|Sharma|2005|p=208}} Although Sharma admits that Ramana was not acquainted with Advaita Vedanta before his personal experience of liberation,{{sfn|Sharma|2005|p=213}} and Ramana never received [[Diksha|initiation]] into the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]] or any other [[sampradaya]],&lt;ref group=web name="jd6"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/jd6.shtml John David, ''An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings.

===Diversity and pluralism===
In response to the British dominance and the British critique of Hinduism, various visions on Indian diversity and unity have been developed within the nationalistic and reform movements.{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

The [[Brahmo Samaj]] strived towards monotheism, while no longer regarding the Vedas as sole religious authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} The Brahmo Samaj had a strong influence on the Neo-Vedanta of Vivekananda,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan and Gandhi,{{sfn|King|2001}} who strived toward a modernized, humanistic Hinduism with an open eye for societal problems and needs.{{sfn|King|2001}} Other groups, like the [[Arya Samaj]], strived toward a revival of Vedic authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Arya Samaj]] "teaches that the ''Vedic'' religion is the only true religion revealed by God for all."{{sfn|Panicker|2006|p=39}} The Arya Samaj was founded by [[Dayanand Saraswati]] (1824-1883), who "was the solitary champion of Vedic authority and infallibility".{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=38}}}} In this context, various responses toward India's diversity developed.

====Hindu inclusivism – Hindutva and "Dharmic religions"====
In modern times, the orthodox measure of the primacy of the Vedas has been joined with the 'grand narrative' of the Vedic origins of Hinduism. The exclusion of Jainism and Buddhism excludes a substantial part of India's cultural and religious history from the asserttion of a strong and positive Hindu identity. Hindutva-ideology solves this problem by taking recourse to the notion of ''[[Hindutva]]'', "Hinduness", which includes Jainism and Buddhism. A recent strategy, exemplified by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], is the use of the term ''[[dharma]]'' as a common denominator, which also includes Jainism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Springer|2012}}

According to Larson, Malhotra's notion of "the so-called "Dharma” traditions"{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=314}} and their "integral unity" is another example of "neo-Hindu discourse".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=314}} Malhotra, in his ''[[Being Different]]'', uses the term "Dharmic tradition" or "dharmic systems", "referring to all the Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina and Sikh traditions".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} He proposes that those traditions, despite their differences, share common features, the most important being "[[Dharma]]".{{refn|group=note|According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], as described by Halbfass, the term "dharma" "assumed a fundamentally new meaning and function in modern Indian thought, beginning with [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] in the nienteenth century. This process, in which ''dharma'' was presented as an equivalent of, but also a response to, the western notion of "religion", reflects a fundamental change in the Hindu sense of identity and in the attitude toward other religious and cultural traditions. The foreign tools of "religion" and "nation" became tolls of self-definition, and a new and precarious sense of the "unity of Hinduism" and of national as well as religious identity took root".{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=10}}}} They are also characterised by the notion of "Integral Unity", which means that "ultimately only the whole exists; the parts that make up the whole have but a relative existence. The whole is independent and indivisible",&lt;ref group=web name="Hitchhiker"&gt;[http://beingdifferentforum.blogspot.nl/2013/01/why-integral-unity-and-not-synthetic.html Hitchhiker's Guide to Rajiv Malhotra's Discussion Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to "Synthetic Unity", which "starts with parts that exist separately from one another".&lt;ref group=web name="Hitchhiker" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Malhotra, "the four Dharma systems also share these general presuppositions":{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They all lead to the transcendent principle expressed variously as [[brahman]], [[nirvana]] and [[kevala]]";{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They facilitate the attainment of an extraordinary and direct experience (such as the highest yogic [[samadhi]]), leading to the realization of the transcendent principle at the personal level (sometimes even at the embodied level as [[Jivanmukta|jivanamukta]] or avalokateçvara);{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They facilitate a harmonious relation between the phenomenal and material mode of life ([[samsara]]) with the goal of spiritual liberation (paramartha) variously";{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}
* "They all share praxis, including symbols, foods, customs, social values, sacred geography, family values, festivals and so on."{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=382-383}}}} Malhotra has received strong criticism of his ideas, for 'glossing over'{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}} the differences between and even within the various traditions of India.{{sfn|Larson|2012}}{{sfn|Yelle|2012}}

In response, Malhotra explains that some of his critics confused "integral unity" with "homogeneity", thinking that Malhotra said all those traditions are essentially the same, when he actually wrote that Dharmic traditions share a sense of an "integral unity" despite differences.{{sfn|Malhotra|2013}}{{refn|group=note| According to Larson,
{{quote|Malhotra would have the reader believe that there is an "integral unity" underlying the various Dharma traditions, but, in fact, the very term "[[dharma]]" signals fascinating differences."{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

And according to Yelle,
{{quote|The idea of "dharmic traditions" represents a choice to gloss over, whether for ideological or strategic reasons, the vast differences that exist among and even within the various traditions of India ... These differences are invoked occasionally in order to buttress Malhotra’s argument for the pluralism of Indian culture, only to be erased as he presents as universal to dharmic traditions what is, in fact, easily recognizable as a thoroughly modern and homogenized ideal of Hinduism drawn from certain aspects of Vedanta philosophy and Yoga.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}}}}

In a response, Malhotra explains that some of his critics confused "integral unity" with "homogeneity", and that all those traditions are essentially the same, but that they share the assertion of an "integral unity":{{sfn|Malhotra|2013}}
{{quote|Yelle is right when he says that, "Every tradition is in fact an amalgam, and retains the traces of its composite origins." But he is wrong when he argues against my use of common features such as integral unity and embodied knowing, calling these "a thoroughly modern and homogenized ideal of Hinduism drawn from certain aspects of Vedånta philosophy and
Yoga." His concern about homogenization would have been legitimate if Being Different had proposed an integration of all Dharma traditions into a single new tradition. This is simply not my goal. Looking for commonality as a standpoint from which to gaze at a different family does not require us to relinquish the internal distinctiveness among the members of either family.{{sfn|Malhotra|2013|p=375-376}}}}}}

====Inclusivism and communalism====
According to Rinehart, neo-Vedanta is "a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}{{refn|group=note|Though neo-Hindu authors prefer the idiom of tolerance to that of inclusivism, it is clear that what is advocated is less a secular view of toleration than a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth. Thus Radhakrishnan's view of experience as the core of religious truth effectively leads to harmony only when and if other religions are willing to assume a position under the umbrella of Vedanta. We might even say that the theme of neo-Hindu tolerance provided the Hindu not simply with a means to claiming the right to stand alongside the other world religions, but with a strategy for promoting Hinduism as the ultimate form of religion itself.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}}} According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is [[Communalism]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} the idea that "all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.pluralindia.com/book/Illustrated_prmier/Chapter_5.pdf Ram Puniyani, ''COMMUNALISM : Illustrated Primer, Chapter 5'']&lt;/ref&gt; Communalism has become a growing force in Indian politics, presenting several threats to India, hindring its [[nation-building]]{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=3}} and threatening "the secular, democratic character of the Indian state".{{sfn|Panicker|2004|p=3}}

Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} and that "the neo-Hindu discource is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda."{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} But Rinehart also points out that it is 
{{quote|...clear that there isn't a neat line of causation that leads from the philosophies of Rammohan Roy, Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan to the agenda of [...] militant Hindus.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=198}}{{refn|group=note|Neither is Radhakrishnan's "use" of religion in the defense of Asian culture and society against colonialism unique for his person, or India in general.

===Influence on western spirituality===
{{Main article|Hinduism in the West|Nondualism}}

Neo-Vedanta has been influenced by western ideas{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but has also had a reverse influence on western spirituality.  Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the late 18th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} In 1785 appeared the first western translation of a Sanskrit-text.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} It marked the growing interest in the Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} which influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them "the consolation of my life".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}{{refn|group=note|And called his poodle "Atman".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}}

A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|"Masters of Wisdom"]]{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}}, "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

==Appraisal and criticism==

===Appraisal===
According to Larson, the "solution of synthesis" prevailed in the work of Rammohun Roy, Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Rabindranath Tagore, [[Swami Vivekananda]], M.K. Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muhammad Iqbal, V.D. Savarkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, "and many others".{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}} Spear voices appraisal of this "solution of synthesis",{{refn|group=note|[S]uch willingness to achieve a synthesis that is neither fearful of the new nor dismissive of the old is 'the ideological secret of modern India'.}}{{refn|group=note|Spear 1958, page 187, in {{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}}}} while G.R.

It alone can supply the philosophical framework for the understanding of the problems of our society.{{sfn|Sharma|2003|p=179}}}}

===Criticism===
Vivekenanda's presentation of Advaita Vedanta has been criticised for its misinterpretation of this tradition:
{{quote|Without calling into question the right of any philosopher to interpret Advaita according to his own understanding of it, [...] the process of Westernization has obscured the core of this school of thought. The basic correlation of renunciation and Bliss has been lost sight of in the attempts to underscore the cognitive structure and the realistic structure which according to Samkaracarya should both belong to, and indeed constitute the realm of māyā.{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

According to [[Anantanand Rambachan]], Vivekananda emphasised ''[[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]]'' ("personal experience"{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}}) over scriptural authority,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}} but in his interpretation of Shankara, deviated from Shankara, who saw knowledge and understanding of the scriptures as the primary means to moksha.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} According to Comans, the emphasis on samadhi also is not to be found in the Upanishads nor with Shankara.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=307}} For Shankara, meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

In the 21st century, Neo-Vedanta has been criticized by Hindu traditionalists for the influence of "Radical Universalism", arguing that it leads to a "self-defeating philosophical relativism," and has weakened the status and strength of Hinduism.&lt;ref group=web name=moralies2013&gt;Frank Morales (February 15, 2013).

==Criticism of neo-Hinduism label==

===Criticism of Paul Hacker===
In the 20th century the German Indologist [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]] used the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" polemically, to criticize modern Hindu thinkers,.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b}} Halbfass regards the terms "Neo-Vedanta" and "Neo-Hinduism" as "useful and legitimate as convenient labels",{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} but has criticized Hacker for use that was "simplistic".{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}} Furthermore, he asks,
{{quote|What is the significance and legitimacy of the "Neo" in expressions like "Neo-Hinduism and "Neo-Vedanta"? Could we speak of "Neo-Christianity" as well? In fact, I have used this term [...] and not all my Christian readers and reviewers were happy about the term.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007a|p=307}}}}

Halbfass wrote that the adoption of the terms 
{{quote|"Neo-Hinduism" and "Neo-Vedanta" [...] by Western scholars reflects Christian and European claims and perspectives which continue to be an irritant to Indians today. For Hacker, the "Neo" in "Neo-Hinduism" implies a lack of authenticity, an apologetic accommodation to Western ideas, and a hybridization of the tradition.{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=587–588}}{{refn|group=note|Halbfass adds that "I have tried [...] to argue that Hacker's radical critique reflects above all a typically Christian and European obsession with the concept of the individual person."{{sfn|Halbfass|2007b|p=588}}}}}}

Bagchee and Adluri argue that German Indology, including Hacker, was merely "a barely disguised form of religious evangelism".{{sfn|Bagche|Adluri|2013|p=215–229}}

According to Malhotra, an Indian-American Hindu writer, it was Paul Hacker who popularized the term 'neo-Hinduism' in the 1950s, "to refer to the modernization of Hinduism brought about by many Indian thinkers, the most prominent being Swami Vivekananda."&lt;ref group=web name="HT" /&gt; In Malhotra's view, "Hacker charged that 'neo-Hindus', most notably Vivekananda, have disingenuously adopted Western ideas and expressed them using Sanskrit."&lt;ref group=web name="HT" /&gt; Malhotra also notes that Hacker was a biased Christian apologist: 
{{quote|What is less known about Hacker is that he was also an unabashed Christian apologist who freely used his academic standing to further the cause of his Christian agenda. He led a parallel life, passionately advocating Christianity while presenting the academic face of being neutral and objective.&lt;ref group=web name="HT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinduism Today Staff|title=Book Review: Defending Hinduism’s Philosophical Unity|journal=Hinduism Today|date=October 2015|issue=October 2015|pages=66–69|url=http://rajivmalhotra.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hinduism-today_indras-net-review.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}According to David Smith, Hacker's belief was that the ethical values of 'neo-Hinduism" came from Western philosophy and Christianity, just in Hindu terms. Hacker also believed that Hinduism began in the 1870's. He saw Bankin Chattopadhyaya, Aruobindo, Gandhi, and Radhakishnan as its most famous proponents.&lt;ref name="'Reformed' Hinduism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=David |title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations |date=February 3, 2016 |publisher=Linda Woodhead |isbn=9780415858816 |page=57 |edition=third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of inherent development of religions===
Brian K. Smith notes that "The Neo-Hindu indigenous authorities are often dismissed as 'inauthentic,' their claims to legitimacy compromised by their encounters with modernity", which influenced their worldview and religious positions,{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=324}} but points out that 
{{quote|''All'' religions, at various points in recent history and under varying circumstances, have adopted to the modern world and the accompanying intellectual trends of modernity. 'Hinduism' (or 'Neo-Hinduism') is not unique in this regard either; the Neo-Hindu movement shares many commonalties with developments in other religious traditions around the world over the past several hundred years. The study of religion is the study of traditions in constant change.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=325}}{{refn|group=note|Smith expressed concern that "scholars of religion do not exercise their authority to write about religion(s) in a vacuum [...] One of the principal ramifications of the trend in Indology to deny the existence of a unified religion called 'Hinduism' is to delegitimize those in India who, in varying ways, have represented themselves as 'Hindus' and their religion as 'Hinduism.' [...] This kind of indifference to indigenous conceptualizations of self-identity [...] is especially problematic in an age where Western scholars often claim to be concerned to allow the 'natives to speak' and 'assume agency' over representational discourse [...] Denying the legitimacy of any and all 'Hindu' representations of Hinduism can easily crossover into a [[Orientalism|Neo-Orientalism]], whereby indigenous discourse is once again silenced or ignored as the product of a false consciousness delivered to it by outside forces or as simply irrelevant to the authoritative deliberations of Western [[Indology|Indologists]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=332–333}}}}}}

According to Madaio, the notion that Vivekananda and other Hindu modernists deviate from orthodox, classical Advaita Vedanta, neglects the fact that considerable developments took place in Indian religious thinking, including Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=2}}

===The "myth of Neo-Hinduism"===
[[Rajiv Malhotra]], in his book [[Indra's Net (book)|Indra's Net]], has stated that there is a "myth of Neo-Hinduism".{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=26}} According to him, there are "eight myths"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=28}} of Neo-Hinduism such as "colonial Indology's biases were turned into Hinduism" (Myth 2){{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=31}} and "Hinduism was manufactured and did not grow organically" (Myth 3).{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=32}} Malhotra denies that "Vivekananda manufactured Hinduism", or that `neo-Vedanta' suppressed "the traditions of the Indian masses." According to Malhotra, there is "an integrated, unified spiritual substratum in ancient India,"{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}} and argues that
{{quote|the branding of contemporary Hinduism as a faux 'neo-Hinduism' is a gross mischaracterization of both traditional and contemporary Hinduism [...] [C]ontemporary Hinduism is a continuation of a dynamic tradition. It is not in any way less authentic or less 'Hindu' than what may be dubbed traditional Hinduism. There are negative connotations to the term 'neo' which imply something artificial, untrue, or unfaithful to the original. Other world religions have undergone similar adaptations in modern times, though there are no such references to 'neo-Christianity' [...] I resist the wide currency being gained for the term 'neo-Hinduism', because this fictional divide between 'neo' and 'original' Hinduism subverts Hinduism.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=30}}}}

According to Malhotra, the 'myth of neo-Hinduism' "is used to fragment Hindu society by pitting its spiritual giants against one another and distorting their subtle and deeply intricate viewpoints."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014}} Also according to him, "the definition of neo-Hinduism has been contrived and [...] gained authenticity, in part because it suits certain academic and political agendas, and in part because it has been reiterated extensively without adequate critical response."{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=42}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4395">{{distinguish|Moore's paradox}}
The '''paradox of analysis''' is a paradox that concerns how an [[analysis]] can be both correct and informative.  Although the problem takes its origin from the conflict in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'', it was formulated in its complete form by philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] in his book ''[[Principia Ethica]]'', and first named by [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]] in his 1942 article "The Notion of Analysis in Moore's Philosophy".

==The paradox==
A [[conceptual analysis]] is something like the definition of a word.  However, unlike a standard dictionary definition (which may list examples or talk about related terms as well), a completely correct analysis of a concept in terms of others seems like it should have exactly the same meaning as the original concept.  Thus, in order to be correct, the analysis should be able to be used in any context where the original concept is used, without changing the meaning of the discussion in context.  Conceptual analyses of this sort are a major goal of [[analytic philosophy]].

However, if such an analysis is to be useful, it should be informative.  That is, it should tell us something we don't already know (or at least, something one can imagine someone might not already know).  But it seems that no conceptual analysis can both meet the requirement of correctness and of informativeness, on these understandings of the requirements.

To see why, consider a potential simple analysis:

:(1) For all x (any given member of a class or set), x is a brother if and only if x is a male sibling	

One can say that (1) is correct because the expression "brother" represents the same concept as the expression "male sibling," and (1) seems to be informative because the two expressions are not identical.  And if (1) is truly correct, then "brother" and "male sibling" must be interchangeable:

:(2) For all x, x is a brother if and only if x is a brother

Yet (2) is not informative, so either (1) is not informative, or the two expressions used in (1) are not interchangeable (because they change an informative analysis into an uninformative one) so (1) is not actually correct.  In other words, if the analysis is correct and informative, then (1) and (2) must be essentially equal, but this is not true because (2) is not informative.  Therefore, it seems an analysis cannot be both correct and informative at the same time.

==Proposed resolutions==
One way to resolve this paradox is to redefine what is an analysis.  In explaining the paradox, a potential analysis is assumed to be a relation between concepts rather than the verbal expressions used to illustrate them.  If the verbal expression is part of the analysis, then we shouldn't expect complete [[salva veritate|intersubstitutivity]] even in cases of correct analyses.  However, this response seems to move the notion of analysis into mere linguistic definition, rather than doing interesting work with concepts.

Another response is to [[bite the bullet]] and just say that correct analyses are uninformative — which then raises the question of what positive cognitive notion should be used instead of this one, if any.

One further response would be to take [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s position and reject the notion of conceptual analysis altogether. This is a natural response to the rejection of the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]]. The fact that many philosophers have followed Quine in this direction is part of the reason that many now say that the term "analytic philosophy" is a misnomer.

'''Paul Martin Laurence Weston''' (born 1965) is a British [[Far-right politics|far-right]] politician&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10792895/Election-candidate-arrested-over-Churchill-speech.html|title=Election candidate arrested over Churchill speech|author=Martin Evans|date=28 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Pegida UK]] leadership team. An activist and blogger, Weston joined the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) in 2010 and stood as a Parliamentary candidate for [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]].  In 2011, Weston left UKIP and joined the now-defunct [[British Freedom Party]] with members of the [[English Defence League]] (EDL) and former members of the [[British National Party]] (BNP).&lt;ref name=ind111125&gt;{{cite news|title=English Defence League prepares to storm local elections |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= 25 November 2011 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/english-defence-league-prepares-to-storm-local-elections-6267740.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the chairman of [[Liberty GB]] before the party was dissolved in December 2017, recommending its members to join [[For Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libertygb.org.uk/news/closure-liberty-gb|title=The Closure of Liberty GB - Liberty GB|website=libertygb.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Liberty GB, he was a candidate for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European election]]&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Weston | publisher=Liberty GB | url=http://www.libertygb.org.uk/content/paul-weston}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. He obtained 158 votes (0.4%).&lt;ref name=BBC15&gt;''BBC News Election 2015'': [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000801 Luton South]. Accessed 12 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He married a Romanian after meeting her in [[Romania]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref name=p100505&gt;{{cite news|title= Interview with Paul Weston | date=5 May 2010 | url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2010/5/5/interview-paul-weston|author=Marina Kim|website=politics.co.uk|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the President of the English branch of the [[International Free Press Society]] founded in 2009.&lt;ref name="Hope Not Hate Profile: Paul Weston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad/country/UK#id-135|title=UK has biggest audience for online jihadist propaganda in Europe |date=20 September 2017|publisher=HOPE not hate|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First partisan forays==
When interviewed in 2010 as a member of UKIP, Weston described himself as a "natural Conservative" and described immigration as the "[[ethnic cleansing]] of the [[English people|English]]".&lt;ref name= p100505/&gt; At the time Weston was standing as the UKIP candidate for [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|UK general election of 2010]]. With a 1.8% share of the vote Weston finished in fifth place. The Conservative candidate, [[Mark Field]], won the seat with 19,264 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/b11.stm "Cities of London and Westminster 2010 election results"], ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after leaving UKIP, in 2011 Weston became the chairman of the [[British Freedom Party]] (BFP) the same year after he had been asked to do so by the activists who had broken away from the BNP in October 2010 to found a new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad/country/UK#id-106|title=UK has biggest audience for online jihadist propaganda in Europe – HOPE not hate|date=20 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Weston has attended and addressed numerous gatherings and rallies for such groups as [[Bloc Identitaire]] in France, [[Freedom (German political party)|Die Freiheit]] in Germany and the [[Jewish Defence League]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="Hope Not Hate Profile: Paul Weston"/&gt; As chairman of the BFP, Weston attended an international conference of [[Counterjihad|counter-jihadists]] in September 2011. Yet in an interview, Weston cited a poll conducted by ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'', which had found that 48% of the British public would support an [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant party]], so long as the party did not take on explicitly [[fascist symbolism|fascist regalia]] and was non-violent, as evidence for an electoral basis for the BFP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/27/support-poll-support-far-right "Searchlight poll finds huge support for far right 'if they gave up violence'"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the midst of a crisis within the BNP and Weston held meetings with [[Andrew Brons]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], and longstanding figure on the far-right, who was vying for the leadership of the party. Ultimately, Weston left the BFP saying, "I joined the British Freedom Party in late 2011, but became disillusioned with the direction it was taking, over which I had little control."&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

In November 2012, the BFP officially announced that it had agreed to enter into a formal political alliance with the [[English Defence League]]. In October 2012, the party failed to hand-in its annual registration form and pay the fee of £25 and, in December of the same year, was deregistered by the [[Electoral Commission]]. The deregistration was statutory rather than voluntary.&lt;ref name=truth&gt;Sonia Gable, [http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/british-freedom-party-deregistration-the-truth-%E2%80%93-exclusive "British Freedom Party deregistration: the truth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231134443/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/british-freedom-party-deregistration-the-truth-%E2%80%93-exclusive |date=31 December 2012 }}, ''Searchlight''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/WS9hx.png|title=Extract from Register of Political Parties|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Searchlight'' speculated that Weston let the party's registration lapse because [[Jim Dowson]] of [[Britain First]] had initiated legal action against the BFP for [[defamation]] over claims made against Britain First's leadership on the BFP website.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

==Liberty GB==
{{main article|Liberty GB}}
Early on, the group was criticised as "old fascist rubbish" in an article by Sonia Gable published in ''Searchlight''.&lt;ref name="Sonia Gable"&gt;{{cite web |newspaper=[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]] |author=Sonia Gable |title=Liberty it isn't |date=12 March 2013 |url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/liberty-it-isn%E2%80%99t |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503134607/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/liberty-it-isn%E2%80%99t |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gable ranked the group alongside the [[British Democratic Party (2013)|British Democratic Party]], [[Britain First]] and the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].&lt;ref name="Sonia Gable"/&gt; Weston responded and accused his critics at ''Searchlight'' of being "a [[Communist front (epithet)|communist front operation]] disguised as an [[anti-fascist]] organisation". Weston has characterized himself as an "Islamo-realist" and is against Muslim people being able to hold [[public office]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=smaller&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2015 |title=Election 2015 smaller parties: Liberty GB |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32236889 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made a video in which he says "I am a racist".&lt;ref name=smaller/&gt; In an interview, the [[BBC]]'s [[Andrew Neil]] brought up the subject of this video and asked him, "Do you regard yourself as a racist?" Weston responded, "No I don't, no." Weston explained that he was indignant about the gang rape that [[Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal|took place in Rotherham]] [[Rochdale sex trafficking gang|and Rochdale]] and the fact that people sometimes fear being labeled racist. He then said, "If you watch the entire video, it is actually making the point that you cannot be quiet about what's going on because you're afraid of one word. It is better to speak out and be honest."&lt;ref name=smaller/&gt;

The other Liberty GB candidates in the [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] 2014 election were Enza Ferreri and [[Jack Buckby]]. In 2012, Buckby founded the "National Culturists" while at university in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/jack-buckby-is-proud-to-be-britains-next-nick-griffin "Jack Buckby is proud to be Britain's next Nick Griffin"], ''Vice''&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Buckby was a member of the BNP and received support from [[Nick Griffin]] after he and his group were prevented from advertising themselves at the freshers' fair by [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist demonstrators]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://liverpool.tab.co.uk/2012/10/01/controversial-society-meets-violent-resistance-at-freshers-fair/ "'Nazi Society' Hounded off Campus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230338/http://liverpool.tab.co.uk/2012/10/01/controversial-society-meets-violent-resistance-at-freshers-fair/ |date=3 May 2014 }}, ''Liverpool Tab''&lt;/ref&gt; Buckby was later invited to speak at the [[Alliance of European National Movements]] and introduced by Griffin.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], Weston contested [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] for Liberty GB and polled 158 votes (0.4%).&lt;ref name="BBC15"/&gt;

===Arrest===
[[File:WinGuild30Je6-4864.jpg|thumb|Steps of Winchester Guildhall on which Weston was arrested.]]
On 26 April 2014, Weston was arrested on the steps of the [[Winchester]] Guildhall for failing to comply with a dispersal notice issued under section 27 of the [[Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006]] as he was reading out a passage from [[Winston Churchill]]'s 1899 book ''[[The River War]]'' that is critical of Islam. He had been reported to the police by a member of the public after they had asked him if he had permission to give the speech and he replied that he did not. At the police station Weston was then rearrested for a racially aggravated offence under section 4 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], compounded with a [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] section 31 [[Fear or provocation of violence|racially aggravated public order offence]], and was bailed to return to Winchester Police on 24 May.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

===Aftermath of arrest===
In the days after, the story was picked up by news outlets. In ''The Telegraph'', [[Daniel Hannan]], an MEP for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]], whom Weston was running against at the time, asked: "Why should it fall to me to defend him? Where are the lion-hearted liberals who are so quick to denounce political arrests in distant dictatorships? I realise that 'political arrest' is a strong phrase, but it's hard to think of any other way to describe a candidate for public office being taken into police custody because of objections to the content of his pitch."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hannan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701051722/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100269400/britain-has-just-witnessed-a-political-arrest-where-is-the-liberal-outrage/ "Britain has just witnessed a political arrest. Where is the liberal outrage?"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner]] [[Simon Hayes (police commissioner)|Simon Hayes]] responded to the media coverage on the Hampshire Police and Crime Commission website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been wrongly suggested that Mr Weston was arrested for reciting passages written by Winston Churchill. I understand he was not welcome outside the Winchester Guildhall, the Police were called and he was asked to move on. I also understand that he was not prepared to move on and was arrested for this reason.

Members of the public are of course at liberty to debate issues of importance to them in private or public spaces. However, there must be a level of decorum and decency.

Hampshire Constabulary has an obligation to ensure action is taken if decency or safety is put at risk and, if there is any reason to suspect they have intervened unnecessary {{sic}}, this will be investigated.

As far as I am aware, this is not so in this case. With the local and European elections coming up, it is important to register that there is a great deal of politically motivated spin going on at the moment which it {{sic}} is having a significant impact on local policing – both in terms of vital frontline rescourse {{sic}} and reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Response to the Arrest of Paul Weston |author=Hampshire Police Commissioner Simon Hayes |url=http://www.hampshire-pcc.gov.uk/Your-Commissioner/Commissioners-point-of-view/Response-to-the-arrest-of-Paul-Weston.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503133051/http://www.hampshire-pcc.gov.uk/Your-Commissioner/Commissioners-point-of-view/Response-to-the-arrest-of-Paul-Weston.aspx |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''personality test''' is a method of assessing human personality constructs. Most personality assessment instruments (despite being loosely referred to as "personality tests") are in fact introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report [[questionnaire]] (Q-data) measures or reports from life records (L-data) such as rating scales.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell R.B. (1973). ''Personality and Mood by Questionnaire''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-87589-181-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Kline, P. (1977). ''The Scientific Analysis of Personality and Motivation''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to construct actual performance tests of personality have been very limited even though [[Raymond Cattell]] with his colleague Frank Warburton compiled a list of over 2000 separate objective tests that could be used in constructing objective personality tests.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Warburton, F.W. (1967). ''Objective Personality and Motivation Tests: A Theoretical Introduction and practical Compendium''. Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception however, was the Objective-Analytic Test Battery, a performance test designed to quantitatively measure 10 factor-analytically discerned personality trait dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Schuerger, J.M. (1978). ''Personality Theory in Action: Handbook for the O-A (Objective-Analytic) Test Kit''.

Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. {{ISBN|9-781412-946520}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem with both L-data and Q-data methods is that because of item transparency, rating scales and self-report questionnaires are highly susceptible to motivational and response distortion ranging all the way from lack of adequate self-insight (or biased perceptions of others) to downright dissimulation (faking good/faking bad) depending on the reason/motivation for the assessment being undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (1985). Self report measures of depression: Some psychometric considerations. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 24'', 45-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J., &amp; Helmes, E. (2009).

The first personality assessment measures were developed in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saccuzzo|first1=, Dennis P.|last2=Kaplan|first2=Robert M.|title=Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, and Issues|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495095559|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were intended to ease the process of personnel selection, particularly in the armed forces. Since these early efforts, a wide variety of personality scales and questionnaires have been developed, including the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI), the [[Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire]] (16PF), the [[Comrey Personality Scales]] (CPS), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J., Matthews, G., &amp; Saklofske, D.H.

(Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 2 - Personality Measurement and Testing''. Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. {{ISBN|9-781412-946520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although popular especially among personnel consultants, the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI) has numerous psychometric deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (1995). Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI): Some psychometric limitations. ''Australian Psychologist, 30'', 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a number of instruments based on the [[Big Five personality traits|Five Factor Model]] of personality have been constructed such as the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P.T., &amp; McCrae, R.R. (1985). ''The NEO Personality Inventory Manual''. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] and related [[Five Factor Model]] have been challenged for accounting for less than two-thirds of the known trait variance in the normal personality sphere alone.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (2008). Critique of Five-Factor Model (FFM). In G.J. Boyle, G. Matthews, &amp; D.H. Saklofske.

Estimates of how much the personality assessment industry in the US is worth range anywhere from $2 and $4 billion a year (as of 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Personality Testing at Work: Emotional Breakdown|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21575817-can-leaders-be-identified-psychometrics-emotional-breakdown|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Personality assessment is used in wide a range of contexts, including individual and [[relationship counseling]], [[clinical psychology]], [[forensic psychology]], [[school psychology]], [[career counseling]], [[employment testing]], [[occupational health and safety]] and [[customer relationship management]].

==History==
[[Image:Physiognomy.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration in a 19th-century book depicting physiognomy.]]
The origins of personality assessment date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through [[phrenology]], the measurement of bumps on the human skull, and [[physiognomy]], which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances.&lt;ref name="psychassess"/&gt; Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldberg | first1 = L.R. | year = 1993 | title = The structure of phenotypic personality traits | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 26–34 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.48.1.26 | pmid=8427480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton's list was eventually refined by [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"/&gt; Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors.&lt;ref&gt;Thurstone, L. L. (1947). ''Multiple Factor Analysis''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"/&gt; This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by [[Raymond Cattell]] (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century—based on the peer-reviewed journal literature),&lt;ref&gt;Haggbloom, S.J., Warnick, R., Warnick, J.E., Jones, V.K., Yarbrough, G.L., Russell, T.M., Borecky, C.M., McGahhey, R., Powell III, J.L., Beavers, J., &amp; Monte, E. (2002). The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century. ''Review of General Psychology, 6'', 139-152. doi: 10.1037//1089-2680.6.2.139&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the [[Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire]] (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors.&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R.B., &amp; Nichols, K.E. (1972). An improved definition, from 10 researches, of second order personality factors in Q data (with cross-cultural checks). ''Journal of Social Psychology, 86'', 187-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many introspective (ie. subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]] (NEO-PI-R)&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.R. 1993"/&gt; However, it should be noted that the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J., Stankov, L., &amp; Cattell, R.B. (1995). Measurement and statistical models in the study of personality and intelligence.  In D.H. Saklofske &amp; M. Zeidner (Eds.), ''International Handbook of Personality and Intelligence'' (pp. 417-446). New York: Plenum. {{ISBN|0-306-44749-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early personality instrument was the [[Woodworth Personal Data Sheet]], a [[self-report inventory]] developed for [[World War I]] and used for the psychiatric screening of new draftees.&lt;ref name="psychassess"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elahe Nezami|author2=James N. Butcher|editor=G. Goldstein|editor2=Michel Hersen|title=Handbook of Psychological Assessment|date=16 February 2000|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-054002-3|page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are many different types of personality assessment measures. The [[self-report inventory]] involves administration of many items requiring respondents to introspectively assess their own personality characteristics. This is highly subjective, and because of item transparency, such Q-data measures are highly susceptible to motivational and response distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (1985). Self-report measures of depression: Some psychometric considerations. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 24'', 45-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents are required to indicate their level of agreement with each item using a [[Likert scale]] or, more accurately, a Likert-type scale. An item on a personality questionnaire, for example, might ask respondents to rate the degree to which they agree with the statement "I talk to a lot of different people at parties" on a scale from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree").

Historically, the most widely used multidimensional personality instrument is the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI), a psychopathology instrument originally designed to assess archaic psychiatric [[nosology]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmes, E., &amp; Reddon, J.R. (1993). A perspective on developments in assessing psychopathology: A critical review of the MMPI and MMPI-2. ''Psychological Bulletin, 113'', 453-471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson [et al.]|first=Neil, R.|title=Psychology: the Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Person Education|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to subjective/introspective self-report inventories, there are several other methods for assessing human personality, including observational measures, ratings of others, projective tests (e.g., the [[Thematic Apperception Test|TAT]] and [[Rorschach inkblot test|Ink Blots]]), and actual objective performance tests (T-data).

== Topics ==

===Norms===
The meaning of ''personality test'' scores are difficult to interpret in a direct sense. For this reason substantial effort is made by producers of personality tests to produce norms to provide a comparative basis for interpreting a respondent's test scores. Common formats for these norms include [[percentile]] ranks, [[standard score|z scores]], [[sten scores]], and other forms of standardised scores.

===Test development===
A substantial amount of research and thinking has gone into the topic of ''personality test'' development. Development of personality tests tends to be an iterative process whereby a test is progressively refined. Test development can proceed on theoretical or statistical grounds. There are three commonly used general strategies: Inductive, Deductive, and Empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burisch|first=Matthias|title=Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits|journal=American Psychologist|date=March 1984|volume=39|issue=3|pages=214–227|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.3.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scales created today will often incorporate elements of all three methods.

Deductive assessment construction begins by selecting a domain or construct to measure.&lt;ref name="Burisch, M. 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burisch | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 214–227 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.39.3.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construct is thoroughly defined by experts and items are created which fully represent all the attributes of the construct definition.&lt;ref name="Burisch, M. 1984"/&gt; Test items are then selected or eliminated based upon which will result in the strongest internal validity for the scale. Measures created through deductive methodology are equally valid and take significantly less time to construct compared to inductive and empirical measures. The clearly defined and face valid questions that result from this process make them easy for the person taking the assessment to understand. Although subtle items can be created through the deductive process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = D. N. | year = 1971 | title = The dynamics of structured personality tests: 1971 | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 78 | issue = 3| pages = 229–248 | doi=10.1037/h0030852}}&lt;/ref&gt; these measure often are not as capable of detecting lying as other methods of personality assessment construction.&lt;ref name="Burisch, M. 1984"/&gt;

Inductive assessment construction begins with the creation of a multitude of diverse items.The items created for an inductive measure to not intended to represent any theory or construct in particular. Once the items have been created they are administered to a large group of participants. This allows researchers to analyze natural relationships among the questions and label components of the scale based upon how the questions group together. Several statistical techniques can be used to determine the constructs assessed by the measure. Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis are two of the most common data reduction techniques that allow researchers to create scales from responses on the initial items.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[Five Factor Model]] of personality was developed using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCrae|first=Robert|author2=Oliver John|title=An Introduction to the Five-Factor Model and Its Applications|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1992|volume=60|issue=2|pages=175–215|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00970.x|pmid=1635039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced statistical methods include the opportunity to discover previously unidentified or unexpected relationships between items or constructs. It also may allow for the development of subtle items that prevent test takers from knowing what is being measured and may represent the actual structure of a construct better than a pre-developed theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Greggory|author2=Sarah Fischer |author3=Suzannah Fister |title=Incremental Validity Principles in Test Construction|journal=Psychological Assessment|date=December 2003|volume=15|issue=4|pages=467–477|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.15.4.467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms include a vulnerability to finding item relationships that do not apply to a broader population, difficulty identifying what may be measured in each component because of confusing item relationships, or constructs that were not fully addressed by the originally created questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan Joseph|title=Understanding Psychological Assessment: Perspective on Individual Differences|year=2001|publisher=Springer|pages=1–15|edition=1|authorlink=Understanding Test Construction|author2=Shane Lopez |author3=Scott Sumerall |editor=William Dorfman, Michel Hersen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically derived personality assessments require statistical techniques. One of the central goals of empirical personality assessment is to create a test that validly discriminates between two distinct dimensions of personality. Empirical tests can take a great deal of time to construct. In order to ensure that the test is measuring what it is purported to measure, psychologists first collect data through self- or observer reports, ideally from a large number of participants.

=== Self- vs. observer-reports ===
A personality test can be administered directly to the person being evaluated or to an observer. In a self-report, the individual responds to personality items as they pertain to the person himself/herself. Self-reports are commonly used. In an observer-report, a person responds to the personality items as those items pertain to someone else. To produce the most accurate results, the observer needs to know the individual being evaluated. Combining the scores of a self-report and an observer report can reduce error, providing a more accurate depiction of the person being evaluated. Self- and observer-reports tend to yield similar results, supporting their validity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987583452|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=C.,|first=Ashton, Michael|isbn=9780128098455|edition=3rd|oclc=987583452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct observation reports===
Direct observation involves a second party directly observing and evaluating someone else. The second party observes how the target of the observation behaves in certain situations (e.g., how a child behaves in a schoolyard during recess). The observations can take place in a natural (e.g., a schoolyard) or artificial setting (social psychology laboratory). Direct observation can help identify job applicants (e.g., work samples&lt;ref&gt;[http://hr.ucdavis.edu/recruitment/selection/work-samples.html Human Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;) who are likely to be successful or maternal attachment in young children (e.g., [[Mary Ainsworth]]'s [[strange situation]]). The object of the method is to directly observe ''genuine'' behaviors in the target. A limitation of direct observation is that the target persons may change their behavior because they know that they are being observed.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Mazzola, J.J. (2013). Strengths and limitations of qualitative approaches to research in occupational health psychology. In R. Sinclair, M. Wang, &amp; L. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Research methods in occupational health psychology: State of the art in measurement, design, and data analysis'' (pp. 268-289). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A second limitation is that some behavioral traits are more difficult to observe (e.g., sincerity) than others (e.g., sociability). A third limitation is that direct observation is more expensive and time consuming than a number of other methods (e.g., [[self-report study|self-report]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Personality tests in the workplace ===
Personality tests can predict something about how a job applicant will act in some workplace situations.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Conscientiousness is one of the [[big five personality traits]]. A person is high in conscientiousness will ordinarily be less likely to commit crimes (e.g., stealing property) against the employer.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} People who are higher in the agreeableness trait tend to be less likely to fight or argue with other employees.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} There is a chance that an applicant may fake responses to personality test items in order to make the applicant appear more attractive to the employing organization than the individual actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Ones, D.S. (2009). Personality at work: Raising awareness and correcting misconceptions. ''Human Performance, 18'', 389-404. doi:10.1207/s15327043hup1804_5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test evaluation===
There are several criteria for evaluating a ''personality test''. For a test to be successful, users need to be sure that (a) test results are replicable and (b) the test measures what its creators purport it to measure. Fundamentally, a ''personality test'' is expected to demonstrate [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Test validity|validity]]. Reliability refers to the extent to which test scores, if a test were administered to a sample twice within a short period of time, would be similar in both administrations. Test validity refers to evidence that a test measures the [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] (e.g., neuroticism) that it is supposed to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Urbina|first1=Susana|title=Essentials of Psychological Testing|date=2014-06-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|location=Hoboken. New Jersey|isbn=978-1-118-70725-8|pages=127–128, 165–167|edition=Second|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/lib/umr-ebooks/reader.action?docID=1727717&amp;ppg=1|accessdate=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
A respondent's response is used to compute the analysis. Analysis of data is a long process. Two major theories are used here; Classical test theory (CTT)- used for the observed score,&lt;ref&gt;(see Lord and Novick, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and item response theory (IRT)- "a family of models for persons' responses to items".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman J. Adèr]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh]] (2008) ''Advising on Research Methods: a consultant's companion''. Johannes van Kessel Publ. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Hamleton and Swaminathon (1985) for a full summary of IRT&lt;/ref&gt; The two theories focus upon different 'levels' of responses and researchers are implored to use both in order to fully appreciate their results.

===Non-response===
Firstly, item non-response needs to be addressed. Non-response can either be 'unit'- where a person gave no response for any of the n items, or 'item'- i.e., individual question. Unit non-response is generally dealt with exclusion.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"&gt;(Mellenbergh, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Item non-response should be handled by imputation- the method used can vary between test and questionnaire items. Literature about the most appropriate method to use and when can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;(Ader, Mellenbergh &amp; Hand, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring===
The conventional method of scoring items is to assign '0' for an incorrect answer '1' for a correct answer. When tests have more response options (e.g. multiple choice items) '0' when incorrect, '1' for being partly correct and '2' for being correct.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"/&gt; Personality tests can also be scored using a dimensional (normative) or a typological (ipsative) approach. Dimensional approaches such as the Big 5 describe personality as a set of continuous dimensions on which individuals differ. From the item scores, an 'observed' score is computed. This is generally found by summing the un-weighted item scores.

==Criticism and controversy==

===Biased test taker interpretation===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
One problem of a personality test is that the users of the test could only find it accurate because of the subjective validation involved. Users of personality tests have to assume that the subjective responses that are given by participants on such tests, represent the actual personality of those participants. Also, one must assume that personality is a reliable, constant part of the human mind or behaviour.

===Personality versus social factors===
{{more citations needed|date=March 2015}}
In the 60s and 70s some psychologists dismissed the whole idea of personality, considering much behaviour to be context-specific.&lt;ref name="Doll1953"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRY8AAAAIAAJ|title=The measurement of social competence: a manual for the Vineland social maturity scale|last=Doll|first=Edgar Arnold|publisher=Educational Test Bureau, Educational Publishers|year=1953|doi=10.1037/11349-000}} archived at [https://archive.org/details/measurementofsoc1953doll]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was supported by the fact that personality often does not predict behaviour in specific contexts. However, more extensive research has shown that when behaviour is aggregated across contexts, that personality can be a modest to good predictor of behaviour. Almost all psychologists now acknowledge that both social and individual difference factors (i.e., personality) influence behaviour. The debate is currently more around the relative importance of each of these factors and how these factors interact.

===Respondent faking===

One problem with self-report measures of personality is that respondents are often able to distort their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arendasy|first=M. |author2=Sommer, Herle |author3=Schutzhofer, Inwanschitz|title=Modeling effects of faking on an objective personality test.|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=32|issue=4|pages=210–218|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotive tests in particular could in theory become prey to unreliable results due to people striving to pick the answer they feel the best fitting of an ideal character and therefore not their true response. This is particularly problematic in employment contexts and other contexts where important decisions are being made and there is an incentive to present oneself in a favourable manner.

Work in experimental settings&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., Viswesvaran &amp; Ones, 1999; Martin, Bowen &amp; Hunt, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; has also shown that when student samples have been asked to deliberately fake on a personality test, they clearly demonstrated that they are capable of doing so.
Hogan, Barett and Hogan (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Joyce|title=Personality Measurement, Faking, and Employment Selection|url=http://filebox.vt.edu/r/rammu/Research%20Methods%20Articles/Hogan.pdf|publisher=American Psychological Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605085027/http://filebox.vt.edu/r/rammu/Research%20Methods%20Articles/Hogan.pdf|archivedate=2013-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  analyzed data of 5,266 applicants who did a personality test based on the big five. At the first application the applicants were rejected. After six months the applicants reapplied and completed the same personality test. The answers on the personality tests were compared and there was no significant difference between the answers.

So in practice, most people do not significantly distort. Nevertheless, a researcher has to be prepared for such possibilities. Also, sometimes participants think that tests results are more valid than they really are because they like the results that they get. People want to believe that the positive traits that the test results say they possess are in fact present in their personality. This leads to distorted results of people's sentiments on the validity of such tests.

Several strategies have been adopted for reducing respondent faking. One strategy involves providing a warning on the test that methods exist for detecting faking and that detection will result in negative consequences for the respondent (e.g., not being considered for the job). Forced choice item formats ([[ipsative]] testing) have been adopted which require respondents to choose between alternatives of equal social desirability. Social desirability and lie scales are often included which detect certain patterns of responses, although these are often confounded by true variability in social desirability.

More recently, [[Item Response Theory]] approaches have been adopted with some success in identifying item response profiles that flag fakers. Other researchers are looking at the timing of responses on electronically administered tests to assess faking. While people can fake in practice they seldom do so to any significant level. To successfully fake means knowing what the ideal answer would be. Even with something as simple as assertiveness people who are unassertive and try to appear assertive often endorse the wrong items. This is because unassertive people confuse assertion with aggression, anger, oppositional behavior, etc.

===Psychological research===
Research on the importance of personality and intelligence in education shows evidence that when others provide the personality rating, rather than providing a self-rating, the outcome is nearly four times more accurate for predicting grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Other-rated personality and academic performance: Evidence and implications|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1043498 |journal = Learning and Individual Differences|date = 2014-08-01|pages = 24–32|volume = 34|doi = 10.1016/j.lindif.2014.05.013|first = Arthur E.|last = Poropat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional applications===
A study by American Management Association reveals that 39 percent of companies surveyed use personality testing as part of their hiring process. However, [[ipsative]] personality tests are often misused in recruitment and selection, where they are mistakenly treated as if they were [[Norm-referenced test|normative]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blinkhorn | first1 = S. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = C. | last3 = Wood | first3 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Spuriouser and spuriouser:The use of ipsative personality tests | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational. Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 153–162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More people are using personality testing to evaluate their business partners, their dates and their spouses. [[Sales]]people are using personality testing to better understand the needs of their customers and to gain a competitive edge in the closing of deals. [[College]] students have started to use personality testing to evaluate their roommates. [[Lawyer]]s are beginning to use personality testing for [[criminal]] behavior analysis, [[litigation]] profiling, witness examination and jury selection.

===Dangers===
{{more citations needed|date=May 2014}}
Personality tests have been around for a long time, but it wasn't until it became illegal for employers to use polygraphs that we began to see the widespread use of personality tests. The idea behind these personality tests is that employers can reduce their turnover rates and prevent economic losses in the form of people prone to thievery, drug abuse, emotional disorders or violence in the workplace.

Employers may also view personality tests as more accurate assessment of a candidate's behavioral characteristics versus an employment reference. But the problem with using personality tests as a hiring tool is the notion a person's [[job performance]] in one environment will carry over to another work environment. However, the reality is that one's environment plays a crucial role in determining job performance, and not all environments are created equally. One danger of using personality tests is the results may be skewed based on a person's mood so good candidates may potentially be screened out because of unfavorable responses that reflect that mood.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Another danger of personality tests is that they can create false-negative results (i.e. honest people being labeled as dishonest) especially in cases when stress on the applicant's part is involved. There is also the issue of privacy to be of concern forcing applicants to reveal private thoughts and feelings through his or her responses that seem to become a condition for employment. Another danger of personality tests is the illegal discrimination of certain groups under the guise of a personality test.&lt;ref name="Stabile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stabile|first=Susan J.|title=The Use of Personality Tests as a Hiring Tool: Is the Benefit Worth the Cost?|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jbl/articles/volume4/issue2/Stabile4U.Pa.J.Lab.&amp;Emp.L.279(2002).pdf|publisher=U.PA.

=== Personality tests of the five factor model ===
Different types of the [[Big Five personality traits]]:

* The NEO PI-R, or the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]], is one of the most significant measures of the Five Factor Model (FFM). The measure was created by Costa and McCrae and contains 240 items in the forms of sentences. Costa and McCrae had divided each of the five domains into six facets each, 30 facets total, and changed the way the FFM is measured.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P. T., Jr., &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1992). Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R) and NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Five-Factor Model Rating Form (FFMRF) was developed by Lynam and Widiger in 2001 as a shorter alternative to the NEO PI-R. The form consists of 30 facets, 6 facets for each of the Big Five factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynam | first1 = D. R. | last2 = Widiger | first2 = T.

(2008). ''Manual for the Five Factor Personality Inventory&amp;nbsp;— Children'' Austin, TX (PRO ED, INC).&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Semi-structured Interview for the Assessment of the Five-Factor Model (SIFFM) is the only semi-structured interview intended to measure a personality model or personality disorder. The interview assesses the five domains and 30 facets as presented by the NEO PI-R, and it additional assesses both normal and abnormal extremities of each facet.&lt;ref&gt;Trull, T.

A '''persuasive definition''' is a form of [[stipulative definition]] which purports to describe the 'true' or 'commonly accepted' meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an uncommon or altered use, usually to support an argument for some view, or to create or alter rights, duties or crimes.&lt;ref name=BDWP-per&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679517_ss1-72 |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |title=Persuasive definition  |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas |first2=Jiyuan|last2= Yu |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0679-5 |accessdate=2012-10-21}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms thus defined will often involve emotionally charged but imprecise notions, such as "freedom", "terrorism", "democracy", etc. In [[argumentation]] the use of a persuasive definition is sometimes called ''definist [[fallacy]]''. (The latter sometimes more broadly refers to a fallacy of a definition based on improper identification of two distinct properties.)&lt;ref name=BDWP-deff&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdbxabeToQYC&amp;pg=PA165|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99721-5|page=165|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |title=Definist fallacy |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas  |first2=Jiyuan|last2= Yu |accessdate=2014-10-15}}

&lt;!--- sources do not agree they are the same, some say there are several kinds of definist fallacies---&gt;

Examples of persuasive definitions (definist fallacies) include: 
* Democrat &amp;ndash; "a leftist who desires to overtax the corporations and abolish freedom in the economic sphere".&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt;
*"Let's define 'atheist' as someone who doesn't yet realize that God exists."&lt;ref name="IEP2"/&gt;

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in controversial topics such as [[politics]], [[sex]], and [[religion]], as participants in emotionally charged exchanges will sometimes become more concerned about swaying people to one side or another than expressing the unbiased facts. A persuasive definition of a term is favorable to one argument or unfavorable to the other argument, but is presented as if it were neutral and well-accepted, and the listener is expected to accept such a definition without question.&lt;ref name=BDWP-per /&gt;

The term "persuasive definition" was introduced by philosopher [[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] as part of his emotive theory of meaning.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=82}}

==Overview and example==
Language can simultaneously communicate information (informative) and feelings (expressive).{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=67, 137}} Unlike other common types of definitions in logic, persuasive definitions focus on the expressive use of language to affect the feelings of readers and listeners ultimately with an aim to change their behavior.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=137}} With this fundamentally different purpose, persuasive definitions are evaluated not on their truth or falsehood but rather on their effectiveness as a persuasive device.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}} 
Stevenson{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|}} showed how these two dimensions are combined when he investigated the terms he called "ethical" or emotive.{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}} He noted that some words, such as 'peace' or 'war', are not simply used to describe reality by modifying the cognitive response of the interlocutor. They have also the power of directing the interlocutor's attitudes and suggesting a course of action. For this reason, they evoke a different kind of reaction, emotive in nature. As Stevenson{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|p=18-19}} put it "Instead of merely describing people's interests, they change and intensify them. They recommend an interest in an object, rather than state that the interest already exists." These words have the tendency to encourage future actions, to lead the hearer towards a decision by affecting his or her system of interests.{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}} Stevenson distinguished between the use of a word (a stimulus) and its possible psychological effects on the addressee's cognitive and the emotive reactions by labeling them as "descriptive meaning" and "emotive meaning".{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=54}} Applying this distinction reveals how the redefinition of an ethical word is transformed into an instrument of persuasion, a tool for redirecting preferences and emotions:{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}}

::Ethical definitions involve a wedding of descriptive and emotive meaning, and accordingly have a frequent use in redirecting and intensifying attitudes. To choose a definition is to plead a cause, so long as the word defined is strongly emotive.

In persuasive definitions the evaluative component associated with a concept is left unaltered while the descriptive meaning is modified. In this fashion, imprisonment can become "true freedom",{{sfn|Huxley|1936|p=122}} and massacres "pacification".{{sfn|Orwell|1946|}} Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while keeping the original evaluations that the use of a word evokes. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the emotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define a word by qualifying the ''definiendum'' without setting forth what the term actually means. For instance, we can consider the following quasi-definition taken from Casanova's Fuga dai Piombi. In this example (1), the speaker, Mr. Soradaci, tries to convince his interlocutor (Casanova) that being a "sneak" is an honorable behavior:{{sfn|Casanova|1911|p=112}}

::I have always despised the prejudice that attaches to the name "spy" a hateful meaning: this name sounds bad only to the ears of who hates the Government. A sneak is just a friend of the good of the State, the plague of the crooks, the faithful servant of his Prince.

This quasi-definition employed in case 1 underscores a fundamental dimension of the "emotive" meaning of a word, namely its relationship with the shared values, which are attacked as "prejudices." This account given by the spy shows how describing the referent based on a different hierarchy of values can modify emotive meaning. The value of trust is not denied, but is placed in a hierarchy where the highest worth is given to the State.{{sfn|Walton &amp; Macagno|2015|}}&lt;p role="presentation"&gt;Stevenson provides us with two definitions of the word culture in order to illustrate what a persuasive definition can accomplish:

*The original definition: "widely read and acquainted with arts"
*The persuasive definition: "imaginative sensitivity"
Both carry with them the positive emotive meaning of culture; it is still a good thing to be cultured no matter which definition is used. What they change is what exactly it means to be called "cultured." Because being cultured is a positive trait, the society views being well read and acquainted with the arts as positive traits to have. By promoting a persuasive definition of "imaginative sensitivity" the society begins to views those qualities positively because they are attached to a word with a positive emotive meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Charles Leslie|date=1938-01-01|title=Persuasive Definitions|jstor=2250337|journal=Mind|volume=47|issue=187|pages=331–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unclear, [[figurative language]] is often used in persuasive definitions.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=154}} Although several techniques can be used to form such a definition,{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}} the [[genus–differentia definition|genus and difference]] technique is the usual one applied.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=103}} Both definitions in the taxation example above agree that the genus is a procedure relating to governance but disagree on the difference. Persuasive definitions combine elements of [[stipulative definition]]s, [[lexical definition]]s, and sometimes [[theoretical definition]]s.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}}

Persuasive definitions commonly appear in political speeches, [[editorial]]s and other situations where the power to influence is most in demand.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}} They have been dismissed as serving only to confuse readers and listeners without legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name="Kemerling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e05.htm |title=Definition and Meaning |first=Garth |last=Kemerling |date=2001-10-27 |work=Philosophy Pages |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scrutiny is often necessary to identify persuasive definitions in an argument as they are meant to appear as honest definitions.{{sfn|Hurley|2008|p=94}}{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Macagno &amp; Walton|2014|}}

'''Population fragmentation''' is a form of population segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=Michael F. |last2=McLellan |first2=Bruce N. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Strobeck |first3=Curtis |year=2002 |title=Population Fragmentation of Grizzly Bears in Southeastern British Columbia, Canada |journal=Ursus |volume=8 |issue= |pages=153–160 |doi= |jstor=3873196 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often caused by [[habitat fragmentation]]. 

==Fragmentation causes==
Fragmentation can be natural or caused by human actions. In modern times, human activity is the most common cause.
* development of land around a protected area, sometimes by just a single road or fence line
* capture or killing of species in an area that links populations
* movement of a population away from other individuals of that species, such as the natural introduction of [[wolves and moose on Isle Royale]]
* geologic processes, such as landslides or volcanoes, dividing a habitat
* rising sea levels can separate islands from what was once a common landmass
* global warming, especially when coupled with mountains, can reduce movement from one habitat to another

==Genetic effects==
Population fragmentation causes [[inbreeding depression]], which leads to a decrease in genetic variability in the species involved.&lt;ref name="ProctorMcLellan"&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=M. F. |last2=McLellan |first2=B. N. |last3=Strobeck |first3=C. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Barclay |first4=R. M. R. |year=2005 |title=Genetic analysis reveals demographic fragmentation of grizzly bears yielding vulnerably small populations |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=272 |issue=1579 |pages=2409–2416 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3246 |pmid=16243699 |pmc=1559960 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decreases the fitness of the population for several reasons. First, inbreeding forces competition with relatives, which decreases the [[evolutionary fitness]] of the species.&lt;ref name="ProctorMcLellan"/&gt; Secondly, the decrease in genetic variability causes an increased possibility a lethal homozygous recessive trait may be expressed; this decreases the average litter size reproduced, indirectly decreasing the population.&lt;ref name="KrebsCJ"&gt;{{Citation |last=Krebs |first=C. J. |year=2009 |title=Ecology: The Experimental Analysis of Distribution and Abundance |edition=6th |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-321-50743-3 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; When a population is small, the influence of genetic drift increases, which leads to less and/or random fixation of alleles. In turn, this leads to increased homozygosity, negatively affecting individual fitness. The performance of plants may be compromised by less effective selection which causes an accumulation of deleterious mutations in small populations. Since individuals in small populations are more likely to be related, they are more likely to inbreed. A reduction in fitness may occur in small plant populations because of mutation accumulation, reduced genetic diversity, and increased inbreeding. Over time, the evolutionary potential and a species’s ability to adapt to a changing environment, such as climate change, is decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Leimu, R., Vergeer, P., Angeloni, F., &amp; Ouborg, N. J. 2010. Habitat fragmentation, climate change, and inbreeding in plants. The Year in Ecology and Conservation Biology 1195:84-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privacy software''' is [[Computer software|software]] built to protect the [[privacy]] of its users. The software typically works in conjunction with [[Internet]] usage to control or limit the amount of information made available to third parties. The software can apply [[encryption]] or filtering of various kinds.

==Types of protection==

Privacy software can refer to two different types of protection.  One type is protecting a user's [[Internet privacy]] from the [[World Wide Web]]. There are software products that will mask or hide a user's [[IP address]] from the outside world in order to protect the user from [[identity theft]].  The second type of protection is hiding or deleting the users Internet traces that are left on their PC after they have been surfing the Internet.  There is software that will erase all the users Internet traces and there is software that will hide and encrypt a user's traces so that others using their PC will not know where they have been surfing.

===Whitelisting and blacklisting===

One solution to enhance privacy software is [[whitelisting]]. Whitelisting is a process in which a company identifies the software that it will allow to and does not try to recognize malware. Whitelisting permits acceptable software to run and either prevents anything else from running or lets new software run in a quarantined environment until the can verify its validity. Whereas whitelisting allows nothing to run unless it is on the whitelist, [[blacklisting]] allows everything to run unless it is on the black. A blacklist then includes certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer-to-peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices, and web sites can also be whitelisted or blacklisted.

=== Intrusion detection systems ===
{{Main|Intrusion detection system}}
Intrusion detection systems are designed to detect all types of malicious network traffic and computer usage that cannot be detected by a firewall. These systems capture all network traffic flows and examine the contents of each packet for malicious traffic.

=== Encryption ===
{{Main|Encryption software}}
[[Encryption]] is another form for privacy security. When organizations do not have secure channel for sending information, they use encryption to stop unauthorized eavesdroppers. Encryption is the process of converting an original message into a form that cannot be read by anyone except the intended receiver.

=== Steganography ===

[[Steganography]] is sometimes used to hide messages from eavesdropping and e-surveillance.

== Privacy vs anonymity ==

Privacy is different from [[anonymity]] in its applicability and usage. Anonymity is subordinate to privacy and might be desired for the exchange, retrieval or publication of specific information.

== Legal issues of use ==
Uses of privacy software are not free from legal issues. For instance, there are regulations for [[export of cryptography from the United States]]. Similarly, [[key disclosure law]] also requires individuals to surrender cryptographic keys to law enforcement agencies. Encryption laws in India also carry many legal restrictions in diverse situations.&lt;ref name="http://perry4law.co.in/blog/?p=67"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://perry4law.co.in/blog/?p=67|title= Encryption Laws In India|work= Cyber Law, Cyber Security, Telecom Laws And Telecom Security Legal Due Diligence And Statutory Compliance Services In India |date=4 June 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks are also in pipeline to include cyber security technologies, like encryption related software, under the Wassenaar Arrangement thereby making its export more cumbersome.&lt;ref name="http://perry4law.co.in/cyber_security/?p=61"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://perry4law.co.in/cyber_security/?p=61|title= India Opposes Proposal To Include Cyber Security Technologies Under The Wassenaar Arrangement|work= International Legal Issues Of Cyber Attacks, Cyber Terrorism, Cyber Espionage, Cyber Warfare And Cyber Crimes|date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''pyeong'''''&lt;!--foreign text in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; (abbreviation{{nbsp}}'''py''') is a [[Korean unit]] of [[area (mathematics)|area]] and [[floorspace]], equal to a square ''[[kan (unit)|kan]]'' or 36{{nbsp}}square [[Korean feet]]. The '''''ping''''' and '''''tsubo''''' are its equivalent [[Chinese units|Chinese]] and [[Japanese unit]]s, similarly based on a square ''[[bu (unit)|bu]]'' ([[:ja:歩 (尺貫法)|ja:步]]) or ''[[ken (unit)|ken]]'', equivalent to 36{{nbsp}}square [[Chinese feet|Chinese]] or [[Japanese feet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samo15.netian.com/unit.html|title=Unit conversion chart|date=28 December 2005|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228140325/http://samo15.netian.com/unit.html|archivedate=28 December 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=40441500|title=ko:'평' : 네이버 국어사전|website=Krdic.naver.com|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Pyeong''==
In Korea, the period of [[Japanese occupation of Korea|Japanese occupation]] produced a ''pyeong'' of {{sfrac|400|121}} or 3.3058{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is the standard traditional measure for [[real estate]] [[floorspace]], with an average [[house]] reckoned as about 25{{nbsp}}''pyeong'', a [[studio apartment]] as 8–12{{nbsp}}py, and a [[garret]] as 1½{{nbsp}}py. In [[South Korea]], the unit has been officially banned since 1961 but with little effect prior to the criminalization of its commercial use effective 1 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Gov't to Crack Down on Those Referring to Land as 'Pyeong' |contribution-url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/217817.html |date=23 June 2007 |title=The Hankyoreh |location=Seoul |publisher=Hankyoreh Media }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Informal use continues, however, including in the form of real estate use of unusual fractions of meters equivalent to unit amounts of ''pyeong''.

==''Ping''==
In Taiwan, the [[Taiwanese units of measurement|Taiwanese]] ''ping'' remains in fairly common use and is about 3.306{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In [[mainland China]], the metrification of traditional units would produce a ''ping'' of 4{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but it is almost unknown with most [[real estate]] [[floorspace]] simply reckoned in square meters. The longer length of the [[Hong Kong]] [[Chek (unit)|foot]] produces a larger ''ping'' of almost 5{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but it is similarly uncommon.

==''Tsubo''==
In Japan, the usual measure of real estate floorspace is the ''[[tatami (unit)|tatami]]'' and the ''tsubo'' is reckoned as two ''tatami''. The ''tatami'' varies by region but the modern standard is usually taken to be the [[Nagoya]] ''tatami'' of about 1.653{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, producing a ''tsubo'' of 3.306{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is sometimes reckoned as comprising 10{{nbsp}}[[gō (unit)|gō]].

'''Redress''', or '''The Redress Trust''' is a human rights organisation based in [[London]], England, that helps survivors of [[torture]] to obtain justice and reparation, in the form of compensation, rehabilitation, official acknowledgement of the wrong and formal apologies. In addition Redress seek accountability for those who have been tortured.

==Services==
Redress provides legal and related support in obtaining legal reparations, promote survivors' rights in international and regional courts and tribunals and promotes survivors’ rights in national policy and practice contexts in the [[United Kingdom]].

In 2008 Redress was addressing torture and related crimes in more than 50 countries in all regions or the world and having over 50 active case files relating to more than 957 survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redress.org/downloads/annual-reports/AR%202011%20for%20the%20web.pdf|title=2011 Annual Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Redress was founded in 1992 by Keith Carmichael, a British torture survivor who sought justice for how he had been treated while a prisoner in [[Saudi Arabia]] from November 1981 until March 1984. After his release, Carmichael found that while the existing [[non-governmental organization]]s advocated for the release of prisoners, provided medical attention, and operated safe havens, none existed to seek [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] under international law. Redress was founded to fill that gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redress.org/about/who-we-are|title=About REDRESS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
* To provide direct support to torture survivors to obtain justice and redress.
* To obtain justice for survivors in post-conflict contexts.
* To promote survivors' rights in international and regional courts and tribunals.
* To ensure survivors' rights in national policy and practice.

Redress pursues its mission through legal assistance and advice to torture survivors, their families and communities, sharing information and support in partnership with other organizations around the world and advocacy by providing information to governments, other organizations and the media.

==Supporters==
Redress is supported by the [[United Nations]], the [[European Commission]], [[Oxfam]], the [[Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust]], UK Department for International Development [[DFID]], Bromley Trust, [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], Oak Foundation, City Parochial Foundation.

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''retraction''' is a [[continuous mapping]] from a [[topological space]] into a subspace which preserves the position of all points in that subspace.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; A '''deformation retraction''' is a mapping which captures the idea of ''continuously shrinking'' a space into a subspace.

An '''absolute neighborhood retract''' ('''ANR''') is a particularly [[well-behaved]] type of topological space. For example, every [[topological manifold]] is an ANR. Every ANR has the [[homotopy type]] of a very simple topological space, a [[CW complex]].

== Definitions ==

=== Retract ===
Let ''X'' be a topological space and ''A'' a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. Then a continuous map
:&lt;math&gt;r\colon X \to A&lt;/math&gt;

is a '''retraction''' if the [[function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] of ''r'' to ''A'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''A''; that is, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r(a) = a&lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'' in ''A''. Equivalently, denoting by

:&lt;math&gt;\iota\colon A \hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Inclusion map|inclusion]], a retraction is a continuous map ''r'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;r \circ \iota = \operatorname{id}_A,&lt;/math&gt;
that is, the composition of ''r'' with the inclusion is the identity of ''A''. Note that, by definition, a retraction maps ''X'' [[onto]] ''A''. A subspace ''A'' is called a '''retract''' of ''X'' if such a retraction exists. For instance, any non-empty space retracts to a point in the obvious way (the constant map yields a retraction). If ''X'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then ''A'' must be a [[closed subset]] of ''X''.

If &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt; is a retraction, then the composition ι∘''r'' is an [[idempotent]] continuous map from ''X'' to ''X''. Conversely, given any idempotent continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;s: X \to X,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain a retraction onto the image of ''s'' by restricting the [[codomain]].

=== Deformation retract and strong deformation retract===
A continuous map
:&lt;math&gt;F\colon X \times [0, 1] \to X &lt;/math&gt;
is a ''deformation retraction'' of a space ''X'' onto a subspace ''A'' if, for every ''x'' in ''X'' and ''a'' in ''A'',
:&lt;math&gt; F(x,0) = x, \; F(x,1) \in A ,\quad \mbox{and} \quad F(a,1) = a.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, a deformation retraction is a [[homotopy]] between a retraction and the identity map on ''X''. The subspace ''A'' is called a '''deformation retract''' of ''X''. A deformation retraction is a special case of a [[homotopy equivalence]].

A retract need not be a deformation retract. For instance, having a single point as a deformation retract of a space ''X'' would imply that ''X'' is [[path connected]] (and in fact that ''X'' is [[contractible space|contractible]]).

''Note:'' An equivalent definition of deformation retraction is the following. A continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Deformation theory|deformation]] retraction if it is a retraction and its composition with the inclusion is homotopic to the identity map on ''X''. In this formulation, a deformation retraction carries with it a homotopy between the identity map on ''X'' and itself.

If, in the definition of a deformation retraction, we add the requirement that
:&lt;math&gt;F(a,t) = a&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''t'' in [0, 1] and ''a'' in ''A'', then ''F'' is called a '''strong deformation retraction'''. In other words, a strong deformation retraction leaves points in ''A'' fixed throughout the homotopy. (Some authors, such as [[Allen Hatcher|Hatcher]], take this as the definition of deformation retraction.)

As an example, the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;S^{n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is a strong deformation retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{n+1} \backslash \{0\};&lt;/math&gt; as strong deformation retraction one can choose the map 

:&lt;math&gt;F(x,t)=\left((1-t)+{t\over \|x\|}\right) x.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cofibration and neighborhood deformation retract===
A map ''f'': ''A'' → ''X'' of topological spaces is a ([[Witold Hurewicz|Hurewicz]]) '''[[cofibration]]''' if it has the [[homotopy extension property]] for maps to any space. This is one of the central concepts of [[homotopy theory]]. A cofibration ''f'' is always injective, in fact a [[homeomorphism]] to its image.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher (2002), Proposition 4H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is Hausdorff (or a [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weak Hausdorff space]]), then the image of a cofibration ''f'' is closed in ''X''.

Among all closed inclusions, cofibrations can be characterized as follows. The inclusion of a closed subspace ''A'' in a space ''X'' is a cofibration if and only if ''A'' is a '''neighborhood deformation retract''' of ''X'', meaning that there is a continuous map &lt;math&gt;u: X \rightarrow I&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I = [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A = u^{-1}\!\left(0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and a homotopy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H: X \times I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H\left(x,0\right) = x \quad \forall x \in X,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;H\left(a,t\right) = a \quad \forall (a,t) \in A \times I,&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h\left(x,1\right) \in A \; \text{if} \; u(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Puppe (1967), Satz 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the inclusion of a subcomplex in a CW complex is a cofibration.

==Properties==
* One basic property of a retract ''A'' of ''X'' (with retraction &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt;) is that every continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f: A \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; has at least one extension &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g: X \rightarrow Y,&lt;/math&gt; namely &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g = f \circ r&lt;/math&gt;.
* Deformation retraction is a particular case of homotopy equivalence. In fact, two spaces are homotopy equivalent [[if and only if]] they are both deformation retracts of a single larger space.
* Any topological space which deformation retracts to a point is contractible and vice versa. However, there exist contractible spaces which do not strongly deformation retract to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher (2002), Exercise 0.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==No-retraction theorem==
The [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the [[N-ball|''n''-dimensional ball]], that is, the (''n''−1)-sphere, is not a retract of the ball. (See {{Section link|Brouwer fixed-point theorem|A proof using homology}}.)

==Absolute neighborhood retract (ANR)==
A closed subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''neighborhood retract''' of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a retract of some open subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of topological spaces, closed under homeomorphisms and passage to closed subsets. Following [[Karol Borsuk|Borsuk]] (starting in 1931), a space ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is called an '''absolute retract''' for the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{AR} \left(\mathcal{C}\right),&lt;/math&gt; if ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and whenever ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is a closed subset of a space  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. A space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''absolute neighborhood retract''' for the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{ANR} \left(\mathcal{C}\right),&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and whenever &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset of a space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

Various classes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such as [[normal space]]s have been considered in this definition, but the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; of [[metrizable space]]s has been found to give the most satisfactory theory. For that reason, the notations AR and ANR by themselves are used in this article to mean &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {AR} \left({\mathcal {M}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {ANR} \left({\mathcal {M}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mardešiċ (1999), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

A metrizable space is an AR if and only if it is contractible and an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Proposition II.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; By [[James Dugundji|Dugundji]], every locally convex metrizable [[topological vector space]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an AR; more generally, every nonempty [[convex set|convex subset]] of such a vector space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an AR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Corollary II.14.2 and Theorem II.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, any [[normed vector space]] ([[complete metric space|complete]] or not) is an AR. More concretely, Euclidean space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{n},&lt;/math&gt; the [[unit cube]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I^{n},&lt;/math&gt;and the [[Hilbert cube]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; are ARs.

ANRs form a remarkable class of "[[Well behaved|well-behaved]]" topological spaces. Among their properties are:
*Every open subset of an ANR is an ANR. 
*By [[Olof Hanner|Hanner]], a metrizable space that has an [[open cover]] by ANRs is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem III.8.1.&lt;/ref&gt; (That is, being an ANR is a '''[[local property]]''' for metrizable spaces.) It follows that every topological manifold is an ANR. For example, the sphere ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;S^{n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is an ANR but not an AR (because it is not contractible). In infinite dimensions, Hanner's theorem implies that every Hilbert cube manifold as well as the (rather different, for example not [[locally compact space|locally compact]]) [[Hilbert manifold]]s and [[Banach manifold]]s are ANRs.
*Every locally finite [[CW complex]] is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Mardešiċ (1999), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; An arbitrary CW complex need not be metrizable, but every CW complex has the homotopy type of an ANR (which is metrizable, by definition).&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch &amp; Piccinini (1990), Theorem 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every ANR ''X'' is '''[[locally contractible]]''' in the sense that for every open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that the inclusion &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V \hookrightarrow U&lt;/math&gt; is homotopic to a [[constant map]]. A [[covering dimension|finite-dimensional]] metrizable space is an ANR if and only if it is locally contractible in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem V.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Cantor set]] is a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the real line that is not an ANR, since it is not even [[locally connected]].
*Counterexamples: Borsuk found a compact subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{3}&lt;/math&gt; that is an ANR but not strictly locally contractible.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1967), section IV.4.&lt;/ref&gt; (A space is '''strictly locally contractible''' if every open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of each point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contains a contractible open neighborhood of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.) Borsuk also found a compact subset of the Hilbert cube that is locally contractible (as defined above) but not an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1967), Theorem V.11.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every ANR has the homotopy type of a CW complex, by [[J. H. C. Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[John Milnor|Milnor]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch &amp; Piccinini (1990), Theorem 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a locally compact ANR has the homotopy type of a locally finite CW complex; and, by West, a compact ANR has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex.&lt;ref&gt;West (2004), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, ANRs avoid all the homotopy-theoretic pathologies of arbitrary topological spaces. For example, the [[Whitehead theorem]] holds for ANRs: a map of ANRs that induces an isomorphism on [[homotopy group]]s (for all choices of base point) is a homotopy equivalence. Since ANRs include topological manifolds, Hilbert cube manifolds, Banach manifolds, and so on, these results apply to a large class of spaces.
*Many mapping spaces are ANRs. In particular, let ''Y'' be an ANR with a closed subspace ''A'' that is an ANR, and let ''X'' be any compact metrizable space with a closed subspace ''B''. Then the space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(Y, A\right)^{\left(X, B\right)}&lt;/math&gt; of maps of [[topological pair|pairs]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(X, B\right) \rightarrow \left(Y, A\right)&lt;/math&gt; (with the [[compact-open topology]] on the [[Function space|mapping space]]) is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem VII.3.1 and Remark VII.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows, for example, that the [[loop space]] of any CW complex has the homotopy type of a CW complex.
*By Cauty, a metrizable space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an ANR if and only if every open subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has the homotopy type of a CW complex.&lt;ref&gt;Cauty (1994), Fund. Math. 144: 11–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*By Cauty, there is a [[topological vector space#Topological structure|metric linear space]] ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;'' (meaning a topological vector space with a [[Translation invariant|translation-invariant]] metric) that is not an AR. One can take &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be [[separable space|separable]] and an [[F-space]] (that is, a complete metric linear space).&lt;ref&gt;Cauty (1994), Fund. Math. 146: 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt; (By Dugundji's theorem above, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; cannot be locally convex.) Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is contractible and not an AR, it is also not an ANR. By Cauty's theorem above, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; has an open subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that is not homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Thus there is a metrizable space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that is strictly locally contractible but is not homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. It is not known whether a compact (or locally compact) metrizable space that is strictly locally contractible must be an ANR.

Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; self-categorization theory assumes that the self can be categorized at various levels of abstraction. In other words, humans may categorize the self as a singular “I”(personal identity), or as a more inclusive “we”(social identity). In the latter case the self is cognitively grouped as identical and interchangeable to other stimuli within that category.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt; It is argued that it is this variation in self categorization that underpins many intergroup phenomenon,&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; including those described in social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;

To demonstrate the notion of varying [[Principle of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] and inclusiveness, three types of self category are often given as examples.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; The lowest level of abstraction is given as a personal self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “I”. A higher level of abstraction corresponds to a social self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “we” in comparison to a salient outgroup (them). A highest level of abstraction is represented by ''we humans'', where the salient outgroup is animals or other non-humans. A common misconception is that these three example categories represent ''the'' self categories that humans use. Instead, the theory posits that there are innumerable self categories that a perceiver may use (see, [[Self-categorization theory#Online category formation|online category formation]]), and in particular that there are a myriad of different personal and social identities that a perceiver may invoke in his or her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Onorato (1998)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds &amp; Turner (2006)."/&gt; The misconception may also be attributable to the early writing of Turner where a singular social identity was contrasted against a singular personal identity.&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Turner| first1=J.C.| editor-last  =Tajfel| editor-first =H.| year=1982| title=Toward a cognitive redefinition of the social group| journal=Social Identity and Intergroup Relations| pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however predates the formal statement of self-categorization theory.

====Accentuation====
In self-categorization theory, categorizing people does not simply involve the redescription of characteristics and categories present in social stimuli. Rather, salient ''social categories'' form the basis of a social world that is enriched with meaning. This is achieved through a non-conscious process of accentuation, where ''differences between'' social categories are accentuated along with the ''similarities within''  social categories.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Turner | first3 = J.

The accentuation component of self-categorization theory stems from prior research that demonstrated an [[accentuation effect]] for categorized non-social stimuli.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"/&gt; A prototypical example of non-social accentuation came from Tajfel and Wilkes, who found that when a categorization scheme corresponded to line length participants would view lines belonging to different categories as more different than if no categorization scheme was present.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Wilkes (1963)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tajfel|first1=H.|last2=Wilkes|first2=A. L.|title=Classification and quantitative judgement|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=1963|volume=54|issue=2|pages=101–114|pmid=13980241|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1963.tb00865.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the idea that an efficient cognitive system would, where possible, use the same systems regardless of the social or non-social nature of the stimuli,&lt;ref name="Van rooy et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Rooy | first1 = D. | last2 = Van Overwalle | first2 = F. | last3 = Vanhoomissen | first3 = T. | last4 = Labiouse | first4 = C. | last5 = French | first5 = R. | year = 2003 | title = A recurrent connectionist model of group biases | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 536–563 | pmid = 12885114 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.110.3.536| citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.3496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; self-categorization theorists have demonstrated similar effects for social stimuli. For example, Haslam and Turner found that a perceiver would describe another person as more or less similar to themselves as a function of the likely categorization scheme.&lt;ref name="Haslam &amp; Turner (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = Alex | last2 = Turner | first2 = John | year = 1992 | title = Context-dependent variation in social stereotyping 2: The relationship between frame of reference, self-categorization and accentuation. | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 251–277 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420220305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depersonalization and self-stereotyping ===
According to self-categorization theory, depersonalization describes a process of [[Self-Stereotyping|self-stereotyping]]. This is where, under conditions of social category [[Self-categorization theory#Determinants of categorization|salience]] and consequent accentuation, “people come to see themselves more as the interchangeable exemplars of a social category than as unique personalities defined by their differences from others”.&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt; Under these conditions a perceiver directly bases their behaviour and beliefs on the [[norm (social)|norms]], goals and needs of a salient ingroup.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, R. J. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1981)."&gt;Brown, R. J. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1981). Interpersonal and intergroup behaviour. In J. C. Turner &amp; H. Giles (Eds.), Intergroup Behaviour (pp. 33-65). Oxford: Blackwell..&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person's salient self-category becomes 'army officer' then that person is more likely to act in terms of the norms associated with that category (e.g. to wear a uniform, follow orders, and distrust an enemy) and less likely to act in terms of other potential self-categories.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; Here the person can be said to be accentuating the similarities between his or herself and other members of the 'army officers' category.

Turner and colleagues stress that depersonalization is not a loss of self, but rather a ''redefinition'' of the self in terms of group membership.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; A depersonalized self, or a social identity, is every bit as valid and meaningful as a personalized self, or personal identity.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt; A loss of self is sometimes referred to using the alternative term [[deindividuation]]. Further, although the term [[depersonalization]] has been used in [[clinical psychology]] to describe a type of disordered experience, this is completely different from depersonalization in the sense intended by self-categorization theory authors.

The concept of depersonalization is critical to a range of group phenomena including social influence, social [[Stereotype|stereotyping]], in-group [[cohesiveness]], [[ethnocentrism]], intragroup [[cooperation]], [[altruism]], emotional [[empathy]], and the emergence of [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

===Determinants of categorization===
In self-categorization theory the formation and use of a social category in a certain context is predicted by an interaction between [[Self-categorization theory#Perceiver readiness|perceiver readiness]] and category-stimulus  fit. The latter being broken down into [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative fit]] and [[Self-categorization theory#Normative fit|normative fit]].&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voci|first=Alberto|title=Relevance of social categories, depersonalization and group processes: two field tests of self-categorization theory|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=36|issue=1|pages=73–90|doi=10.1002/ejsp.259}}&lt;/ref&gt; This predictive interaction was heavily influenced by [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner’s]] accessibility and fit formula.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruner (1957)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruner | first1 = J. S. | year = 1957 | title = On perceptual readiness | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 123–152 | pmid = 13420288 | doi=10.1037/h0043805}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social category that is currently in use is called a ''salient'' social category, and in the case of a self category is called a ''salient social identity''.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt; The latter should not be confused with ''level of identification'', which is a component of perceiver readiness.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C. (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGarty | first1 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Social Identity Theory does not maintain that identification produces bias, and Self-categorization Theory does not maintain that salience is identification: Two comments on Mummendey, Klink and Brown | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 173–176 | pmid = 11446223 | doi=10.1348/014466601164777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perceiver readiness====
Perceiver readiness, which Turner first described as ''relative accessibility'',&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; “reflects a person’s past experiences, present expectations, and current motives, values, goals and needs”.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; It is the relevant aspects of cognition that the perceiver brings to the environment. For example, a perceiver who categorizes frequently on the basis of nationality (e.g., “we [[Americans]]”) is, due to that past experience, more likely to formulate a similar self category under new conditions. Accordingly, ''social identification'', or the degree to which the group is valued and self-involving, may be  thought of as an important factor that affects a person’s readiness to use a particular social category.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;

====Comparative fit====
[[File:SCT comparative context.JPG|thumb|right|300px|alt= Variation in self-categorization as a function of comparative context.| Figure 2. Variation in self-categorization as a function of comparative context. In Context 1 Amy and Beth self-categorize in terms of lower-level personal identities that accentuate their differences from each other. However, in Context 2 the comparative is extended to include more different others (here men), and Amy and Beth are now more likely to define themselves in terms of a higher-level social identity. They hence appear more similar to each other. The main theoretical point here is that as comparative context is extended, people tend to self-categorize at a more inclusive, higher level of abstraction.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;]]Comparative fit is determined by the meta-contrast principle—which states that people are more likely to believe that a collection of stimuli represents an entity to the degree that the differences between those stimuli are less than the differences between that collection of stimuli and other stimuli.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; For predicting whether a group will categorize an individual as an ingroup or outgroup member, the meta-contrast principle may be defined as the ratio of the average similarity of the individual to outgroup members over the average similarity of the individual to ingroup members. The meta-contrast ratio is dependent on the context, or frame of reference, in which the categorization process is occurring.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1999)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1999). Current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, &amp; B. Doosje (Eds), Social identity: Context, commitment, content (pp. 6-34) Oxford, UK. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the ratio is a comparison based on whichever stimuli are cognitively present. For example, if the frame of reference is reduced such that potential outgroup members are no longer cognitively present, ingroup members regard the individual as less similar to the group and are less likely to categorize that individual as belonging to that group.

====Normative fit====
Normative fit is the extent that the perceived behaviour or attributes of an individual or collection of individuals conforms to the perceiver’s knowledge-based expectations.&lt;ref name="Oakes, et al. (1994)"&gt;Oakes, P. J., Haslam, S. A. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1994). Stereotyping as social reality. Oxford, UK and Cambridge, MA:  Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, normative fit is evaluated with reference to the ''perceiver readiness'' component of the categorisation process.&lt;ref name="Brown, P. M. &amp; Turner, J. C. (2002)."&gt;Brown, P. M. &amp; Turner, J. C. (2002). The role of theories in the formation of stereotype content. In C. McGarty, V. Y. Yzerbyt &amp; R. Spears (Eds), Stereotypes as explanations: The formation of meaningful beliefs about social groups. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the role of normative fit in categorization, although a collection of individuals may be categorized as an entity on the basis of ''comparative fit'', they are only labelled using the specific social category of “science students” if perceived as hard working. That is, they fit the normative content of that category.

===Online category formation===
Self-categorization theorists posit “self-categorization is comparative, inherently variable, fluid and context dependent.”&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; They reject the notion that self concepts are stored invariant structures that exist ready for application.&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Turner (1990)"/&gt; Where stability is observed in self perception this is not attributed to stored stable categories, but rather to stability in both the perceiver and the social context in which the perceiver is situated.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."&gt;McGarty, C. (1999). Categorization in social psychology. Sage Publications: London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; This variability is systematic and occurs in response to the changing context in which the perceiver is situated. As an example, the category of [[psychologists]] can be perceived quite differently if compared to [[physicists]] as opposed to [[artists]] (with variation perhaps on how [[Scientific method|scientific]] psychologists are perceived to be).&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; In self-categorization theory contextual changes to the salient social category are sometimes referred to as shifting [[Self-categorization theory#Prototypicality|prototypicality]].

Although the theory accepts that prior categorization behaviour impacts present perception (i.e., as part of perceiver readiness), self-categorization theory has key advantages over descriptions of social categorization where categories are rigid and invariant cognitive structures that are stored in comparative isolation prior to application. One advantage is that this perspective removes the [[implausibility]] of storing enough categorical information to account for all the nuanced categorization that humans use daily.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Onorato (1998)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; Another advantage is that it brings social cognition in line with a [[Connectionism|connectionist approach]] to cognition.&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"/&gt; The connectionist approach is a neurologically plausible model of cognition where semantic units are not stored, but rather semantic information forms as a consequence of network pattern activation (both current and prior).&lt;ref name="Smith, E. R. (1996)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = E. R. | year = 1996 | title = What do connectionism and social psychology offer each other? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5| pages = 893–912 | pmid = 8656338 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith, E.

===Prototypicality===
In social psychology a category [[prototype]] may be thought of as a “representative exemplar” of a category.&lt;ref name="Billig, M. (1987)"&gt;Billig, M. (1987). Arguing and thinking: A rhetorical approach to social psychology: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-categorization theory predicts that what is prototypical of a category is contingent on the context in which the category is encountered.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; More specifically, when the [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative context]] changes (i.e., the psychologically available stimuli change) this has implications for how the self category is perceived and the nature of subsequent [[Self-categorization theory#Depersonalization and self-stereotyping|depersonalization]].  Self-categorization theory predicts that individuals adopt the features of a salient self category (self-stereotyping), and the content of the category they adopt depends on the present comparative context.

An individual’s degree of prototypicality also varies in relation to changes in the comparative context, and self-categorization theory expects this to have direct implications for interpersonal phenomenon. Specifically, prototypicality plays an important role in the social identity approach to [[Social identity approach#Leadership|leadership]],&lt;ref name="Platow, M. J. et al. (1997)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Platow | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Hoar | first2 = S. | last3 = Reid | first3 = S. Harley | last4 = Morrison | first4 = D. | last5 = Morrison | first5 = Dianne | year = 1997 | title = Endorsement of distributively fair and unfair leaders in interpersonal and intergroup situations | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 465–494 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199707)27:4&lt;465::aid-ejsp817&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; influence, and [[interpersonal attraction]]. For example, on interpersonal attraction, self-categorization theory states that "self and others are evaluated positively to the degree that they are perceived as prototypical (representative, exemplary, etc.) of the next more inclusive (positively valued) self-category of which they are being compared".&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

Levels of individual prototypicality may be gauged using the meta-contrast principle, and indeed it is this purpose the meta-contrast ratio is more often used for.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; Furthermore, although prototypicality is most often discussed in relation to the perception of individuals within a group, groups may also be assessed in terms of how prototypical they are of a superordinate category.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, M. (2012). Group status is related to group prototypicality in the absence of social identity concerns. ''Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 386–389. doi: 10.1080/00224545.2011.614648''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.2011.614648 [View&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social influence===
{{main|social influence}}

Self-categorization theory provides an account of social influence.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This account is sometimes referred to as the theory of ''referent informational influence''.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt; According to self-categorization theory, as social identities become salient, and depersonalization and self-stereotyping occurs, people adopt the norms, beliefs, and behaviors of fellow ingroup members. They also distance themselves from the norms, beliefs, and behaviors of comparison outgroup members. When someone observes a difference between themselves and a fellow ingroup member that person will experience subjective uncertainty. That uncertainty can be resolved by either a) recategorizing people or the situation to reflect those perceived differences, or b) engaging in a social influence process whereby one person makes changes to become more similar to the other. Which person adopts the views or behaviors of the other (i.e. who influences who) is predicted to be that person who is most prototypical of the ingroup. In other words, the person who exemplifies the norms, values, and behaviors of the ingroup the most. The self-categorization theory account of social influence has received a large amount of empirical support.&lt;ref name="McGarty &amp; Turner (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = McGarty|first1 = C.|last2=Turner|first2=J.

Self-categorization theory’s account of social influence differs from other social psychological approaches to social influence. It rejects the traditional distinction between [[informational influence]] and [[normative influence]],&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J.

A. | year = 1997  | title = The socially structured mind | journal = The Message of Social Psychology | pages = 355–373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where informational influence involves the assessment of social information based on its merit and normative influence involves public compliance to the expectations of group members. For self-categorization theory social information does not have merit independent of self-categorization. Instead, information is perceived as valid to the extent that it is perceived to be a normative belief of the ingroup. Normative influence, on the other hand, is not normative at all. Rather, it is counter-normative influence based compliance to expectations of psychological outgroup members. In a similar vein self-categorization theory also challenges the distinction between objective reality testing and social reality testing (e.g. the [[elaboration likelihood model]]).&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J.

J.|title=Asking the accuracy question: is measurement the answer?|journal=The Social Psychology of Stereotyping and Group Life|year=1997|pages=119–143|editor1-first=R.|editor1-last=Spears|editor2-first=P.J.|editor2-last=Oakes|editor3-first=N.|editor3-last=Ellemers|editor4-first=S.A.|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Haslam}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that there is no such thing as objective reality testing isolated from social reality testing. Sensory data is always interpreted with respect of the beliefs and ideas of the perceiver, which in turn are bound up in the psychological group memberships of that perceiver.

===Out-group homogeneity===
{{main|Out-group homogeneity}}

Outgroup homogeneity can be defined as seeing the outgroup members as more homogeneous than ingroup members.&lt;ref name="Quattrone &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quattrone|first1=George A.|last2=Jones|first2=Edward E.|title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=1|year=1980|pages=141–152|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-categorization accounts for the outgroup homogeneity effect as a function of perceiver motivation and the resultant [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative context]],&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; which is a description of the psychologically available stimuli at any one time. The theory argues that when perceiving an outgroup the psychologically available stimuli include both ingroup and outgroup members. Under these conditions the perceiver is more likely to categorize in accordance with ingroup and outgroup memberships and is consequently naturally motivated to [[Self-categorization theory#Accentuation|accentuate]] intergroup differences as well as intragroup similarities. Conversely, when perceiving an ingroup the outgroup members may not be psychologically available. In such circumstances there is no ingroup-outgroup categorization and thus no accentuation. Indeed, accentuation of intragroup differences may occur under these circumstances for the same sense making reasons.

In line with this explanation it has been shown that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup is perceived as more homogeneous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup is perceived as comparatively [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]].&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1995)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Haslam, et al. (1996)."&gt;Halsam, S. A., Oakes, P. J., Turner, J. C., &amp; McGarty, C. (1995). Social identity, self-categorization and the perceived homogeneity of ingroups and outgroups: the interaction between social motivation and cognition. In R. M. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), Handbook of Motivation and Cognition (Vol. 3, pp. 182-222). New York: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; This is also congruent with depersonalization, where under certain circumstances perceivers may see themselves as interchangeable members of the ingroup.&lt;ref name="De Cremer 138–146"&gt;{{cite journal| last=De Cremer| first=David| title= Perceptions of group homogeneity as a function of social comparison: The mediating role of group identity| journal=Current Psychology| date=1 August 2001| volume=20| issue=2| pages=138–146| doi=10.1007/s12144-001-1021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-categorization theory eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the [[minimal group paradigm]].&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Meta-theoretical debate===
The social identity approach explicitly rejects the metatheory of research that regards limited information processing as the cause of social stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal |last= McGarty|first= C. |year= 2002|title= Stereotype formation as category formation |journal= Stereotypes as Explanations |pages= 16–37 |editor1-first= C.|editor1-last= McGarty |editor2-first= V.Y. |editor2-last= Yzerbyt |editor3-first= R. |editor3-last= Spears }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Turner (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oakes | first1 = Penny | last2 = Turner | first2 = John | editor-last = Stroebe | editor-first = Wolfgang | editor-link1= Wolfgang Stroebe|editor2-last = Hewstone | editor2-first = Miles | year = 1990 | title = Is limited information processing capacity the cause of social stereotyping? | journal = European Review of Social Psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 111–135 | doi=10.1080/14792779108401859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, where other researchers adopt the position that stereotyping is second best to other information processing techniques (e.g.,  individuation), social identity theorists argue that in many contexts a stereotypical perspective is entirely appropriate. Moreover, it is argued that in many intergroup contexts to take an individualistic view would be decidedly maladaptive and demonstrate ignorance of important social realities.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam &amp; Turner (1992)."/&gt;

===Category hierarchies===
Self-categorization theory emphasises the role of category hierarchies in social perception.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; That is, much like a biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], social groups at lower [[Self-categorization theory#Levels of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] are subsumed within social groups at higher levels of abstraction. A useful example comes from the world of [[team sport]]s, where a particular social group such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] [[Fan (person)|fans]] may be an ingroup for a perceiver who may compare with a relevant outgroup (e.g., [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans). However, at a higher level of abstraction, both social groups may be subsumed into the singular category of [[Association football|football]] fans. This is known as a superordinate category, and in this context those Liverpool fans once considered outgroup members are now considered fellow ingroup members. The new salient outgroup might instead be [[Rugby union|rugby]] fans. Awareness of category hierarchies has led to the development of the [[common ingroup identity]] model. This model suggests that conflict at one level of abstraction (e.g., between Manchester United fans and Liverpool fans) might be ameliorated by making salient a more inclusive superordinate ingroup.&lt;ref name=" (1993)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaertner | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Dovidio | first2 = J. F. | last3 = Anastasio | first3 = P. A. | last4 = Bachman | first4 = B. A. | last5 = Rust | first5 = M.

It has been noted, however, that very few social groups can be described in hierarchical terms. For example, [[Catholics|Catholic people]] in [[Germany]] cannot be always considered a subordinate category of Germans, as there are Catholic people throughout the globe. McGarty proposes that the theory's use of hierarchies as an organizing principle must be relaxed. The alternative proposition is that social psychologists should look to [[Venn diagram|Venn]]-like structures for descriptions of social structure.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C.

In R. J. Crisp and M. Hewstone (Eds.), Multiple Social Categorization: Processes Models and Applications (pp. 25-49). Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The awareness of crossed cutting social categories has allowed for the development of further intergroup conflict reduction strategies.&lt;ref name=" (2006)."&gt;Dovidio.

Multiple social categorization: Processes, models and application (pp, 65-89). . New York: Psychology Press. .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation in the theory===
Brewer and Brown describe self-categorization theory as a “version of social identity theory” that is heavily cognitive and is not attentive to many motivational and affective processes.&lt;ref name="Brewer &amp; Brown (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41885">The '''seven rays''' is an [[occult]] concept that has appeared in several religions and [[esoteric]] philosophies in both Western culture and in India since at least the sixth century BCE. Also they are known as gods or angels from different planets or can be called fallen angels.

In the west, it can be seen in early [[western mystery tradition]]s such as [[Gnosticism]] and [[Mithraism]]; and in texts and [[icon]]ic art of the [[Catholic Church]] as early as the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets |author=Barbara G.

Beginning in the late 19th century, the seven rays appeared in a modified and elaborated form in the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], first presented by [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;  The Theosophical concept of the seven rays was further developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the writings of Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and by other authors such as [[Alice Bailey]], [[Manly P. Hall]], and others, including notably the teachings of [[Benjamin Creme]] and his group [[Share International]];&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin.

As the [[New Age]] movement of the mid-to-late 20th century developed, the seven rays concept appeared as an element of metaphysical healing methods such as [[Reiki]] and other modalities,&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of Reiki|author=Carolyn E.

==In Antiquity==

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] takes the bull-form known as Taurus in order to win [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. Taurus is also associated with [[Aphrodite]] and other goddesses, as well as with [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]]. The face of Taurus "gleams with seven rays of fire."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', v.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chaldean Oracles]] of the 2nd century CE feature the seven rays as purifying agents of [[Helios]], symbolism featured in [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]] liturgy as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ow0VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=chaldean+Seven+Rays&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=08IwTY6kLMG88gaB-MGdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chaldean%20Seven%20Rays&amp;f=false "The Chaldean oracles: text, translation, and commentary" by Julianus (the Theurgist.), Ruth Dorothy Majercik, ed., p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 4th century, [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian Saturnalia]] composed a ''Hymn to the Solemn Sun'', and in his ''Hymn to the Mother of the Gods'' spoke of "unspeakable mysteries hidden from the crowd such as Julian the Chaldean prophesied concerning the god of the seven rays."  In Greek Gnostic magic of the same era, colored gemstones were often used as [[amulet|talisman]]s for medicine or healing; they were often engraved with a symbol borrowed from the Egyptian deity [[Chnuphis]]: a hooded serpent or great snake. The snake was shown with a lion's head, from which emanated either twelve or seven rays. The twelve rays represented the [[zodiac]], and the seven rays represented the planets, usually with the seven Greek vowels engraved at the tips of the seven rays. The reverse sides of the talismans were engraved with a snake twisting around a vertical rod. These were known as "Gnostic [[amulet]]s" and were sometimes also engraved with the names ''Iao Sabao'' ([[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]]).&lt;ref name="Thorndike"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science|author=Lynn Thorndike |publisher=Columbia University Press |year= 1958 |pages=317–318, 379 |isbn= 0-231-08794-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gnostic gems with [[Abraxas]] also featured the seven rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/gar/gar31.htm#page_218 "Part III.

In early Christian iconography, the dove of the Holy Ghost is often shown with an emanation of seven rays, as is the image of the Madonna, often in conjunction with a dove or doves.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Divine Domesticity: Augustine of Thagaste to Teresa of Avila |author=Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle |publisher=BRILL |year= 1997 |isbn= 90-04-10675-8 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, circa 565 CE, shows the [[Transfiguration of Christ]] in the apse mosaic, with "seven rays of light shining from the luminous body of Christ over the apostles Peter, James and John."&lt;ref name="Schroer"/&gt;  In the present day Byzantine-style St. Louis Cathedral in Missouri, the center of the sanctuary has an engraved circle with many symbols of the [[Holy Trinity]].

During the 12th century, [[Saint Norbert of Xanten]], founder of the Order of Canons Regular of Prémontré, discovered the spot where the [[relics]] of [[Saint Ursula]] and her companions of [[Saint Gereon]] and of other martyrs lay hidden while in a dream. In the dream that led him to this location, he was guided by "the seven rays of light... surrounding the head of the crucified Redeemer."&lt;ref name="Bartoli"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Life and Institute of St. Ignatius de Loyola: Founder of the Society of Jesus |author=Daniello Bartoli |publisher=E.

[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]] is an oil painting by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436. The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the Son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38). In a prominent element of the complex iconographic work, the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on seven rays of light from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg39/gg39-49.0.html |publisher=National Gallery of Art|quote=The Holy Spirit descends to her on seven rays of light.

Only the seven rays are so treated, and while all of the other light sources in the painting cast shadows, the seven rays do not.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, E.

The Italian [[secret society]] of the late 17th century, [[Knights of the Apocalypse]], was founded with the professed aim to defend the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] against the expected [[Antichrist]], though it was accused of having political motives as well. They wore on their breasts a star with seven rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Apocalypse, Knights of the |volume=2|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hindu scripture==
[[File:Agni and consort.jpg|thumb|The seven-armed Agni with his wife.]]
[[Agni]] is a [[Hindu]] and [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]] depicted in three forms: fire, lightning and the sun. In Hindu art, Agni is depicted with two or seven hands, two heads, and three legs. In each head, he has seven fiery tongues with which he licks sacrificial butter. He rides a ram or a chariot harnessed by fiery horses. His attributes are an axe, a torch, prayer beads and a flaming spear. Agni is represented as red and two-faced, suggesting both his destructive and his beneficent qualities, and with black eyes and hair. Seven rays of light emanate from his body.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana]], a [[vedas|post-vedic]] scripture, describes how [[Vishnu]] "enters into the seven solar rays which dilate into seven suns." These are the "seven principal solar rays," the source of heat even to the planet Jupiter, and the "seven suns into which the seven solar rays dilate at the consummation of all things..."&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt;

20th century Hindu scholar, poet and mystic, [[Sri Aurobindo]], described the Vedic seven rays of knowledge, or [[Agni]], as "the seven forms of the Thought-principle" and wrote that "the seven brilliant horses of the sun and their full union constitutes the seven-headed Thought of Ayasya by which the lost sun of Truth is recovered. That thought is again established in the seven rivers, the seven principles of being divine and human, the totality of which founds the perfect spiritual existence."&lt;ref name="Aurobindo"/&gt;

==Syncretistic interpretations==

Egyptologist [[Gerald Massey]] wrote in 1881 of what he described as connections between Vedic scripture, ancient Egyptian mythology and the Gospel stories.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey Collection-Upper Norwood Joint Library&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that [[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]], the "Seven-rayed Sun-God of the Gnostic-stones" was also the "Serpent Chnubis," and "the Second Beast in the Book of Revelation."&lt;ref name="massey-genesis"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Natural Genesis |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Black Classic Press |year= 1998 |edition=from original published circa 1881 |pages=366, 369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he elaborated further, describing the unity of "the seven souls of the Pharaoh," "the seven arms of the Hindu god [[Agni]]," "the seven stars in the hand of the Christ in Revelation," and "the seven rays of the Chaldean god Heptaktis, or Iao, on the Gnostic stones."&lt;ref name="massey-lectures"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gerald Massey's Lectures |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year= 1992 |edition=from original published posthumously circa 1900 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Fales Dunlap, wrote in 1894:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moses was of the race of the Chaldeans. The Chaldean Mithra had his Seven Rays, and Moses his Seven Days. The other planets which circling around the sun lead the dance as round the King of heaven receive from him with the light also their powers; while as the light comes to them from the sun so from him they receive their powers that he pours out into the Seven Spheres of the Seven Planets of which the sun is the centre.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dunlap wrote that the idea of spirit as the ultimate cause is present in all of the great religions of the East (which in the terminology of his time included the area now known as the Near East or Middle East), and that this idea can be found in "the Seven Rays of the Chaldaean [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithra]] and the Seven Days of Genesis. From the Sun came fire and spirit." According to Dunlap, "this was the astronomical religion of the Chaldeans, Jews, Persians, Syrians, Phoenicians and Egyptians."&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithra mysteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap | publisher=G Redway &amp; JW Bouton |year= 1894 |pages=reface, iii-vi |edition=Original from the University of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunlap compared the [[Halo (religious iconography)#Ancient Greek world|nimbus]] of [[Apollo]] to the seven rays of [[Dionysus]], presiding over the orbits of the seven planets. The seven rays are found also in the Chaldean mystery of "the God of the Seven Rays, who held the Seven Stars in his hand, through whom (as Chaldaeans supposed) the souls were raised." Prior to the Christian era, this deity was known as Iao (the first birth) or  [[Sabaoth]] (the Sun), and later described as "Christos of the Resurrection of Souls."&lt;ref name="dunlap2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithramsyteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap |publisher=G.

In the late 1940s, art historian and writer [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] was curator in the department of Asiatic Art at the Boston [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and built the first large collection of Indian art in the United States. His writings in the field of [[perennial philosophy]] and the [[Traditionalist School]] included complex essays collating symbols of ancient wisdom and metaphysics from widely diverse cultures including Indian, Islamic, Chinese, Hellenic, and Christian sources. He wrote that the seven rays of the sun appear in both Hindu and Christian symbolism, representing similar concepts, and in particular the symbolism of the seventh ray that "corresponds to the distinction of transcendent from immanent and of infinite from finite." He added that of "our Axis of the Universe ([[Stambha|skambha]], divo dharuna, etc.) and Islamic [[Qutb]] ..... The seventh ray alone passes through the Sun to the suprasolar Brahma worlds, "where no sun shines" ('all that is under the Sun being in the power of Death, and all beyond immortal')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Door in the Sky: Coomaraswamy on Myth and Meaning |author=Ananda K.

==In Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Syncretism is one of the core principles of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a religious philosophy originating with [[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] from the 1870s, and the seven rays appear repeatedly in the related writings. Theosophy holds that all [[religion]]s are attempts by the "[[Spiritual Hierarchy]]" to help humanity in evolving to greater perfection, and that each religion therefore has a portion of the truth.

Blavatsky wrote in the first book of ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' of an " analogy between the Aryan or Brahmanical and the Egyptian esotericism" and that the "seven rays of the Chaldean Heptakis or Iao, on the Gnostic stones" represent the seven large stars of the Egyptian "Great Bear" constellation, the seven elemental powers, and the Hindu "seven Rishis." She stated that the seven rays of the Vedic sun deity Vishnu represent the same concept as the "astral fluid or 'Light' of the Kabalists," and that the seven emanations of the lower seven [[sephirot]]h are the "primeval seven rays," and "will be found and recognized in every religion."&lt;ref name="doctrine1-129"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 1, p 129–130, 523, 573–4 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky discusses the "seven nervous plexuses of the body" and the seven rays they radiate, stating that this principle is found in the [[Rig Veda]], in the mythology of [[Ahura Mazda]], in the beliefs of the Incas, the Chinese Yao, and the Egyptian Osiris, who "when he enters the ark, or solar boat, takes seven Rays with him." She describes the "seven wise ones" of the Veda as "the seven Rays which fall free from the macrocosmic centre".&lt;ref name="doctrine2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 143, 191 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blavatsky summarizes the syncretistic principle of her doctrine as it relates to the seven rays:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a key which reveals to us on indisputable grounds of comparative analogy... the Indian phœnix, the emblem of cyclic and periodical time, the "man-lion" Singha, of whose representations the so-called "gnostic gems" are so full. Over the seven rays of the lion's crown, and corresponding to their points, stand, in many cases, the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet AEHIOYW, testifying to the Seven Heavens. This is the Solar lion and the emblem of the Solar cycle, as Garuda is that of the great cycle, the "Maha-Kalpa" co-eternal with Vishnu, and also, of course, the emblem of the Sun, and Solar cycle. ... As well remarked by C. W. King: — "Whatever the primary meaning (of the gem with the solar lion and vowels) it was probably imported in its present shape from India, that true fountain head of gnostic iconography." (Gnostics, p. 218)&lt;ref name="Doctrine 2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 564–5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the third volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', published posthumously, Blavatsky described the "Seven Primeval Rays" as a group of celestial beings also known as "Gods" or "[[Deva (New Age)|Angels]]" or "Powers". She stated that this symbolism was "adopted later on by the Christian Religion as the 'Seven [[Angel of the Presence|Angels of the Presence]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Occultism Of The Secret Doctrine  |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year= 2004 |edition=originally published in 1897 |isbn= 1-4179-1104-2 |page=art I, page 369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Theosophy, the seven rays are said to be seven major types of ''Light-Substance'' (spirit/matter) (waves/particles) that compose the created universes. These are also believed to convey "Divine Qualities".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Reed. [http://www.blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm ''Blavatsky' Foreknowledge of The Wave/Particle Duality of Light''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927044457/http://blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm |date=2006-09-27 }} 1997. "It would also be incorrect to claim light is fully explained as a particle. Rather it has a dual nature possessing the properties of both [[wave]] and [[Elementary particle|particle]]. In general, [[electromagnetic radiation]] acts more like waves in the [[radio wave]] end of the [[spectrum]], more like particles in the [[x-ray]] end of the spectrum, and usually (but not always) like a wave in the "middle" light area of the spectrum in our everyday experience. Her ambiguity, then, reflects a fact in nature, the wave/particle duality of nature."&lt;/ref&gt;

===C.W. Leadbeater===

[[C.W. Leadbeater]] gave a list showing the characteristic type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for each ray. This list indicates what he regarded as the most compatible type of magic to be performed by persons on each ray (although anyone of any ray can do any of these various types of magic).&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--The Theosophical Publishing House. Chart on P. 229 lists Characteristic Magic of each Ray.&lt;/ref&gt;

* First ray: Magic of [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] of [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]
* Second ray: Magic of [[Raja Yoga]] (Development of Mind)
* Third ray: Magic of [[Astrology]] (Natural Magnetic Forces)
* Fourth ray: Magic of [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]] (physical development)
* Fifth ray: Magic of [[Alchemy]] (Manipulation of Material Substances)
* Sixth ray: Magic of [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]] (Selfless Service and Altruistic Love; [[agape]])
* Seventh ray: [[Ceremonial magic]] (Invocation of Elementals, and [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]])

==New Age teachings==

According to [[Alice A. Bailey]], each person has a ''soul ray'' that remains the same through all their incarnations, and a ''personality ray'' that is different for each incarnation. Each ray is also correspondent with certain Masters of Wisdom, and with particular planets, cycles, nations, etc. The seven rays are the basis for what Alice A. Bailey called ''New Age Psychology''—she divides everyone in the human race into these seven [[psychological type]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Seven Rays of Life'' New York: 1995—Lucis Publishing Co. Compilation from all the [[Alice A. Bailey]] books of material about the seven rays.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey stated that the seven rays that reach us on [[Earth]] locally originate within the "Solar Logos," i.e., the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Sun]]. According to Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]], the seven rays are focused to the Solar Logos, through [[Sirius]], the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] in the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], and the seven major stars of the [[Pleiades]] form the "Galactic Logos," (the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]), and have their ultimate origin within the mind of [[God]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On the local planetary level, it is believed that the seven rays are transmitted from the Solar Logos through the God of our planet, [[Sanat Kumara]], then through the spiritual hierarchy of our planet which includes the "Masters of Wisdom" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;(Some writings term them the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] or the [[Great White Brotherhood]]).

Each of the seven rays is believed to be associated with a different kind of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult energy]], and a different [[color]].

===Qualities of the seven rays===
The ''seven rays'' are listed below:

[[Alice A. Bailey]] and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] assign different colors and in some cases different Masters to each of the seven rays. In ''Letters on Occult Meditation'', Alice Bailey indicates that there is no simple correspondence between the rays and these colors. The colors, Masters, and Retreats indicated here are those indicated by both Alice Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant.

According to Alice A. Bailey the Masters live in immortal bodies at a ''residence'' on the [[physical plane]] at the indicated location (although a given Master may physically travel extensively incognito to various locations, become [[Invisibility|invisible]], [[Teleportation in theology|teleport]] to various locations, and walk through walls, as well as influence humans [[telepathy|telepathically]] and travel on the [[Plane (metaphysics)|inner planes]], as required by the demands of his spiritual work).

According to the Church Universal and Triumphant, and other ''[[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master Activities]]'', each Master is believed to serve at a ''Retreat'' on the physical or [[etheric plane]] at the geographical location shown after their name.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Prophet, Elizabeth Clare (Compiled and edited by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press "The Retreats of the Ascended Masters" Pages 395-492&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Gifts of the Holy Spirit" of the Church Universal and Triumphant for each ray are shown. For both Alice A. Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant, each ray has a [[Gemstone|jewel]] which is believed to focus the energy of that ray, which is indicated.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, as the [[New Age]] movement gained in popularity, the concept and imagery of the seven rays appeared in a variety of settings.

In [[esoteric astrology]], the seven rays are considered to be split into three groups: the first two rays represent Will and Wisdom, respectively, and the remaining five rays together form the group that represents Activity.&lt;ref name="Leo" /&gt; In a style of Reiki adapted by Carolyn E. Jackson the student passes through a sequence of levels by mastering the "key" to each level. The key for the second level is known as the key of "oneness" and is attained by passing through each of the seven rays.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; This, however, is not part of traditional [[Reiki]] or other versions of the Reiki system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascensionreiki.com/Usui%20Reiki%20Manual.pdf The Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reiki Sourcebook |author=Bronwen &amp; Frans Steine|publisher=O Books |year= 2003|isbn= 1-903816-55-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[psychic]] counselor Samantha Stevens, an individual can use [[affirmative prayer|affirmations]], candles, [[Chromotherapy|color therapy]], vibrational medicines and other methods to contact "archangels," which she defines as the "seven rays," based on Buddhist and Christian theories: "The Rays or Divine Flames (as they are sometimes called) represent elements in the perfectly integrated human being - one whose heart is aligned with their will and inspired by the Divine Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Rays: A Universal Guide to the Archangels |author=Samantha Stevens |publisher=Insomniac Press |year= 2003|isbn= 1-894663-49-7 |page=22 et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light therapy|Light therapist]] and [[Radionics]] Practitioner Primrose Cooper writes that in using light as a healing modality, she finds it helpful to use the seven rays as defined in Theosophy to assist her clients in finding "psychological insight into their soul's purpose."&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

In recent years, there was the creation of a secretive group named "The Keepers of the Seven Rays". Their philosophy is the human being has seven emanations in which it finds itself, or connects with the Higher Self. These emanations are extensions of the Higher Self or otherwise called the Higher Will. These emanations reach out like arms and grasp onto the knowledge(of all types) needed for the full development of the individual into his/her Higher Potential. All a human has to do to use these emanations is to know basic moral law, what their body and/or psyche can and cannot handle, and listen.

Metaphysical philosopher Gurdjieff writes frequently of his "Seven Rays of Creation".   According to Gurdjieff, the Seven Rays of Creation are the seven manifestations of Energy in our Universe. The first Ray contains all things (THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE) and all things obey the laws inherent in the First Ray. The First Ray then manifests itself in the 2nd Realm, the realm of Galaxies. From Galaxies to Solar Systems, Solar Systems to Planets. From Planets to Organisms on the planets, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-legacy.org/ Gurdjieff Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spiritualism|main}}
A '''spirit''' is a [[supernatural]] being, often, but not exclusively, a [[non-physical entity]]; such as a [[ghost]], [[fairy]], or [[angel]].&lt;ref name="polysemy"/&gt; The concepts of a person's spirit and [[soul]], often also overlap, as both are either [[Mind-body dualism|contrasted with]] or [[Idealism|given ontological priority over]] the [[Human body|body]] and both are believed to survive bodily death in some religions,&lt;ref&gt;OED "spirit 2.a.: The soul of a person, as commended to God, or passing out of the body, in the moment of death."&lt;/ref&gt; and "spirit" can also have the sense of "[[ghost]]", i.e. a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person. In [[Bible translations into English|English Bibles]], "the Spirit" (with a capital "S"), specifically denotes the [[Holy Spirit]].

Spirit is often used [[metaphysically]] to refer to the [[consciousness]] or [[personality]].

Historically, it was also used to refer to a "subtle" as opposed to "gross" material substance, as in the famous last paragraph of [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burtt|first1=Edwin A.|title=Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science|date=2003|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc|location=Mineola, New York|page=275|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word "spirit" comes from the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'',but also "spirit, soul, courage, vigor", ultimately from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*(s)peis''. It is distinguished from Latin ''anima'', "[[soul]]" (which nonetheless also derives from an Indo-European root meaning "to breathe", earliest form ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;enh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-'').&lt;ref&gt;'''anə-''', from *''ə&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;enə&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-''. Watkins, Calvert. 2000. ''The American Heritage&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', second edition. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., p.4. Also [https://web.archive.org/web/20071208010420/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE17.html available online]. (NB: Watkins uses '''ə&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''ə&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''ə&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' as fully equivalent variants for '''h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', respectively, for the notation of Proto-Indo-European [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal segments]].)&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, this distinction exists between ''[[pneuma]]'' ({{lang|grc|πνεῦμα}}), "breath, motile air, spirit," and ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psykhē]]'' ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}), "soul"&lt;ref name="polysemy"&gt;[[#polysemy|François 2009]], p.187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; (even though the latter term, {{lang|grc|ψῡχή}} = ''psykhē/psūkhē'', is also from an Indo-European root meaning "to breathe": ''*bhes-'', [[Zero grade#Zero grade|zero grade]] ''*bhs-'' [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|devoicing]] in [[Proto-Greek language#Proto-Greek changes|proto-Greek]] to ''*phs-'', resulting in historical-period Greek ''ps-'' in ''psūkhein'', "to breathe", whence ''psūkhē'', "spirit", "soul").&lt;ref&gt;'''''bhes-'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Watkins, Calvert. 2000. ''The American Heritage&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', second edition. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 2000, p.11. Also [https://web.archive.org/web/20071208011042/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE60.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "spirit" came into [[Middle English]] via [[Old French]]. The distinction between soul and spirit also developed in the [[Abrahamic religions]]: Arabic ''nafs'' ({{lang|ar|نفس}}) opposite ''rūħ'' ({{lang|ar|روح}}); Hebrew ''neshama'' ({{Hebrew|נְשָׁמָה}} ''nəšâmâh'') or ''[[nephesh]]'' {{Hebrew|נֶ֫פֶשׁ}} ''nép̄eš'' (in Hebrew ''neshama'' comes from the root ''NŠM'' or "breath") opposite ''ruach'' ({{Hebrew|רוּחַ}} ''rúaħ''). (Note, however, that in Semitic just as in Indo-European, this dichotomy has not ''always'' been as neat historically as it has come to be taken over a long period of development: Both {{Hebrew|נֶ֫פֶשׁ}} (root {{Hebrew|נפשׁ}}) and {{Hebrew|רוּחַ}} (root {{Hebrew|רוח}}), as well as cognate words in various Semitic languages, including Arabic, also preserve meanings involving misc. air phenomena: "breath", "wind", and even "odour").&lt;ref&gt;Koehler, L., Baumgartner, W., Richardson, M.

== Spiritual and metaphysical usage ==
In spiritual and metaphysical terms, "spirit" has acquired a number of meanings:
* An [[incorporeal]] but ubiquitous, non-quantifiable substance or [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] present individually in all living things.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Unlike the concept of souls (often regarded as eternal and sometimes believed to pre-exist the body) a spirit develops and grows as an integral aspect of a living being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Mormonism/Beliefs/Human-Nature-and-the-Purpose-of-Existence.html|title=Human Nature and the Purpose of Existence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Daemon (mythology)|daemon]], [[sprite (creature)|sprite]], or [[ghost]]. People usually conceive of a ghost as a wandering spirit from a being no longer living, having survived the death of the body yet maintaining at least vestiges of [[mind]] and [[consciousness]].l
* In [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] of a human has for obvious reasons become seen as strongly linked with the very occurrence of life. Spirit, in this sense, means the thing that separates a living body from a corpse&amp;mdash;and usually implies [[intelligence]], [[consciousness]], and [[sentience]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* [[Latter-day Saint]] prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.]] taught that the concept of spirit as incorporeal or without substance was incorrect: "There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131?lang=eng 131:7]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Various forms of [[animism]], such as Japan's [[Shinto]] and [[African traditional religion]], focus on invisible beings that represent or connect with plants, animals, or [[landform]]s ([[kami]]){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}: translators usually employ the English word "spirit" when trying to express the idea of such entities.
* Individual spirits envisaged as interconnected with all other spirits and with "The Spirit" (singular and [[capitalization|capitalized]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This concept relates to theories of a unified [[spirituality]], to [[universal consciousness]] and to some concepts of [[Deity]]. In this scenario all separate "spirits", when connected, form a greater unity, the Spirit, which has an identity separate from its elements plus a [[consciousness]] and [[intellect]] greater than its elements; an ultimate, unified, [[nondualism|non-dual]] awareness or [[force]] of [[life]] combining or transcending all individual units of consciousness. The [[experience]] of such a connection can become a primary basis for [[supernatural|spiritual]] [[belief]]. The term ''spirit'' occurs in this sense in (to name but a few) [[Anthroposophy]], [[Aurobindo]], ''[[A Course In Miracles]],'' [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Ken Wilber]], and [[Meher Baba]] (though in his teachings, "spirits" are only ''apparently'' separate from each other and from "The Spirit.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalchuri, Bhau |url=http://www.lordmeher.org/ |title=Meher Prabhu |trans-title=Lord Meher |volume=Eighteen |publisher=Manifestation, Inc. |year=1986 |page=5937}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this use, the term seems conceptually identical to [[Plotinus|Plotinus's]] "[[Absolute (philosophy)|The One]]" and [[Friedrich Schelling|Friedrich Schelling's]] "[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]". Similarly, according to the [[panentheism|panentheistic]]/[[pantheism|pantheistic]] view, Spirit equates to [[essence]] that can manifest itself as [[mind]]/[[soul]] through any level in pantheistic [[hierarchy]]/[[holarchy]], such as through a mind/soul of a single cell (with very primitive, elemental consciousness), or through a human or animal mind/soul (with [[consciousness]] on a level of organic synergy of an individual human/animal), or through a (superior) mind/soul with synergetically extremely complex/sophisticated consciousness of whole galaxies involving all sub-levels, all emanating (since the superior mind/soul operates non-dimensionally, or trans-dimensionally) from the one Spirit.
* Christian [[Spirituality|spiritual]]  [[theology]] can use the term "Spirit" to describe [[God]], or aspects of God — as in the "[[Holy Spirit]]", referring to a [[Triune God]] ([[Trinity]]) (cf. [[Gospel of Matthew]] 28:19).
* [[Pneumatology]] is the study of [[spirituality|spiritual beings]] and phenomena, especially the spiritual aspect of human beings and the interactions between humans and [[God]].
* [[Christian Science]] uses "Spirit" as one of seven synonyms for [[God]], as in: "Principle; Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Mary Baker |authorlink=Mary Baker Eddy |title=[[Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures]] |format=txt |accessdate=2009-03-11 |year=1875 |page=587 |chapter=Glossary |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/shkts11.txt |quote='''GOD''' &amp;mdash; The great I AM; the all-knowing, all-seeing, all-acting, all-wise, all-loving, and eternal; Principle; Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love; all substance; intelligence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[C. G. Jung]] (in a lecture delivered to the literary Society of Augsburg, 20&amp;nbsp;October 1926, on the theme of “Nature and Spirit”): 
{{quote|The connection between spirit and life is one of those problems involving factors of such complexity that we have to be on our guard lest we ourselves get caught in the net of words in which we seek to ensnare these great enigmas. For how can we bring into the orbit of our thought those limitless complexities of life which we call "Spirit" or "Life" unless we clothe them in verbal concepts, themselves mere counters of the intellect? The mistrust of verbal concepts, inconvenient as it is, nevertheless seems to me to be very much in place in speaking of fundamentals. "Spirit" and "Life" are familiar enough words to us, very old acquaintances in fact, pawns that for thousands of years have been pushed back and forth on the thinker's chessboard. The problem must have begun in the grey dawn of time, when someone made the bewildering discovery that the living breath which left the body of the dying man in the last death-rattle meant more than just air in motion. It can scarcely be an accident [[onomatopoeic]] words like ''ruach'' ([[Hebrew]]), ''ruch'' ([[Arabic]]), ''roho'' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]]) mean ‘spirit’ no less clearly than ''πνεύμα'' (''pneuma'', [[Greek language|Greek]]) and ''spiritus'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. G. |last=Jung |author-link=Carl G. Jung |editor-last1=Hull |editor-first1=R. F. C. |title=The Collected Works of C. G. Jung |volume=8 |chapter =Spirit and Life |date=1960 |publisher=Pantheon Books for Bollinger |series=XX |location=New York, NY |pages=319–320 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Parapsychology|Psychical research]], "In all the publications of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] the term ‘spirit’ stands for ''the personal [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]'' whatever else it may ultimately be proved to imply or require" ([[James H. Hyslop]], 1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hyslop |first1=James Hervey |title=Contact with the Other World |date=1919 |publisher=The Century Co. |location=New York, NY |page=11 |edition=First |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[mysticism]]: existence in unity with [[Divinity|Godhead]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Soul may also equate with spirit, but the soul involves a certain individual human consciousness, while spirit comes from beyond that. Compare the psychological teaching of [[Al-Ghazali#Psychology|Al-Ghazali]].

==Related concepts==
{{See also|Holy Spirit|Ruach HaKodesh}}
Similar concepts in other languages include Greek ''[[pneuma]]'' and Sanskrit ''[[akasha]] / [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]''&lt;ref name=polysemy/&gt; (see also ''[[prana]]''). Some languages use a word for ''spirit'' often closely related (if not synonymous) to ''[[mind]]''. Examples include the German ''[[Geist]]'' (related to the English word ''ghost'') or the French ''l'esprit''. English versions of the [[Bible]] most commonly translate the Hebrew word ''ruach'' (רוח; ''wind'') as "the spirit", whose essence is divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblicalheritage.org/Bible%20Studies/ruach.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006125829/http://www.biblicalheritage.org/Bible%20Studies/ruach.htm |archive-date=2015-10-06 |title=Ruach: Spirit or Wind or ??? |website=BiblicalHeritage.org |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Hebrew texts commonly use the word ''[[nephesh]]''. [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] regard ''nephesh'' as one of the five parts of the Jewish [[soul]], where ''nephesh'' (animal) refers to the physical being and its animal instincts. Similarly, [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages, as well as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[qi|气 ''qi'']]), use the words for ''breath'' to express concepts similar to "the spirit".&lt;ref name=polysemy/&gt;

The German [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] (1864-1920) formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]] that defines a '''status group'''&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart Bendix. 1960. Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait. p. 105. London: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; (also '''status class''' and '''[[Estates of the realm|status estate]]''')&lt;ref&gt;Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich (eds). 1978. ''Economy and society: an outline of interpretive sociology, Volume 1.'' p. 300. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as a group of people who, within a [[society]], can be differentiated on the basis of non-economic qualities such as [[honour]], [[Reputation|prestige]], [[ethnicity]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rdA86k8WTuoC&amp;pg=PA42 |title= The Breakdown of Class Politics|author= Terry N. Clark, Seymour Martin Lipset}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Weber used the German terms ''Stand'' (status group) and ''Stände'' (status groups).)

Since Weber's day, sociologists have intensively studied the matter of “status incongruence” - both in [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], and in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;''From Social Class and Religious Identity to Status Incongruence in Post-Industrial Societies'', by [[Mattei Dogan]] in ''Comparative Sociology'' (2004) www.statusgroup.com.ua&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber said that status groups emerge from "the house of honor", and that such status-honor stands in contrast with:
 
* [[social class]], based on [[economic]]ally determined relationship in the house of the marketplace
* [[political party]], based on [[Political party|affiliations]] in the [[politics|political domain]], or the house of power

Status groups, social classes, and political parties are the constituent concepts of the [[three-component theory of stratification]]. Discussion of the relationships among status groups, social class, and political parties occurs in Weber's essay "Class, Status, Party", written before the First World War (1914–18); the first translation into English, by [[Hans Gerth]] and [[C. Wright Mills]], was published in the 1940s. Dagmar Waters and colleagues produced a newer English translation of the essay, titled “The Distribution of Power within the Community: Classes, Stände, Parties” (2010), published in the “Journal of Classical Sociology”; the title of the new English-language translation includes the German word “Stände” (status groups) in place of the English term.&lt;ref&gt;"The Distribution of Power within the Community: Classes, Staende, Parties", Journal of Classical Sociology, 2010:137-152, http://jcs.sagepub.com/content/10/2/137.short&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Zeppelin University of "Class, Status, Party" by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Journal of Classical Sociology 2010:142-148 http://jcs.sagepub.com/content/10/2/153.extract&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Weber, status groups feature in a wide variety of social stratifications which both popular discourse and the academic literature commonly refer to.  These include categorization by [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[caste]], professional groups, neighborhood groups, nationalities, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Tony and Dagmar Waters (2016).  Are the Terms 'Socioeconomic Status' and 'Class Status' Oxymorons for Max Weber?  Palgrave Communications http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms20162&lt;/ref&gt;  These contrast with relationships rooted in economic relations, which Weber calls "class".

Sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930-2002) discusses issues of [[cultural capital]] and [[symbolic capital]]. Like Weber, he comments on how non-monetary means are used{{by whom?|date=January 2018}} to confer and deny status to individuals and groups.  However, Bourdieu developed independently from Weber,{{cn|date=January 2018}} even though they{{who?|date=January 2018}} probably{{or?|date=January 2018}} do reflect the type of "capital" that status groups confer on those who are [[privilege (social inequality) | privileged]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23139">In [[cognitive psychology]], the '''telescoping effect''' (or '''telescoping bias''') refers to the temporal displacement of an event whereby people perceive recent events as being more remote than they are and distant events as being more recent than they are.&lt;ref name=Janssen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janssen |first1=Steve M. J. |last2=Chessa |first2=Antonio G. |last3=Murre |first3=Jaap M.

[[File:Telescopingmodel.jpg|thumb|Events that occurred more recently than 3 years ago are subject to backward telescoping, and events that occurred more than 3 years in the past are subject to forward telescoping. Events that occurred around the 3 year mark are equally subject to forward as backward telescoping.]]

==Origin of the term==
The original work on telescoping is usually attributed to a 1964 article by Neter and Waksberg in the ''[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]]''.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=David C. |last2=Baddeley |first2=Alan D. |date=1989 |title=Telescoping is not time compression: A model |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |doi=10.3758/BF03202626 |volume=17 |issue=6|pages=653–661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term telescoping comes from the idea that time seems to shrink toward the present in the way that the distance to objects seems to shrink when they are viewed through a telescope.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;

==Real-world example==
A real-world example of the telescoping effect is the case of [[:nl:Ferdi Elsas|Ferdi Elsas]], an infamous kidnapper and murderer in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Draa2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Draaisma |first1=Douwe |last2=Pomerans |first2=Erica |date=2004 |title=Why life speeds up as you get older: on autobiographical memory |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-83424-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was let out of prison, most of the general population did not believe he had been in prison long enough.&lt;ref name=Draa2/&gt; Due to forward telescoping, people thought Ferdi Elsas' sentence started more recently than it actually did.&lt;ref name=Draa2/&gt; Telescoping has important real world applications, especially in survey research. Marketing firms often use surveys to ask when consumers last bought a product, and government agencies often use surveys to discover information about [[drug abuse]] or about [[victimology]].&lt;ref name=Mor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morwitz |first=Vicki G. |date=1997 |title=It Seems Like Only Yesterday: The Nature and Consequences of Telescoping Errors in Marketing Research |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp0601_01 |volume=6 |pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telescoping may bias answers to these questions.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt;

==Methods for studying==
Telescoping is studied in psychology by asking participants to recall dates or to estimate the recency of a personal event.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Another procedure that is often used is called the diary procedure, in which participants record personal events in a diary each day for several months.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Charles P. |last2=Skowronski |first2=John J. |last3=Larsen |first3=Steen F. |last4=Betz |first4=Andrew L. |title=Autobiographical memory: remembering what and remembering when |date=1996 |publisher=Erlbaum |location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=978-0-8058-1514-6 |pages=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the diary is completed, participants are asked to date events and assess how well they remember those events.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;  Their recollections are then compared to the actual dates and details of the events in order to determine if telescoping has occurred.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;

==Models and other explanations==
Researchers have examined possible reasons that the telescoping effect occurs.  They have proposed the following hypotheses and models.  The two models that are currently favored are the associative and boundary models.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

===Accessibility hypothesis===
Brown, Rips, and Shevell created the accessibility hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crawley |first1=Susan E. |last2=Pring |first2=Linda |date=2000 |title=When did Mrs Thatcher resign? The effects of ageing on the dating of public events |journal=Memory |doi=10.1080/096582100387650 |pmid=10829127 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=111–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis states that dates are estimated, not recalled, and these estimates are based on what is remembered about the event.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; People use how much detail they recall about an event to infer how long ago the event occurred.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Therefore, memorable events should be recalled as occurring recently.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; Since these memorable events are recalled as occurring more recently, in general people overestimate the recency of events and forward telescoping occurs.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; For example, when people are asked to estimate the dates of the shooting of Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II, which occurred in the same year, they typically estimate that Ronald Reagan's shooting occurred more recently.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Norman R. |last2=Rips |first2=Lance J. |last3=Shevell |first3=Steven K. |date=1985 |title=The subjective dates of natural events in very-long-term memory |journal=Cognitive Psychology  |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90006-4 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=139–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Reagan's shooting is usually a more memorable event and was more heavily publicized, so the memory of this event was more accessible to participants, indicating that accessibility plays a role in the dating of events.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; However, these results are not always replicated, and sometimes the reverse is found.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; For this reason, other explanations have been presented to explain telescoping.

===Conveyor belt model===
Thompson et al. used the conveyor belt model of memory to explain forward telescoping.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; It assumes that events are stored in the order that they occur.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; When individuals try to remember the date of an event, they scan serially backward through memory.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Since events are only remembered by order or time between events in this model, if an event is forgotten, previous events are recalled as if they occurred more recently and forward telescoping occurs.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Another way of interpreting this theory is that people estimate the dates of events based on the number of personal events that have occurred since the target event.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; Since people underestimate memory loss over long periods of time, target events are moved closer to the present.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; Although this model explains forward telescoping, it does not explain backward telescoping. [[File:Telescoping effect Conveyor Belt Model.jpg|thumb|right| This image portrays the conveyor belt model of the telescoping effect, which assumes that when an event is forgotten, earlier events are recalled as occurring more recently.]]

===Guessing===
Some psychologists have suggested that telescoping occurs because people are guessing the date of an event. According to this theory, if a person is unsure of a date, they minimize their chance of erring by placing events toward the middle of the period.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; However, telescoping occurs at the same frequency if events are remembered well or if events are not remembered well.&lt;ref name=Thompson2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Charles P. |last2=Skowronski |first2=John J. |last3=Lee |first3=D. John |date=1988 |title=Telescoping in dating naturally occurring events |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition  |doi=10.3758/BF03214227 |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=461–468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, guessing is not a complete explanation for telescoping, and another one of these models is likely responsible.

===Boundary model===
Rubin and Baddley created the boundary model to explain telescoping. When people date events, they often get information from a bounded period, such as a year or a vacation.&lt;ref name="Th book"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Charles P. |editor-last=Thompson |title=Autobiographical memory: theoretical and applied perspectives |date=1998 |publisher=Erlbaum |location=Mahwah |isbn=978-0-8058-2795-8 |edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes events are not assigned outside of the boundaries of this period, so dating errors can only move toward the middle of a boundary and that since recent events are dated more accurately, forward telescoping has a stronger effect.&lt;ref name=Thompson2/&gt; It postulates that, without boundaries, an estimation would be unbiased.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Peter James |last2=Brown |first2=Norman R. |date=2004 |title=The role of guessing and boundaries on date estimation biases |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |doi=10.3758/BF03196630 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=748–754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boundarymodeltelescoping.jpg|thumb|left| This image explains the boundary model of the telescoping effect. The boundary model states that telescoping is the result of dating errors moving toward the middle of a bounded period]]

There is some evidence against the boundary model. A study by Lee and Brown in 2004 looked at how four different groups dated news events under different conditions.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cohen |editor1-first=Gillian |editor-last2=Conway |editor-first2=Martin|title=Memory in the real world |edition=Updated |date=2008 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=Hove |isbn=1-84169-641-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the different boundaries had no effect on date estimation, and the existence of a boundary had no effect on date estimation.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; This study suggests that telescoping is not due solely to boundaries.

===Associative model===
Simon Kemp proposed the associative model to explain telescoping without using boundaries.&lt;ref name= "Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=William J.|author2=Janssen, Steve M.J. |title=Aging and the speed of time|journal=Acta Psychologica |date=2010|volume=134|pages=130–141|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2010.01.004|issue=2|pmid=20163781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemp argued that people use an association strategy that links target events to other events for which dating information is available.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; According to Kemp, this association leads to a [[Regression toward the mean|regression to the mean]] of known dates.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; This approach assumes that the date of an event is determined by using memories from other similar events, that ability to recall relevant information decreases overtime, and that the associated event is more likely to be more recent than the actual event because the ability to retrieve information decreases overtime.&lt;ref name= "Lee"/&gt;

A variation of this theory is the [[prototype]] model. This model states that prototypes can aid the process of dating events.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=Simon|title=Association as a Cause of Dating Bias|journal=Memory|date=1996 |volume=4|issue=2|pages=131–1431|doi= 10.1080/096582196389004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype event is a general event.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; For example, a specific event could be the assassination of John F. Kennedy and a prototype event could be the assassination of a world leader.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; People can use associated prototype events to help them recall events in the same way they use normal events.

Although the prototype model is based on general events and the associative model is based on actual events, both have been supported in experiments.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; Participants are worse at estimating the dates of events if they have to date events spontaneously, without using context or associated events, and prototype event estimates resemble spontaneously estimated events.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; The associative model does not predict what occurs if a person has never heard of an event and cannot predict what sort of biasing will occur for these responses.&lt;ref name= "Lee"/&gt; Therefore, the associative model, like the boundary effect model, cannot explain all aspects of telescoping but can explain new aspects of telescoping.

===Other explanations===
'''Heuristics'''
{{main|Heuristics}}

Some psychologists suggest telescoping errors are due to the heuristics used to answer dating and frequency questions. When asked questions about frequency, people often answer using phrases like "all the time" and "everyday" and therefore don't account for exceptions.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Depending on the events in question, this could lead to an over or under estimation of the occurrence of an event, and be perceived as telescoping.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; This over reporting is a result of telescoping because telescoping causes participants include events beyond the period.&lt;ref name= "Draa"/&gt; Therefore, heuristics may be responsible for some of the telescoping errors.

'''Demand characteristics'''
{{main|Demand characteristics}}
Other psychologists believe that the telescoping errors that have been reported in studies are not due to a phenomenon of memory, but demand characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Responses to questions about the frequency of behavior can be biased because of demand characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Respondents may provide too much information, rather than too little, because they are trying to provide as much useful information as possible, and therefore over-report the frequency of events.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Some researchers perceive this over reporting as telescoping because people are including events beyond the given period, but the over reporting could be due to the demand characteristics of the study.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt;  Demand characteristics can explain the appearance of forward telescoping, but cannot explain backwards telescoping and can not explain the inaccurate recall of dates when respondents are not led to believe that a certain answer is desirable.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt;

==Modifiers of effect==

===Development===

Psychologists have studied the telescoping effect in children because a person's development can have a significant impact on his or her memory.  Telescoping occurs at all ages, but to different degrees.&lt;ref name= "Wang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Qi|author2=Peterson, Carole |author3=Hou, Yubo |title=Children dating childhood memories|journal=Memory|date=1 October 2010|volume=18|pages=754–762|doi=10.1080/09658211.2010.508749|issue=7|pmid=20818575}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Older children have a greater tendency to telescope earlier memories and a weaker tendency to telescope recent memories than younger children.&lt;ref name= "Wang"/&gt;  Children's telescoping errors occur for their earliest memories.&lt;ref name= "Wang"/&gt; This finding is significant because it probably occurs for adults as well, and therefore people's earliest memories are reported as more recent than they actually are. This finding indicates that the earliest memories reported in [[childhood amnesia]] literature should be questioned because they may have occurred earlier than they are reported.&lt;ref name= "Wang"/&gt;

Many older adults claim time speeds up as they get older, which can be explained by forward telescoping.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;  Since forward telescoping leads people to underestimate the amount of time that has occurred since an event, people may feel as if time has passed quickly when they discover the true amount of time since that event.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;  This explanation is one reason for why people perceive time as moving faster as they age, but it does not take into account changes in the amount of telescoping that occurs with age.  People are best at accurately identifying dates when they are ages 35–50.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;  Participants age 60 and older show a decrease in the degree of forward telescoping and tend to date events too remotely instead of too recently.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The sensation of time speeding up may be derived from the fact that time is subjectively longer and therefore people assume that the time must be going by more quickly.&lt;ref name= "Draa2"/&gt;

===Minimizing the effect===
The way a question is phrased is an important factor in minimizing the telescoping effect. If a question clearly defines the time period of interest, telescoping errors will be reduced.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Also, if a question is more specific or difficult, it requires more [[reconstructive memory|reconstructive processes]]; therefore, the answers to these questions will include less telescoping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prohaska|first=Vincent|author2=Brown, Norman R. |author3=Belli, Robert F. |title=Forward Telescoping: The Question Matters|journal=Memory|year=1998|volume=6|pages=455–465|doi=10.1080/741942604|issue=4|pmid=9829101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neter and Waksberg also developed a procedure called bounded recall to help decrease the effect of telescoping.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; In preliminary interviews, participants are asked about events, and then, in later interviews, participants are reminded of these events and then asked about additional occurrences.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; One limitation of this process is that it requires information from preliminary interviews be correct.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;

A person's temporal framework is also related to the amount of telescoping errors that they make.&lt;ref name= "Janssen"/&gt; As a person's temporal framework becomes more elaborate, they have more reference points from which to date events and commit fewer telescoping errors.&lt;ref name= "Janssen"/&gt;

==Implications==

===Substance use===
The telescoping effect is pertinent for behaviors such as smoking and alcohol usage, especially when they are early onset behaviors.  Studies of the telescoping effect have examined the reported age of onset of [[smoking]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and drug use.  Forward telescoping has been found in reported age of initial use of cigarettes and in reported age of beginning daily smoking.&lt;ref name= "Johnson3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Eric O.|author2=Schultz, Lonni |title=Forward telescoping bias in reported age of onset: an example from cigarette smoking|journal=International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research|date=2005|volume=14|pages=119–129|doi=10.1002/mpr.2|issue=3|pmid=16389888}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, people may be misclassified as having late onset of drug use, when in reality, they had early onset.&lt;ref name="Johnson3" /&gt;  Forward telescoping of risky behaviors can be problematic in monitoring patients for issues associated with early onset drug use because if they are misclassified, they may not be correctly monitored.&lt;ref name="Johnson3" /&gt;  The same effect of forward telescoping is found for [[marijuana]], alcohol, and hard drug usage.&lt;ref name=Golub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golub|first=Andrew|author2=Johnson, Bruce D. |author3=Labouvie, Eric |journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology|date=2000|volume=16|pages=45–68|doi=10.1023/A:1007573411129|pmid=21544259|title=On Correcting Biases in Self-Reports of Age at First Substance Use with Repeated Cross-Section Analysis|issue=1|pmc=3085261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of forward telescoping on these behaviors are similar to those of smoking.&lt;ref name=Golub/&gt;

In the [[United States]], in the 1950s, a telescoping effect was observed with women entering alcohol abuse treatment programs with shorter histories than their male counterparts, but with symptoms of equivalent severity.&lt;ref name="M.D.Seeman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romans|first1=Sarah E. |last2=Seeman|first2=Mary V.|title=Women's Mental Health: A Life-Cycle Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azXsnaRdDRQC&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=23 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-5129-2|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forward telescoping of alcohol histories is still prevalent today and has since been observed in opiate abuse and [[pathological gambling]].&lt;ref name="M.D.Seeman2006"/&gt; Several theories have been suggested to explain the effect, though the exact mechanism remains unclear.&lt;ref name="BradyBack2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Kathleen T.|last2=Back|first2=Sudie E.|last3=Greenfield|first3=Shelly F.|title=Women and Addiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=euKt9az2tUIC&amp;pg=PA345|accessdate=23 March 2013|date=2 April 2009|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60623-403-7|pages=344–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--expand with theories--&gt;

===Marketing===
{{main|Marketing}}

Marketing firms often use survey data to estimate when consumers will next buy a product. Telescoping errors may bias these estimates and cause faulty marketing campaigns. Respondents on marketing research surveys are often inaccurate when recalling the time period of their last purchase, and forward telescoping is common.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Backward telescoping is also common and leads to respondents overstating their intention to buy a replacement product as they underestimate the likelihood of their product breaking down.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Telescoping has a significant effect on market research and therefore should be taken into account in marketing strategies.

The '''tetrad test''' is a series of behavioral paradigms in which rodents treated with [[cannabinoids]] such as [[THC]] show effects.&lt;ref&gt;Little, P.J.; Compton, D.R.; Johnson, M.R.; Melvin, L.S.; Martin, B.R. (1988). Pharmacology and stereoselectivity of structurally novel cannabinoids in mice. ''J Pharmacol Exp Ther'' 247: 1046–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fride, E., A. Perchuk, F. S. Hall, G. R. Uhl, and E. S. Onaivi. 2006. Behavioral methods in cannabinoid research. Pp. 269–290 in E. S. Onaivi, ed. Marijuana and Cannabinoid Research: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is widely used for screening drugs that induce [[cannabinoid receptor]]-mediated effects in rodents. The four behavioral components of the tetrad are spontaneous activity, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia. Common assays for these behavioral paradigms are as follows:
* Spontaneous activity (or [[hypomotility]]) is determined by an [[Open field (animal test)|open field test]], in which a mouse is placed in a cage with perpendicular grid lines, usually spaced by approx. 1 inch. An experimenter counts the number of line crossings by the mouse in a given amount of time.
* [[Catalepsy]] is determined by the bar test. The mouse is placed on a bar oriented parallel to and approximately 1 inch off of the ground. If the mouse remains immobile on the bar for typically more than 20 seconds, it is considered cataleptic.
* [[Hypothermia]] (reduced body temperature) is determined by using a rectal probe to measure the rectal temperature.
* [[Analgesia]] is usually determined by the [[Hot plate test|hot plate]] or tail immersion test. In the hot plate test, the mouse is placed on a heated plate, typically between 54 and 58°C. An experimenter measures the time it takes for the animal to raise its feet or jump off of the hot plate. In the tail immersion test, the mouse is immobilized and its tail is placed into a warm water bath, typically also between 54 and 58°C. An experimenter measures the time it takes for the mouse to remove its tail from the water bath.

Direct [[cannabinoid receptor 1|CB1]] agonists, such as [[THC]] (the psychoactive component of [[marijuana]]), or [[WIN 55,212-2]], have effects in all components of the tetrad and induce hypomotility, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia in rodents. Accordingly, all true "tetrad effects" are not observed following treatment with [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] or [[inverse agonist|inverse agonists]] of CB1 such as [[rimonabant]].

'''The Kindness Offensive''' ('''TKO''') is a group based in [[London]] known for orchestrating large-scale [[random acts of kindness]], involving the distribution of industrial quantities of goods to unsuspecting members of the public and charities. The group's stated purpose is to "Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty", a phrase first coined by [[Anne Herbert (writer)|Anne Herbert]].

==History==
The Kindness Offensive was formed in August 2008, when three of the four founding members (David Goodfellow, Benny Crane and James Hunter) asked members of the public in [[Hampstead]] what "[[random acts of kindness]]" they would like done for them. They received many requests from the public, and the group attempted to meet some of them by contacting companies and persuading them to donate the required goods for free, a technique developed by fourth founding member Robert Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jochan Embley |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/independent-on-sundays-happy-list-2014-not-the-rich-list-robert-williams-kindness-giver-9430850.html |title=Independent on Sunday's Happy List 2014 (NOT the Rich List): Robert Williams, kindness giver - News - People |publisher=The Independent |date=2014-05-25 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to by the group as "phone whispering".

TKO attracted press attention in October 2008 for giving away twenty-five tonnes of non-perishable foods to fourteen soup kitchens and drop-in centres across London England; the event came to be known as 'The Mountain of Food'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7657122.stm |title=England &amp;#124; 'Kindness offensive' begins |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was the first of many large-scale events centred on distributing industrial quantities of goods in short periods of time to a wide variety of locations and causes; the most notable of these were The Vinspired Kindness Offensive (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7796092.stm |title=England &amp;#124; Hampers at the ready |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuOa8kQDud0 |title=An act of kindness |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Stuff Kindness Offensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4ZJcmFCKfY |title=A festive kindness offensive |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely reported as a record-breaking event (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHuWuOqYYC4 |title=A hundred volunteers &amp; ONE dog |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barclaycard Kindness Offensive (2011) the Hasbro Kindness Offensive (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvB-6nIyItk |title=Kids show true Christmas spirit |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-12-16 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Read Free!

As well as large giveaways, TKO has also staged a series of pop-up events, including The Everyday Kindness Awards in 2009. Over the course of a weekend, actors in public places pretended to need help, and when members of the public stepped up to offer a hand, they received a pop-up celebration rewarding their kindness with champagne, flowers and a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8201806.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; Project rewards acts of kindness |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo''' (April 11, 1925 – March 25, 1965) was a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]]&lt;ref name="uua"/&gt; [[civil rights]] activist from [[Michigan]]. In March 1965 Liuzzo, then a housewife and mother of five with a history of local activism, heeded the call of [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and traveled from [[Detroit]], Michigan, to [[Selma, Alabama]] in the wake of the [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]] attempt at marching across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]].  Liuzzo participated in the successful [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and helped with coordination and logistics. Driving back from a trip shuttling fellow activists to the Montgomery airport, she was murdered by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. She was 39 years old.

One of the four Klansmen in the car from which the shots were fired was [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) informant [[Gary Thomas Rowe]].&lt;ref name="uua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |title=Viola Liuzzo |work=Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography |publisher=Uua.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316062159/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |archive-date=2013-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrhighdropout.com/post/105092804453/government-evils-not-to-be-forgotten |title=Government Evils Not To Be Forgotten |publisher=JrHighDropOut.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rowe testified against the shooters and was given [[witness protection]] by the FBI.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/04/us/gary-t-rowe-jr-64-who-informed-on-klan-in-civil-rights-killing-is-dead.html|title=Gary T. Rowe Jr., 64, Who Informed on Klan In Civil Rights Killing, Is Dead|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI later leaked what were purported to be salacious details about Liuzzo. The FBI attempted to downplay the situation and discredit Liuzzo by spreading rumors that she was a member of the [[Communist Party]], was a heroin addict,&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;Jack Anderson (March 21, 1983). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19830321&amp;id=QV1GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zTENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2477,2441456&amp;hl=en "Hoover smear tactics hurt civil rights case"]. ''The Evening News''.&lt;/ref&gt; and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-Americans involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Viola Liuzzo|url = http://uudb.org/articles/violaliuzzo.html|website = uudb.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these were either proved or substantiated in any way.

In addition to other honors, Liuzzo's name is today inscribed on the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], created by Maya Lin.

==Early life==
Liuzzo was born '''Viola Fauver Gregg''' on April 1, 1925, in the small town of [[California, Pennsylvania]], the elder daughter of Eva Wilson, a teacher, and Heber Ernest Gregg, a coal miner and World War I veteran. He left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother Eva had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. The couple had one other daughter, Rose Mary, in 1930. While on the job, Heber's right hand was blown off in a mine explosion and, during the [[Great Depression]], the Greggs became solely dependent on Eva's income. Work was very hard to come by for Mrs. Gregg, as she could pick up only sporadic, short-term teaching positions. The family descended further into poverty and decided to move from Georgia to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where Eva found a teaching position, when Viola was six.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"&gt;Stanton, Mary (2004). "Viola Liuzzo and the Gendered Politics of Martyrdom: From Selma to Sorrow: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo". ''[[Harvard Women's Law Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family was very poor and lived in one-room shacks with no running water. The schools Liuzzo attended did not have adequate supplies and the teachers were too busy to give extra attention to children in need. Because the family moved so often, Liuzzo never began and ended the school year in the same place. Having spent much of her childhood and adolescence poor in Tennessee, Viola experienced the segregated nature of the South firsthand. This would have a powerful impact on her activism. It was during her formative years that she realized the injustice of segregation and racism, as she and her family, in similar conditions of great poverty, were still afforded social privilege and amenities denied to African-Americans under the Jim Crow laws.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/93289614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michigan==
In 1941 the Gregg family moved to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], where her father sought a job assembling bombs at the Ford Motor Co. Viola's strong-willed nature led her to drop out of high school after one year, and elope at the age of 16. The marriage did not last and she returned to her family. Two years later the Gregg family moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], which was starkly segregated by race.  Tensions between whites and blacks there was very high and the early 1940s saw violence and rioting.  Witnessing these horrific ordeals was a major motivator that influenced Viola's future civil rights work.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 she married George Argyris, the manager of a restaurant where she worked. They had two children, Penny and Evangeline Mary, and divorced in 1949.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; She later married Anthony Liuzzo, a [[Teamsters]] union business agent.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teamsters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teamster.org/content/civil-rights-martyr-viola-liuzzo |title=Civil Rights Martyr Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Teamsters]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children: Tommy, Anthony Jr. and Sally.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;  Liuzzo sought to return to school, and attended the Carnegie Institute in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. She then enrolled part-time at [[Wayne State University]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="uu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Viola Liuzzo |url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626124213/http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 26, 2003 |publisher=[[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 she began attending the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Detroit, and joined the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;

A large part of Viola's activism, particularly with the NAACP, was due to a close friendship with an African-American woman, Sarah Evans. After initially meeting in a grocery store where Liuzzo worked as a cashier, the two kept in touch. Evans eventually became Liuzzo's housekeeper while still maintaining a close, friendly relationship in which they shared similar views including support for the civil rights movement. In the aftermath of Liuzzo's death, Evans would go on to become the permanent caretaker of Liuzzo's five young children.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt;

Liuzzo so passionately believed in the fight for civil rights that she helped organize Detroit protests, attended civil rights conferences and worked with the NAACP. She had a strong desire to make a difference on as large a scale as she could.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"/&gt;

==Local activism==
In addition to actively supporting the civil rights movement, Liuzzo was also notable for her protest against Detroit's laws that allowed for students to more easily drop out of school. Her disagreement with this law led her to withdraw her children from school in protest. Because she deliberately home-schooled them for two months, Liuzzo was arrested, but did not waiver. She pleaded guilty in court and was placed on probation.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt;

==Selma==
In February 1965 a night demonstration for voting rights at the Marion, Alabama, courthouse turned violent. State troopers clubbed marchers and beat and shot a 26-year-old African-American named [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], who later died. His death spurred on the fight for civil rights in Selma, Alabama. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) scheduled a protest march for Sunday, March 7, 1965. Gov. George Wallace banned the march, but the ban was ignored. Six hundred marchers headed for the arched [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] that crossed the Alabama River. As the protesters reached the crest of the bridge, they saw a terrifying sight on the other side: state troopers armed with clubs, whips and tear gas and a sheriff's posse on horseback. When told to stop and disperse, the marchers refused. The troopers advanced on the marchers, clubbing and whipping them, fracturing bones and gashing heads. Seventeen people were hospitalized on the day later called "[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]".

Liuzzo was horrified by the images of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|aborted march]] on Bloody Sunday. A second march took place March 9. Troopers, police and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, the [[Rev. Martin Luther King]] led the marchers back to the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Branch | first = Taylor | title = The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist [[James Reeb]], a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group.&lt;ref&gt;http://uudb.org/articles/jamesjosephreeb.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On March 16, Liuzzo took part in a protest at Wayne State. She then called her husband to tell him she would be traveling to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] after hearing the Rev Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. call for people of all faiths to come and help, saying that the struggle "was everybody's fight."   Leaving her children in the care of family and friends she contacted the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who took her on and tasked her with delivering aid to various locations, welcoming and recruiting volunteers and transporting volunteers and marchers to and from airports, bus terminals and train stations, for which she volunteered the use of her car,&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt; a 1963 [[Oldsmobile]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On March 21, 1965 more than 3,000 people began the third march, including blacks, whites, doctors, nurses, working-class people, priests, nuns, rabbis, homemakers, students, actors, and farmers. Many famous people participated, including Dr. Martin Luther King, [[Ralph Bunche]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Ralph Abernathy]], and [[Andrew Young]]. It took five days for the protesters to reach their goal. Liuzzo marched the first full day and returned to Selma for the night. That Wednesday, March 24, she rejoined the march four miles from the end, where a "Night of the Stars" celebration was held the City of St. Jude with performances by many popular entertainers of the day, including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Dick Gregory]]. Liuzzo helped at the first aid station. On Thursday, Liuzzo and other marchers reached the state capitol building, with a Confederate flag flying above it. Martin Luther King addressed the crowd of 25,000, calling the march, a "shining moment in American history."{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Murder and aftermath==
After the third march concluded on March 25, Liuzzo, assisted by Leroy Moton, a 19-year-old [[African American]], continued shuttling marchers and volunteers from Montgomery back to Selma in her car.  As they were driving along Route 80, a car tried to force them off the road. After dropping passengers in Selma, she and Moton headed back to Montgomery. As they were getting gas at a local filling station, they were subject to abusive calls and racist scorn. When Liuzzo stopped at a red light, a car with four members of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] pulled up alongside her. When they saw a white woman and a black man in a car together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them. Overtaking the Oldsmobile, they shot directly at Liuzzo, mortally wounding her twice in the head. The car veered into a ditch, crashing into a fence.&lt;ref name="teamsters"/&gt;

Although Moton was covered with blood, the bullets missed him. He lay motionless when the Klansmen reached the car to check on their victims. After the Klansmen left, Moton began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Like Moton and Liuzzo, Riley was shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.

Liuzzo's funeral was held at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church on March 30 in Detroit, with many prominent members of both the civil rights movement and government there to pay their respects. Included in this group were [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]; [[NAACP]] executive director [[Roy Wilkins]]; [[Congress on Racial Equality]] national leader [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]]; Michigan lieutenant governor [[William G. Milliken]]; Teamsters president [[Jimmy Hoffa]]; and [[United Auto Workers]] president [[Walter Reuther]]. She was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Less than two weeks after her death, a [[Cross burning|charred cross]] was found in front of four Detroit homes, including the Liuzzo residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fourth Cross Is Burned On Detroit Lawn |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/823323// |newspaper=[[The Brownsville Herald]]|date=April 4, 1964|page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=August 4, 2014}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and legal proceedings==
The four Klan members in the car, Collie Wilkins (21), FBI informant Gary Rowe (34), William Eaton (41) and Eugene Thomas (42) were quickly arrested; within 24 hours, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] appeared on national television to announce their arrest. In order to avoid bad press, President Johnson made sure to focus on the positive work of the FBI agents' solving of the murder of Viola Liuzzo, in an attempt to divert scrutiny away from the fact that one of the men in the car, Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr., was an FBI informant and therefore protected by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/111/3/870.full |author=Gary May |title=The Informant: The FBI, The Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2005 |page=431 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alabama mistrial and acquittal===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
Wilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were indicted in the State of Alabama for Liuzzo's death on April 22. FBI informant Rowe was not indicted and served as a witness.  Rowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots on the order of Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/3141/Collie-Leroy-Wilkins-Trial-1965.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal civil trial===
The next phase of the lengthy process began when a federal trial charged the defendants with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|Ku Klux Klan Act]], a [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] civil rights statute. The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo's murder. On December 3, the trio were found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p 130&lt;/ref&gt;

While out on appeal, Wilkins and Thomas were each found guilty of firearms violations and sent to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of the ''[[Birmingham News]]'' published an ad offering Liuzzo's bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking $3,500, the ad read, "Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact. Ideal to bring in crowds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liuzzo protests car advertising|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EcIlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HPUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2564,308263&amp;dq=vilola+liuzzo&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=Baltimore Afro-American|date=18 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After all three defendants were convicted of the federal charges, state murder cases proceeded against Eaton and Thomas. Eaton, the only defendant who remained out of jail, died of a heart attack on March 9. Thomas's state murder trial – the final trial – got under way on September 26, 1966. The prosecution built a strong circumstantial case in the trial that included an FBI ballistics expert testifying that the bullet removed from the woman's brain was fired from a revolver owned by Thomas. Two witnesses testified they had seen Wilkins drinking beer at a [[VFW]] Hall near Birmingham, 125 miles from the murder scene, an hour or less after Liuzzo was shot. Despite the presence of eight African Americans on the jury, Thomas was acquitted of the state murder charge the following day after just 90 minutes of deliberations. State attorney general [[Richmond Flowers, Sr.]] criticized the verdict, deriding the black members of the panel, who had been carefully screened, as "[[Uncle Tom]]s."

On April 27, 1967, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[New Orleans]] upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants. Thomas served six years in prison for the crime. Due to threats from the Klan, both before and after his testimony, Gary Thomas Rowe went into the federal witness protection program.&lt;ref name=RoweVGriffin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openjurist.org/676/f2d/524/rowe-v-griffin-o |title=676 F. 2d 524 – Rowe v.

==FBI cover-up and leaks==
Within 24 hours after Liuzzo's assassination by the Ku Klux Klan and the FBI's informant Gary Thomas Rowe, [[J. Edgar Hoover]] began a smear campaign to the press, to subordinate FBI agents and to select politicians, claiming the cut marks from the car's shattered window were "puncture marks in her arm indicating recent use of a hypodermic needle; she was sitting very, very close to that negro in the car; that it has the appearance of a necking party."&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt;

While attempting to obscure the fact that an FBI informant was in the car, and to ensure that the FBI was not held responsible for permitting their informant to participate in violent acts, without FBI surveillance or backup, the FBI was concerned that they might be held accountable for their informant's (Rowe) role in the death.  Rowe had been an informant for the FBI since 1960. The FBI was aware that Rowe had participated in acts of violence during Ku Klux Klan activities. On the day of Liuzzo's death, prior to the shooting, Rowe called his FBI contact and notified him that Rowe and other Klansman were travelling to Montgomery, and that violence was planned.&lt;ref name="Stanton, pp 52-55"&gt;Stanton, pp 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autopsy testing in 1965 showed no traces of drugs in Liuzzo's system, and that she had not had sex recently at the time of death.   The FBI's role in the smear campaign was uncovered in 1978 when Liuzzo's children obtained case documents from the FBI under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, pp 52–55, 189–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p 201.  Quote from Penny on p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and subsequent lawsuits==
[[File:Memorial to Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo, (Lowndes County, Alabama).jpg|thumb|200 px|Memorial to Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo in Lowndes County, Alabama]]
Liuzzo was condemned by different racist organizations for having brought her death upon herself. At the time, Liuzzo's choice to immerse herself in such a dangerous undertaking was seen by some as radical and controversial. However, of all the deaths to occur during the campaign, Liuzzo's was the only one scrutinized in such a way, where other male activists who were killed were recognized as heroes.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"/&gt;

Rowe was indicted in 1978 and tried for his involvement in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The first trial ended in a [[hung jury]], and the second trial ended in his acquittal.&lt;ref name=RoweVGriffin/&gt;

On May 27, 1983, Judge [[Charles Wycliffe Joiner]] rejected the claims in the Liuzzo family lawsuit, saying there was "no evidence the FBI was in any type of joint venture with Rowe or conspiracy against Mrs. Liuzzo. Rowe's presence in the car was the principal reason why the crime was solved so quickly." In response to the verdict, Liuzzo family lawyer Dean A. Robb said "This is a terrible opinion. I'm shocked. I think this is incredible."&lt;ref name="AAN"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pyen |first1=Chong |last2=Cain |first2=Stephen |title=Judge Rules Against Liuzzo Family |url=https://aadl.org/aa_news_19830527-judge_rules_against_liuzzo_family |accessdate=4 August 2018 |work=Ann Arbor News |date=27 May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1983, the FBI was awarded $79,873 in court costs,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture'' {{ISBN|978-0-313-32944-9}} p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; but costs were later reduced to $3,645 after the [[ACLU]] appealed on behalf of the family.&lt;ref&gt;See Liuzzo v. US, 565 F. Supp. 640 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Walter P. Reuther Library]] contains original archival material surrounding Liuzzo and her case. [http://reuther.wayne.edu/files/UP001745_.pdf The Viola Liuzzo Papers] contain documentation of the events surrounding the murder, the resulting investigation, and later legal involvement of the Liuzzo Family. The papers contain FBI murder investigation files and completed Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for the FBI's involvement with the Ku Klux Klan. Several documents relate to the Freedom Riders.

Liuzzo was featured in part 3 of a series of videos, ''Free at Last: Civil Rights Heroes''.

Her murder was shown in Episode 2 of the ''[[King (TV miniseries)|King]]'' miniseries.

Viola Liuzzo Park is located at Winthrop and Trojan in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/2015/04/07/viola-liuzzo-detroit-wayne-state-degree-selma-civil-rights/25432865/ |title=Week of events will honor Viola Liuzzo |publisher=Detroitnews.com |date=2015-04-07 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liuzzo has her name included as part of the [[Civil Rights Memorial]], a monument in Montgomery, Alabama, created by [[Maya Lin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/civil-rights-memorial/civil-rights-martyrs |title=Civil Rights Martyrs &amp;#124; Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Splcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Liuzzo was the subject of a documentary, ''[[Home of the Brave (2004 film)|Home of the Brave]]''.

In 2008, Liuzzo's story was memorialized in a song, "Color Blind Angel" by the late blues singer [[Robin Rogers]] on her [[album]] ''Treat Me Right''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Hal |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/treat-me-right-mw0000789597 |title=Treat Me Right – Robin Rogers : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Viola Liuzzo Ethics Scholarship was started at [[Adrian College]] by her grandson, Joshua James Liuzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/adriancollege_/docs/contactmagspring2012/23 |title=Contact Magazine Spring 2012 by Adrian College |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''Outside Agitators'' was written by 20% Theater's Artistic Associate, Laura Nessler. Inspired by and based on Liuzzo's story, the play premiered at the Prop Theater in Chicago, Illinois, on September 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/outside-agitators/Event?oid=14993117|title=Outside Agitators|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liuzzo was played by [[Tara Ochs]] in the 2014 film [[Selma (film)|''Selma'']].

In 2015, [[Wayne State University]] bestowed its first posthumous honorary doctorate degree on Liuzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spratling |first=Cassandra |url=http://www.freep.com/story/life/2015/04/10/viola-liuzzo-wayne-state-university-honor/25603257/ |title=Wayne State hails civil rights icon Viola Liuzzo as hero |publisher=Freep.com |date=1965-03-25 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vipāka''' ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]]) is a [[Buddhist]] term for the ripening or maturation of ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'' (Pāli ''kamma''), or intentional actions. The theory of karmic action and result (''kamma-vipāka'') is a central belief within the Buddhist tradition.

==Alternate translations==
The term ''vipaka'' is translated as:
* effect (Ven. D. Mahinda Thera&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metta.lk/english/buddhist-points.htm Buddhist Points Misunderstood], by Ven. D. Mahinda Thera&lt;/ref&gt;)
* maturation (Keown, 2000, loc 810-813)
* ripening (Harvey, 1990, p. 39{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=39-40}})
* result

==Within the discourses==
The Samyutta Nikaya states:
{{quote|
According to the seed that’s sown,&lt;br /&gt;
So is the fruit you reap therefrom,&lt;br /&gt;
Doer of good will gather good,&lt;br /&gt;
Doer of evil, evil reaps,&lt;br /&gt;
Down is the seed and thou shalt taste the fruit thereof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7524">The '''Waelz process''' is a method of recovering [[zinc]] and other relatively low boiling point metals from metallurgical waste (typically EAF flue dust) and other recycled materials using a rotary kiln ('''''waelz kiln''''').

The zinc enriched product is referred to as '''''waelz oxide''''', and the reduced zinc by product as '''''waelz slag'''''.

==History and description==
The concept of using a [[rotary kiln]] for the recovery of Zinc by volatization dates to at least 1888.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|p=11}} A process was patented by Edward Dedolph in 1910. Subsequently, the Dedpolph patent was taken up and developed by [[Metallgesellschaft]] (Frankfurt) with [[Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron]] but without leading to a production scale ready process. In 1923 the [[Krupp Grusonwerk]] independently developed a process (1923), named the ''Waelz process'' (from the German ''Waelzen'', a reference to the motion of the materials in the kiln); the two German firms later collaborated and improved the process marketing under the name ''Waelz-Gemeinschaft'' (German for Waelz association).{{sfn|Harris|1936}}

The process consists of treating zinc containing material, in which zinc can be in the form [[zinc oxide]], [[zinc silicate (disambiguation)|zinc silicate]], [[zinc ferrite]], [[zinc sulphide]] together with a carbon containing reductant/fuel, within a rotary kiln at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|p=11}} The kiln feed material comprising zinc 'waste', fluxes and reductant (coke) is typically pelletized before addition to the kiln.&lt;ref name="z2000"/&gt; The chemical process involves the reduction of zinc compounds to elemental zinc (boiling point 907&amp;nbsp;°C) which volatalises, which oxidises in the vapour phase to zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is collected from the kiln outlet exhaust by filters/electrostatic precipitators/settling chambers etc.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|pp=11, 13}}&lt;ref name="z2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|Daley|Stephens|2000|loc = [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118788073.ch29/summary Recovery of Zinc Oxide from secondary raw materials : New developments of the Waelz Process]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiln size is typically {{convert|50|by|3.6|m}} long / internal diameter, with a rotation speed of around 1 rpm. The recovered dust (''Waelz oxide'') is enriched in zinc oxide and is a feed product for zinc smelters, the zinc reduced by-product is known as ''Waelz slag''. Sub-optimal features of the process are high energy consumption, and lack of iron recovery (and iron rich slag).&lt;ref name="z2000"/&gt; The process also captures other low boiling metals in the ''waelz oxide'' including lead, cadmium and silver.{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|p=118}} Halogen compounds are also present in the product oxide.{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|p=119}}

Increased use of [[galvanised]] steel has resulted in increased levels of zinc in steel scrap which in turn leads to higher levels of zinc in [[electric arc furnace]] flue dusts - as of 2000 the waelz process is considered to be a "[[best available technology]]" for flue dust zinc recovery, and the process is used at industrial scale worldwide.{{sfn|Stewart|Daley|Stephens|2000|loc = [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118788073.ch29/summary Recovery of Zinc Oxide from secondary raw materials : New developments of the Waelz Process]}}

As of 2014 the Waelz process is the preferred or most widely used process for zinc recovery of zinc from [[electric arc furnace]] dust (90%).{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|pp=117-118, 119}}

Alternative production and experimental scale zinc recovery processes include the rotary hearth treatment of pelletised zinc containing dust ([[Kimitsu Steel Works|Kimitsu works]], Nippon Steel);&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.nssmc.com/en/tech/report/nsc/pdf/8607.pdf| title = Dust Recycling Technology by the Rotary Hearth Furnace| first = Hiroshi|last  =Oda| first2 = Tetsuharu| last2 = Ibaraki| first3= Masaharu| last3 = Takahashi| work = Nippon Steel Technical Report| number = 86| date = July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= http://mmmmconferences.com/01JyunpeiKikuta_29Sept2012.pdf | title = Dust Recycling System by the Rotary Hearth Furnace| first = Hiroshi|last  =Oda| first2 = Tetsuharu| last2 = Ibaraki| first3= Youichi| last3 = Abe | work = Nippon Steel Technical Report| number = 94| date = July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SDHL (Saage, Dittrich, Hasche, Langbein) process, an efficiency modification of the Waelz process;&lt;ref name="z2000"/&gt; the "DK process" a modified blast furnace process producing pig iron and zinc (oxide) dust from blast furnace dusts, sludges and other wastes;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.dk-duisburg.de/en/unternehmen/img/artikel_stahleisen2006.pdf| title = Solutions for dusts and sludges from the BOF process| first = Carsten|last = Hillmann| first2= Karl-Josef| last2 = Sassen| journal = Stahl und Eisin| volume = 126| year = 2006| number = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PRIMUS process (multi-stage zinc volatilisation furnace).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = J.

*An example of [[fine art]], such as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]
*An object that has been designed specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of [[jewellery]]
*An object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional purpose, as in [[interior design]] and much [[folk art]] 
*An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by [[Culture|cultural]] outsiders)
*A non-ephemeral [[photograph]], [[film]] or visual [[computer program]], such as a [[video game]] or [[computer animation]]
*A work of [[installation art]] or [[conceptual art]].
Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:
*A fine work of [[architecture]] or [[landscape design]]
*A production of live [[performance]], such as [[theater]], [[ballet]], [[opera]], [[performance art]], musical [[concert]] and other [[performing arts]], and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.

This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as [[aural]]-[[music]] and written word-[[literature]] have similar issues and philosophies.  The term ''[[objet d'art]]'' is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical).  The term '''''oeuvre''''' is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre Oeuvre] Merriam Webster Dictionary, Accessed April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''work of art'' in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent [[aesthetic]] function.  A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger [[art movement]] or artistic [[era]], such as: a [[genre]], aesthetic [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[culture]], or regional-national distinction.&lt;ref name=gell1998/&gt; It can also be seen as an item within an artist's "body of work" or ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]''. The term is commonly used by: [[museum]] and [[cultural heritage management|cultural heritage]] [[curator]]s, the interested public, the [[patronage|art patron]]-private [[art collector]] community, and [[art gallery|art galleries]].&lt;ref name=macdonald2006/&gt;

Physical objects that document immaterial or [[conceptual art]] works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some [[Dada]] and [[Neo-Dada]] conceptual and [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] works have received later inclusion. Also, some [[architectural rendering]]s and [[architectural model|model]]s of unbuilt projects, such as by [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[Frank Gehry]], are other examples.

The products of [[environmental design]], depending on intention and execution, can be "works of art" and include: [[land art]], [[site-specific art]], [[architecture]], [[garden]]s, [[landscape architecture]], [[installation art]], [[rock art]], and [[megalith|megalithic monuments]].

Legal definitions of "work of art" are used in [[copyright]] law; ''see {{slink|Visual arts|United States of America copyright definition of visual art}}''.

==Theories==
[[Marcel Duchamp]] critiqued the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.) 1997, ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Michael Craig-Martin]], creator of ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', said of his work – ''"It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual [[oak|oak tree]] is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/theres-no-need-to-be-afraid-of-the-present-625001.html "There's No Need to be Afraid of the Present"], ''The Independent'', 25 Jun 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==

Some [[Art criticism|art theorist]]s and writers have long made a distinction between the [[physical art|physical qualities of an art object]] and its identity-status as an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804100009/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/08/gabos3.shtm |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a painting by [[Rembrandt]] has a physical existence as an "oil painting on canvas" that is separate from its identity as a [[masterpiece]] "work of art" or the artist's ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rembrandtresearchproject.org/|title=Rembrandt Research Project - Home|work=rembrandtresearchproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many works of art are initially denied "museum quality" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the [[Impressionists]] and non-representational [[abstract art]]ists are examples. Some, such as the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|"Readymades" of Marcel Duchamp]] including his infamous urinal ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.

There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between "[[fine art]]" objects made by "[[artist]]s"; and  [[folk art]], [[handicraft|craft-work]], or "[[Applied arts|applied art]]" objects made by "first, second, or third-world" [[designer]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[Artisan|craftspeople]]. Contemporary and archeological [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous art]], [[industrial design]] items in limited or [[mass production]], and places created by [[environmental design]]ers and [[cultural landscape]]s, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.
