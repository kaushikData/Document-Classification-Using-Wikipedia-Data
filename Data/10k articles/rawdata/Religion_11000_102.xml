      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4944">{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=5}}

The work known by its incipit, '''Angim''', “The Return of [[Ninurta]] to [[Nippur]],” is a rather obsequious 210-line mythological praise poem for the ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n warrior-god Ninurta, describing his return to Nippur from an expedition to the mountains (&lt;small&gt;KUR&lt;/small&gt;), where he boasts of his triumphs against "rebel lands" (&lt;small&gt;KI.BAL&lt;/small&gt;), boasting to [[Enlil]] in the [[Ekur]], before returning to the Ešumeša temple &amp;ndash; to “manifest his authority and kingship.”

The ancient [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] epic had been provided with an intralinear [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] translation during the course of the second millennium.

==The Myth==

Three copies from Nippur provide a subscript labeling it a šìr-gíd-da, or “long song,” of Ninurta,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = From an Antique Land: An Introduction to Ancient Near Eastern Literature | chapter = Sumerian Literature | author = Gonzalo Rubio | editor = Carl S. Ehrlich | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2009 | page = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the term ''long'' perhaps refers to the tuning of the musical instrument intended to accompany the song.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{ cite book | title = The return of Ninurta to Nippur: An-gim dím-ma (AnOr 52) | author = Jerrold S. Cooper | publisher = Pontificium institutum biblicum | year = 1978 | pages = 2–3, 10–13, 53ff }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extant in unilingual Sumerian from Nippur during the Old Babylonian period, and thereafter in bilingual editions from the [[Kassites|Kassite]], middle [[Assyria]]n and neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian versions, where the later ones are closer textually to the old version than the Middle Babylonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The World's Oldest Literature: Studies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres | author = William W. Hallo | publisher = Brill | year = 2009 | pages = 60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its companion composition, [[Lugal-e]], it is the only Sumerian composition other than incantations and proverbs to have survived in the canon from the Old Babylonian period into the first Millennium.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt; The title comes from the opening line: an-[gim] dím-ma, &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;en-líl-gim dím-ma, “created like An, created like Enlil.”

The narrative relates that he mounts the monsters, “slain heroes,” he has defeated as trophies on his [&lt;sup&gt;giš&lt;/sup&gt;gigir z]a-gìn-na, “shining chariot.” Echoing the number of [[Tiamat|Tiāmat]]’s eleven monstrous offspring, (from the [[Enûma Eliš]], whom [[Marduk]] had vanquished), Ninurta’s conquests included 

* wild bulls he hung on the axle, 
* captured cows on the cross-piece of the yoke, 
* a [[six-headed Wild Ram]] (šeg.&lt;small&gt;SAG-ÀŠ&lt;/small&gt;) on the dustguard, 
* [[Bašmu]] (Sumerian: Usum) on the seat, 
* [[Magilum boat|Magilum]], or "ship-locust," on the frame, 
* the bison [[Kusarikku]] (Sumerian: gud.alim) on the beam, 
* the mermaid [[Mermaid (Ninurta)|Kulianna]] on the footboard, 
* “white substance” (''gaṣṣa'', gypsum&lt;ref&gt;''gaṣṣa'' CAD g, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;), on the forward part of the yoke,
* [[strong copper]] (''urudû''&lt;ref&gt;''urudû'' CAD u pp. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt; níg kal-ga) on the inside pole pin, 
* the [[Zu (mythology)|Anzu]]-bird on the front guard and 
* the [[seven-headed serpent]] (Sumerian: muš sag-imin) possibly [[Mušmaḫḫū]] on another illegible part.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

He then journeys with his attendants, Udanna, the all-seeing god, Lugalanbadra, the bearded lord, and Lugalkudub, with full battle regalia in a terrifying procession to Nippur. [[Nusku]] warns him that he is frightening the gods, the Ananna, and, if he can tone it down a little, Enlil will reward him. In the [[Ekur]], he displays his trophies and booty to the general astonishment of the gods &amp;ndash; including his brother, the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], father, Enlil, and mother [[Ninlil]]. Ninurta then extols his virtues in a long hymn of self-praise in an effort to solicit the establishment of his own cult. On his departure from the Ekur, he is petitioned by the god [[Ninkarnunna]] to extend his blessings to the king, perhaps the underlying purpose of the whole poem. The work ends with: &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;Ninurta dumu mah é-kur-ra, “Ninurta, the magnificent scion of Ekur.”&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Greek Myths and Mesopotamia | author = Charles Penglase | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1994 | pages = 55–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient use of the text is uncertain. It may have been recited during some kind of cultic activity, such as the annual transport of the Ninurta idol between the temples, Ešumeša and Ekur.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

'''Badrinath''' or '''Badrinarayan Temple''' is a [[Hindu temple]] dedicated to [[Vishnu]] which is situated in the town of [[Badrinath]] in [[Uttarakhand]], India. The temple and town form one of the four [[Char Dham]] and [[Chota Char Dham]] [[Hindu pilgrimage|pilgrimage sites]]. The temple is also one of the 108 [[Divya Desams]] dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinath{{mdash}}holy shrines for [[Vaishnavite]]s. It is open for six months every year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region. The temple is located in [[Garhwal Himalaya|Garhwal hill]] tracks in [[Chamoli district]] along the banks of [[Alaknanda]] River at an elevation of {{convert|3133|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the mean sea level. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 1,060,000 visits.

The image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple is a {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, the black stone statue of Vishnu in the form of Badrinarayan. The statue is considered by many Hindus to be one of eight ''swayam vyakta kshetras'', or self-manifested statues of Vishnu.&lt;ref name=dhaams&gt;{{harvnb|Sen Gupta|2002|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of river [[Ganges]] on mother earth, is the most prominent festival celebrated in the Badrinath Temple. Although Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a [[Nambudiri|Nambudiri Brahmin]] chosen from the South Indian state of [[Kerala]]. The temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which later came to be known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. The committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples and has seventeen members on its board.

The temple is mentioned in ancient religious texts like ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and ''[[Skanda Purana]]''. It is glorified in the ''[[Divya Prabandha]]'', an early medieval [[Tamil literature|Tamil]] canon of the [[Alvars|Azhwar]] saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD.

[[File:Badrinath-taptkund.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tapt Kund hot springs next to Badrinath Temple, enclosed inside bath house|alt=a rectangular tank with a house on the bank and with people taking bath in the hot springs]]
The temple is located in [[Garhwal Himalaya|Garhwal]] hill tracks along the banks of the [[Alaknanda River]]{{sfn| Baynes|1878}} in [[Chamoli district]] in [[Uttarakhand]], a state in North India. The hill tracks are located {{convert|3133|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the mean sea level.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the temple|url=http://www.badarikedar.org/badrinath.aspx|publisher=Shri Badrinath - Shri Kedarnath Temples Committee|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214005611/http://badarikedar.org/badrinath.aspx|archive-date=14 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 174|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nar Parbat mountain is located opposite to the temple, while the Narayana Parbat is located behind the Neelakanta peak.&lt;ref name="Nair67"&gt;{{harvnb|Nair|2007|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple has three structures: the [[garbha grha|Garbhagriha]] (sanctum), the [[Darśana|Darshan]] Mandap (worship hall), and Sabha Mandap (convention hall).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nair67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyagi"/&gt; The conical-shaped roof of the sanctum, the ''garbhagriha'', is approximately {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with a small cupola on top, covered with a gold gilt roof.&lt;ref name="Nair67"/&gt;&lt;ref name=call&gt;{{harvnb|Nautiyal|1962|p= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facade is built of stone and has arched windows. A broad stairway leads up to the main entrance, a tall, arched gateway. Just inside is a [[mandap]], a large, pillared hall that leads to the sanctum, or main shrine area. The walls and pillars of the hall are covered with intricate carvings.&lt;ref name=dhaams/&gt;

The main shrine houses the {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Shaligram]] (black stone) idol of Lord Badrinarayana, which is housed in a gold canopy under a Badri Tree. The idol of Lord Badrinarayana shows Him holding a ''[[Shankha]]'' (conch) and a ''[[Sudarshan Chakra|Chakra]]'' (wheel) in two of His arms in a lifted posture and the other two arms resting on His lap in a ''[[Lotus position|Yogamudra]]'' (''Padmasana'') posture.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyagi"/&gt; The sanctum also houses images of the god of wealth{{mdash}}[[Kubera]], sage [[Narada]], [[Uddhava]], [[Nara-Narayana|Nar and Narayan]]. There are fifteen more images that are also worshipped around the temple. These include that of [[Lakshmi]] (the consort of Vishnu), [[Garuda]] (the [[vahana]] of Narayan), and [[Navadurga]], the manifestation of [[Durga]] in nine different forms. The temple also has shrines of Lakshmi Narasimhar and for saints [[Adi Shankara]] ({{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;788-820), [[Nara-Narayana|Nar and Narayan]],Ghantakarna, [[Vedanta Desika]]  and [[Ramanujacharya]]. All the idols of the temple are made of black stone.&lt;ref name=dhaams/&gt;&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nair67"/&gt;

The Tapt Kund, a group of hot sulfur springs just below the temple, are considered to be medicinal; many pilgrims consider it a requirement to bathe in the springs before visiting the temple. The springs have a year-round temperature of {{convert|55|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, while outside temperature is typically below {{convert|17|°C|°F|abbr=on}} all year round.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; The two water ponds in the temple are called Narad Kund and Surya Kund.&lt;ref name=Bhalla190/&gt;

==History==
{{Chota Char Dham}}
There is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in [[Vedic scriptures]] ({{circa|lk=no|1750}}–500&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).&lt;ref name="Nair67"/&gt; According to some accounts, the temple was a Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and [[Adi Shankara]] converted it to a Hindu temple.&lt;ref name="Tyagi"&gt;{{harvnb|Tyagi|1991|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sadasivan|2000|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of the temple resembling that of a [[Buddhist]] [[vihara]] (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument.&lt;ref name=dhaams/&gt; Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara resided in the place for six years from {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;814 to 820. He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the image of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami101"&gt;{{harvnb|Swami|2004|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the [[Parmar]] ruler king [[Kanak Pal]]. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title "Bolanda Badrinath", meaning speaking Badrinath. They had other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.&lt;ref name="Guha"/&gt;

The throne of Badrinath was named after the presiding deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by the devotees before proceeding to the shrine. The practice was continued until the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Guha"&gt;{{harvnb|Guha|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, the King of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] moved the murti to the present temple.&lt;ref name=call/&gt; When the state of Garhwal was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued as the chairman of the management committee.The selection of priest is  done after consultation between Garhwal and Travancore royal families&lt;ref name="Guha"/&gt;

The temple has undergone several major renovations due to its age and damage by an avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was expanded by the Kings of Garhwal. After significant damage in the great 1803 Himalayan earthquake, it was largely rebuilt by the King of [[Jaipur State|Jaipur]].&lt;ref name=dhaams/&gt; It was still under renovation as late as the 1870s{{sfn| Baynes|1878}} but these were completed by the time of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} At that time, [[Badrinath|the town]] was still small, consisting of only the 20-odd huts housing the temple's staff, but the number of pilgrims was usually between seven and ten thousand.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The Kumbh Meld festival held every twelve years raised the number of visitors to 50,000.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The temple also enjoyed revenue from the rents owed to it by various villages bequeathed by various rajas.{{sfn| Baynes|1878}}

During 2006, the state government announced the area around Badrinath as a no construction zone to curb illegal encroachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uttaranchal declares Badrinath as no construction zone|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1034737141.html|newspaper=Hindustan Times|location=Badrinath|date=9 May 2006|accessdate=1 January 2014}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
[[File:Nara narayana.jpg|thumb|[[Nara-Narayana|Nara and Narayana]]]]

According to Hindu legend, god [[Vishnu]] sat in meditation at this place. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. [[Lakshmi]], his consort, protected him in the form of the Badri tree ([[jujube]] or Indian date). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which is not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the ''[[Lotus position|padmasana]]'' posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by sage [[Narada]], who saw Vishnu's consort, Lakshmi, massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana. &lt;ref name=dhaams/&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami101"/&gt;

The ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' narrates another version of the origins of Badrinath. According to the tradition, [[Dharma|Dharam]] had two sons, Nar, and Narayan{{mdash}}both of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their religion and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.&lt;ref name="Swami101"/&gt;

==Literary mention==
The temple finds mention in several ancient books like ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref name=Bhalla190&gt;{{harvnb|Bhalla|2006|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', "[t]here in Badrikashram the Personality of Godhead (Vishnu), in his incarnation as the sages Nar and Narayana, had been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all living entities".&lt;ref name=bhagavatam&gt;[[#Bhagavata|Bhagavata Purana]] 3.4.22&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Skanda Purana'' states that "[t]here are several sacred shrines in heaven, on earth, and in hell; but there is no shrine like Badrinath". The area around Badrinath is also celebrated in ''[[Padma Purana]]'' as abounding in spiritual treasures.&lt;ref name=call/&gt; The ''Mahabharata'' revered the holy place as the one which can give salvation to devotees arriving close to if, while in other holy places they must perform religious ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Bhalla190/&gt; The temple is revered in ''[[Nalayira Divya Prabandham]]'', in 11 hymns in the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon by [[Periazhwar]] and in 13 hymns in [[Thirumangai Alvar|Thirumangai Azhwar]]. It is one of the 108 ''[[Divyadesam]]'' dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinath.&lt;ref name="dinamalar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Badrinath Perumal temple|url=http://temple.dinamalar.com/New.php?id=1783|publisher=Dinamalar|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Badrinath temple is one of five related shrines called [[Sapta Badri|Panch Badri]], which are dedicated to the worship of Vishnu.&lt;ref name=bansal&gt;{{harvnb|Bansal|2005|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five temples are Vishal Badri - Badrinath Temple in Badrinath, [[Sapta Badri#Yogadhyan Badri|Yogadhyan Badri]] located at Pandukeshwar, Bhavishya Badri located {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} from Jyotirmath at Subain, Vridh Badri located {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} from Jyotirmath in Animath and Adi Badri located {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} from [[Karnaprayag]]. The temple is considered one of the holiest Hindu ''[[Char Dham]]'' (four divine) sites, comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath, [[Puri]] and [[Dwarka]].&lt;ref name="Chakra"&gt;{{harvnb|Chakravarti|1994|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the temple's origins are not clearly known, the [[Advaita]] school of Hinduism established by Adi Shankara attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer.&lt;ref name="Mittal"/&gt; The four monasteries are located across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North, [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] at Puri in the East, [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarakadheesh Temple]] at Dwarka in the West and [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|Sri Sharada Peetam Sringeri]] at [[Sringeri]], [[Karnataka]] in the South.&lt;ref name="Chakra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittal"/&gt;

Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism, namely [[Saivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]], the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair.&lt;ref name="Brockman"&gt;{{harvnb|Brockman|2011|pp=94–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (''Chota'' meaning small): Badrinath, [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]] and [[Yamunotri]]{{mdash}}all of which lie in the foothills of the Himalayas.&lt;ref name="Mittal"&gt;{{harvnb|Mittal |2004|pp=482–483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Badrinath temple reopens for Hindu pilgrims|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2340841281.html|newspaper=Hindustan Times|location=Chamoli|date=9 May 2011|accessdate=1 January 2014}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Chota'' was added during the mid of 20th century to differentiate the original Char Dhams. As the number of pilgrims to these places has increased in modern times, it is called Himalayan Char Dham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus, who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Gwynne"&gt;{{harvnb|Gwynne|2009|loc=Section on Char Dham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the pilgrimage starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding clockwise in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="Gwynne"/&gt;

==Festivals and religious practices==
[[File:Badri Night.JPG|thumb|Badrinath Temple at Night|alt=image of the temple at night illuminated with green light]]
The most prominent festival held at Badrinath Temple is Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of the river [[Ganges]] on mother earth. The mother of Badrinath, who is believed to have divided the river into twelve channels for the welfare of earthly beings, is worshiped during the festival. The place where the river flowed became the holy land of Badrinath.&lt;ref name="festivals"/&gt;

The [[Badri Kedar]] festival is celebrated during the month of June in both the temple and the Kedarnath temple. The festival lasts for eight days; artists from all over the country perform during the function.&lt;ref name="festivals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Festivals celebrated in the temple |url=http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=11 |publisher=Shri Badrinath - Shri Kedarnath Temples Committee |year=2006 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217172228/http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=11 |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major religious activities (or ''[[puja (Hinduism)|pujas]]'') performed every morning are ''mahabhishek'' (ablution), ''[[Abhisheka|abhishek]]'', ''gitapath'' and ''bhagavat puja'', while in the evening the ''pujas'' include ''geet govinda'' and ''[[aarti]]''. Recital in vedic scripts like ''Ashtotram'' and ''[[Sahasranama]]'' is practiced during all the rituals. After ''aarti'', the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image is given to the devotees the next day as [[prasad]] during the ''nirmalaya [[Darśana|darshan]]''. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them.&lt;ref name="Nair67"/&gt; Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common [[prasad]] provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uttaranchal declares Badrinath as no construction zone|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1034191151.html|newspaper=Hindustan Times|location=New Delhi|date=8 May 2006|accessdate=1 January 2014}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple is closed for winter on the auspicious day of [[bhatridwityia or later]] during October–November.&lt;ref name="close"/&gt; On the day of closure, ''Akhanda Jyothi'', a lamp is lit filled with [[ghee]] to last for six months.&lt;ref name=Bhalla258/&gt; Special ''pujas'' are performed on the day by the chief priest in the presence of pilgrims and officials of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Badrinath shrine closes marking end of Chardham Yatra|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttarakhand/badrinath-shrine-closes-marking-end-of-chardham-yatra_742346.html|location=Dehradun|publisher=Zeenews|date=17 November 2011|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Badrinath is notionally transferred during the period to the Narasimha temple at [[Jyotirmath]], located {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} away from the temple.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld"/&gt; The temple is reopened around April-May on [[Akshaya tritiya]], another auspicious day on the [[Hindu calendar]].&lt;ref name="close"&gt;{{cite news|title=Badrinath shrine closed for winter|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Badrinath-shrine-closed-for-winter/articleshow/3724410.cms|work=TNN|publisher=The Times of India|location=Dehradun|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrims gather on the first day of opening of the temple after the winter to witness the ''Akhanda Jyothi''.&lt;ref name=Bhalla258&gt;{{harvnb|Bhalla|2006|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple is one of the holy places where the Hindus offer oblations to ancestors with the help of the priests.&lt;ref name="Swmami102"/&gt; Devotees visit the temple to worship in front of the image of Badrinath in the sanctum and have a holy dip in Alaknanda River. The general belief is that a dip in the tank purifies the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davidson|Gitlitz|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and visit==
[[File:alaknanda.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Alaknanda River]] in Badrinath|alt=image of Alaknanda river with a hanging bridge across it]]
The Badrinath Temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which was later known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. A committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples. The act was modified in 2002 to appoint additional committee members, including Government officials and a Vice chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Administration of the temple |url=http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=2 |publisher=Shri Badrinath - Shri Kedarnath Temples Committee |year=2006 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193204/http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=2 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seventeen members in the board; three selected by the Uttaranchal Legislative Assembly, one member each by the [[District Councils of India|Zilla Parishad]]s of [[Pauri Garhwal district|Garhwal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, [[Tehri District|Tehri]], [[Chamoli district|Chamoli]] and [[Uttarkashi district|Uttarkashi]], and ten members nominated by the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee members of the temple |url=http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=3 |publisher=Shri Badrinath - Shri Kedarnath Temples Committee |year=2006 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184513/http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=3 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As indicated in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to [[Nambudiri]] community, a religious group common in modern [[Kerala]]. When the last of the ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for the priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld"&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2002|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious setup of the temple |url=http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=4 |publisher=Shri Badrinath - Shri Kedarnath Temples Committee |year=2006 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192556/http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=4 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld"/&gt; The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer, and a public officer to assist the chief executive officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power structure of the temple |url=http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=6 |publisher=Shri Badrinath - Shri Kedarnath Temples Committee |year=2006 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184226/http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=6 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Badrinath Temple - OCT 2014.jpg|thumb|200px|View of the temple during Summer|alt=image showing Badrinath temple with the mountain in the background]]
Although Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a [[Nambudiri|Nambudiri Brahmin]] chosen from the South Indian state of [[Kerala]]. This tradition is believed to have been initiated by Adi Shankara, who was a South Indian philosopher. The Rawal (chief priest) is requested by the [[Government of Uttarakhand]] ([[Uttar Pradesh]] government before the formation of Uttarakhand state) to the [[Kerala Government]]. The candidate should possess a degree of [[Acharya]] in [[Sanskrit]], be a bachelor, well-versed in reciting ''[[mantras]]'' (sacred texts) and be from the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism. The erstwhile ruler of Garhwal, who is the tutelary head of Badrinath, approves the candidate sent by the Government of Kerala. A Tilak Ceremony is held to instate the Rawal and he is deputed from April to November when the temple remains open. The Rawal is accorded high holiness status by [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]] and the state governments of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. He is also held in high esteem by the Royals of [[Nepal]]. From April to November, he performs his duties as a temple priest. Thereafter, he either stays in Joshimutt or returns to his native village in Kerala. The duties of the Rawal starts at 4 a.m. every day with the ''[[Abhisheka]]''. He should not cross the river until Vamana Dwadasi and must adhere to ''[[Brahmacharya]]''. The Rawal is assisted by the [[Garhwali people|Garhwali]] Dimri Pundits belonging to the Village Dimmer, Nayab Rawals, Dharmadikari, Vedapathi, a group of priests, Pandas Samadhi, Bhandari, Rasoiyas (cook), devotional singer, clerk of devashram, Jal Bhariya (water keeper) and temple guards. Badrinath is one of the few temples in North India that follow the ancient Tantra-Vidhi of [[Shrauta]] tradition more common in the south.&lt;ref name="Swmami102"&gt;{{harvnb|Swami|2004|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Outlook Traveller |url=http://traveller.outlookindia.com/fulltravelogue.aspx?id=216 |title=Badrinath |publisher=Traveller.outlookindia.com |date= |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201558/http://traveller.outlookindia.com/fulltravelogue.aspx?id=216 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2008/07/18/stories/2008071851520400.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|title=Badrinath Temple|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the temple administration introduced a token system for visitors to the temple. Tokens indicating the time of visit were provided from three stalls in the taxi stands. Each devotee to visit the presiding deity is allocated 10–20 seconds. Proof of identity is mandatory to enter the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News about the temple |url=http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=29 |publisher=Shri Badrinath - Shri Kedarnath Temples Committee |year=2006 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195444/http://www.badarikedar.org/content-badari.aspx?id=29 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is reached from [[Rishikesh]], located {{convert|298|km|mi|abbr=on}} away via [[Dev Prayag]], [[Rudra Prayag]], [[Karna Prayag]], [[Nandaprayag|Nanda Prayag]], [[Joshimath]], [[Vishnuprayag]] and [[Devadarshini]].

==`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan==
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of World War I and the [[Spanish flu]]. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unavailing in 1919&lt;!-- Mr. Lamb says 1916 but it is established that at least Tobey became a Bahá'í in 1918 and visited in 1931 - see below --&gt;, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and [[Hands of the Cause#Appointed posthumously by Shoghi Effendi|Roy C. Wilhelm]], and [[Martha Root]]. Root's travels, perhaps the first Bahá'í to Uruguay, began in the summer of 1919 - stopping first in Brazil, then Argentina and Uruguay before setting out to cross the Andes mountains into Chile in winter.&lt;ref name="root"/&gt; The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"His Holiness [[Christ]] says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]]. … Attach great importance to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of America ... the republics of the continent of South America—[[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], the [[The Guianas|Guiana]]s, [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]]; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as [[Falkland Islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagòs]], [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernandez]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Tobago and Trinidad]]...."&lt;ref name="Tablets"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;

===Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades===
Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;  In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.  In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.

Early in 1940 the first pioneer, Wilfrid Barton, arrived in Uruguay. [[May Maxwell]] stopped one day in Uruguay on a trip in February 1940 and died a few days later while in [[Buenos Aires]] where Wilfrid Barton joined by newly arrived Simon Rosenzweig from Montevideo assisted in the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Holley | first = Marion | title = A Compendium of Volumes of the Baha'i World I-XII, 1925-1954 | publisher = George Ronald | year = 1981 | location = Oxford | pages = 516–28 | url = http://bahai-library.com/may_ellis_maxwell_bw | doi = | id= 0853985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton reports the first converts in spring of 1941 -  Emilia A.

==After World War II==

In the midst of World War II there is a report that the assembly of Montevideo was dissolved in early 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Inter-American News | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1945 | issue = 145 | page = 7 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was re-established by summer 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Inter-American News; Uruguay | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1945 | issue = 175 | page = 10 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton was joined by pioneer Flora Hottes in early 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Inter-American News; News from Pioneers | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1946 | issue = 181 | page = 4 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regional committee to coordinate efforts and build unity and familiarity in regions leading to regional national assemblies were appointed in 1946 - Chili, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay were in one such committee's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Inter-American News; Regional Committees | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1946 | issue = 186 | page = 5 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, a stated purpose for the regional committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | issue = 493 | page = 2 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. The second South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in Santiago, Chile, in January, 1948 with Uruguayan delegate Gambeta Roldan.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; When the regional national assembly of South America was elected the members included Rangvald Taetz of Uruguay. By 1950 there was still the one assembly in Uruguay.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; In 1956 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo hosted the sixth convention to elect the regional assembly of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Dedication of Haziratu'l-Quds at Montevideo Precedes Sixth South American Convention| journal = Bahá'í News |date=July 1956 | issue = 305 | page = 5 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional assembly was reorganized in 1957 to be made up of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay &amp; Bolivia; one member was Roberto Cazcarra of Montevideo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Public Meeting at the National School Of Drama… | journal = Bahá'í News |date=December 1957 | issue = 322 | page = 10 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1958 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo held their first summer school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Spirit of Rededication Emerges From South American Schools; Special School for Huanuni Indian Pioneers | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1958 | issue = 328 | page = 21 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the fall of 1959 eighteen Bahá'ís gathered for a conference to discuss the progress of the religion in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Four South American Countries Hold Teaching Conferences During Year | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1958 | issue = 348 | page = 13 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1959 the Montevideo newspaper [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]] covered a presentation on Israel, which mentioned the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Baha'i in the News | journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1960 | issue = 353 | page = 14 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1960 Hand of the Cause [[William Sears (Bahá'í)|William Sears]] visited the Bahá'ís in Minas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Spirit of Rededication Emerges From South American Schools; Special School for Huanuni Indian Pioneers | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1960 | issue = 351 | page = 15 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1960 the secretary of the regional assembly, Chilean Salvador Tormo, died in a plane crash in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Salvador Tormo, Indefatigable Servant of Faith, Dies in Airplane Crash in Uruguay | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1960 | issue = 356 | page = 3 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 each country of the regional assembly elected its own National Spiritual Assembly&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; - Uruguay's was witnessed by [[Hand of the Cause]], [[`Alí-Akbar Furútan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Barron | title = Biography | work = The Furutan Academy | publisher = The Furutan Academy | year = 2007 | url = http://www.furutanacademy.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=24 | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the first Uruguayan national assembly were: Leopolda Caraballo, Else Cazcarra, Roberto Cazcarra, Mary Dutra, Francisco Flores, Elena Caraballo, Mario Regina Marius, Carola Escofet, and Edward Belcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Six More Latin-American NSAs Report on Formation; Uruguay | journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1961 | issue = 365 | page = 6| url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963 there were Local Spiritual Assemblies also in [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]], and [[Minas, Uruguay|Minas]], and a smaller group in [[Juan Lacaze]] (see [[List of cities in Uruguay]].)

==Modern community==
The contributions of the community were noted in 1995 when three Uruguayan senators urged a favorable vote supporting the human rights of Iran's Bahá'ís, saying: "A vote in this sense will not only be in accordance with the country's tradition, but shall encourage the members of this community to continue their benevolent work within Uruguay and the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="bw95-6"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Universal House of Justice | title = 1995-96 Update: The Situation of the Bahá'ís in Iran | journal = The Bahá'í World | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 139–144 | year = 1997 | url = http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-3-9.html  | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some well known Baha'is who have lived in Uruguay. In 1968 [[Alfredo Speranza]], an Uruguayan pianist who's given concerts in Uruguay and other countries, became a member of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Music Lends Prestige to the Faith| journal = Bahá'í News |date=February 1972 | issue = 491 | page = 20 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augustorobiati.it/speranza.htm Augusto Robiati on Alfredo Speranza]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Uruguayan artist Sima Baher was invited to exhibit her art by the embassy of Uruguay in Argentina at the Borges Cultural Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | title = Paintings of peace and unity on display | work = Bahá'í World News Service | place = Buenos Aires, Argentina | pages = | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | date = 2004-02-29 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/298 | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, [[Phil Sisson]] left New York City and traveled to South America where he served as a Bahá'í pioneer. His first recording, "The Dream" was recorded in Montevideo and featured Baha'i chants of the Hidden Words by Baha'u'llah, prayers and meditations, and original songs. Sisson also toured throughout the region with [[Raul Medina]], and hosted his own television show called "Oro Solido" on Uruguayan national TV and throughout [[Río de la Plata]], was guest performer on ''Telecataplum'' (see [[Canal 12 (Argentina)|Canal 12]]), and performed at [[La Allianaza]], was a featured guest artist in the "Miss Hawaiian Tropic Beauty Pageant in Punta del Este", and was invited to perform at the Israeli Embassy in Montevideo. Sisson married Lena Hedayatzadeh in 1989, two years after adopting Lua Aline who (in 2004) served for three months at the [[Baha'i Lotus Temple]] in New Delhi, India. - "Her service was the sweetest affirmation and compliment she could have ever bestowed upon us." In 2006, Sisson released his second recording, "We're One People" in San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sisson | first = Phil | title = We'reOnePeople | work = Bitmunk Collection | publisher = Digital Bazaar, Inc. | year = 2006 | url =http://bitmunk.com/media/6537401 | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been activities noted among the community in general. Bahá'ís from Uruguay pioneered to the Falkland Islands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = First Baha'i Conference in the Folklands| journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1973 | issue = 507 | page = 24 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Brazil; Amazon a 'new frontier' for pioneers| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1985 | issue = 648 | pages = 6–8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer schools held in Uruguay showed 87 attendees in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The World; Uruguay| journal = Bahá'í News |date=July 1985 | issue = 652 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 16 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 93 in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Around the World; Uruguay| journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1986 | issue = 663 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 14 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Bahá'ís were believed to live in 96 locations in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Uruguay| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1988 | issue = 684 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 3 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988 a community of Bahá'ís was to be found in [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The World; Uruguay| journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1989 | issue = 697 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 15 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo hosted two events; underr the auspices of the national assembly the first was an international women's conference attracting about 300 people from 12 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The World; Uruguay| journal = Bahá'í News |date=January 1990 | issue = 705 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 16 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and second, held through the work of the local assembly, was an "Evening of Cultural Integration" brought together representatives from Armenian, African, and Israeli ethnicities including cultural forms of dress and talks on integrating into Uruguayan community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The World; 'Cultural evening' in Uruguay| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1990 | issue = 708 |issn=0195-9212 | page = 8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-five members of the religion from Uruguay joined those from across Brazil and other places for a 2008 regional conference called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]] in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title =  The São Paulo Regional Conference | work = Bahá'í World News Service | place = São Paulo, Brazil | pages = | publisher = Bahá’í International Community | date = 2008-12-21 | url =http://news.bahai.org/community-news/regional-conferences/saopaulo.html | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
By 2001 there was an estimated 4,000 Bahá'ís, about 0.2% of the national population according to the [[World Christian Encyclopedia|World Christian Database]],&lt;ref name="WCE"&gt;{{cite web| title =ARDA: International &gt; Regions &gt; South America &gt; Uruguay | work = the arda.com | publisher = thearda.com| year = 2001| url =http://www.thearda.com/internationaldata/countries/Country_235_2.asp | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; concentrated primarily in Montevideo.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;  The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 7,300 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8637">{{About|the book mentioned in Christian and Jewish religious teachings|other uses|The Book of Life (disambiguation){{!}}The Book of Life}}

In Christianity and Judaism, the '''Book of Life''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ספר החיים, [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] ''Sefer HaChaim''; {{Lang-el|βιβλίον τῆς ζωῆς}} ''Biblíon tēs Zōēs'') is the  [[book]] in which [[God]] records the names of every person who is destined for [[Heaven]] or the [[World to Come]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}  According to the [[Talmud]] it is open on [[Rosh Hashanah]], as is its analog for the [[Evil|wicked]], the '''Book of the Dead'''. For this reason extra mention is made for the Book of Life during [[Amidah]] recitations during the [[High Holidays|Days of Awe]], the ten days between Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish [[new year]], and [[Yom Kippur]], the day of atonement (the two [[High Holidays]], particularly in the prayer [[Unetaneh Tokef]]).

==In the Hebrew Bible==
In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the Book of Life—the book or [[Muster (military)|muster-roll]] of God—records forever all people considered [[righteousness|righteous]] before God.{{cn|date=May 2018}} To be blotted out of this book signifies [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Shemot ([[Book of Exodus]]) [http://www.breslov.com/bible/Exodus32.htm#33 32:33]&lt;/ref&gt; It is with reference to the Book of Life that the holy remnant is spoken of as being written unto life&lt;ref&gt;A. V., "among the living"&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jerusalem]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Isaiah|4:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; compare also Ezekiel 9:4, where one of the six heavenly envoys "who had the scribe's [[inkhorn]] upon his loins" is told to mark the righteous for life, while the remainder of the inhabitants of Jerusalem are doomed. The [[Psalms]] also speaks of a book of the living: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Psalms|69:28}}; compare {{bibleref2|Psalms|139:16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the tears of men are recorded in this Book of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Psalms|56:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Every one that shall be found written in the book . . . shall awake to everlasting life".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Daniel|12:1}} et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; This book is probably identical with the "Book of Remembrance" in which are recorded the deeds of those that [[Fear of God#Judaism|fear the Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Malachi|3:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In apocrypha==
The [[Apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Book of Jubilees]]&lt;ref&gt;xxx. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of two heavenly tablets or books: a Book of Life for the righteous, and a Book of Death for those that walk in the paths of impurity and are written down on the heavenly tablets as adversaries (of God). Also, according to Jubilees 36:10, one who contrives evil against his neighbor will be blotted out of the Book of Remembrance of men, and will not be written in the Book of Life, but in the Book of Perdition. In Daniel 12:10 and Enoch 47:3 "the [[Ancient of Days]]" is described as seated upon [[Throne of God|his throne]] of glory with "the Book" or "the Books of Life" ("of the Living") opened before him. So are, according to Enoch 56:1, the righteous "written before the glory of the Great One," and, according to Enoch 108:3, the transgressors "blotted out of the ''Book of Life'' and out of the books of the holy ones." Reference is made also in [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] (Vision i. 3; Mandate viii.; Similitude ii.); in Revelation 3:5, 13:8, 17:8, 20:12–15, where "two Books" are spoken of as being "opened before the throne, the Book of Life, and the Book of Death, in which latter the unrighteous are recorded together with their evil deeds, in order to be cast into the [[lake of fire]]." It is the ''Book of Life'' in which the [[Twelve apostles|apostles']] names are "written in heaven" (Luke 10:20), or "the fellow-workers" of [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] (Phil 4:3), and "the assembly of the first-born" (Hebrews 12:23; compare I Clem. 45). Allusion is made also in Enoch 81:4, 89:61–77, 90:17–20, 98:76, 104:7; [[2 Baruch]] 24:1; [[Ascension of Isaiah]] 9:20.

==In the New Testament==
The Book of Life is referred to seven times in the [[Book of Revelation]] (3:5 13:8 17:8 20:12 20:15 21:27 22:19) one of the books of the [[New Testament]], attributed to  [[John of Patmos]]. As described, only those whose names are written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, and have not been blotted out by the [[Lamb of God|Lamb]], are saved at the [[Last Judgment]]; all others are doomed. "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the [[lake of fire]]" (''Rev.'' 20:15, [[King James Version]]). "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works". (''Rev.'' 20:12, King James Version)

It is also mentioned in Pauls letter to the Philippians 4:3.

==The eschatological or annual roll-call==
While the prevailing tendency among apocryphal writers of the [[Hasidean]] school was to give the Book of Life an [[eschatology|eschatological]] meaning, the Jewish liturgy and the tradition relating to the New Year and Atonement days adhered to the ancient view, which took the Book of Life in its natural meaning, preferring, from a [[pragmatism|practical]] point of view, the [[worldliness]] of Judaism to the [[mysticism|heavenliness]] of the [[Essenes]]. Instead of transferring, as is done in the [[Book of Enoch]], the [[Testament of Abraham]], and elsewhere, the great [[Judgment Day]] to the [[afterlife|hereafter]], the [[Pharisees|Pharisaic school]] taught that on the first day of each year (''Rosh Hashanah''), [[Jewish eschatology|God sits in judgment]] over his [[Animal|creatures]] and has the Books of Life together with the books containing the records of the righteous and the wicked.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The origin of the [[heaven]]ly Book of Life must be sought in [[Babylonia]], where legends&lt;ref&gt;See ''Creation Tab.'' iv. 121, and the ''Zu'' legend, ii. 7, quoted in Harper's "Babylonische Legenden," in ''Beitr. z. Assyriologie'' by Delitzsch and Haupt, 1892, ii. 2, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of the [[Tablets of Destiny]] and of tablets containing the [[Sin|transgression]]s, [[sin]]s, [[wrongdoing]]s, [[curse]]s and [[execration]]s of a person who should be "cast into the water"; that is, blotted out.&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''Micah'' vii. 19 and the art. ''Tashlik''.&lt;/ref&gt; The living are the righteous,&lt;ref&gt;''Ps.'' lxix.29.&lt;/ref&gt; who alone are admitted to [[citizenship]] in the [[theocracy]], while the [[wickedness|wicked]] are denied membership and [[eternal punishment|blotted out]] of God's book (''Ex.'' xxxii. 32 ''et seq''.).&lt;ref&gt;''Ezek.'' xiii. 9; ''Jer.'' xxii. 30; and ''Ex.'' xxxii. 30-34, accordingly assigned by Holzinger to a late stratum; see his commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; The life in which the righteous participate is to be understood in a temporal sense, as temporal life is apparently prayed for in the [[liturgy|liturgical formula]]: "Inscribe us in the Book of Life."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

In ''Daniel'' xii. 1, however, those who are found written in the book and who escape the [[tribulation|troubles]] preparatory to the coming of the [[messiah|Messianic]] kingdom are they who, together with the [[Resurrection|risen]] [[martyr]]s, are destined to share in [[everlasting life]]. Eternal life is certainly meant in ''Enoch'' xlvii. 3, civ. 1, cviii. 3, and frequently in the ''[[New Testament]]'', especially in ''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]''. The [[Targum]] (''Isa.'' iv. 3; ''Ezek.'' xiii. 9) speaks of the "Book of Eternal Life." The [[Mishnah]] states that the deeds of every human being are recorded in a book (''Abot,'' ii. 1; see iii. 16). The ''Sefer Ḥasidim'' (xxxiii) pointedly adds that God is in no need of a book of records; "the Torah speaks the [[language]] of man."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Fundraising ==

A book of life motif is frequently found in Jewish houses of worship. It is both a decorative feature and fundraiser. Some synagogues have raised money by inscribing congregation member's names in a "book of life" as a tribute to their financial generosity.

The '''Central Jewish Bureau''' ({{lang-pl|Centralne Biuro Żydowskie}}, CBŻ) was a [[Jewish]] autonomous section inside the [[Communist Party of Poland]]. The CBŻ was founded shortly after the [[Communist Bund (Poland)|Kombund]] had merged into the Communist Party in 1923. The role of the CBŻ was to mobilize support for the Communist Party amongst the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Jaff Schatz. Jews and the communist movement in interwar Poland. In: Jonathan Frankel.

'''Chinese jade''' refers to the [[jade]] [[mining|mined]] or [[hardstone carving|carved]] in [[China]] from the [[Neolithic]] onward. It is the primary [[hardstone]] of [[Chinese sculpture]]. Although deep and bright green [[jadeite]] is better known in Europe, for most of China's history, jade has come in a variety of colors and white "mutton-fat" [[nephrite]] was the most highly praised and prized. Native sources in [[Henan]] and along the [[Yangtze]] were exploited since prehistoric times and have largely been exhausted; most Chinese jade today is extracted from the northwestern [[provinces of the People's Republic of China|province]] of [[Xinjiang]].

Jade was prized for its [[scratch hardness|hardness]], [[toughness|durability]], [[Bianqing|musical qualities]], and beauty.&lt;ref name=fieryglo/&gt; In particular, its subtle, translucent colors and protective qualities&lt;ref name=fieryglo&gt;Fiero, Gloria K. ''The Humanistic Tradition'' 6th Ed, Vol. I. McGraw-Hill, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; caused it to become associated with Chinese conceptions of the [[Chinese soul|soul]] and [[Taoist immortal|immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt; With gold, it was considered to be a symbol of heaven&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The most prominent early use was the crafting of the '''Six Ritual Jades''',&lt;!--Linked here. Kindly leave bolded til separate article.--&gt; found since the 3rd-millennium&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BC}} [[Liangzhu culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[jade bi|bi]]'', the ''[[jade cong|cong]]'', the ''[[huang (jade)|huang]]'', the ''hu'', the ''gui'', and the ''zhang''.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chap. IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the meanings of these shapes were not mentioned prior to the eastern Zhou dynasty, by the time of the composition of the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', they were thought to represent the [[tian|sky]], the [[di (Chinese concept)|earth]], and the [[Four Symbols (China)|four directions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Han dynasty]], the royal family and prominent lords were buried entirely ensheathed in [[jade burial suits]] sewn in gold thread, on the idea that it would preserve the body and the souls attached to it. Jade was also thought to combat fatigue in the living.&lt;ref name=fieryglo/&gt; The Han also greatly improved prior artistic treatment of jade.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lYYvsRdxsX4C&amp;pg=PA77 77].&lt;/ref&gt;

These uses gave way after the [[Three Kingdoms period]] to [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices and new developments in [[Taoism]] such as [[Chinese alchemy|alchemy]]. Nonetheless, jade remained part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and an important artistic medium. Although its use never became widespread in [[Japan]], jade became important to the art of [[Korean jade carving|Korea]] and Southeast Asia.

==Name==
[[File:玉-oracle.svg|thumb|[[Oracle bone script]] for 玉 "jade".]]
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''yù'' [[wikt:玉|玉]] "jade; gems of all kinds; (of women) beautiful; (courteous) your" has semantically broader meanings than  English ''[[wikt:jade|jade]]'' "any of various hard greenish gems used in jewelry and artistic carvings, including jadeite and nephrite; a green color of medium hue; made of jade; green like jade".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wenlin]]'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' (2011) [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/jade jade].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yù'' has referred to many rocks and minerals that carve and polish well, especially [[jadeite]], [[nephrite]] and [[agalmatolite]], as well as [[bowenite]] and other varieties of [[serpentine subgroup|serpentine]].&lt;ref&gt;Desautels, Paul E. (1986), ''The Jade Kingdom'', Springer, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jadeite is now known as ''yìngyù'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|硬玉}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"hard&amp;nbsp;jade") and nephrite correspondingly as ''ruǎnyù'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|軟玉}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"soft&amp;nbsp;jade"). The [[polysemous]] term ''yù'' is used in various Chinese ''[[chengyu]]'' "[[set phrase]]s, such as ''pāozhuānyǐnyù'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|抛砖引玉}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"cast aside a brick, pick up a jade") "offer banal/humble remarks to spark abler talk by others; sacrifice a little to gain much"—one of the [[Thirty-Six Stratagems]], and [[idiom]]s, for instance ''yùlì'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|玉立}}}}}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"jade standing") "gracious; graceful".

The [[Chinese character]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|玉}}}} for ''yu'' "jade" dates back to circa 11th century BCE [[oracle bone script]] from the late [[Shang dynasty]], when it depicted pieces of jade hanging on a string. Chinese characters most commonly combine a [[Chinese radical|radical]], such as the "[[Radical 96|jade radical]]" 玉 or 王, that suggests meaning and a phonetic that hints at pronunciation. The "jade radical" frequently occurs in characters for names of gemstones (e.g., ''bì'' 碧 "green jade; bluish green" and ''shānhú'' 珊瑚 "coral"), and occasionally for words denoting "preciousness" (''bǎo'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|宝}}}} "treasure" and ''bǎobǎo'' {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|宝宝}}}}}} "precious/darling baby").

==History==
[[File:Chinese - Cong - Walters 42340 - Profile.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neolithic]] [[Cong (jade)|''cong'']], 3rd&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BC}}]]
[[Image:Jade ornament with grape design.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jade]] ornament with flower design, [[Jin Dynasty, 1115-1234|Jin Dynasty]] (12th or 13th century), [[Shanghai Museum]].]]
Jade has been used in virtually all periods of [[Chinese history]] and generally accords with the style of [[decorative art]] characteristic of each period.

The jades of this period were primarily small items of personal adornment, such as small discs strung onto necklaces&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Typically, the jade was polished on its surface and perforated&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. This religious nature of jade is often evaluated as connections between spirituality and the Neolithic societal structure that jade was produced in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Neolithic]] times, the key known sources of nephrite jade in China for utilitarian and [[ceremonial]] jade items were the now depleted deposits in the Ningshao area in the [[Yangtze River Delta]] ([[Liangzhu culture]] 3400&amp;ndash;2250 BC) and in an area of the [[Liaoning province]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] ([[Hongshan culture]] [[5th millennium BC|4700]]&amp;ndash;2200 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Li 2003:3-15&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological finds have also unearthed jade objects in this province in the shapes of dragons and clay-molded human figurines, therefore symbolizing the existence of a developed social group along the Liao River and inner-Mongolia &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As early as 6000 BC, [[Mount Du|Dushan]] Jade has been mined. In the Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty in Anyang, Dushan Jade ornaments were unearthed in the tombs of the Shang kings.

The [[Bi (jade)|''bi'']] and [[Cong (jade)|''cong'']] are types of objects only found in jade in early periods, and probably had religious or cosmic significance. The ''bi'' is a circular disk with a hole, originally usually plain, but increasingly decorated, and the ''cong'' is a vessel, square on the outside but circular inside. In later literature the ''cong'' represents the earth and the ''bi'' the sky.

Jades of the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]] are increasingly embellished with animal and other decorative motifs characteristic of those times, and craftsmen developed great skill in detailed low [[relief]] work in objects such as the [[belt hook|belt-hooks]] that became part of elite costume. In later periods ancient jade shapes, derived from [[Chinese ritual bronzes|bronze sacrificial vessels]], and motifs of [[painting]] were used to demonstrate the [[artisan|craftsman]]'s extraordinary technical facility.

In the Chou Dynasty (1122-255 BC), the system of government had been completed and there were varying levels of departments within the government. Buttons of jade were utilized to differentiate the various levels of official society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.|first=C.|date=1921|title=CHINESE JADES|url=|journal=Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis|volume=6|pages=32-47|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jade was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects, ranging from indoor decorative items to [[jade burial suit]]s, reflecting the ancient Chinese belief that jades would confer immortality or prolong life and prevent decay. Jade spoons, spatulas, and pestles were used to make medicine  in order for the jade to bestow its special virtues onto the medical compounds&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

From about the earliest [[Chinese dynasties]] until the present, jade was sourced from deposits in western regions like [[Khotan]] and other parts of China like  [[Lantian County|Lantian]], [[Shaanxi]]. In Lantian, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the rivers flowing from the [[Kun-Lun mountain range]] northward into the [[Takla-Makan desert]] area. River jade collection was concentrated in the [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]], the White Jade ([[Yurungkash River|Yurungkash]]) and Black Jade ([[Karakash River|Karakash]]) Rivers. From the [[Kingdom of Khotan]], on the southern leg of the [[Silk Road]], yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there transformed into ''[[objets d'art]]'' by skilled artisans as jade was considered more valuable than [[gold]] or [[silver]], and white more valuable than green. 

Jade became a favorite material for the crafting of Chinese writing materials, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some [[opium pipes]], due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Steven.

The Qing dynasty was the final dynasty to gain political power within China beginning in 1644 CE until 1911 CE. Emperor Shengzu, who was also known as Kangxi, ruled between circa 1662 CE until 1722 CE. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi, a distinctive pairs of lions or dogs composed of jade were commissioned by the dynastic family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chem/hd_chem.htm|title=List of Rulers of China|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2004|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carving Techniques ==
The hardness of jade presented an obstacle to those who wanted to carve it and turn it into various objects&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;FitzHugh, E.  (2003, January 01). "Jade". ''Grove Art Online.'' Ed.   Retrieved 26 Nov. 2018, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http:////www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000043200&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. In order to quarry nephrite jade, fires were placed next to the jade to heat it and water was thrown against the rock's surface&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This rapid temperature change caused the jade to crack and wooden wedges were used to further break it down&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. However, this quarrying technique also destroyed the jade&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The best way to extract jade in terms of it being in the best condition was to remove it from pebbles and boulders that were found in rivers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

Neolithic jade workshops, also known as wasters, have been found in areas where jade usage was evident and popularized &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.|first=Dematte,|title=The Chinese Jade Age: Between antiquarianism and archaeology|url=http://www.academia.edu/4745736/The_Chinese_Jade_Age_Between_antiquarianism_and_archaeology|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|issn=1469-6053}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most evidence of the development of jade technology and tools are taken from wasters and the discards and finished works present in these workshops &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. From the traces of jade left at these sites, one can see the evolution of crafting procedures from chipping and polishing to more advanced drilling and slicing &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  . Due to the toughness of jade, the chipping and polishing procedures differ drastically from regular stone &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The only possible method of altering the shape or texture of this mineral dense rock hasn’t seen much change from its introduction to modern day as both times remain reliant on the abrasion method &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. In order to override the abrasiveness of jade and subdue it to molding, a jade-worker must use an object of higher abrasive factor &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. In the early day’s of jade carving, quartz, a mineral with a high hardness level, was the object of choice &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. At the beginning of the Song dynasty, a time of prolific technology growth, “red sand”, with a hardness level of 7.5 became the dominant tool of the industry &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/songdynasty-module/index.html|title=The Song Dynasty in China|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In terms of Hongshan (a culture consisting of regions such as Dongjiayingzi, Aohan, and Inner Mongolia) jade, four main tools comprise the basics for jade carving: the string, awl, the hollow drill, and a slow rotating disk &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The string tools specifically were involved in the shaping of raw materials and slicing of jade into flat disks &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Besides for slicing, this instrument was also responsible for open work, specifically the cutting of slits &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Awls and hollow drills were both used to delicately puncture holes into jade material, however, awls were responsible for small pierces in ornaments whereas hollow drills made larger punctures for a variety of purposes &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The slow rotating disk, finally, was purposeful in line cutting and preparing jade material for other drilling techniques &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Although little is researched regarding the manufacturing techniques of other major Neolithic jade centers Dawenkou or Longshan, the Hongshan culture is quite known for its technical quality in the production of jade products and therefore serves as reliable source when examining the pinnacle of jade crafting during the Neolithic period &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.    

The introduction of metal tools occurred in the late Zhou period (1050-256 B.C.) &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. It is likely that the use of copper in these tools preceded the use of iron &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

Since jade was considered to be rare and strenuous to work with, pieces of jade were minimally changed and scrap pieces were reused in some way&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The coloration of the jade was a factor taken into consideration when deciding what form the piece of jade would take&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==Categories==
Jade objects of early ages (Neolithic through Zhou) fall into five categories: small decorative and functional ornaments such as [[beads]], [[pendants]], and belt hooks; [[weapons]] and related equipment; independent [[sculptural]], especially of real and mythological animals; small objects of probably emblematic value, including the han (ornaments, often carved in the shape of a [[cicada]], to be placed in the mouth of the dead), and many examples of larger objects — such as the ''[[cong (jade)|cong]]'' (a hollow cylinder or truncated cone)

===Six Ritual and Six Ceremonial Jades===
{{see also|Chinese nobility}}
The '''Six Ritual Jades''' originating in pre-history were the ''[[bi (jade)|bi]]'' (a flat disk with a hole in its center), the ''[[cong (jade)|cong]] (prismatic tube)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Rui Oliveira|date=2014|title=Securing the Harmony between the High and the Low: Power Animals and Symbols of Political Authority in Ancient Chinese Jades and Bronzes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586915|journal=Asian Perspectives|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–225|doi=10.1353/asi.2014.0019|issn=1535-8283}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  the ''[[Huang (jade)|huang]] (a flat, half-ring pendant), the ''hu'', the flat, bladelike ''gui'', and the ''zhang''. The original names, value and functions of these objects have invited much speculation. The [[Rites of Zhou|Zhou Li]], itself probably compiled in the [[Han Dynasty]], ascribes the circular ''bi'' as representing the heavens, the ''cong'' as representing the earth, the ''gui'' the east, the ''zhang'' the south, the ''hu'' the west and the ''huang'' the north. Although over two  millennia old these names and symbolism were given to these objects by much later writers, who interpreted the objects in a way that reflected their own understanding of the cosmos.

The original use of the "Six Ritual Jades" became lost, with such jades becoming [[status symbols]], with [[utility]] and religious significance forgotten. The objects came to represent the status of the holder due to the expense and authority needed to command the resources and labour in creating the object. Thus it was as the "Ceremonial Jades" that the forms of some of these jades were perpetuated. The "Zhou Li" states that a king (wang) was entitled to ''gui'' of the ''zhen'' type, dukes (gong) to the huang, marquis to ''gui'' of the ''xin'' type, earls (bo) to ''gui'' of the ''gong'' type, viscounts (zi) to a ''bi'' of the ''gu'' type and barons (nan) to a ''bi'' of the ''pu'' type.

'You start with beatings, and from there it can go almost anywhere,' he said. Certainly, I knew what most Pakistanis would say of the confession -- that the teenager would admit to anything after persistent electrical prodding by the Indians.

According to the Indian government, They came wearing Indian Army fatigues to avoid detection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatodaygroup.com/itoday/20000403/nation.html Death in Disguise]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[India Today]], 2000-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; the killers came into the village in two groups at separate ends of the village where the two Gurdwaras were located. They first lined up the Sikhs, who had been celebrating the Holi or [[Hola Mahalla]] Festival, in front of their  Gurdwaras and opened fire, killing thirty-six people.

==Aftermath==
The killings of 36 Sikhs was a turning point in the [[Terrorism in Kashmir|Kashmir issue]], where Sikhs had usually been spared from militant violence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEED6113AF932A15750C0A9669C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/C/Clinton,%20Bill 34 Massacred In Sikh Town In Kashmir], [[The New York Times]], 2000-03-21&lt;/ref&gt;  After the massacre hundreds of Kashmiri Sikhs gathered in the village shouting anti Pakistan and anti Muslim slogans and criticizing Indian government for failing to protect the villagers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0403/india.singhpora.html Slaughter in Singhpora], [[TIME]], 2000-04-03&lt;/ref&gt;  Sikh protesters shouting "blood for blood" marched to the seat of Jammu-Kashmir government to demand retaliation against Pakistan-based Muslim militants.&lt;ref name="Independent20000323"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/man-arrested-in-connection-with-sikh-massacre-722015.html|title=Man arrested in connection with Sikh massacre|date=23 March 2000|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The villagers ensured that the local school was up and running just two weeks after the killings. The massacre created tension and distrust between the Sikh and Muslim residents of the area, but no problems developed at the joint Muslim-Sikh village school.  After the massacre the residents of the village pointed the police to Mohammad Yakub Magray as one of the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1707/17070340.htm The massacre at Chattisinghpora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530201145/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1707/17070340.htm |date=2008-05-30 }}, [[Frontline (magazine)]], 2000-04-01&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Sikh organizations such as the Bhai Kanahiya Jee Nishkam Seva Society demanded a deeper state inquiry into the details of the massacre&lt;ref name = "Tribune"&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051112/j&amp;k.htm#3 Sikhs want CBI probe into Chittisinghpura Massacre], ''tribuneindia.com''&lt;/ref&gt; and for the inquiry to be made public. The state government ordered an inquiry into the massacre. 

Commenting on this massacre [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal]] responding to a call for international inquiry into the incident by [[Nazir Ahmed, Baron Ahmed]] said that violence will never solve Kashmir problems and rejected the call for international inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;'We were appalled by the massacre of Sikhs on 20 March. Violence will never bring a solution to the situation in Kashmir. We welcome the state authorities' decision to launch a judicial inquiry into the massacre. We look forward to seeing the results of the inquiry'[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000502/text/00502w01.htm Kashmir: Massacre of Sikhs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinton Controversy==
The massacre coincided with the visit of [[United States]] president [[Bill Clinton]] to India. In an introduction to a book written by [[Madeleine Albright]] titled ''The Mighty and the Almighty: Reflections on America, God, and World Affairs (2006)'', she accused "Hindu Militants" of perpetrating the act. This error created a major incident, with both Hindu and Sikh groups expressing outrage at the inaccuracy. Clinton's office did not return calls seeking comment or clarification. In the hours immediately after the massacre in March 2003,  the US condemned the killings but refused to accept the Indian government's accusation that it was the work of [[Pakistan]]i [[Islamist]] groups. The publishers, [[Harper Collins]] routed a correction through Albright's office. In a public statement they acknowledged the mistake.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;[http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JTS8yMDA2LzA1LzE5I0FyMDE0MDE=&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom Clinton goofs up on J&amp;K killings],''Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Page xi of the Mighty and the Almighty contains a reference to Hindu militants that will be deleted in subsequent printings, both in America and in international editions. This error was due to a failure in the fact-checking process.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chittisinghpura massacre in film==
The massacre was depicted in the commercial [[Bollywood]] film [[Adharm (2006 film)|Adharm]] (unholy) directed by Adeep Singh.

== David Headley's confession ==

In 2010, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) associate [[David Headley]], who was arrested in connection with the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]], reportedly confessed to the [[National Investigation Agency]] that the LeT carried out the Chittisinghpura massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Lashkar-behind-Sikh-massacre-in-Kashmir-in-2000-says-Headley/Article1-617459.aspx Lashkar behind Sikh massacre in Kashmir in 2000, says Headley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114013820/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Lashkar-behind-Sikh-massacre-in-Kashmir-in-2000-says-Headley/Article1-617459.aspx |date=2011-01-14 }}. Hindustan Times. 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have identified an LeT militant named Muzzamil as part of the group which carried out the killings apparently to create communal tension just before Clinton’s visit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101026/j&amp;k.htm#2 Chittisinghpura Massacre: Obama’s proposed visit makes survivors recall tragedy ].

{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar}}

'''Criticism of Buddhism''' has taken numerous different forms, including that its practitioners act in ways contrary to Buddhist principles or that those principles systemically marginalize women. There are many sources of criticism, both ancient and modern, stemming from other religions, the non-religious, and other Buddhists.

== Criticism of Buddhist practices ==

=== Women in Buddhism ===
{{Main|Women in Buddhism}}
{{See also|Women and religion}}


Most schools of Buddhism have more rules for ''[[bhikkunis]]'' (nuns) than ''[[bhikkus]]'' (monk) lineages. Theravada Buddhists explain that in the time of the [[Buddha]], nuns had such problems like safety if they were to be ordained the same way as monks who traveled around in the forest and between cities. Thus, more rules have to be created for nuns; for instance: nuns are forbidden to travel alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/WomenInBuddhism2.html Women in Buddhism] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] referred to the [[Dalai Lama]]'s statement at the 2007 Hamburg congress:&lt;ref name="studybuddhism.com"&gt;Berzin Summary Report [http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_4.html#n063b0e55a12ff6f34 Human Rights and the Status of Women in Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Sometimes in religion there has been an emphasis on male importance. In Buddhism, however, the highest vows, namely the bhikshu and bhikshuni ones, are equal and entail the same rights. This is the case despite the fact that in some ritual areas, due to social custom, bhikshus go first. But Buddha gave the basic rights equally to both sangha groups. There is no point in discussing whether or not to revive the bhikshuni ordination; the question is merely how to do so properly within the context of the Vinaya.|}}

The most criticised doctrine is found in [[Amitābha|Amida Buddha's]] vow 35: "The Buddha established the Vow of transformation [women] into men, Thereby vowing to enable women to attain Buddhahood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/WomenInBuddhism4.html|title=Women In Buddhism Part IV by Rev. Patti Nakai|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=self-published, dead link
|date=May 2018}} Earlier limitations on attainment of [[Buddhahood]] by women were abolished in the [[Lotus Sutra]] which opened the direct path to enlightenment for women equally to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.org/buddhism/buddhist-concepts/the-enlightenment-of-women.html|title=The Enlightenment of Women|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nichiren]] 
"Only in the Lotus Sutra do we read that a woman who embraces this sutra not only excels all other women but surpasses all men".&lt;ref&gt;Writing of Nichiren Daishonin, vol1. [http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=463&amp;m p 463]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
{{See also|Religious nationalism|Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism|Nichirenism}}
In medieval Southeast Asia, there were a number of Buddhist states, including the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], and the [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa]]. In [[Sri Lanka]] especially, modern monks frequently involve themselves in nationalist politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Abeysekara, "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3270564 The Saffron Army, Violence, Terror(ism): Buddhism, Identity, and Difference in Sri Lanka]". ''Numen'' 48.1 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; These Buddhist nationalists have been opposed by the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]], a [[self-governance]] movement led by the Buddhist [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] and based in Buddhist ideals, who condemn the use of violence and the denial of [[Human rights]] to [[Tamils]] and other non-Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Thomas Banchoff]]|author2=[[Robert Wuthnow]]|title=Religion and the Global Politics of Human Rights|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=9780199841035|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oVViGSEpu8C&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maung Zarni]], a Burmese democracy advocate, human rights campaigner, and a research fellow at the [[London School of Economics]] who has written on the violence in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, states that there is no room for fundamentalism in Buddhism. "No Buddhist can be nationalistic," said Zarni, "There is no country for Buddhists. I mean, no such thing as ‘me,’ ‘my’ community, ‘my’ country, ‘my’ race or even ‘my’ faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Anuradha Sharma Pujari]]|author2=[[Vishal Arora]]|title=Nirvanaless: Asian Buddhism’s growing fundamentalist streak|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/nirvanaless-asian-buddhisms-growing-fundamentalist-streak/2014/05/01/9af7413c-d161-11e3-a714-be7e7f142085_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=19 June 2015|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of violence===
{{main|Buddhism and violence}}
Violence in Buddhism refers to acts of violence and aggression committed by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] with religious, political, and socio-cultural motivations. Buddhism is generally seen as among the religious traditions least associated with violence,&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Warfare by Michael Jerryson and Mark Juergensmeyer / Oxford University Press 2010, p.3 {{ISBN|978-0-19-539484-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the history of Buddhism there have been acts of violence directed, fomented or inspired by Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jerryson|first1=Michael|title=Buddhist Warfare|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539483-2|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Buddhist doctrine ==

=== Accusations of nihilism ===
{{See also|Nihilism|Sukha}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], through [[Schopenhauer]] whose pessimism was highly influenced by Buddhist philosophy, interpreted Buddhism as a life-negating philosophy that seeks to escape an existence dominated by [[suffering]]. According to Omar Moad, Nietzsche misunderstood the meaning of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/buddhism.htm|title=Buddhism and Nietzsche|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Dukkha]]'' has different meanings and is neither pessimistic nor optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=[[Rupert Gethin]] | year =1998 | title =Foundations of Buddhism | url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/The%20Foundations%20of%20Buddhism_Gethin_1998.pdf | format=PDF | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=[[Walpola Rahula]] | year =2014 | title =What the Buddha Taught | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8CcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT525 | pages=525–541 | publisher = [[Oneworld Publications]] | isbn=9781780740003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dukkha may mean disappointment, desires, cravings, bereavement, unfulfillment, or dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/beliefs/fournobletruths_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Buddhism: The Four Noble Truths|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lama [[Surya Das]] emphasizes the matter-of-fact nature of ''dukkha'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author =[[Surya Das]] | year =2009 | title =Awakening the Buddha Within | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9_fMzGKtWsC | publisher =Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony | isbn=9780385530989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Buddha Dharma does not teach that everything is suffering. What Buddhism does say is that life, by its nature, is difficult, flawed, and imperfect. [...] That's the nature of life, and that's the First Noble Truth. From the Buddhist point of view, this is not a judgement of life's joys and sorrows; this is a simple, down-to-earth, matter-of-fact description.}}

While the Buddha describes the flawed and imperfect nature of life in the first noble truth, he also points to the causes that underlie this imperfection and how to bring these causes to an end.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucian criticism===
Buddhism is sometimes seen as antithetical to much of [[Confucian philosophy]].  Due to the focus on social roles as the source of ethical obligation in Confucianism compared to the seemingly inherent nonconformity of Buddhism, there was a sustained ethical critique of Buddhism in early Confucianism.  While Buddhism entails the belief there is nothing rightfully considered the self, Confucianism emphasized the self a great deal in their doctrines of self-development and societal roles. As a consequence Buddhism was considered by many to be [[Nihilism|nihilistic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://history.cultural-china.com/en/165History5834.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments of secular origin===
{{See also|Secular Buddhism}}
[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], a prominent proponent of [[New Atheism]]&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and [[Daniel Dennett]] have been described as the "Four Horsemen" of the "New Atheism". See [http://richarddawkins.net/article,2025,THE-FOUR-HORSEMEN,Discussions-With-Richard-Dawkins-Episode-1-RDFRS 'THE FOUR HORSEMEN,' Discussions with Richard Dawkins: Episode 1, RDFRS - RichardDawkins.net&lt;!-- Bot generated &amp; editor modified title --&gt;] and [http://daviddent.net/blog/2007/06/17/the-four-horsemen-of-the-new-atheism/ » Blog Archive » The Four Horsemen of the New Atheism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730114549/http://daviddent.net/blog/2007/06/17/the-four-horsemen-of-the-new-atheism|date=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]], claims that many practitioners of Buddhism improperly treat it as a religion, criticizes their beliefs as "naive, petitionary, and superstitious," and claims that such beliefs impede the spread of Buddhist principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/media/killing-the-buddha.pdf  Killing the Buddha] by Sam Harris&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has also underlined that these beliefs stem from the tendency of some Buddhists to not follow a fundamental teaching of Buddhism; namely, to believe a teaching only with sufficient evidence. &lt;ref&gt;https://samharris.org/killing-the-buddha/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]], author of "Buddhism without Beliefs" has written about karma and rebirth, asserting that the Buddha “did not claim to have had experience that granted him privileged, esoteric knowledge of how the universe ticks”. However, his critics point out that his assertion is contrary to the earliest written records of the Buddha's teaching as well as hundreds of years of academic study on the topic. They also point to a lack of scholarly research on Batchelor's part to give credibility to his claims; and suggest that Batchelor may be attempting to reshape Buddhism due to his own discomfort with concepts such as karma and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;http://fpmt.org/mandala/archives/mandala-issues-for-2010/october/distorted-visions-of-buddhism-agnostic-and-atheist/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{EarlyBuddhism}}

The '''Dharmaguptaka''' ([[Sanskrit]]; {{zh|c=法藏部|p=Fǎzàng bù}}) are one of the eighteen or twenty [[early Buddhist schools]], depending on the source. They are said to have originated from another sect, the [[Mahīśāsaka]]s. The Dharmaguptakas had a prominent role in early [[Central Asia]]n and [[Chinese Buddhism]], and their [[Prātimokṣa]] (monastic rules for [[bhikkhu|bhikṣus]] and [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇīs]]) are still in effect in East Asian countries to this day, including [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]]. They are one of three surviving [[Vinaya]] lineages, along with that of the [[Theravada|Theravāda]] and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]].

==Etymology==
''Guptaka'' means "preserver"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskritdictionary.com/guptaka/72982/1 ''Guptaka in the Sanskrit Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[dharma]]'' "law, justice, morality", and, most likely, the set of laws of Northern Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskritdictionary.com/dharma/109288/1 ''Dharma in the Sanskrit Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrinal development==

===Overview===
The Dharmaguptakas regarded the path of a [[śrāvaka]] (''[[śrāvakayāna]]'') and the path of a bodhisattva (''bodhisattvayāna'') to be separate. A translation and commentary on the ''Samayabhedoparacanacakra'' reads:&lt;ref&gt;《異部宗輪論述記》：謂佛雖在僧中所攝，然別施佛果大，非僧（果大）。於窣堵波興供養業獲廣大果。佛與二乘解脫雖一，而聖道異。無諸外道能得五通。阿羅漢身皆是無漏。餘義多同大眾部執。&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|They say that although the Buddha is part of the Saṃgha, the fruits of giving to the Buddha are especially great, but not so for the Saṃgha. Making offerings to stūpas may result in many extensive benefits. The Buddha and those of the [[Yana (Buddhism)|Two Vehicles]], although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths. Those of outer paths (i.e. heretics) cannot obtain the [[Abhijñā|five supernormal powers]]. The body of an arhat is without outflows. In many other ways, their views are similar to those of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s.}}
According to the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra]]'', the Dharmaguptakas held that the [[Four Noble Truths]] are to be observed simultaneously.

Vasubandhu states that the Dharmaguptakas held, in agreement with Theravada and against Sarvāstivāda, that realization of the four noble truths happens all at once (''ekābhisamaya'').&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Sujato, Sects and Sectarianism, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dharmaguptaka are known to have rejected the authority of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] [[prātimokṣa]] rules on the grounds that the original teachings of the Buddha had been lost.&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 52"&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twelve aṅgas===
The Dharmaguptaka used a unique twelvefold division of the Buddhist teachings, which has been found in their ''Dīrgha [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]]'', their ''Vinaya'', and in some [[Mahāyāna sūtras]].&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 184"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''The Origins and Nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; These twelve divisions are: ''[[sutra|sūtra]]'', ''geya'', ''vyākaraṇa'', ''[[gatha|gāthā]]'', ''udāna'', ''nidāna'', ''jātaka'', ''itivṛttaka'', ''vaipulya'', ''adbhūtadharma'', ''[[avadana|avadāna]]'', and ''upadeśa''.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 184"/&gt;

==Appearance and language==

===Robes===
Between 148 and 170 CE, the [[Parthia]]n monk [[An Shigao]] came to China and translated a work which described the color of monastic robes (Skt. ''[[Kasaya (clothing)|kāṣāya]]'') utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called ''Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi'' ({{zh|大比丘三千威儀}}).&lt;ref name="Hino, Shoun 2004. p. 55"&gt;Hino, Shoun. ''Three Mountains and Seven Rivers.'' 2004. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Another text translated at a later date, the ''Śāriputraparipṛcchā'', contains a very similar passage with nearly the same information.&lt;ref name="Hino, Shoun 2004. p. 55"/&gt; However, the colors for Dharmaguptaka and [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] are reversed. In the earlier source, the Sarvāstivāda are described as wearing deep red robes, while the Dharmaguptaka are described as wearing black robes.&lt;ref name="Hino, Shoun 2004. pp. 55-56"&gt;Hino, Shoun. ''Three Mountains and Seven Rivers.'' 2004. pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding passage found in the later ''Śāriputraparipṛcchā'', in contrast, portrays the Sarvāstivāda as wearing black robes and the Dharmaguptaka as wearing deep red robes.&lt;ref name="Hino, Shoun 2004. pp. 55-56"/&gt;

During the [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese Buddhist monastics typically wore grayish-black robes and were even colloquially referred to as ''Zīyī'' ({{zh|緇衣}}), "those of the black robes."&lt;ref&gt;Kieschnick, John. ''The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture.'' 2003. pp. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Song dynasty]] monk Zanning (919–1001 CE) writes that during the earlier [[Han dynasty|Han]]-[[Cao Wei|Wei]] period, the Chinese monks typically wore red robes.&lt;ref&gt;Kieschnick, John. ''The Eminent Monk: Buddhist Ideals in Medieval Chinese Hagiography.'' 1997. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Dharmaguptaka [[vinaya]], the robes of monastics should be sewn out of no more than 18 pieces of cloth, and the cloth should be fairly heavy and coarse.&lt;ref&gt;Kieschnick, John. ''The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture.'' 2003. pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
A consensus has grown in scholarship which sees the first wave of Buddhist missionary work as associated with the [[Gāndhārī language]] and the [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] script and tentatively with the Dharmaguptaka sect.&lt;ref name="Heirman"/&gt;{{rp|97}} However, there is evidence that other sects and traditions of Buddhism also used Gāndhārī, and further evidence that the Dharmaguptaka sect also used Sanskrit at times:

{{quote|It is true that most manuscripts in Gāndhārī belong to the Dharmaguptakas, but virtually all schools &amp;mdash; inclusive [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] &amp;mdash; used some Gāndhārī. Von Hinüber (1982b and 1983) has pointed out incompletely [[Sanskritisation|Sanskritised]] Gāndhārī words in works heretofore ascribed to the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādins]] and drew the conclusion that either the sectarian attribution had to be revised, or the tacit dogma "Gāndhārī equals Dharmaguptaka" is wrong. Conversely, Dharmaguptakas also resorted to [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name=Heirman&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Heirman|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Bumbacher|editor2-first=Stephan Peter|title=The spread of Buddhism|date=2007|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-9004158306}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}} }}
Starting in the first century of the [[Common Era]], there was a large trend toward a type of Gāndhārī which was heavily Sanskritized.&lt;ref name=Heirman /&gt;{{rp|99}}

==History==

===In Northwest India===
[[File:Aparanta.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The region of [[Aparanta|Aparānta]], where the Dharmaguptakas are believed to have originated]]

The [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]], the earliest Buddhist texts ever discovered, are apparently dedicated to the teachers of the Dharmaguptaka school. They tend to confirm a flourishing of the Dharmaguptaka school in northwestern [[India]] around the 1st century CE, with Gāndhārī as the canonical language, and this would explain the subsequent influence of the Dharmaguptakas in [[Central Asia]] and then northeastern Asia. According to Buddhist scholar [[A. K. Warder]], the Dharmaguptaka originated in [[Aparanta|Aparānta]].&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 278"&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one scholar, the evidence afforded by the Gandharan Buddhist texts "suggest[s] that the Dharmaguptaka sect achieved early success under their Indo-Scythian supporters in Gandhāra, but that the sect subsequently declined with the rise of the [[Kushan Empire|Kuṣāṇa Empire]] (ca. mid-first to third century A.D.), which gave its patronage to the Sarvāstivāda sect."&lt;ref&gt;"The Discovery of 'the Oldest Buddhist Manuscripts'" Review article by Enomoto Fumio. ''The Eastern Buddhist'', Vol NS32 Issue I, 2000, pg 161&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Central Asia===
Available evidence indicates that the first Buddhist missions to [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] were carried out by the Dharmaguptaka sect:&lt;ref name="Heirman"/&gt;{{rp|98}}
{{quote|[T]he Khotan ''[[Dhammapada|Dharmapada]]'', some orthographical devices of [[Saka language|Khotanese]] and the not yet systematically plotted Gāndhārī loan words in Khotanese betray indisputably that the first missions in Khotan included Dharmaguptakas and used a Kharoṣṭhī-written Gāndhārī. Now all other manuscripts from Khotan, and especially all manuscripts written in Khotanese, belong to the Mahāyāna, are written in the [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī script]], and were translated from Sanskrit.}}
A number of scholars have identified three distinct major phases of [[missionary]] activities seen in the history of [[Buddhism in Central Asia]], which are associated with the following sects, chronologically:&lt;ref&gt;Willemen, Charles. Dessein, Bart. Cox, Collett. ''Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism.'' 1997. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
# Dharmagupta
# [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]]
# [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]]

In the 7th century CE, [[Xuanzang]] and [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] both recorded that the Dharmaguptakas were located in [[Oddiyana|Oḍḍiyāna]] and Central Asia, but not in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 52"/&gt; Yijing grouped the Mahīśāsaka, Dharmaguptaka, and [[Kāśyapīya]] together as sub-sects of the Sarvāstivāda, and stated that these three were not prevalent in the "five parts of India," but were located in the some parts of Oḍḍiyāna, Khotan, and [[Kucha]].&lt;ref&gt;Yijing. Li Rongxi (translator). ''Buddhist Monastic Traditions of Southern Asia.'' 2000. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===In East Asia===
[[File:Chinese Bhiksuni Taiwan Vesak Festival.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Full [[bhiksuni|bhikṣuṇī]] ordination is common in the Dharmaguptaka lineage. [[Vesak]] festival, [[Taiwan]]]]

The Dharmaguptakas made more efforts than any other sect to spread Buddhism outside India, to areas such as [[Iran]], [[Central Asia]], and China, and they had great success in doing so.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 278"/&gt; Therefore, most countries which adopted Buddhism from China, also adopted the Dharmaguptaka vinaya and ordination lineage for bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs. According to A. K. Warder, in some ways the Dharmaguptaka sect can be considered to have survived to the present in those East Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; Warder further writes:&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism.'' 2000. pp. 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It was the Dharmaguptakas who were the first Buddhists to establish themselves in Central Asia. They appear to have carried out a vast circling movement along the trade routes from Aparānta north-west into [[Iran]] and at the same time into Oḍḍiyāna (the [[Swat District|Suvastu valley]], north of Gandhāra, which became one of their main centres). After establishing themselves as far west as [[Parthia]] they followed the "[[Silk Road|silk route]]", the east-west axis of Asia, eastwards across Central Asia and on into China, where they effectively established Buddhism in the second and third centuries A.D. The Mahīśāsakas and Kāśyapīyas appear to have followed them across Asia into China. [...] For the earlier period of Chinese Buddhism it was the Dharmaguptakas who constituted the main and most influential school, and even later their ''Vinaya'' remained the basis of the discipline there.}}
During the early period of Chinese Buddhism, the Indian Buddhist sects recognized as important, and whose texts were studied, were the Dharmaguptakas, Mahīśāsakas, Kāśyapīyas, Sarvāstivādins, and the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism.'' 2000. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 250 and 255 CE, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was established in China when Indian monks were invited to help with ordination in China.&lt;ref name="Mohr"/&gt; No full Vinaya had been translated at this time, and only two texts were available: the Dharmaguptaka Karmavācanā for ordination, and the Mahāsāṃghika Prātimokṣa for regulating the life of monks. After the translation of full Vinayas, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was followed by most monks, but temples often regulated monastic life with other Vinaya texts, such as those of the Mahāsāṃghika, the Mahīśāsaka, or the Sarvāstivāda.&lt;ref name="Mohr"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mohr|editor1-first=Thea|editor2-last=Tsedroen|editor2-first=Jampa|title=Dignity &amp; discipline : reviving full ordination for Buddhist nuns|date=2010|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0861715886}}, pp. 187-189&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in [[Guanzhong]] (the region around [[Chang'an]]), and that the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya was prominent in the [[Yangtze]] area and further south.&lt;ref name="Mohr"/&gt; In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] and [[Dao An]] (654&amp;ndash;717). In the early 8th century, Dao An gained the support of [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang]] and an imperial edict was issued that the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka vinaya for ordination.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==

===Gandhāran Buddhist texts===
The [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts]] (the oldest extant Buddhist manuscripts) are attributed to the Dharmaguptaka sect by Richard Salomon, the leading scholar in the field, and the British Library scrolls "represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in Nagarāhāra."&lt;ref&gt;"The Discovery of 'the Oldest Buddhist Manuscripts'" Review article by Enomoto Fumio. ''The Eastern Buddhist'', Vol NS32 Issue I, 2000, pg 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Salomon. ''Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhāra: The British Library Kharosthī Fragments'', with contributions by Raymond Allchin and Mark Barnard. Seattle: University of Washington Press; London: The British Library, 1999. pg 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Dharmaguptaka Gandhāran Buddhist texts in the [[Schøyen Collection]], is a fragment in the Kharoṣṭhī script referencing the Six [[Pāramitā]]s, a central practice for bodhisattvas in Mahāyāna doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Eurasia Episode III - Gandhara, the Renaissance of Buddhism | series = Eurasia| credits = Presenters: Patrick Cabouat and Alain Moreau| network = France 5 / NHK / [[Point du Jour International]]| airdate = 2004| number = 3| minutes = 11:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vinaya translation===
In the early 5th century CE, Dharmaguptaka [[Vinaya]] was translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by the Dharmaguptaka monk [[Buddhayasas|Buddhayaśas]] (佛陀耶舍) of [[Kashmir]]. For this translation, Buddhayaśas recited the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya entirely from memory, rather than reading it from a written manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Scharfe, Harmut. ''Education in Ancient India.'' 2002. pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; After its translation, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya became the predominant vinaya in Chinese Buddhist monasticism. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, or monastic rules, are still followed today in China, Vietnam and Korea, and its lineage for the ordination of monks and nuns has survived uninterrupted to this day. The name of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in the East Asian tradition is the "Vinaya in Four Parts" ({{zh | c=四分律| hp=Sìfēn Lǜ}}), and the equivalent Sanskrit title would be ''Caturvargika Vinaya''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 3.'' 2004. p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ordination under the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya only relates to monastic vows and lineage (''Vinaya''), and does not conflict with the actual Buddhist teachings that one follows (''Dharma'').

===Āgama collections===
The ''Dīrgha Āgama'' ("Long Discourses," 長阿含經 ''Cháng Āhán Jīng'') (T. 1)&lt;ref name="entry on 阿含經"&gt;Muller, Charles. Digital Dictionary of Buddhism, [http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?96.xml+id('b963f-542b-7d93') entry on 阿含經]&lt;/ref&gt; corresponds to the ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]]'' of the Theravada school.  A complete version of the ''Dīrgha Āgama'' of the Dharmaguptaka sect was translated by Buddhayaśas and Zhu Fonian (竺佛念) in the [[Later Qin]] dynasty, dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 sūtras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin ''Dīgha Nikāya''.

The ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara Āgama]]'' ("Incremental Discourses," 增壹阿含經 ''Zēngyī Āhán Jīng'') (T. 125) corresponds to the ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Anguttara Nikāya]]'' of the Theravāda school. It was translated into Chinese by Dharmanandi in 384 CE, and edited by Gautama Saṃghadeva in 398 CE. Some have proposed that the original text for this translation came from the Sarvāstivādins or the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref&gt;Sujato Bhikkhu. [http://ekottara.googlepages.com/about "About the EA"]. ekottara.googlepages.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to A.K. Warder, the ''Ekottara Āgama'' references 250 prātimokṣa rules for monks, which agrees only with the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. He also views some of the doctrine as contradicting tenets of the Mahāsāṃghika school, and states that they agree with Dharmaguptaka views currently known. He therefore concludes that the extant ''Ekottara Āgama'' is that of the Dharmaguptakas.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism.'' 2000. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhidharma===
The ''Śāriputra Abhidharma Śāstra'' (舍利弗阿毘曇論 ''Shèlìfú Āpítán Lùn'') (T. 1548) is a complete abhidharma text that is thought to come from the Dharmaguptaka sect. The only complete edition of this text is that in Chinese. Sanskrit fragments from this text have been found in [[Bamiyan]], [[Afghanistan]], and are now part of the [[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Collection]] (MS 2375/08). The manuscripts at this find are thought to have been part of a monastery library of the Mahāsāṃghika [[Lokottaravāda]] sect.

===Additional piṭakas===
The Dharmaguptaka ''[[Tripiṭaka]]'' is said to have contained two extra sections that were not included by some other schools. These included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka and a [[Mantra]] Piṭaka ({{lang|zh|咒藏}} ''Zhòu Zàng''), also sometimes called a [[Dhāraṇī]] Piṭaka.&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 52"/&gt; According to the fifth-century Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhayaśas, the translator of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya into Chinese, the Dharmaguptaka school had assimilated the "Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka" ({{lang|zh|大乘三藏}} ''Dàchéng Sānzàng'').&lt;ref name="Walser, Joseph 2005. pp. 52-53"&gt;Walser, Joseph. ''Nāgārjuna in Context: Mahāyāna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture.'' 2005. pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra''===
&lt;!--"Rāhula" links here. When renaming or removing this section, please adjust wikilink accordingly.--&gt;
The Dharmaguptaka biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive of all classical biographies of the Buddha, and is entitled ''Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra''. Various Chinese translations of this text date from between the 3rd and 6th century CE.

==Relationship to Mahāyāna==
[[Image:Chinese Buddhist Monks Ceremony Hangzhou.jpeg|thumb|[[bhikkhu|Bhikṣu]]s performing a traditional Buddhist ceremony in [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] province, China]]

===Kushan era===
It is unknown when some members of the Dharmaguptaka school began to accept the Mahāyāna sūtras, but the ''Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa'' records that [[Kanishka|Kaniṣka]] (127-151 CE) of the Kuṣāṇa Empire presided over the establishment of [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] doctrines in the northwest of India.&lt;ref name="Ray, Reginald 1999. p. 410"&gt;Ray, Reginald. ''Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations.'' 1999. p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; Tāranātha wrote that in this region, 500 bodhisattvas attended the council at Jālandhra monastery during the time of Kaniṣka, suggesting some institutional strength for Mahāyāna in the northwest during this period.&lt;ref name="Ray, Reginald 1999. p. 410"/&gt; [[Edward Conze]] goes further to say that Prajñāpāramitā had great success in the northwest during the Kuṣāṇa period, and may have been the "fortress and hearth" of early Mahāyāna, but not its origin, which he associates with the Mahāsāṃghika branch.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. ''Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations.'' 1999. p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra''===
Jan Nattier writes that available textual evidence suggests that the Mahāyāna ''[[Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra]]'' circulated in Dharmaguptaka communities during its early history, but a later translation shows evidence that the text later circulated amongst the Sarvāstivādins as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan. ''A Few Good Men: Based on the Ugraparipṛcchā, a Mahāyāna Sūtra.'' 2007. pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ugraparipṛcchā'' also mentions a fourfold division of the Buddhist canon which includes a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, and the Dharmaguptaka are known to have had such a collection in their canon.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan. ''A Few Good Men: Based on the Ugraparipṛcchā, a Mahāyāna Sūtra.'' 2007. pp. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Nattier further describes the type of community depicted in the ''Ugraparipṛcchā:''&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan. ''A Few Good Men: Based on the Ugrapariprccha, a Mahayana Sutra.'' 2007. pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... [T]he overall picture that the ''Ugra'' presents is quite clear. It describes a monastic community in which scriptures concerning the bodhisattva path were accepted as legitimate canonical texts (and their memorization a viable monastic specialty), but in which only a certain subset of monks were involved in the practices associated with the Bodhisattva Vehicle.}}

===''Ratnarāśivyākaraṇa Sūtra''===
The Mahāyāna ''Ratnarāśivyākaraṇa Sūtra'', which is part of the ''[[Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra]]'', is believed by some scholars to have a Dharmaguptaka origin or background, due to its specific regulations regarding giving to the Buddha and giving to the Saṃgha.&lt;ref&gt;Silk, Jonathan. ''The Maharatnakuta Tradition: A Study of the Ratnarasi Sutra. Volume 1.'' 1994. pp. 253-254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prajñāpāramitā sūtras===
According to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the ''[[Prajnaparamita#Overview of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras|Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'' (25,000 lines) and the ''Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (100,000 lines) have a connection with the Dharmaguptaka sect, while the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (8000 lines) does not.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Guang Xing assesses the view of the Buddha given in the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (8000 lines) as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhayaśas===
The translator Buddhayaśas was a Dharmaguptaka monk who was known to be a Mahāyānist, and he is recorded as having learned both [[Hīnayāna]] and Mahāyāna treatises. He translated the ''Dharmaguptaka Vinaya'', the ''Dīrgha Āgama'', and Mahāyāna texts including the ''[[Ākāśagarbha]] Bodhisattva Sūtra'' (虛空藏菩薩經 ''Xūkōngzàng Púsà Jīng''). The preface written by Buddhayaśas for his translation of the ''Dharmaguptaka Vinaya'' states that the Dharmaguptakas had assimilated the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka.&lt;ref name="Walser, Joseph 2005. pp. 52-53"/&gt;

===Buddhist canon===
The Dharmaguptakas were said to have had two extra sections in their canon:&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 52"/&gt;

# Bodhisattva Piṭaka
# Mantra Piṭaka or Dhāraṇī Piṭaka

In the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work ''Abhidharmasamuccaya'', [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] refers to the collection which contains the Āgamas as the ''Śrāvakapiṭaka'', and associates it with the śrāvakas and [[pratyekabuddha]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Asaṅga classifies the Mahāyāna sūtras as belonging to the ''Bodhisattvapiṭaka'', which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"/&gt;

===Paramārtha===
[[Paramartha|Paramārtha]], a 6th-century CE Indian monk from [[Ujjain]], unequivocally associates the Dharmaguptaka school with the Mahāyāna, and portrays the Dharmaguptakas as being perhaps the closest to a straightforward Mahāyāna sect.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph. ''Nāgārjuna in Context: Mahāyāna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture.'' 2005. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greek literature, an '''eidolon''' (plural: '''eidola''' or  '''eidolons''') ([[Greek language|Greek]] εἴδωλον: "image, idol, double, apparition, phantom, [[ghost]]") is a spirit-image of a living or dead person; a shade or phantom look-alike of the human form. The concept of [[Helen of Troy]]'s eidolon was explored both by [[Homer]] and [[Euripides]]. However, where Homer uses the concept as a free-standing idea that gives Helen life after death, Euripides entangles it with the idea of [[kleos]], one being the product of the other.&lt;ref name="Philology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Meltzer | first = Gary S. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Where Is the Glory of Troy?"

The concept of the eidola of the dead was explored in various literature regarding [[Penelope]], who in later works was constantly laboring against the eidola of [[Clytamnestra]] and later Helen herself.&lt;ref name="Philology"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Holmberg | first = Ingrid E. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Euripides' Helen: Most Noble and Most Chaste | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 116 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–42  | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | location = | date = Spring 1995  | url = &lt;!--http://www.academicroom.com/article/euripides-helen-most-noble-and-most-chaste | accessdate = March 3, 2015--&gt; | jstor = 295501 | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer's use of eidola also extends to the [[Odyssey]] where, after the death of the suitors, Theoclymenos notes that he sees the doorway of the court filled with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barasch | first = Moshe | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Departing Soul.

[[Walt Whitman]]'s poem by the same name in 1876 used a much broader understanding of the term, expanded and detailed in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carpenter | first = Frederic I. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Walt Whitman's "Eidolon" | journal = College English | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 534–545 | publisher = National Council of Teachers of English | location = | date = Mar 1942 | url = | jstor = 370944 | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Whitman's use of the term we can see the use broaden to include the concept of an oversoul composed of the individual souls of all life and expanding to include the Earth itself and the hierarchy of the planets, Sun, stars and galaxy.

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the astral double or [[perispirit]] or [[Kamarupa (Theosophy)|kamarupa]] after death, before its disintegration is identified with the ''eidolon''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/etg-hp.htm Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary: A Resource on Theosophy, G. de Purucker&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghats in [[Varanasi]]''' are riverfront steps leading to the banks of the River [[Ganges]]. The city has 88 [[ghat]]s. Most of the ghats are bathing and [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] ceremony ghats, while two ghats are used exclusively as [[cremation]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Bowden (2003), The Ganges, {{ISBN|978-0739860700}}, Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Varanasi ghats were rebuilt after 1700 AD, when the city was part of [[Maratha Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana Eck, Banaras: CITY OF LIGHT, {{ISBN|978-0691020235}}, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The patrons of current ghats are Marathas, Shindes ([[Scindia]]s), [[Holkar]]s,  [[Bhonsle]]s, and Peshwes ([[Peshwa]]s). Many ghats are associated with legends or mythologies while many ghats are privately owned. Morning boat ride on the Ganges across the ghats is a popular visitors attraction.

==Popular ghats==
According to the puranic sources, there are five key ghats on the riverfront, important because of their association with a defining feature of the holy city of ''Kashi'': Assi Ghat, Dashashwamedh Ghat, Manikarnika Ghat, Panchganga Ghat and Adi Keshav Ghat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shankar|first1=Hari|title=Kashi ke Ghat|date=1996|publisher=Vishwvidyalaya Prakashan|location=Varanasi|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

===Assi Ghat===
This ghat that used to lie at the confluence of the Ganges with the dry river ''Asi'' marks the traditional southern boundary of the city. ''Asisangameshwar'' Temple at the ghat finds mention in the ''Kashi Khand'' of ''Skandmahapuran''.This ghat is very popular because it is one of the very few ghats that is linked with the city through a wide street.Assi ghat name is given as it is the 80th ghat.PM MODI launched water ATM  on 17th sep ,2015 on occasion of PM bithday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mishra|first1=Rajnish|title=Ghats of Varanasi|date=2017|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-1521414323|pages=51|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dashashwamedh Ghat===
[[File:Ganga Aarti at Varanasi ghats.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Ganges]] [[Aarti]] at [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]], Varanasi]]
'''[[Dashashwamedh Ghat]]''' is located close to [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple|Vishwanath Temple]], and is probably the most spectacular ghat. Two Hindu mythologies are associated with it: According to one, Lord Brahma created it to welcome Lord Shiva. According to another, [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]] sacrificed ten horses, during Dasa-[[Ashwamedha]] [[yajna]] performed here. A group of priests daily perform in the evening at this ghat "Agni Pooja" (Worship to Fire) wherein a dedication is made to Lord Shiva, River Ganges, Surya (Sun), Agni (Fire), and the whole universe.

===Manikarnika Ghat===
Two legends are associated with [[Manikarnika Ghat]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} According to one, it is believed to be the place where [[Lord Vishnu]] dug a pit with his [[Chakra]] and filled it with his perspiration while performing various penances. While Lord Shiva was watching Lord Vishnu at that time, the latter's earring ("manikarnika") fell into the pit. According to the second legend, in order to keep Lord Shiva from moving around with his devotees, his consort Goddess [[Parvati]] hid her earrings, and asked him to find them, saying that they had been lost on the banks of the Ganges. Goddess Parvati's idea behind the fib was that Lord Shiva would then stay around, searching forever for the lost earrings. In this legend, whenever a body gets cremated at the Manikarnika Ghat, Lord Shiva asks the soul whether it has seen the earrings.

According to ancient texts, the owner of Manikarnika Ghat bought King Harishchandra as a slave and made him work on the Manikarnika at [[Harishchandra]] Ghat. Hindu cremations customarily take place here, though a majority of dead bodies are taken for cremation to the Manikarnik Ghat.
According to other sources that Manikarnik Ghat is named after Jhansi ki Rani Laxmibhai.

===Scindia Ghat===
[[File:Meditation on a Ghat on the Ganges, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|180px|Early morning meditation on a Ghat on the Ganges, Varanasi]]
[[Scindia Ghat]] also known as Shinde Ghat borders Manikarnika to the north, with its Shiva temple lying partially submerged in the river as a result of excessive weight of the ghat’s construction about 150 years ago. Above the ghat, several of Kashi’s most influential shrines are located within the tight maze of alleys of Siddha Kshetra (Field of Fulfillment). According to tradition, [[Agni]], the Hindu God of Fire was born here. Hindu devotees propitiate at this place Vireshwara, the Lord of all heroes, for a son.

===Maan-Mandir Ghat===
Mana-Mandir Ghat: [[Jai Singh II of Amber|Maharaja Jai Singh]] II of [[Jaipur]] built this Ghat in 1770, as well as the [[Jantar Mantar]] equipped with ornate window casings along with those at Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, and Mathura. There is a fine stone balcony in the northern part of the ghat. Devotees pay homage here to the [[lingam]] of Someswar, the Lord of the Moon.

===Lalita Ghat===
[[File:Varanasi ghats at the sunrise.JPG|thumb|Varanasi Ghat at sunrise.]]
[[Lalita Ghat]]: The late [[Kingdom of Nepal|King of Nepal]] built this Ghat in the northern region of Varanasi. It is the site of the Ganges Keshav Temple, a wooden temple built in typical Kathmandu style,The temple has an image of Pashupateshwar, a manifestation of Lord Shiva. Local festivals including musical parties and games regularly take place at the beautiful [[Assi Ghat]] which is at the end of the continuous line of ghats. It is a favorite site of painters and photographers.

==Cremation on ghats==
[[File:Burning ghats of Manikarnika, Varanasi.jpg|right|thumb|Cremations in progress at Manikarnika Ghat, [[Varanasi]].]]
In [[Hindu]] traditions, cremation is one of the [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|rites of passage]] and the Ghats of Varanasi are considered one of the auspicious locations for this ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Eck, Banaras - City of Light, {{ISBN|978-0231114479}}, Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the cremation or "last rites", a "[[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]]" (prayer) is performed. Hymns and mantras are recited during cremation to mark the ritual. The Manikarnika and Harishchandra Ghats are dedicated to the cremation ritual. Annually, less than 2 in 1000 people who die in India, or 25,000 to 30,000 bodies are cremated on various Varanasi Ghats; about an average of 80 per day. This practice has become controversial for the pollution it causes to the river.&lt;ref&gt;S. Agarwal, Water pollution, {{ISBN|978-8176488327}}, APH Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980s, the Government of India funded a Clean Ganges initiative, to address cremation and other sources of pollution along the Ghats of Varanasi. In many cases, the cremation is done elsewhere and only the ashes are dispersed into the river near these Ghats.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin: ''Rites of Passage'', in: Bowen, Paul (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_bjmiUSDRkAC Themes and issues in Hinduism]''. Cassell, London. {{ISBN|0-304-33851-6}}. pp. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollution of ghats==
Untreated sewage is a pervasive source of river [[pollution in India]]. City municipal waste and untreated sewage is the largest source of pollution of Ganges river near the Ghats of Varanasi.&lt;ref&gt;O. Singh, Frontiers in Environmental Geography, {{ISBN|978-8170224624}}, pp 246-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaholidaymall.com/highlights/detail/ghats-in-varanasi|title=Ghats of Varanasi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gopas''' are a tribe or caste of Bombay, India&lt;ref&gt;The tribes and castes of Bombay, Volume 1 By Reginald Edward Enthoven&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Mumbai]]) who were kinsmen and fighters for [[Vasudeva]] Krishna. They were allied with Kauravas, due to a pact made between Vasudeva Krishna, [[Arjuna]] and [[Duryodhana]].

The pact of Vasudeva Krishna to Arjuna and Duryodhana:- There is a large body of cowherds known as the Narayanas, all of whom are able to fight in the thick of battle. These soldiers shall be sent to one of you and I alone, resolved not to fight on the field, and laying down my weapons, will go to the other. Arjuna selected Vasudeva Krishna and Duryodhana selected Krishna's army. (5,7)

Many thousands of Gopas with a large Gopayana force battled in the Kurukshetra War, at Kauravas side, against the Pandavas, along with other armies, like the [[Madras]], the [[Sauviras]], the [[Gandharas]], the Trigartas and the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalingas]]. (6,71)

Lord [[Krishna]] was a Gopa. Amarakosha gives Ballava as well as [[Abhira]] as synonym for Gopa.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tribes and Castes of Bombay|author=Enthoven, R.E.|volume=1|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120606302|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoT6gPrbTp8C|page=23|accessdate=2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Harivansa [[Purana]], it has been said that Gope and [[Yadav]] are generic of the same lineage.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?ei=VD-QTZagH8qycMXUmYsK&amp;ct=result&amp;id=wT-BAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=krishna+was+abhira&amp;q=kshatriyas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The cattle and the stick: an ethnographic profile of the Raut of Chhattisgarh&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hārītī''' ([[Sanskrit]]), also known as {{nihongo|'''Kishimojin'''|鬼子母神|}}, is both a revered [[deva (Buddhism)|goddess]] and [[demon]] in some Buddhist traditions. In her positive aspect, she is regarded for the protection of children, easy delivery and happy child rearing while her negative aspects include the belief of her terror towards irresponsible parents and unruly children. 

In Japanese Buddhism, the variant ''Kishimojin'' is venerated both as a [[Tutelary deity|protector deity]], but in many folk traditions is often recognized as a female [[demon]] of misery and unhappiness towards children and parents. Both popular traditions persevere in current Japanese Buddhist practices and belief. 

==Iconography==
Hārītī is a figure of the 26th chapter&lt;!-- "26th chapter" says onmarkproductions.com, but that chapter does not seem to refer to Hariti--&gt; of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', and is especially important to [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. In [[Shingon Buddhism]], she is named {{nihongo|Karitei|訶利帝}} or {{nihongo|Karitei-mo|訶梨帝母}}. Her iconography is based mostly on the {{nihongo||大薬叉女歓喜母并愛子成就法|Dai Yakusha Nyo Kangimo Narahini Aishi Jōjuhō}}.&lt;ref name="Schumacher"&gt;{{citation|last=Schumacher|first=Mark|year=1995|chapter=Kariteimo|title=A-Z Photo Dictionary of Japanese Buddhist Statuary|publisher=onmarkproductions.com|chapter-url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/kariteimo.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese tradition, Kishimojin is an aspect of [[Guanyin|Kannon]], the goddess of mercy, and she bears the epithets {{nihongo|"Bringer of Happiness"|歓喜母}} and {{nihongo|"Giver of Children and Easy Delivery"|子安鬼子母神}}. 

In the [[Kathmandu Valley]] of [[Nepal]], she is known as Hārītī Mā "Mother Hārītī", and her main temple is part of Kathmandu's [[Swayambhunath]] stupa complex. She is perceived as the consort of [[Pañcika]] and as protector of children, and is a patron of the [[Newar people]] of [[Kathmandu]], [[Bhaktapur]] and [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur District]]. The [[Newars]] call her ''Ajima'', meaning "grandmother" in the [[Newar language]].{{cn|date=August 2015}}

==Narrative==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reliëf op de Candi Mendut TMnr 20026894.jpg|thumb|right|The bas-relief of Hariti with her children on inner northern wall of [[Mendut]], 9th century.]]
According to myth, Hārītī was originally a [[rakshasa|rākṣasī]] of [[Rajgir]] at the same time that [[Gautama Buddha]] also lived there. She had hundreds of children of her own, whom she loved and doted upon, but to feed them, she abducted and killed the children of others. The bereaved mothers of her victims pleaded to the Buddha to save them. So, the Buddha stole the youngest of her sons (in a variant version, the youngest daughter), and hid him under his rice bowl. After having desperately searched for her missing son throughout the universe, Hārītī finally appealed to the Buddha for help. 
[[File:Whitehead Coins of the Punjab Museum Plate XI Azes Demeter and Hermes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Azes]] coin in [[India]], with [[Demeter]]/ Hariti with children and holding a [[cornucopia]] (Obv.)and [[Hermes]] (Rev.), 1st century BCE.]]
The Buddha pointed out that she was suffering because she lost one of hundreds of children, and asked if she could imagine the suffering of parents whose only child had been devoured. She replied contritely that their suffering must be many times greater than hers. She then vowed to protect all children, and in lieu of children's flesh, she would henceforth only eat pomegranates. Henceforth Hārītī became the protector of children and women in childbirth. In exchange, the Buddha gave her [[bodhi]], which enabled her to withstand black magic and evil powers, and gave her the facility to cure the sick.&lt;!-- Coulter, Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities is not generally a good source. Its good enough for the myth. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Coulter|first=Charles Russell|last2=Turner|first2=Patricia|chapter=Kishimojin|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson|year=2000|isbn=0-7864-0317-9|page=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumacher" /&gt;

In the Japanese version of the tale, Kishimojin's enlists the aid of the {{nihongo|Ten Rākṣasī Women|十羅刹女|jūrasetsunyo}} to abduct and murder the children of other families. In some variants of the myth, the Ten Rākṣasī Women are themselves daughters (or daughters' daughters) of Kishimojin.&lt;ref name="Chitkara"&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Chitkara|editor-first=M.

'''Hunzahúa''' was the first ''[[zaque]]''; ruler of the northern [[Muisca people|Muisca]] with capital [[Tunja|Hunza]], named after him. His contemporary ''[[zipa]]'' of the southern Muisca was [[Meicuchuca]].

== Biography ==
Hunzahúa, heir of [[Idacansás]], was a ''[[cacique]]'' in the sacred valley of the ''[[iraca]]'' and was chosen by the other ''caciques'' of the region to make peace between the battling parties. He became the first ''zaque'' of the northern Muisca region based in Hunza, present-day [[Tunja]], and one of his policies was the ban on the use of weapons. According to [[List of Muisca scholars|Muisca scholar]] [[Javier Ocampo López]], who wrote extensively about the [[Muisca religion|religion]] and [[Muisca mythology|mythology]] of the Muisca, his mother was named Faravita and his sister Noncetá.&lt;ref name=OcampoHunzahua&gt;{{es}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20071216105459/http://www.tunja.gov.co/?idcategoria=3264 Hunzahúa y su hermana Noncetá]&lt;/ref&gt; Legend tells that Hunzahúa fell in love with his sister and made her his wife when he left Hunza for [[Chipatá, Santander|Chipatá]]. Faravita, the mother of the ''zaque'', disagreed with the marriage of her two children and attacked the couple, spilling a bowl of [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]. This created the [[Hunzahúa Well]]. When Hunzahúa saw what his mother had done, and the Muisca protesting against his [[incest]], he damned Hunza and the surrounding valley. Noncetá gave birth to a son in [[Susa, Cundinamarca|Susa]], but the young boy turned into a rock. The sad couple traveled further, to the [[Tequendama Falls]]. Here, they changed into two rocks at either side of the sacred waterfall.&lt;ref name=OcampoHunzahua/&gt;

The reign of the northern Muisca spread from the [[Chicamocha River]] to the area populated by the [[Sutagao people|Sutagao]] around [[Fusagasugá]] and from the flatlands of San Juan to the border region with the [[Panche people|Panche]] and [[Muzo people|Muzo]], including the territories of [[Vélez, Santander|Vélez]]. The previous unknown unity of the region permitted the conservation of the [[Chibcha language]] and [[Muisca religion and mythology]]. Peace was disturbed when the southern Muisca ''zipa'' [[Saguamanchica]] took up arms against the northern ''zaque'' [[Michuá]], succeeding the rule of Hunzahúa in 1470.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/biografias/michua.html Biography of Hunzahúa] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/32359 History of the Muisca] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Islamic Salvation Front''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الجبهة الإسلامية للإنقاذ, ''al-Jabhah al-Islāmiyah lil-Inqādh''; {{lang-fr|Front Islamique du Salut}}) was a Sunni [[Islamist]] [[political party]] in [[Algeria]]. The party had two major leaders representing its two bases of its support. [[Abbassi Madani]] appealed to pious small businessmen, and [[Ali Belhadj]] appealed to the angry, often unemployed youth of Algeria.

Officially made legal as a political party in September 1989, less than a year later the FIS received more than half of valid votes cast by Algerians in the [[Algerian local elections, 1990|1990 local government elections]]. When it appeared to be winning a general election in January 1992, a military coup dismantled the party interning thousands of its officials in the [[Sahara]]. It was officially banned two months later.&lt;ref name=itdme-106&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalacoura|first1=Katerina|title=Islamist Terrorism and Democracy in the Middle East|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlTKrMFyawoC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=FIS+was+banned&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hkZmVbLXMY2vogSQnYCwAQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=FIS%20was%20banned&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders and leaders of the FIS did not agree on all issues, but agreed on the core objective of establishing an [[Islamic state|Islamic State]] ruled by [[sharia]] law.  FIS hurriedly assembled a platform in 1989, the ''Projet de Programme du Front Islamique du Salut'', which was widely criticized as vague.

Its 1990 electoral victory, giving it control of many local governments, led to the imposing of the [[Hijab#Governmental enforcement and bans|veil]] on female municipal employees; pressuring of liquor stores, video shops and other establishments perceived as un-Islamic to close; segregation of bathing areas by gender.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:170-1&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.170-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Elimination of the French language and culture was an important issue for many in the FIS such as co-leader Ali Benjadj, who in 1990 declared his intention "to ban France from Algeria intellectually and ideologically, and be done, once and for all, with those whom France has nursed with her poisoned milk."&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:170-1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Slimane Zeghidour, ''Politique internationale'', Autumn 1990, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; Devout activists removed satellite dishes of households receiving European satellite broadcast in favor of Arab satellite dishes receiving Saudi broadcasts.&lt;ref name="Martínez-38"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martínez|first1=Luis|title=The Algerian Civil War, 1990-1998|origyear=1998|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press.|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_wFQ5-mdKAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=satellite+dishes+in+algeria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=REtmVeSFFYexogTN0YOgBg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20dishes%20in%20algeria&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Educationally, the party was committed to continue the Arabization of the educational system by shifting the language of instruction in more institutions, such as medical and technological schools, from French to Arabic. Large numbers of recent graduates, the first post-independence generation educated mainly in Arabic, liked this measure, as they had found the continued use of French in higher education and public life jarring and disadvantageous.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:173&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the first National Assembly ballot, the FIS issued a second pamphlet.  Economically, it strongly criticized Algeria's [[planned economy]], urging the need to protect the private sector and encourage competition&amp;nbsp;– earning it support from traders and small businessmen&amp;nbsp;– and urged the establishment of [[Islamic banking]]. However, from leaders Abbasi Hadani and Abdelkader Hachani both made statements opposed opening the country to competition from foreign business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=willis|first1=michael|editor1-last=Nonneman|editor1-first=Gerd|title=Political and Economic Liberalization: Dynamics and Linkages in Comparative ...|date=1996|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers.|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5Pe4HTa_bYC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=FIS+algeria+statement+on+the+economy+competition+1991&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J0JmVd6bPIy1oQTewICYDg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=FIS%20algeria%20statement%20on%20the%20economy%20competition%201991&amp;f=false|chapter=ALgeria's troubled road towards liberalization, 1988-1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socially, it suggested that women should be given a financial incentive to stay at home rather than working outside, thus introducing sexual segregation (Ali Belhadj called it immoral for men and women to work in the same office) with the supposed goal of increasing the number of jobs available to men in a time of chronic unemployment.&lt;ref name=WSE-71&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tierney|first1=Helen|title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group.|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9E4GgV6pBB8C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=fis+algeria+women+stay+home&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tUpmVZn7EMbroAS1uILQCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=fis%20algeria%20women%20stay%20home&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, the contradiction between Madani and Belhadj's words was noteworthy: Madani condemned violence "from wherever it came",&lt;ref&gt;''El Moudjahid'', 26 December 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed his commitment to democracy and resolve to "respect the minority, even if it is composed of one vote".&lt;ref&gt;''Jeune Afrique'', 12 February 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Belhadj said, "There is no democracy in Islam"&lt;ref&gt;''El-Bayane'', Dec. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "If people vote against the Law of God... this is nothing other than blasphemy. The ulama will order the death of the offenders who have substituted their authority for that of God".&lt;ref&gt;''Horizons'' 23 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Daniel Pipes]] and [[Patrick Clawson]], [[Anwar Haddam]] rejected this view of Belhadj, saying, "He has been misquoted. He has been accused of things out of bitterness. He wrote a book in which he expressed himself clearly in favor of democracy. In it, he writes on page 91 that "the West progressed by defeating tyranny and preserving freedoms; this is the secret of the Western world's remarkable progress." Belhadj refers many times to the Western world and to those very values that people are trying to deny us within our own borders."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/316 "Anwar N. Haddam: An Islamist Vision for Algeria"], ''Middle East Quarterly''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also: Shaykh Abdul-Malik ar-Ramadani al-Jaza'iri, ''Madarik un-Nadhr fi's-Siyasah: Bayna't-Tatbiqat ash-Shar'iyyah wa'l-Infia'lat al-Hamasiyyah'' [Perceptions of Viewing Politics: Between the Divinely Legislated Application and Enthusiastic Disturbances],(KSA: Dar Sabeel il-Mumineen, 1418 AH/1997 CE, 2nd Edn).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{politics of Algeria}}

===Background===
Social conditions that led to formation and popularity of the FIS included a population explosion in the 1960s and 70s that outstripped the stagnant economy's ability to supply jobs, housing, food and urban infrastructure to massive numbers of young in the urban areas;{{#tag:ref|In 1989, 40 percent of Algeria's population of 24 million were under 15 years of age; the urban population was in excess of 50 percent of the total population; the birthrate was 3.1% per year&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:159-60&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.159-60&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  a collapse in price of oil, whose sale supplied 95% of Algeria's exports and 60% of the government's budget;&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:159-60/&gt; a single-party state ostensibly based on socialism, anti-imperialism, and [[popular democracy]] but ruled by high level military and party ''[[nomenklatura]]'' from the east side of the country;&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:159-60/&gt; "corruption on a grand scale";&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:159-60/&gt; and in response to these issues, "the most serious [[1988 October Riots|riots]] since independence" occurred in October 1988 when thousands of urban youth took control of the streets.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:159-60/&gt;

Earlier Salafist movements in Algeria included the Association of Muslim Ulemas founded in 1931 by Abdel Hamid Ben Badis, which like the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] believed that religion should be the "absolute focus of private life and society", preached against the "superstitions" of popular Islam and French culture or [[secularism]] in Algeria, but did not venture into politics or promotion of an Islamic state.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:161-2&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence the government of [[Houari Boumediene]] began a campaign of Arabization and Islamization against the French language which was still dominant in higher education and the professions. It recruited Egyptians to Arabize and de-Frenchify the school system, including a substantial number of Muslim Brothers. Many of the generation of "strictly Arabphone teachers" trained by the Brothers adopted the beliefs of their teachers and went on to form the basis of a "Islamist intelligentsia" that made up the FIS ([[Ali Belhadj]] being a prime example).&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:162-3&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s the government imported two renowned Islamic scholars, [[Mohammed al-Ghazali]] and [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], to "strengthen the religious dimension" of the ruling [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) party's "nationalist ideology".  However, both clerics were "[[fellow traveler]]s" of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], supporters of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies, and supported "Islamic awakening" in Algeria, giving only "lip service" to the government.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:165&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Islamist, [[Mustafa Bouyali]], a "gifted inflammatory preacher" and veteran of the Algerian independence struggle, called for the application of the ''[[sharia]]'' and creating of an [[Islamic state]] by ''[[jihad]]''. After persecution by the security services he founded the ''Mouvement Islamique Arme'' (MIA), "a loose association of tiny groups", with himself as ''amir'' in 1982. His group carried out a series of "bold attacks" against the regime and was able to carry it fight on underground for five years before Bouyali was killed in February 1987.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:162-3/&gt;

Also in the 1980s, several hundred youth left Algeria for camps of [[Peshawar]] to fight [[Afghan Arabs|jihad in Afghanistan]]. As Algeria was a close ally of the jihadists enemy the Soviet Union, these jihadists tended to consider the Afghan jihad a "prelude" to jihad against the Algerian FLN.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:164&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.164&lt;/ref&gt;     After the Marxist government in Afghanistan fell, many of the salafist-jihadis returned to Algeria and supported the FIS and later the GIA.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:164"/&gt;

Also adding to the strength of salafist "Islamic revivalism" and political Islam in Algeria was the weakness (or nonexistence) of any alternative in the form of popular Muslim brotherhoods which had been dismantled by the FLN government in retaliation for lack of support and whose land had been confiscated and redistributed by the FLN government after independence.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:166&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the  [[1988 October Riots]]  Islamists "set about building bridges to the young urban poor". The riots "petered out" after meetings between the President Chadli and Islamists [[Ali Belhadj]] and members of the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:166-7&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.166-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding===
On November 3, 1988, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended to allow parties other than the ruling [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] to operate legally.  The FIS was born shortly afterwards in [[Algiers]] on February 18, 1989, led by an elderly sheikh, Abbassi Madani,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Augustus Richard Norton|title=Civil society in the Middle East. 2 (2001)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k61qG1OlLl4C&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=13 September 2014|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-10469-0|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a charismatic young mosque preacher, Ali Belhadj.  Its views ranged across a wide (but not complete&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:166-7/&gt;) spectrum of Islamist opinion, exemplified by its two leaders. Abbassi Madani, a professor at University of Algiers and ex-independence fighter, represented a relatively moderate religious conservatism and symbolically connected the party to the [[Algerian War of Independence]], the traditionally emphasized source of the ruling FLN's legitimacy. His aim was to "Islamise the regime without altering society's basic fabric."&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:166-7/&gt; The party came into legal existence in September 1989.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:169&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Belhadj, a high school teacher appealing to a younger and less educated class. An impassioned orator, he was known for his ability to both enrage and calm at will the tens of thousands of young ''hittiestes'' who came to hear him speak. However, his radical speeches alarmed non-Islamists and feminists. He purportedly represents a Salafi (Sunni) branch. Madani sometimes expressed support for multiparty democracy, whereas Belhadj denounced it as a potential threat to [[sharia]].  Their support of free market trading and opposition to the ruling elite also attracted middle class traders, who felt left out of the economy.

As in other Muslim countries where the political system allowed opposition and free elections for the first time, the FIS benefited from being a religious party. Unlike the secular parties it had "a coherent network of preachers already in place."&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:166-7/&gt;
Its support base increased rapidly with the help of activists preaching in friendly [[mosque]]s.

===1990 local elections victory===
The FIS made "spectactular" progress in the first year of its existence.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:166-7/&gt; The first edition of its weekly publication, ''Al Munqidh'', was distributed to 200,000. The FIS-inspired doctors, nurses and rescue teams showed "devotion and effectiveness" helping victims of an earthquake in [[Tipaza Province]].&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:169/&gt; It organized marches and rallies and "applied steady pressure on the state" to force a promise of early elections.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:169"/&gt;

In the first free elections since independence on June 12, 1990, they swept the [[Algerian local election, 1990|local elections]] with 54% of votes cast, almost double that of the FLN and far more than any of the other parties. The FIS took 46% of town assemblies and 55% of wilaya assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algeria-interface.com/new/article.php?article_id=545&amp;lng=e |title=algeria-interface.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110102745/http://www.algeria-interface.com/new/article.php?article_id=545&amp;lng=e |archivedate=10 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its supporters were especially concentrated in urban areas: it secured 93% of towns/cities of over 50,000.  This was the "high point"&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:171&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  of FIS influence. Its rapid rise alarmed the government, which moved to curtail the powers of local government.

Once in power in local governments, its administration and its Islamic charity was praised by many as just, equitable, orderly and virtuous, in contrast to its corrupt, wasteful, arbitrary and inefficient FLN predecessors.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:170&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Martinez, ''La guerre civile en Algerie'', (Paris: Karthala, 1998), 53-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory in local elections was the "high point" of FIS influence, which benefited from widespread disillusionment with the Algerian ruling party.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:171"/&gt;  As time went on non-core supporters began to become disenchanted. The secular,  educated, salaried urban middle class began to be concerned over the anti-French language policy.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:171/&gt;

The [[Gulf War]] energized the party, but brought fissures. The FIS had condemned [[Saddam Hussein]]'s invasion of [[Kuwait]], but once it was apparent that Western intervention was inevitable, public opinion shifted and there were massive demonstrations, blood donation drives.  When Binhadj delivered a speech in front of the Ministry of Defense building demanding a corp be sent to fight in Iraq's favor, the military took it as a "direct affront" and challenged to the discipline in the armed forces.  (Binhadj later appealed unsuccessfully to the armed forces rank and file for a general mutiny.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:175&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.175&lt;/ref&gt;) Furthermore, his co-leader Madani had received much aid from Iraq's direct enemies, Saudi Arabia and other oil monarchies, supported them and was unhappy about having to defer to Binhadj and the pro-Sadam position.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:172-3&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.172-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===General strike and arrests of leadership===
In May 1991, the FIS called for a general strike to protest the government's redrawing of electoral districts, which it saw as [[gerrymandering]] directed against it.  The strike itself was a failure, but the demonstrations FIS organized in Algiers were huge. Mass [[sit-in]]s were held in one of Algiers largest squares for a week, and the FIS succeeded in pressuring the government. It was persuaded in June to call the strike off by the promise of fair parliamentary elections.

However, disagreements on the strike provoked open dissension among the FIS leadership (the ''Madjliss ech-Choura''), and the prolonged demonstrations alarmed the military.  Shortly afterwards the government arrested Madani and Belhadj on June 30, 1991, having already arrested a number of lower-ranking members.  The party, however, remained legal in the meantime,&lt;ref name=itdme-106/&gt; and passed to the effective leadership of "djazarists"&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:174&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.174&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Abdelkader Hachani]] after four days of contested leadership by [[Muhammad Said (GIA)|Mohamed Said]] (who was then arrested).

Despite activists anger that its demands for the leaders' release went unheeded, after some deliberation (and expulsion of dissenters such as [[Said Mekhloufi]] and [[Kamareddine Kherbane]] who advocated direct action against the government), the FIS agreed to participate in the next elections.  On December 26, 1991, the FIS won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round of parliamentary elections]], although with one million fewer votes than in the earlier local elections.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:174/&gt; It won 48% of the overall popular vote, and 188 of the 231 seats contested in that round, putting them far ahead of rivals.

The army saw the seeming certainty of resulting FIS rule as unacceptable.  On January 11, 1992, it cancelled the electoral process, forcing President [[Chadli Bendjedid]] to resign and bringing in the exiled independence fighter [[Mohammed Boudiaf]] to serve as a new president. Many FIS members were arrested, including FIS number three leader [[Abdelkader Hachani]] on January 22.  A state of emergency was declared, and the government officially dissolved FIS on March 4.  On July 12, Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj were sentenced to 12 years in prison.

40,000 FIS militants and elected FIS officials were interned in tents deep in the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:258&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.258&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosques were placed under "tight surveillance".&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:175"/&gt; Such activists as remained at large took this as a declaration of war, though FIS would not officially call for armed resistance until 1993, attempting to steer a nuanced course of expressing sympathy for the guerrillas without endorsing their actions.

===Civil war===
{{further information|Algerian Civil War}}
Many took to the hills and joined guerrilla groups.  The country inexorably slid into a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] which would claim more than 250,000 lives, from which it only began to emerge at the end of the 1990s. Initially, the guerrillas were led by members of non-FIS groups, such as [[Mustafa Bouyali]]'s supporters and people who had fought in Afghanistan, although FIS itself established an underground network, led by [[Muhammad Said (GIA)|Mohamed Said]] and [[Abderrezak Redjam]], setting up clandestine newspapers and even a radio station with close links to the MIA.  From late 1992, they also began issuing official statements from abroad, led by [[Rabah Kebir]] and [[Anwar Haddam]].

Soon after taking office in 1994, [[Liamine Zeroual]] began negotiations with the imprisoned FIS leadership, releasing some prisoners (including such figures as [[Ali Djeddi]] and [[Abdelkader Boukhamkham]]) by way of encouragement.  These first negotiations collapsed in March, as each accused the other of reneging on agreements; but further, initially secret, negotiations would take place over the following months.

====Founding of the Islamic Salvation Army====

As the radical [[Armed Islamic Group]] (''Groupe Islamique Armé'' or GIA), hostile to FIS as well as to the government, rose to the forefront, FIS-loyalist guerrillas, threatened with marginalization, attempted to unite their forces.  In July 1994, the MIA, together with the remainder of the MEI and a variety of smaller groups, united as the Islamic Salvation Army (or AIS, a term that had previously sometimes been used as a general label for pro-FIS guerrillas), declaring their allegiance to FIS and thus strengthening FIS' hand for the negotiations.  It was initially headed by MIA's [[Abdelkader Chebouti]], who was superseded in November 1994 by MEI's [[Madani Mezrag]].

The GIA jihad strategy was designed to create an atmosphere of general insecurity, and included attacks on civilians. It rejected all truces and compromises with the government.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:260/&gt; The AIS favored a long-term jihad directed against the state and its representatives, not civilians.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:260&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.260&lt;/ref&gt; The GIA appealed to the ''hittistes'' urban youth, while the AIS support came from the pious middle class.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:254&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p.254&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1994, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) controlled over half the guerrillas of the east and west, but barely 20% in the center, near the capital, where the GIA were mainly based.  Their main leadership was based in the [[Beni Khettab]] mountains near [[Jijel]].  It issued communiqués condemning the GIA's indiscriminate targeting of women, journalists, and other civilians "not involved in the repression", and attacking its school arson campaign.

Meanwhile, following letters from Madani and Belhadj expressing a commitment to pluralistic democracy and proposing possible solutions to the crisis, the government released both from jail to house arrest on September 13.  However, no let up was observed in the fighting, and the government was unwilling to allow them to consult with FIS figures that remained in prison; the negotiations soon foundered, and at the end of October the government announced the failure of the second round of negotiations, and published incriminating letters from Belhadj that were allegedly found on the body of GIA leader Cherif Gousmi, who had been killed on September 26.

===Work in exile===
A few FIS leaders, notably [[Rabah Kebir]], had escaped into exile abroad.  During 1994, they carried out negotiations in Italy with other political parties, notably the FLN and FFS, and came out with a mutual agreement on January 14, 1995: the [[Sant'Egidio platform]].  This set forth a set of principles: respect for human rights and multiparty democracy, rejection of army rule and dictatorship, recognition of [[Islam]], [[Arab]]ness, and [[Berber people|Berberness]] as essential aspects of Algerianness, demand for the release of FIS leaders, and an end to extrajudicial killing and torture on all sides.  To the surprise of many, even Ali Belhadj endorsed the agreement.  However, a crucial signatory was missing: the government itself.  As a result, the platform had little if any effect.

Despite the government's extremely hostile reaction to the Rome Platform, though, a third attempt at negotiations took place, starting in April with a letter from Madani condemning acts of violence, and hopes were raised.  However, the FIS did not offer enough concessions to satisfy the government, demanding, as usual, that FIS leaders should be released before FIS could call for a ceasefire.  In July Zeroual announced that the talks had failed, for the last time.

In 1995, the GIA turned on the AIS in earnest.  Reports of battles between the AIS and GIA increased (resulting in an estimated 60 deaths in March 1995 alone), and the GIA reiterated its death threats against FIS and AIS leaders, claiming to be the "sole prosecutor of jihad" and angered by their negotiation attempts. On July 11 [[Abdelbaki Sahraoui]], a co-founder of FIS, was assassinated in Paris; the GIA said that they were responsible, although there was no evidence supporting this.

===Declaration of ceasefire===
The AIS, faced with attacks from both sides and wanting to dissociate itself from the GIA's [[List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|civilian massacres]], declared a unilateral ceasefire on September 21, 1997 (in order to "unveil the enemy who hides behind these abominable massacres"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/troubles/gia1996.htm |title=Lycos.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210101449/http://membres.lycos.fr/troubles/gia1996.htm |archivedate=10 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and disbanded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/433/re4.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly - Region - Algeria's FIS lays down arms|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327114252/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/433/re4.htm|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of AIS fighters surrendered and handed over their weapons to the authorities. In January 2000 those fighters obtained amnesty under the terms of the "Civil Concord" decreed by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after his election in April 1999. Both Mezrag and Benaïcha offered their services to the authorities to fight the GIA and the [[Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat]] (GSPC), which has links to [[al-Qaida]].

On July 2, 2003, Belhadj and Madani were released. (The former had been in jail, the latter had been moved to house arrest in 1997)  Foreign media were banned from covering the event locally, and FIS itself remains banned.  However, their release has had little apparent impact.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  After a decade of vicious civil conflict, there was little enthusiasm in Algeria for reopening old wounds.

As the civil war jihad impoverished the pious middle class, the AIS lost support to the "moderate" Islamic parties - especially the [[Movement of Society for Peace|Hamas]] party of [[Mahfoud Nahnah]].&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:254/&gt;

'''John Barclay''' (28 January 1582 – 15 August 1621) was a Scottish writer, satirist and [[New Latin language|neo-Latin]] poet.

==Life==
He was born in [[Pont-à-Mousson]], [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]], France, where his Scottish-born father, [[William Barclay (jurist)|William Barclay]], held the chair of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. His mother was a [[French people|Frenchwoman]]. His early education was obtained at the [[Jesuit College]] at Pont-a-Mousson. While there, at the age of nineteen, he wrote a commentary on the ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]'' of [[Statius]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The Jesuits endeavored to induce him to join their order; but his father refused to give his consent and took him to England in 1603.
Barclay had persistently maintained his [[Scottish nationality]] in his French surroundings, and probably found in [[James I of England|James VI and I]]'s accession an opportunity which he would not let slip. In early 1604 John Barclay presented James with a Latin poem, "Kalendae Januariae", and afterward dedicated to him the first part of his ''Euphormionis Satyricon'' (''Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon'') against the [[Jesuits]]. He returned to France by 1605, when a second edition of that book appeared in Paris, having spent some time in [[Angers]]. He was the husband of a Frenchwoman, [[Louise Debonaire]]. Barclay and his wife returned to London in 1606, and there published his ''[[Sylvae]]'', a collection of Latin poems. In 1607 the second part of the ''[[Satyricon]]'' appeared in Paris. In 1616 he went to Rome and resided there until his death on 15 August 1621, aged 39.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} His departure from England may have been prompted by the threat that his children would be brought up as Protestants, since they had been born in England. To the Catholic Barclay, this was unacceptable. In addition he may have been seeking a more generous patron that the somewhat parsimonious King James. In fact Barclay received a pension of some 150 pounds from the Pope.&lt;ref name=RileyHuber/&gt; He wrote his major novel, Argenis, in Rome and, according to his contemporaries, indulged in gardening. He was a member of several learned and literary societies in Rome, including the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000006500&amp;searchAssoc=Assoc accessed9/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; His wife outlived him and died in 1652. One son became bishop of Toul in France and survived until 1673.&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt;

==Works==
In 1609 Barclay edited the ''[[De Potestate Papae]]'', an [[anti-papal]] [[treatise]] by his father, who had died in the preceding year. In 1611 he issued an ''[[Apologia]]'' or "third part" of the ''Satyricon'', in answer to the attacks of the Jesuits. A so-called "fourth part," with the title of ''[[Icon Animorum]]'', describing the character and manners of the European nations, appeared in 1614.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He appears to have been on better terms with the Church and notably with [[Robert Bellarmine]], for in 1617 he issued, from a [[Printing press|press]] at Rome, a ''[[Paraenesis ad Sectarios]]'', an attack on the position of Protestantism. Later editions were published in Cologne. The literary effort of his closing years was his best-known work the ''[[Argenis]]'', a political romance, resembling in certain respects the ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]'' of [[Philip Sidney]], and the ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' of [[Thomas More]]. The book was completed about a fortnight before his death, which has been said to have been hastened by poison.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Richard Crashaw]]'s poem, "Description of a Religious House and Condition of Life", beginning, "No roofs of gold o'er riotous tables shining,/Whole days and suns devour'd with endless dining;" was translated "Out of Barclay."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Crashaw (1914), ''The Religious Poems of Richard Crashaw'', [[Roehampton]], England:  [[Manresa]] Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause for Novak's beatification started on 19 August 2017; he is titled now as a [[Servant of God]].

==Life==
Jorge Novak was born on 4 March 1928 to Jorge Novak and Christina Prediger; he was of German descent on his maternal side. He had seven brothers&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;

Novak entered the [[Society of the Divine Word Missionaries|Divine Word Missionaries]] and made his initial profession on 1 March 1947 and on 1 March 1953 made his solemn profession into the order. He was [[ordained]] to the [[priesthood]] in 1954 in [[Bahía Blanca]] and in 1958 obtained a [[doctorate]] in historical sciences from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Pontifical Gregorian]] in [[Rome]].

In 1972 he became the provincial superior for the order and held that appointment until his elevation to the episcopate. [[Pope Paul VI]] later created the Quilmes diocese through the [[papal bull]] ''Cups Regimini'' on 2 August 1976 and appointed Novak as its first bishop on 7 August. Novak received his [[episcopal consecration]] on 19 September from [[Pio Laghi]] in the new diocese's Immaculate Conception cathedral.&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;&lt;ref name=ID/&gt; There was initial apprehension surrounding his episcopal appointment due to strong rumors of his authoritative professorship in [[La Plata]].

Novak railed against [[human rights abuses]] and criticized the dictatorship and the guerillas for their violence and carnage during the period of [[Dirty War|civil unrest and conflict]]. He pleaded for proper negotiations and peace in 1982 during the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name=ID/&gt; It was after the disappearances of 30 000 people became public that he served as a sort of 'spokesman' for their next of kin asking for investigations and closure for the families of those lost.

He co-founded the Ecumenical Movement for Human Rights alongside several others in February 1976. In September 1984 he was on a trip in [[Costa Rica]] when he was struck with [[Guillain-Barré]] and was recuperating to recover his [[motor skills]] until 1985.&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;

Towards the end of his life he wrote to the government demanding greater action for the poor and often used strong language in order to force the point across. He was also seen leading demonstrations for jobs and organized [[soup kitchens]] in [[shack|shanties]] around urban centers.&lt;ref name=ID/&gt; In 2000 he encouraged one of his priests and the prominent social worker Luis Farinello to go into politics to run for a Senate seat in the [[Argentine legislative election, 2001|October congressional elections]].&lt;ref name=ZN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://zenit.org/articles/argentine-priest-gets-ok-to-enter-politics/|title=Argentine Priest Gets OK to Enter Politics|publisher=Zenit|date=12 December 2000|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novak issued a decree that authorized Farinello to pursue politics but removed him from all ecclesial responsibilities from his public announcement of his candidature and for the duration of his mandate if elected. The decree cited canon 904 of [[canon law]] which allowed Farinello to "celebrate Mass without the attendance of faithful" and exhorted Farinello to adhere to the values of the [[Gospel]] and the [[Roman Catholic social teaching|social teachings of the Church]].

On 28 April 1995 he issued a statement asking for forgiveness for the failure of the Argentine priesthood and episcopate to act during the 1970s when people were disappearing and being killed. Novak pleaded for forgiveness "for our insensitivities" while also referring to their collective "cowardice" and "omissions" which he affirmed made them complicit in the actions of the dictatorship.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; Back in 1991 he was a sharp critic of President [[Carlos Saul Menem]] for his decision to [[People pardoned by Carlos Menem|pardon]] [[Jorge Videla]] and other jailed leaders of the dictatorship and referred to the pardon as a "humiliating defeat" for those who suffered during the dictatorship.&lt;ref name=TM/&gt; In June 2001 he gave his last sermon and discussed the growing [[1998-2002 Argentine great depression|economic crisis]] in which he asked: "How is it possible that in this day and age there are still people who die from hunger, condemned to illiteracy, and without a roof over their heads?"&lt;ref name=ID/&gt;

Novak had an operation for [[stomach cancer]] (the disease he kept a close secret) and later died from it at 4:00am on 9 July 2001.&lt;ref name=ID/&gt; Twelve bishops attended his funeral as did the [[apostolic nuncio]] (later [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]) [[Santos Abril y Castelló]]; the people shouted "Viva el Padre Jorge" and "Viva Monsignor Novak" as his casket was carried out of the church.&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;

==Beatification process==
The cause commenced on 19 August 2017 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declared "[[nihil obstat]]" (no objections) and titled Novak as a [[Servant of God]]. The diocesan process is set to open on 11 December 2017.

From 24 June 2016 the [[postulator]] of the cause is the current [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mendoza|Archbishop of Mendoza]] [[Marcelo Daniel Colombo]].

[[File:Dahi Handi.JPG|thumb|right|Dahi Handi, a Janmashtami tradition, in progress in [[Mumbai]] India.]]

===Maharashtra===
{{Main|Dahi Handi}}
Janmashtami (popularly known as "Gokulashtami" as in Maharashtra) is celebrated in cities such as [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]]. ''Dahi Handi'' is celebrated every August/September, the day after Krishna Janmashtami.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p459"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Roy2005p213"/&gt; The term literally means "earthen pot of yoghurt". The festival gets this popular regional name from legend of baby Krishna. According to it, he would seek and steal milk products such as yoghurt and butter and people would hide their supplies high up out of the baby's reach. Krishna would try all sorts of creative ideas in his pursuit, such as making human pyramids with his friends to break these high hanging pots.&lt;ref name=bryant9&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Francis Bryant|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z02cZe8PU8C|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803400-1|pages=9–10, 115–116, 265–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story is the theme of numerous reliefs on Hindu temples across India, as well as literature and dance-drama repertoire, symbolizing the joyful innocence of children, that love and life's play is the manifestation of god.&lt;ref name="Hawley2014ix"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Stratton Hawley|title=Krishna, The Butter Thief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncb_AwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5540-7|pages=ix–xi, 3–11, 89, 256, 313–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Francis Bryant|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z02cZe8PU8C|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803400-1|pages=114–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maharashtra and other western states in India, this Krishna legend is played out as a community tradition on Janmashtami, where pots of yoghurt are hung high up, sometimes with tall poles or from ropes hanging from second or third level of a building.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p459"/&gt; Per the annual tradition, teams of youth and boys called the "Govindas" go around to these hanging pots, climb one over another and form a human pyramid, then break the pot.&lt;ref name=" Roy2005p213"/&gt; Girls surround these boys, cheer and tease them while dancing and singing. The spilled contents are considered as ''Prasada'' (celebratory offering). It is a public spectacle, cheered and welcomed as a community event.&lt;ref name=" Roy2005p213"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Roy|title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&amp;pg=PA213 |year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|pages=213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNDMello&gt;{{cite news|last1=DMello|first1=Daniel|title=8 incredible facts about Mumbai|url=http://travel.cnn.com/mumbai/life/8-incredible-facts-about-Mumbai-082838|accessdate=23 July 2014|work=CNN|date=4 October 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140729030959/http://travel.cnn.com/mumbai/life/8-incredible-facts-about-Mumbai-082838|archivedate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, many Indian cities celebrate this annual Hindu ritual. Youth groups form ''Govinda pathaks'', which compete with each other, especially for prize money on Janamashtami. These groups are called ''mandals'' or ''handis'' and they go around the local areas, attempting to break as many pots as possible every August. Social celebrities and media attends the festivities, while corporations sponsor parts of the event.&lt;ref name=TOIMishra&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ambarish Mishra|author2=Nitin Yeshwantrao|author3=Bella Jaisinghani|title=Nine-tier handi breaks into Guinness Records|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Nine-tier-handi-breaks-into-Guinness-Records/articleshow/15441796.cms?referral=PM|accessdate=23 July 2014|work=Times of India|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2008/aug/240808-janmashtami-celebrated.htm|title=Janmashtami celebrated with zeal, enthusiasm|work=Mid Day|date=24 August 2008|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash and gifts are offered for ''Govinda'' teams, and according to The Times of India, in 2014 over 4,000 ''handis'' in Mumbai alone were high hung with prizes, and numerous Govinda teams participated.&lt;ref name="TOIMishra"/&gt;

===Gujarat and Rajasthan===
[[File:Festive dishes on Krishna Janmashtami.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional festive food shared on Krishna Janmashtami]]
People in the city of [[Dwarka]] in [[Gujarat]] – where Krishna is believed to have established his kingdom – celebrate the festival with a tradition similar to ''Dahi Handi'', called ''Makhan Handi'' (pot with freshly churned butter). Others perform folk dances at temples, sing bhajans, visit the Krishna temples such as at the [[Dwarkadhish Temple]] or [[Nathdwara]]. In [[Kutch district]] region, farmers decorate their bullock carts and take out Krishna processions, with group singing and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anjali H.

The carnival-style and playful poetry and works of [[Dayaram]], a scholar of the [[Pushtimarg]] of [[Vaishnavism]], is particularly popular during Janmashtami in Gujarat and Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Dwyer|title=The Poetics of Devotion: The Gujarati Lyrics of Dayaram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7XyeTFxY3wC |year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1233-5|pages=79–101, 119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern India=== 
[[File:ISKCON temple, Delhi at Janamashtami.jpg|thumb|ISKCON temple in Delhi at Janamashtami]]
Janmashtami is the largest festival in the Braj region of north India, in cities such as [[Mathura]] where Hindu tradition states Krishna was born, and in [[Vrindavan]] where he grew up.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p459"/&gt; Vaishnava communities in these cities in [[Uttar Pradesh]], as well as others in the state, as well locations in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himalayan north celebrate Janmashtami. Krishna temples are decorated and lighted up, they attract numerous visitors on the day, while Krishna devotees hold [[bhakti]] events and keep night vigil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kishore|first=B. R.|title=Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3WzDipk9xwC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2001|publisher=Diamond |isbn=978-81-7182-073-3|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival typically falls as the monsoons in north India have begun retreating, fields laden with crops and rural communities have time to play. In the northern states, Janmashtami is celebrated with the ''Raslila'' tradition, which literally means "play (lila) of delight, essence (rasa)". This is expressed as solo or group dance and drama events at Janmashtami, wherein Krishna related compositions are sung, music accompanies the performance, while actors and audience share and celebrate the performance by clapping hands to mark the beat.&lt;ref name=" Roy2005p213"/&gt; The childhood pranks of Krishna, and love affairs of Radha-Krishna are particularly popular. According to Christian Roy and other scholars, these Radha-Krishna love stories are Hindu symbolism for the longing and love of human soul for the divine principle and reality it calls [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=bryant9/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Roy2005p213"/&gt;

In [[Jammu]], kite flying from roof tops is a part of the celebration on Krishna Janmashtami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Festival of Kite Flying in Jammu|url= http://www.jammu.com/jammu/fairs/kite-flying.htm |accessdate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern and Northeastern India===
Janmashtami is widely celebrated in the Hindu Vaishnava communities of eastern and northeastern India. The widespread tradition of celebrating Krishna in these regions is credited to the efforts and teachings of 15th and 16th century [[Sankardev]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. They developed philosophical ideas, as well as new forms of performance arts to celebrate the Hindu god Krishna such as [[Borgeet]], [[Ankia Naat]], [[Sattriya]] and [[Bhakti yoga]] now popular in West Bengal and Assam. Further east, Manipur people developed [[Manipuri dance]] form, a classical dance form known for its Hindu [[Vaishnavism]] themes, and which like Sattriya includes love-inspired dance drama arts of Radha-Krishna called [[Raslila]].&lt;ref name=lochtefeld420&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6088">The annual convention of ISNA ([[Islamic Society of North America]]) is the largest annual gathering of Muslim Americans to discuss their role in society, politics, public media, activism, educational institutions, etc. 

The convention occurs every [[Labor Day]] weekend and also include parallel conventions by the [[Muslim Students' Association]] (MSA) of North America, the [[Muslim Youth of North America]] (MYNA), and [[The Islamic Medical Association of North America]] (IMA or IMANA) as well as many other smaller groups associated under the umbrella group ISNA. Attendance in recent years peaked close to 50,000, which is a significant number especially considering the total Muslim population in America is reasonably estimated at 6-7 million. (Other estimates have the number as low as 2 million or as high as 10 million, but these are considered biased estimates).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7750">[[Pope John XXIII]] (1881–1963, {{Abbr|r.|reigned}} 1958–1963) issued eight Papal [[Encyclical]]s during his five-year reign as [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Two of his encylicals, ''[[Mater et magistra]]'' and ''[[Pacem in terris]]'', are especially important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Vatican Revolutionary| newspaper= TIME| pages= | date= 7 June 1963 | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874758-1,00.html | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20000903_john-xxiii_en.html |title= Pope John XXIII Biography |accessdate=2008-05-11 |author= |date= 6 September 2000 |work=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishops]] in a particular area or of the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle= Ecclesiastical Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle= Bulls and Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical varies depending on the circumstances on the content and is not necessarily infallible. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its [[incipit|first few words]].&lt;ref name="Ad Petri cathedram"/&gt;

Pope John XXIII's first encyclical, ''[[Ad Petri cathedram]]'', was issued eight months into his pontificate and was neither an important social document nor doctrinal exposition. Instead it looked at truth, unity and peace with distinctive familiarity and concern.&lt;ref name="Ad Petri cathedram" &gt;{{Citation | title= Ad Petri cathedram| newspaper= TIME| pages= | date= 13 July 1959 | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869179,00.html | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, ''[[Sacerdotii nostri primordia]]'', commemorated the 100th anniversary of the death of [[St. John Vianney]], while ''[[Grata recordatio]]'' considered the use of the [[Rosary]]. ''[[Princeps pastorum]]'', his fourth encyclical, used [[s:Bible (King James)/1 Peter#5:4|1 Peter 5:4]] as its biblical text and celebrated [[Roman Catholic]] missions.

''[[Mater et magistra]]'', the fifth encyclical, carried forward ideas from [[Leo XIII]]'s ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), which had been issued 70 years before, and [[Pius XI]]'s ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931). It considers social ethics with its most important point being the application of [[natural law]] to the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Brown|first= Robert McAfee|authorlink= Robert McAfee Brown |year= 1964|month= |title= Review of The Challenge of ''Mater et magistra''|journal= Review of Religious Research|volume= 6|issue= 1|pages= 44–45|id=  | format = subscription required | quote = The significant new thrust in the encyclical is its application of natural law theory to the international community, and its recognition that in our new and complex society there will be more occasions than in the past in which activities formerly conducted by private individuals will have to be administered by the state. |doi= 10.2307/3510885 |jstor= 3510885 |publisher= Religious Research Association, Inc. |last2= Moody |first2= Joseph N. |last3= Lawler |first3= J. George |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the longest encyclicals, at more than 25,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Mater et Magistra| newspaper= TIME| pages= | date= 21 July 1961 | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897825,00.html | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth encyclical, ''[[Aeterna Dei sapientia]]'', commemorated the death of [[Pope Leo I]] and called for unity within [[Christendom]] from external movements such as [[Communism]] and [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= A Shepherd Calls| newspaper= TIME| pages= | date= 15 December 1961 | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827100,00.html | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penultimate encyclical, ''[[Paenitentiam agere]]'', considered penance and the then-upcoming [[Second Vatican Council]]. Pope John XXIII's final encyclical, ''[[Pacem in terris]]'', was written two months before his death. It is long—over 15,000 words—and is the first in history to have been addressed to "all men of good will", rather than only the bishops and laity of the Roman Catholic Church. It was hailed as "one of the most profound and significant documents of our age."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Lasting Vision of Pope John| newspaper= TIME| pages= | date= 26 February 1965 | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,833488,00.html | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of the largest evangelical megachurches''' contains only [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] [[megachurch]]es related to the following currents: [[baptist|baptism]], [[pentecostalism]], [[evangelical charismatic movement]], [[neo-charismatic movement]] and [[nondenominational Christianity]]. Large churches from other denominations, like [[catholic]], are not included as they are not deemed to belong to the megachurch phenomenon which by definition is part of Protestantism. The list is not exhaustive, there are large annual changes, and there are difficulties to compare the churches as different methods to count can be used.

==Characteristics==
The term megachurch is used for churches with regular attendance of 2,000 people. When it has more than 10,000 people who gather together, the term ''gigachurch'' is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;Alicia Budich, cbsnews.com,

==Data accuracy==
The numbers reported are not accurate by any means, as attendance and membership may be defined very differently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/dr-ray-pritchard/do-pastors-exaggerate-attendance-figures-11529586.html Do Pastors Exaggerate Attendance Figures?]&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance may include people that are not legally members of the church, not [[baptism|baptised]], non-believers, children, and may even belong to other churches. Some churches include their, sometimes loosely, affiliated churches in other places and even people that attend by electronic media. As many have several services on one day, there may be some overlap, with people attending more than one service. The exact number of people is seldom counted, thus estimation errors can occur. There is an obvious psychological boost from reporting growing numbers, "success", for enhanced credibility and motivation to support the work. The megachurches may quite be different from traditional evangelical congregations where clear membership records are maintained, to define who has legal right to vote in the church assembly, who can be appointed to public offices and who belongs to the flock under direct pastoral care, and the pastor can often be replaced. The megachurches are often formed around a strong leader that stays in charge for decades, it is often like his "own personal enterprise", many times with limited economic transparency, a tendency that has been questioned in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16860611 Senator Probes Megachurches' Finances]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charismanews.com/us/53191-controversial-megachurch-pastor-won-t-discuss-finances-because-of-jesus Controversial Megachurch Pastor Won't Discuss Finances Because of Jesus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianpost.com/news/are-prosperity-preachers-destroying-the-traditional-black-church-a-review-of-black-church-inc-121694/ Are Prosperity Preachers Destroying the Traditional Black Church? A Review of 'Black Church Inc']&lt;/ref&gt; In notable cases the headship has been passed on from father to son, like in [[Lakewood Church]]. Many megachurches have had an affiliation to a [[Christian denomination|denomination]], but have become independent, thus outside the denominational supervision that is common for non-independent congregations. Thus, in cases of irregularities, a pastor may continue without disciplinary measures, due to their sheer power, and any disappointed members may leave but new people keep coming in, with reduced effect on attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/may/will-embassy-of-god-punish-sunday-adelaja-multiple-affairs.html Will Europe's Third-Largest Church Punish Pastor for Multiple Affairs?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, due to inaccuracies, the same church can sometimes be reported to have attendance and membership counts that differ 5-10 times, depending on how reporting is done and who is doing it, e.g. [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]] can sometimes be mentioned with attendance numbers over 800,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/10015239 The Economist: O come all ye faithful]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4514">[[image:Baptism-christ.jpg|thumb|''The Baptism of Christ'', by [[Piero della Francesca]], 1449]]
'''Matthew 3:15''' is the fifteenth verse of the third chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. [[Jesus]] has come to [[John the Baptist]] to be baptized, but John [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/balk balked] at this, saying that he should be the one baptized. In this verse, Jesus explains why it is right that He should be baptized.

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:And Jesus answering said unto him, 
:Suffer it to be so now: for thus 
:it becometh us to fulfil all 
:righteousness. Then he suffered him

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:But Jesus, answering, said to him,
:"Allow it now, for this is the 
:fitting way for us to fulfill all 
:righteousness." Then he allowed him.

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=3:15&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 3:15]

These are the first words spoken by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. Since traditionally the Gospel of Matthew is placed as the first book of the New Testament, these are textually the first words spoken by Jesus in the entire Bible. However they are not very well known or much quoted. Scholars have paid considerable attention to them, mainly because of their vagueness.

As it was the first Gospel that was written according to general scholarship, the first recorded words of Jesus are actually in Mark 1:15:  “This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. So mετανοείτε, and believe in the gospel.”

Like the previous verse this one only occurs in Matthew. Many scholars see this section as an add-on attempting to explain why the [[messiah]] is baptized by someone much lower than he is.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew." ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "fulfill all righteousness" is a problematic one. [[Righteousness]] is an important concept in Matthew and it generally means obedience to God. Matthew also often uses the word "fulfill", almost always referring to an Old Testament [[prophecy]] which Jesus is fulfilling. David Hill notes that the phrase could thus be interpreted as Jesus fulfilling divine rules of which only he is aware.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, David. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Cullman emphasizes the word ''all'' and argues that Jesus' baptism is to obtain righteousness for all humanity. [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Daniel J. Harrington|Daniel Harrington]] links the fulfillment not to the Old Testament but to the discussion of fruits of repentance at [[Matthew 3:8]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Daniel J. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Liturgical Press, 1991 pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

A second important issue is why Jesus, who is [[sin]]less, should go through a ritual that is designed to cleanse all sins. There are two main explanations of this. One is that Jesus by being baptized is setting a good example for the rest of humanity, that while he does not himself need the cleansing he is showing how important it is for others. The second view is that Jesus' being baptized is part of the process of taking on the burden of the sins of all humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Howard W. ''The Gospel of Matthew and its Readers: A Historical Introduction to the First Gospel.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; German theologian [[Heinrich August Wilhelm Meyer|Heinrich Meyer]] lists and evaluates a number of reasons offered for why Jesus came to be baptized by John.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Matthew 3:13#Analysis|Matthew 3:13]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Mormon]] provides an additional perspective on these two issues, explaining that Jesus "fulfilled all righteousness" by humbly witnessing that he would obey the Father, thus setting an example for how "the children of men" should live.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.6-7,9 2 Nephi 31:6-7,9]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several of the [[Fathers of the Church]] infer from the words "it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness" that John was afterwards baptized by Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm Pulpit Commentary] on Matthew 3, accessed 30 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modh''' communities comprise people who use the name and originate from [[Modhera]] in [[Gujarat]], India. In that [[States and territories of India|state]] and in [[Rajasthan]], there are many examples of Hindu communities who take their name from a town and thus there exist both Modh [[Brahmin]]s and Modh [[Bania (caste)|Vaniks]]. Where two groups share a similar toponym, the Brahmin group often traditionally acted as priests for the other, although this was not always the case and sometimes there was no corresponding group at all or there were more than two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Family in India: Critical Essays |first=A.

'''Muslim Roma''' or '''Muslim Gypsies''' are [[Romani people]] who adopted [[Islam]]. Romanies have usually adopted the predominant religion of the host country. Islam among Romanies is historically associated with life of Romanies within the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Correspondingly, significant cultural minorities of Muslim Roma are found in [[Turkey]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Egypt]], [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]] (by mid-1990s estimates, Muslim Roma in [[Bulgaria]] constituted about 40% of Roma in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Nonneman, Tim Niblock, Bogdan Szajkowski (Eds.) (1996) "Muslim Communities in the New Europe", {{ISBN|0-86372-192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Romania]] (a very small [[Islam in Romania|Muslim Romani]] group exist in the [[Dobruja]] region of [[Romania]], comprising 1% of the country's Romani population)&lt;ref name="oprisangrigore"&gt;Ana Oprişan, [[George Grigore]], [http://www.isim.nl/files/newsl_8.pdf "The Muslim Gypsies in Romania"], in International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) Newsletter 8, September 2001, p.32; retrieved June 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Croatia]] (45% of the country's Romani population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vulnerability.undp.sk/DOCUMENTS/croatia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727005759/http://vulnerability.undp.sk/DOCUMENTS/croatia.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Southern [[Russia]], [[Greece]] (a small part of Muslim Roma concentrated in Thrace), [[Crimea]] and the [[Caucasus]].
Because of the relative ease of migration in modern times, Muslim Roma may be found in other parts of the world as well.

After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the parts where Islam is no longer a dominant religion Muslim Roma have found themselves under double discrimination, both due to [[Antiziganism]] and [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Danchin, Elizabeth A. Cole (Eds.) (2002) "Protecting the Human Rights of Religious Minorities in Eastern Europe", {{ISBN|0-231-12475-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim Roma throughout Southern Europe call themselves '''Horahane Roma''' ("Turkish Roma", also spelled as '''Khorakhane''', '''Xoraxane''', '''Kharokane''',  '''Xoraxai''', etc.) and are colloquially referred to as '''Turkish Roma''' or Turkish Gypsies in the host countries.

Otukan (Ötüken) is also one of the names given to [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]].

== Otukan and nature ==
According to this ancient belief, the mood of the [[Yer-sub]] and Ötüken could be seen in the trees' condition. If the trees are healthy and strong and are bearing a lot of [[fruit]], it is believed that Ötüken is satisfied with humans. A prayer dedicated to Ötüken was once directed to a grand tree.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Otugan existed in the middle of the Universe and her residence was in Central Asia on Khangan Plateau. This place was called "The Otuken (Ötüken) Homeland".

== Mountain ==
The word was used to describe the sacred [[mountain]] of the [[Göktürks|ancient Turks]]. It was mentioned by [[Bilge Khagan]] in the [[Orkhon inscriptions]] as "the place from where the tribes can be controlled". A force called ''qut'' was believed to emanate from this mountain, granting the local potentate the divine right to rule all the Turkic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Franke, Herbert. ''The Cambridge History of China''. Cambridge University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-521-21447-5}}. Page 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although never identified precisely, Ötüken probably stretched "from the [[Khangai Mountains|Khangai]] Range of Central [[Mongolia]] to the [[Sayan Mountains]] of [[Tuva]], at the centre of which is the [[Orkhon Valley]]",&lt;ref&gt;Jarich G. Oosten, Henri J. M. Claessen. ''Ideology and the Formation of Early States''. Brill Academic Publishers, 1996. {{ISBN|90-04-10470-4}}. Pages 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt; which for centuries was regarded as the seat of the imperial power of the [[steppe]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">'''Patit''' is a term which refers to a person who has been initiated into the [[Sikh]] religion, but violates the religion's precepts. The term is sometimes translated as [[apostate]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikhism Today|author=Jhutti-Johal, J.|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781847062727|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37i7uAYe6QEC|page=99|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its legal definition as inserted in the Sikh [[Gurdwaras Act]], 1925, through the amending Act XI of 1944:: ''Patit means a person who being a [[Keshdhari]] [[Sikh]], trims or shaves his beard or keshas or who after taking amrit commits any one or more of the four kurahits.''

[[Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971]], contains a similar definition except a reference to keshdhari because unlike [[Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925]], it defines only [[keshdhari]], and not [[sahajdhari]], as Sikhs. It states: ''"Patit" means a Sikh who trims or shaves his beard or hair (keshas) or who after taking amrit commits any one or more of the four kurahits.''

In the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]], Section Six, it states: The undermentioned four transgressions must be avoided:
* Dishonouring the hair;
* Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered the [[Kutha meat|Kutha]] way;
* Cohabiting with a person other than one's spouse;
* Using tobacco.

These four kurahit causes of apostasy were first listed by [[Guru Gobind Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Singh|editor1-first=Kharak|title=Apostasy among Sikh youth: causes and cures|date=1997|publisher=Institute of Sikh Studies|isbn=8185815054|pages=1-3, 6|url=https://archive.org/details/ApostesyAmongSikhYouthItsCausesAndCures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Alexander McWilliams''' (August 5, 1949 – June 14, 2000)&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; was an American self-help author who advocated for the legalization of [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/26/us/peter-mcwilliams-dies-at-50-an-author-of-self-help-books.html|title=Peter McWilliams Dies at 50; An Author of Self-Help Books|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2000|accessdate=March 12, 2013|author=Lehman-Haupt, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McWilliams was born to a [[Roman Catholic]] family in Detroit, one of two sons of Henry G. and Mary (née Taormina; later Fadden) McWilliams. His father worked as a supervisor at a drugstore and his mother was a part-time salesperson.

He attended [[Allen Park High School]] and [[Eastern Michigan University]] and later enrolled at [[Maharishi International University]]. At the age of 17 he wrote a collection of poems called ''Come Love with Me and Be My Life,'' which he self-published under the name Versemonger Press.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;

==Adult life==
McWilliams wrote ''The TM Book'' in 1975 with Denise Denniston, which was at the top of the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for three weeks.&lt;ref name=Sokol/&gt;

In 1976, he wrote ''TM: An Alphabetical Guide to the [[Transcendental Meditation]] Program'' with Denniston and [[Nat Goldhaber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Goldhaber|first1=Nat|last2=Denniston|first2=Denise|last3=McWilliams|first3=Peter|title=TM: an alphabetical guide to the transcendental meditation program|year=1976|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-24096-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later wrote ''TM'', with [[Harold H. Bloomfield]] and later co-wrote the book ''How to Heal Depression''.&lt;ref name=Sokol&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'shame' of depression That's how many people see it. 'Women sit down and cry. Men go out and get drunk,' says one sufferer. But ignoring it will often just make things worse|first=Al|last=Sokol|work=Toronto Star|date=July 4, 1994|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McWilliams was active in [[Erhard Seminars Training]] with [[Werner Erhard]] and Stuart Emory's "Actualizations" [[large-group awareness training]] before meeting [[John-Roger]] in the fall of 1978. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

He wrote nearly 40 books&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; including ''Surviving the Loss of a Love'' (1971),  ''The Personal Computer Book'' (1982) and  ''Life 101: Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School but Didn't'' (1990).  His 1982 book, ''The Word Processing Book: A Short Course in Computer Literacy'' was published during the "computer revolution" and was "highly successful."&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; McWilliams was a photographer and a collection of his own photographs were published in October 1992 in a book titled ''Portraits - A Book of Photographs by Peter McWilliams'' (1992).

McWilliams was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; He was arrested and charged with growing marijuana in 1997.&lt;ref name="Wash Po"/&gt; He was released from custody on $250,000 bail and with the "condition that he not use marijuana."&lt;ref name="Wash Po"/&gt; His book, ''[[Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do|Ain't Nobody's Business if You Do: The Absurdity of Consensual Crimes in Our Free Society]]'', published in 1993, made a case for the legalization of drugs and became a favored publication of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; ''Life 101'' and subsequent books list John-Roger (Roger Delano Hinkins), the leader of the Church of the [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]] as his co-writer.  McWilliams later repudiated the movement, claiming to be the sole author of the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McWilliams|first1=Peter|title=Life 102: What to Do When Your Guru Sues You|year=1994|publisher= Prelude Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=093158034X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
McWilliams died on June 14, 2000 in his Los Angeles home, of [[AIDS]]-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was survived by his mother and brother, Michael McWilliams.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt; At the time he was awaiting sentencing for his conviction of conspiring to "possess, manufacture and sell marijuana."&lt;ref name="Wash Po"&gt;{{cite news|title=Author Peter McWilliams; Marijuana Proponent|work=The Washington Post|date=June 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis activist [[Richard Cowan (cannabis activist)|Richard Cowan]] and many critics of the drug policies in the United States have described his death as murder by the U. S. government, insofar as they denied him the use of the [[medical marijuana]] which might have prevented his death. [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]] stated that McWilliams was vomiting and in pain when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life cut short – over a forbidden toke|first=WILLIAM F. |last=BUCKLEY JR.|work=Houston Chronicle|date=June 24, 2000|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is entombed at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Westwood, California.

'''Pravachanasara''', is a text composed by [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]], [[Kundakunda]], in about the mid-second century BC. It means "Essence of Scriptures" or "Essence of Sermons" or "Essence of Doctrine". In the text, Kundakunda shows how the correct understanding of the duality of self and others leads to that defining characteristic of [[Digambara]] mendicant praxis, nudity.{{sfn|Cort|1998|p=10}} It consists of three chapters and 275 verses. 

First chapter consists of 92 verses and it describes attributes of Supreme Beings and outlines the first steps in the process of transforming oneself into a Supreme Being. Second chapter consists of 108 verses and it describes laws of interaction between space, time particles, elementary matter particles, compound matter particles, motion and souls in the Cosmos. Third chapter consists of 75 verses and it is aimed at delineating the bases of correct mendicant praxis. 

Acharya [[Jayasena]] has written a commentary on Pravachanasara titled ''Tatparyavritti'' (i.e. ''the Purport'').{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=139}}

'''Process theology''' is a type of theology developed from [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s (1861–1947) [[process philosophy]], most notably by [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000) and [[John B. Cobb]] (b. 1925). Process theology and process philosophy are collectively referred to as "process thought".

For both Whitehead and Hartshorne, it is an essential attribute of God to affect and be affected by temporal processes, contrary to the forms of theism that hold God to be in all respects non-temporal (eternal), unchanging ([[wikt:immutable|immutable]]), and unaffected by the world ([[wikt:impassible|impassible]]). Process theology does not deny that God is in some respects eternal (will never die), immutable (in the sense that God is unchangingly good), and impassible (in the sense that God's eternal aspect is unaffected by actuality), but it contradicts the classical view by insisting that God is in some respects temporal, mutable, and passible.&lt;ref name=viney&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Viney |first=Donald Wayne |title=Process Theism |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/ |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=January 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cobb, "process theology may refer to all forms of theology that emphasize event, occurrence, or [[becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] over against [[being|substance]]. In this sense theology influenced by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] is process theology just as much as that influenced by Whitehead. This use of the term calls attention to affinities between these otherwise quite different traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cobb Jr. |first=John B. |authorlink=John B.

== History ==
Various theological and philosophical aspects have been expanded and developed by [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000), [[John B. Cobb|John B.

Cooper, ''Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2006), 342.&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of process theology each of these thinkers shared was a rejection of [[metaphysics]] that privilege "[[being]]" over "[[becoming (philosophy)|becoming]]", particularly those of [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Seibt, Johanna |title=Process Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/ |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=October 26, 2017 |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartshorne was deeply influenced by French philosopher [[Jules Lequier]] and by Swiss philosopher [[Charles Secrétan]] who were probably the first ones to claim that in God liberty of becoming is above his substantiality.

Process theology soon influenced a number of [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologians including [[Rabbi]]s [[Max Kadushin]], [[Milton Steinberg]] and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky and, to a lesser degree, [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]]. Today some rabbis who advocate some form of process theology include [[Bradley Shavit Artson]], Lawrence A. Englander, [[William E. Kaufman]], [[Harold Kushner]], Anton Laytner, [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]],  Gilbert S. Rosenthal, [[Lawrence Troster]], Donald B. Rossoff, Burton Mindick, and Nahum Ward.

Alan Anderson and Deb Whitehouse have applied process theology to the [[New Thought Movement|New Thought]] variant of [[Christianity]].

The work of Richard Stadelmann has been to preserve the uniqueness of Jesus in process theology.

==God and the World relationship ==
Whitehead's classical statement is a set of [[Antithesis|antithetical statements]] that attempt to avoid self-contradiction by shifting them from a set of oppositions into a contrast:

* It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent.
* It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many.
* It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently.
* It is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is immanent in the World.
* It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God.
* It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Process and Reality, Corrected Ed. (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes  ==
* [[God]] is not [[omnipotent]] in the sense of being [[coercive]]. The divine has a power of persuasion rather than coercion. Process theologians interpret the classical doctrine of omnipotence as involving force, and suggest instead a forbearance in divine power. "Persuasion" in the causal sense means that God does not exert unilateral control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes'' (Albany: State University of New York, 1984), 20—26.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reality is not made up of material substances that endure through time, but serially-ordered events, which are experiential in nature. These events have both a physical and mental aspect. All experience (male, female, atomic, and botanical) is important and contributes to the ongoing and interrelated process of reality.
* The universe is characterized by process and change carried out by the agents of [[free will]]. [[Self-determination theory|Self-determination]] characterizes everything in the [[universe]], not just human beings. God cannot totally control any series of events or any individual, but God influences the creaturely exercise of this universal free will by offering possibilities. To say it another way, God has a will in everything, but not everything that occurs is God's will.&lt;ref&gt;John Cobb and David Griffin, ''Process Theology: An Introductory Exposition'' (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1976), 14—16, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* God contains the universe but is not identical with it ([[panentheism]], not [[pantheism]] or [[pandeism]]). Some also call this "theocosmocentrism" to emphasize that God has always been related to some world or another.
* Because God interacts with the changing universe, [[Theomorphism|God is changeable]] (that is to say, God is affected by the actions that take place in the universe) over the course of time. However, the abstract elements of God ([[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], [[wisdom]], etc.) remain eternally solid.
* [[Charles Hartshorne]] believes that people do not experience ''subjective'' (or personal) [[immortality]], but they do have ''objective'' immortality because their experiences live on forever in God, who contains all that was. Other process theologians believe that people do have subjective experience after bodily death.&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne, 32−36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dipolar theism]] is the idea that God has both a changing aspect (God's existence as a Living God) and an unchanging aspect (God's eternal essence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Viney, Donald Wayne |title=Charles Hartshorne: Dipolar Theism |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/biographies/charles-hartshorne-dipolar-theism/ |publisher=Harvard Square Library |date=August 24, 2004&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20040824225940/http://harvardsquarelibrary.org:80/Hartshorne/Viney/12.html --&gt; |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to liberation theology ==
Henry Young combines Black theology and Process theology in his book ''Hope in Process''. Young seeks a model for American society that goes beyond the alternatives of integration of Blacks into white society and Black separateness. He finds useful the process model of the many becoming one. Here the one is a new reality that emerges from the discrete contributions of the many, not the assimilation of the many to an already established one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cobb Jr., John B. |title=Process Theology |url=https://www.religion-online.org/article/process-theology/ |publisher=Religion Online |date=1978 |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monica Coleman]] has combined Womanist theology and Process theology in her book ''Making a Way Out of No Way''. In it, she argues that 'making a way out of no way' and 'creative transformation' are complementary insights from the respective theological traditions. She is one of many theologians who identify both as a process theologian and feminist/womanist/ecofeminist theologian, which includes persons such as [[Sallie McFague]], [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]], and [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Process Studies, [http://www.ctr4process.org/about/CoDirectors/ "CPS Co-directors,"] retrieved September 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianbook.com/the-body-god-an-ecological-theology/sallie-mcfague/pd/27350 "The Body of God - An Ecological Theology,"] retrieved September 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. Robert Mesle]], in his book ''Process Theology'', outlines three aspects of a process [[liberation theology|theology of liberation]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Robert Mesle]], ''Process Theology: A Basic Introduction'' (St. Louis, MO: Chalice Press, 1993), 65—68, 75−80.&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is a relational character to the divine which allows God to experience both the joy and suffering of humanity. God suffers just as those who experience oppression and God seeks to actualize all positive and beautiful potentials. God must, therefore, be in solidarity with the oppressed and must also work for their liberation.
# God is not omnipotent in the classical sense and so God does not provide support for the status quo, but rather seeks the actualization of greater good.
# God exercises relational power and not unilateral control. In this way God cannot instantly end evil and oppression in the world. God works in relational ways to help guide persons to liberation.

== Relationship to pluralism ==
Process theology affirms that God is working in all persons to actualize potentialities. In that sense each religious manifestation is the Divine working in a unique way to bring out the beautiful and the good. Additionally, scripture and religion represent human interpretations of the divine. In this sense [[religious pluralism|pluralism]] is the expression of the diversity of cultural backgrounds and assumptions that people use to approach the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Mesle (1993). p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the doctrine of the incarnation ==
{{further information|Incarnation (Christianity)}}
Contrary to [[Christian theology|Christian orthodoxy]], the ''[[Christ]]'' of mainstream process theology is not the mystical and historically exclusive union of divine and human natures in one hypostasis, the eternal [[Logos]] of God uniquely enfleshed in and identifiable as the man [[Jesus]]. Rather God is incarnate in the lives of all people when they act according to a call from God. Jesus fully and in every way responded to God's call, thus the person of Jesus is theologically understood as "the divine Word in human form." Jesus is not singularly or essentially God, but he was perfectly synchronized to God at all moments of life.&lt;ref&gt;Mesle (1993). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb expressed the Incarnation in process terms that link it to his understanding of actualization of human potential: "'Christ' refers to the Logos as incarnate hence as the process of creative transformation in and of the world".

== Debate about process theology's conception of God’s power ==
A criticism of process theology is that it offers a too severely diminished conception of God’s power.  Process theologians argue that God does not have unilateral, coercive control over everything in the universe.  In process theology, God cannot override a person’s freedom, nor perform miracles that violate the laws of nature, nor perform physical actions such as causing or halting a flood or an avalanche.  Critics argue that this conception diminishes divine power to such a degree that God is no longer worshipful.&lt;ref name="John W. Cooper 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=[[John S. Feinberg]] ; John S. Feinberg, general|title=No one like Him : the doctrine of God|date=2006|publisher=Crossway Books|location=Wheaton. Ill.|page=178|isbn=978-1581348118|edition=[Rev. ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger E. Olson]], “[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2013/12/why-i-am-not-a-process-theologian/ Why I am Not a Process Theologian],” last modified December 4, 2013, ''Patheos.org'', accessed May 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Basinger]], ''Divine Power in Process Theism'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Truesdale, ''God Reconsidered'' (Kansas City: Beacon Hill Press, 2010), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process theology response to this criticism is that the traditional Christian conception of God is actually ''not'' worshipful as it stands, and that the traditional notion of God’s [[omnipotence]] fails to make sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''God, Power, and Evil: A Process Theodicy'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2004), 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

First, power is a relational concept.  It is not exerted in a vacuum, but always by some entity ''A'' over some other entity ''B''.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin (2004). p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, power requires analysis of both the being exerting power, and the being that power is being exerted upon.  To suppose that an entity ''A'' (in this case, God), can always successfully control any other entity ''B'' is to say, in effect, that ''B'' does not exist as a free and individual being in any meaningful sense, since there is no possibility of its resisting ''A'' if ''A'' should decide to press the issue.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin (2004). p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mindful of this, process theology makes several important distinctions between different kinds of power. The first distinction is between "coercive" power and "persuasive" power.&lt;ref name="God, Power 2004"&gt;David Ray Griffin (2004). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Coercive power is the kind that is exerted by one physical body over another, such as one billiard ball hitting another, or one arm twisting another. Lifeless bodies (such as the billiard balls) cannot resist such applications of physical force at all, and even living bodies (like arms) can only resist so far, and can be coercively overpowered.  While finite, physical creatures can exert coercive power over one another in this way, God—lacking a physical body—''cannot'' (not merely ''will'' not) exert coercive control over the world.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin (2004). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

But process theologians argue that coercive power is actually a secondary or derivative form of power, while persuasion is the primary form.&lt;ref name="God, Power 2004"/&gt; Even the act of self-motion (of an arm, for instance) is an instance of persuasive power. The arm may not perform in the way a person wishes it to—it may be broken, or asleep, or otherwise unable to perform the desired action. It is only after the persuasive act of self-motion is successful that an entity can even ''begin'' to exercise coercive control over other finite physical bodies.  But no amount of coercive control can alter the free decisions of other entities; only persuasion can do so.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin (2004). p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a child is told by his parent that he must go to bed. The child, as a self-conscious, decision-making individual, can always make the decision to ''not'' go to bed. The parent may then respond by picking up the child bodily and carrying him to his room, but nothing can force the child to alter his decision to resist the parent's directive. It is only the ''body'' of the child that can be coercively controlled by the body of the physically stronger parent; the child's free will remains intact.  While process theologians argue that God does not have coercive power, they also argue that God has ''supreme persuasive power'', that God is always influencing/persuading us to choose the good.

One classic exchange over the issue of divine power is between philosophers [[Frederick Sontag]] and [[John K. Roth]] and process theologian [[David Ray Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Evil 1981"&gt;David Ray Griffin, "Creation Out of Chaos and the Problem of Evil," in ''Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy'', ed. Stephen Davis (Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1981), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Sontag and Roth argued that the process God’s inability to, for instance, stop the genocide at Auschwitz meant that God was not worthy of worship, since there is no point in worshipping a God that cannot save us from such atrocities. Griffin's response was as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the stronger complaints from Sontag and Roth is that, given the enormity of evil in the world, a deity that is [merely] doing its best is not worthy of worship. The implication is that a deity that is ''not'' doing its best ''is'' worthy of worship. For example, in reference to Auschwitz, Roth mocks my God with the statement that “the best that God could possibly do was to permit 10,000 Jews a day to go up in smoke.” Roth prefers a God who had the power to prevent this Holocaust but did not do it! This illustrates how much people can differ in what they consider worthy of worship. For Roth, it is clearly brute ''power'' that evokes worship. The question is: is this what ''should'' evoke worship? To refer back to the point about revelation: is this kind of power worship consistent with the Christian claim that divinity is decisively revealed in Jesus? Roth finds my God too small to evoke worship; I find his too gross.&lt;ref name="Evil 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The process argument, then, is that those who cling to the idea of God's coercive omnipotence are defending power for power's sake, which would seem to be inconsistent with the life of Jesus, who Christians believe died for humanity's sins rather than overthrow the Roman empire.  Griffin argues that it is actually the God whose omnipotence is defined in the "traditional" way that is not worshipful.&lt;ref name="Evil 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One other distinction process theologians make is between the idea of "unilateral" power versus "relational" power.&lt;ref name="Relational Power"&gt;C. Robert Mesle, "[http://www.jesusjazzbuddhism.org/relational-power.html Relational Power]," ''JesusJazzBuddhism.org'', accessed May 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;   Unilateral power is the power of a king (or more accurately, a tyrant) who wishes to exert control over his subjects ''without'' being affected ''by'' them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schubert M. Ogden]], ''The Reality of God and Other Essays'' (Dallas: Southern Methodist University Press, 1992), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, most people would agree that a ruler who is not changed or affected by the joys and sorrows of his subjects is actually a despicable ruler and a psychopath.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, "Kant's Traditionalism," in ''Insights and Oversights of Great Thinkers: An Evaluation of Western Philosophy'', ed. Charles Hartshorne (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983), 174.&lt;/ref&gt;   Process theologians thus stress that God’s power is relational; rather than being unaffected and unchanged by the world, God is the being ''most'' affected by every other being in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, ''The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; As process theologian C. Robert Mesle puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Relational power takes great strength.  In stark contrast to unilateral power, the radical  manifestations of relational power are found in people like [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Jesus]]. It requires the willingness to endure tremendous suffering while refusing to hate.  It demands that we keep our hearts open to those who wish to slam them shut. It means offering to open up a relationship with people who hate us, despise us, and wish to destroy us.&lt;ref name="Relational Power"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In summation, then, process theologians argue that their conception of God’s power does not diminish God, but just the opposite.  Rather than see God as one who unilaterally coerces other beings, judges and punishes them, and is completely unaffected by the joys and sorrows of others, process theologians see God as the one who persuades the universe to love and peace, is supremely affected by even the tiniest of joys and the smallest of sorrows, and is able to love all beings despite the most heinous acts they may commit.  God is, as Whitehead says, "the fellow sufferer who understands."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred North Whitehead]], ''[[Process and Reality]]'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, '''psychology of religion''' consists of the application of [[List of psychological research methods|psychological methods]] and interpretive frameworks to the diverse contents of the religious traditions as well as to both religious and irreligious individuals. The extraordinary range of methods and frameworks can be helpfully summed up regarding the classic distinction between the natural-scientific and human-scientific approaches: the first cluster proceeds by means of objective, quantitative, and preferably experimental procedures for testing hypotheses regarding the causal connections among the objects of one's study. In contrast, the human-scientific approach accesses the human world of experience using qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretive methods, with the goal of discerning meaningful rather than causal connections among the phenomena one seeks to understand.

Psychologists of religion pursue three major projects: (1) systematic description, especially of religious contents, attitudes, experiences, and expressions; (2) explanation of the origins of religion, both in the history of the human race and in individual lives, taking into account a diversity of influences; and (3) mapping out the consequences of religious attitudes and conduct, both for the individual and for society at large. The psychology of [[religion]] first arose as a self-conscious discipline in the late 19th century, but all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.&lt;ref name=" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732"&gt;Wulff, D. M. (2010). Psychology of Religion. In D. A. Leeming, K. Madden, &amp; S. Marian (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (pp. 732–735). New York; London: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The challenge for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold: (1) to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition's ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct; (2) to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena, whether they be in individual lives; and (3) to clarify the outcomes—the fruits, as William James put it—of these phenomena, for individuals, and the larger society.&lt;ref name=" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732"/&gt; These fruits may be both positive and negative.

The first, descriptive task naturally requires a clarification of one's terms—above all, the word religion. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic character of this term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally in the direction of [[Concretization|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. C. (1963). ''The Meaning and End of Religion: A New Approach to the Religious Traditions of Mankind.'' New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, D. M. (1999). Psychologists Define Religion: Patterns and Prospects of a Century-Long Quest. In J. G. Platvoet and A. L. Molendijk (Eds.), ''The Pragmatics of Defining Religion: Contexts, Concepts, and Contests'' (pp. 207–224). Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology over the course of the 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be operationalized by quantitative procedures, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P. C., and Hood, R. W., Jr. (Eds.). (1999). ''Measures of Religiosity." Birmingham, AL: Religious Education Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Factor analysis was also brought into play by both [[psychologist]]s and [[sociologist]]s of religion, to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.

In the last several decades, especially among [[clinical psychologist]]s, a preference for the terms "spirituality" and "spiritual" has emerged, along with efforts to distinguish them from "religion" and "religious." Especially in the [[United States]], "religion" has for many become associated with sectarian institutions and their obligatory creeds and rituals, thus giving the word a negative cast; "spirituality," in contrast, is positively constructed as deeply individual and subjective, as a universal capacity to apprehend and accord one's life with higher realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schlehofer M. M. |author2=Omoto A. M. |author3=Adelman J. R. | year = 2008 | title = How Do "Religion" and "Spirituality" Differ? Lay Definitions Among Older Adults | URL = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 411–425 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00418.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, "spirituality" has likewise undergone an evolution in the [[Western world|West]], from a time when it was essentially a synonym for religion in its original, subjective meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Principe W | year = 1983 | title = Toward Defining Spirituality | URL = | journal = Sciences Religieuses/Studies in Religion | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 127–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Today, efforts are ongoing to "[[operationalization|operationalize]]" these terms, with little regard for their history in their Western context, and with the apparent realist assumption that underlying them are fixed qualities identifiable using empirical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, P. C. (2005). Measurement in the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality: Current Status and Evaluation. In [[Raymond Paloutzian|R. F. Paloutzian]] &amp; C. L. Park (Eds.), ''Handbook of the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.'' New York, London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schnitker and Emmons theorized that the understanding of religion as a search for meaning makes implications in the three psychological areas of motivation, cognition and social relationships. The cognitive aspects relate to God and a sense of purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious search for meaning is also weaved into social communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Spiritual striving and seeking the sacred: religion as meaningful goal-directed behavior.|last = Schnitker|first = Sarah|date = 2013|journal = The International Journal For The Psychology Of Religion|doi = 10.1080/10508619.2013.795822|pmid = |volume=23|pages=315–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{More footnotes|date=January 2012}}

=== William James ===
American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as the founder of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger and Gorsuch, 2003, The Psychology of Religion, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the ''American Psychological Association'', and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James' influence endures. His ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience|Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences.

James distinguished between [[institutional religion]] and [[personal religion]]. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has [[mystical experience]], can be experienced regardless of the culture. James was most interested in understanding personal religious experience.

In studying personal religious experiences, James made a distinction between ''healthy-minded'' and ''sick-souled'' religiousness. Individuals predisposed to healthy-mindedness tend to ignore the evil in the world and focus on the positive and the good. James used examples of [[Walt Whitman]] and the "[[mind-cure]]" religious movement to illustrate healthy-mindedness in ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''. In contrast, individuals predisposed to having a sick-souled religion are unable to ignore evil and suffering and need a unifying experience, religious or otherwise, to reconcile good and evil. James included quotations from [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[John Bunyan]] to illustrate the sick soul.

William James' hypothesis of pragmatism stems from the efficacy of religion. If an individual believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, then there is no rationality for continuing the practice.

=== Other early theorists ===

==== G. W. F. Hegel ====
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) described all systems of religion, philosophy, and social science as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of that search for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]] was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel's system, Religion is one of the major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity's past in various stages of its development.

==== Sigmund Freud ====
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]. Back row: [[Abraham Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]].]] 
[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', he applied the idea of the [[Oedipus complex]] (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud reconstructed biblical history by his general theory. His ideas were also developed in ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]''. When Freud spoke of religion as an [[illusion]], he maintained that it "is a fantasy structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to maturity."

Freud views the idea of [[God]] as being a version of the [[father]] image, and religious belief as at bottom infantile and [[neurosis|neurotic]]. Authoritarian religion, Freud believed, is dysfunctional and alienates man from himself.

==== Carl Jung ====
The Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) adopted a very different posture, one that was more sympathetic to religion and more concerned with a positive appreciation of [[religious symbolism]]. Jung considered the question of the metaphysical existence of God to be unanswerable by the psychologist and adopted a kind of [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 'On the Nature of the Psyche,' C.W.8, Aphorisms 362, 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung postulated, in addition to the personal [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] (roughly adopting Freud's concept), the [[collective unconscious]], which is the repository of human experience and which contains "[[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]" (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The irruption of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of [[religious experience]] and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung's writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal [[symbol]]s, and include his work in [[comparative mythology]].

==== Alfred Adler ====
Austrian psychiatrist [[Alfred Adler]] (1870–1937), who parted ways with Freud, emphasized the role of goals and motivation in his ''Individual Psychology''. One of Adler's most famous ideas is that we try to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions, God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.

Our ideas about [[God]] are important indicators of how we view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our vision of the world – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by [[natural selection]]. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way, our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.

An important thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and others. Our view of God is important because it embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.

Compared to [[science]], another social movement, [[religion]] is more efficient because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervor, and promotes the welfare of all segments of society, will the two be more equal in peoples' eyes.

==== Gordon Allport ====
In his classic book ''The Individual and His Religion'' (1950), [[Gordon Allport]] (1897–1967) illustrates how people may use religion in different ways.&lt;ref name="Leak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3852/is_200201/ai_n9029025/?tag=untagged|title=Exploratory factor analysis of the religious maturity scale|last=Leak|first=Gary K|year=2002|work=BNET UK|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a distinction between ''Mature religion'' and
''Immature religion''. Mature religious sentiment is how Allport characterized the person whose approach to religion is dynamic, open-minded, and able to maintain links between inconsistencies. In contrast, immature religion is [[vanity|self-serving]] and generally represents the negative stereotypes that people have about religion.
More recently, this distinction has been encapsulated in the terms "intrinsic religion", referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout [[faith]], and "extrinsic religion", referring to a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as [[church attendance]] to gain [[social status]]. These dimensions of religion were measured on the [[Extrinsic religious orientation|Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and Ross (1967). The third form of religious orientation has been described by [[Daniel Batson]]. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search (Batson, Schoenrade &amp; Ventis, 1993).
More specifically, it has been seen by Batson as comprising a willingness to view religious doubts positively, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quests respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end, and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade &amp; Ventis, 1993).

==== Erik H. Erikson ====
[[Erik Erikson]] (1902–1994) is best known for his theory of psychological development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of [[identity (social science)|identity]] in personality. His biographies of [[Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther]] reveal Erikson's positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful [[personality development]] because they are the primary way that cultures promote the [[virtues]] associated with each stage of life. Religious [[ritual]]s facilitate this development. Erikson's theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.

==== Erich Fromm ====
The American scholar [[Erich Fromm]] (1900–1980) modified the Freudian theory and produced a more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book ''[[Psychoanalysis and Religion]]'' he responded to Freud's theories by explaining that part of the modification is viewing the [[Oedipus complex]] as based not so much on sexuality as on a "much more profound desire", namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm's estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual's highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.&lt;ref name=PsyRel&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fromm |first1=Erich |authorlink1=Erich Fromm |title=Psychoanalysis and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/?id=A-3DjYEK4MIC&amp;dq=psychoanalysis+and+religion |accessdate=10 February 2010 |year=1950 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven, CT, US |isbn=0-300-00089-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fromm, humans need a stable frame of reference. Religion fills this need. In effect, humans crave answers to questions that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.&lt;ref name=Personality&gt;{{cite book |title=Personality |last=Burger |first=Jerry |year=2007 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location=Stamford, CT, US |isbn=0-495-09786-1 |page= |pages=122–123 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FvGH0J_wHggC&amp;dq=Fromm+Freud+Jung+religion |accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rudolf Otto ====
[[Rudolf Otto]] (1869–1937) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] theologian and scholar of comparative religion. Otto's most famous work, ''The Idea of the [[Holy]]'' (published first in 1917 as ''Das Heilige''), defines the concept of the holy as that which is ''numinous''. Otto explained the numinous as a "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self." It is a [[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]] (Latin: ''mysterium tremendum'') that is both fascinating (''fascinans'') and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps [[supernatural]] [[emotion]]al reaction of [[wonder (emotion)|wonder]] drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences of [[divine grace|grace]]. This sense of emotional wonder appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.

It also sets a [[paradigm]] for the study of religion that focuses on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was under much attack between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has made a strong comeback since then.

=== Modern thinkers ===
Autobiographal accounts of 20th-century psychology of religion as a field have been supplied by numerous modern psychologists of religion, primarily based in Europe, but also by several US-based psychologists such as [[Ralph W. Hood]] and [[Donald Eric Capps|Donald Capps]].&lt;ref name=belzen2012&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Belzen|editor1-first=Jacob A. |title=Psychology of religion: autobiographical accounts|date=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4614-1601-2 |OCLC=773924284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Allen Bergin ====
[[Allen Bergin]] is noted for his 1980 paper "Psychotherapy and Religious Values," which is known as a landmark in scholarly acceptance that religious values do, in practice, influence psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bergin A.

====Robert Emmons====
[[Robert Emmons]] offered a theory of "spiritual strivings" in his 1999 book, ''[[The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns (book)|The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns]]''.&lt;ref name=emmons99&gt;{{cite book

He is professor of [[psychology]] at [[Bowling Green State University]] ([[Ohio]], [[US]]), and
has published more than 100 papers on the subject of religion and spirituality in psychology.

==== James Hillman ====
[[James Hillman]], at the end of his book ''Re-Visioning Psychology'', reverses James' position of viewing religion through psychology, urging instead that we view psychology as a variety of religious experience. He concludes: "Psychology as religion implies imagining all psychological events as effects of Gods in the soul.&lt;ref&gt;James Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology, HarperCollins, NY, 1977, p227&lt;/ref&gt;"

==== Julian Jaynes ====
[[Julian Jaynes]], primarily in his book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]'', proposed that religion (and some other psychological phenomena such as hypnosis and schizophrenia) is a remnant of a relatively recent time in human development, prior to the advent of consciousness. Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came to be perceived as an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, ancestors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Jaynes | first=Julian | title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=2000 | isbn=0-618-05707-2 | pages=131–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypotheses on the role of religion ==
There are three primary hypotheses on the role of religion in the modern world.

=== Secularization ===
The first hypothesis, [[secularization]], holds that science and technology will take the place of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Cultural divide ===
In response to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the secularization hypothesis. His argument hinges on the premise that religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development of social and economic security in Europe explains its corresponding secularization due to a lack of need for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The idea that [[religiosity]] arises from the human need for security has also been furthered by studies examining religious beliefs as a compensatory mechanism of control. These studies are motivated by the idea that people are invested in maintaining beliefs in order and structure to prevent beliefs in chaos and randomness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the experimental setting, researchers have also tested compensatory control in regard to individuals' perceptions of external systems, such as religion or government. For example, Kay and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in a laboratory setting, individuals are more likely to endorse broad external systems (e.g., religion or sociopolitical systems) that impose order and control on their lives when they are induced with lowered levels of personal control. In this study, researchers suggest that when a person's personal control is lessened, their motivation to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.

== Psychometric approaches to religion ==
Since the 1960s psychologists of religion have used the methodology of [[psychometrics]] to assess ways in which a person may be religious. An example is the [[Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|Ross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first provides an age-independent measure of Allport and Ross's two religious orientations. The second measures three forms of religious orientation: religion as means (intrinsic), religion as end (extrinsic), and religion as quest. The third assesses spiritual maturity using two factors: Spiritual Support and Spiritual Openness.

===Religious orientations and religious dimensions===
{{Further|Sociology of religion}}
Some questionnaires, such as the [[Religious Orientation Scale]], relate to different religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion for the purpose of psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.

===Questionnaires to assess religious experience===
What we call religious experiences can differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that it would be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.

An objectivist would argue that the religious experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible to tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subjectivist view argues that it is not necessary to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God. From this point of view, the important thing is the experience itself and the effect that it has on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Developmental approaches to religion ==
{{Main|James W. Fowler|Stages of faith development}}
{{further|Psychology of religious conversion}}

Many have looked at stage models, like those of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], to explain how children develop ideas about God and religion in general.

The best known stage model of spiritual or religious development is that of [[James W. Fowler]], a [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] at the [[Candler School of Theology]], in his ''Stages of Faith''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-06-062866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He follows Piaget and Kohlberg and has proposed a holistic staged development of [[faith]] (or spiritual development) across the lifespan.

The book-length study contains a framework and ideas which have generated a good deal of response from those interested in religion{{Who|date=July 2011}}, so it appears to have [[face validity]]. James Fowler proposes six stages of faith development:

1. Intuitive-projective
2. Symbolic Literal
3. Synthetic Conventional
4. Individuating
5. Paradoxical (conjunctive)
6. Universalising.

Although there is evidence that children up to the age of twelve years do tend to be in the first two of these stages{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, adults over the age of sixty-one show considerable variation in displays of qualities of Stages 3 and beyond{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, most adults remaining in Stage 3 (Synthetic Conventional). Fowler's model has generated some empirical studies, and fuller descriptions of this research (and of these six stages) can be found in Wulff (1991).

Fowler's [[Scientific method|scientific research]] has been criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found empirical support{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of [[Theory of cognitive development|cognitive development]]. The tables and graphs in the book were presented in such a way that the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of [[Statistical#Statistical methods|statistical verification]] of the stages were not met. His study was not published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics{{Who|date=July 2011}} of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to say that people who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of [[Religious studies|academic religion]]{{Who|date=July 2011}}, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.

Other theorists in developmental psychology have suggested that religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies. In addition, children have a tendency to see agency and human design where there is not, and prefer a creationist explanation of the world even when raised by parents who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Researchers have also investigated attachment system dynamics as a predictor of the religious conversion experience throughout childhood and adolescence. One hypothesis is the correspondence hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | author=Bloom, P. |date=January 2007
 | title=Religion is natural

Under the correspondence hypothesis, internal working models of a person's attachment figure is thought to perpetuate his or her perception of God as a secure base. Another hypothesis relating attachment style to the conversion experience is the compensation hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | doi=10.2307/1386461
 | volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that individuals with insecure attachments are more likely to have a sudden conversion experience as they compensate for their insecure attachment relationship by seeking a relationship with God. 
Researchers have tested these hypotheses using longitudinal studies and individuals' self narratives of their conversation experience. For example, one study investigating attachment styles and adolescent conversions at Young Life religious summer camps resulted in evidence supporting the correspondence hypothesis through analysis of personal narratives and a prospective longitudinal follow-up of Young Life campers, with mixed results for the compensation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Evolutionary and cognitive psychology of religion ==
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Neuroscience of religion}}
&lt;!-- {{More footnotes|date=January 2012}} There's a main article linked which has more references that this section. Does that count, or should there be more references within the section itself?--&gt;
[[Evolutionary psychology]] is based on the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, [[cognition]] has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through [[natural selection]]. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.

[[Pascal Boyer]] is one of the leading figures in the cognitive psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book ''Religion Explained'', Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about how the world is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.

Religious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure. The child of a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] will not become an evangelical [[Christian]] or a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a [[Roman Catholic]] but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says [[cognitive science]] can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations and in so doing enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.

Boyer moves outside the leading currents in mainstream [[cognitive psychology]] and suggests that we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's [[theory of evolution]]. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those [[reproductive]] ends.

For [[Steven Pinker]] the universal propensity toward religious belief is a genuine scientific puzzle. He thinks that [[adaptationist]] explanations for religion do not meet the criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that originally evolved for other purposes.

== Religion and prayer ==
Religious practice oftentimes manifests itself in some form of [http://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/the-psychology-of-prayer-an-interview-with-kevin-ladd/ prayer]. Recent studies have focused specifically on the effects of prayer on health. Measures of prayer and the above measures of spirituality evaluate different characteristics and should not be considered synonymous.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd and Spilka's first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).

Dein and Littlewood (2008) suggest that an individual's prayer life can be viewed on a spectrum ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale is characterized by a change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective has been shown to be associated with an individual's passage through adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dein Simon, Littlewood Roland | year = 2008 | title = The Psychology of Prayer and the Development of the Prayer Experience Questionnaire | url = | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 39–52 | doi=10.1080/13674670701384396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer is also positively correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma &amp; Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Francis Leslie J., Robbins Mandy, Alan Lewis Christopher, Barnes L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These offerings have been expanded by Breslan and Lewis (2008) who have constructed a five pathway model between prayer and health with the following mediators: physiological, psychological, placebo, social support, and spiritual. The spiritual mediator is a departure from the rest in that its potential for empirical investigation is not currently feasible. Although the conceptualizations of chi, the universal mind, divine intervention, and the like breach the boundaries of scientific observation, they are included in this model as possible links between prayer and health so as to not unnecessarily exclude the supernatural from the broader conversation of psychology and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Breslin Michael J., Alan Lewis Christopher | year = 2008 | title = Theoretical Models of the Nature of Prayer and Health: A Review | url = | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 9–21 | doi=10.1080/13674670701491449}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, whether the activation of healing processes explanation is supernatural or biological, or even both, is beyond the scope of this study and this article.)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emotional distancing enables an individual to experience feelings with an amount of separation, and thus less intensity. However, the conception of religious ritual as an interactive process has since matured and become more scientifically established. From this view, ritual offers a means to catharsis through behaviors that foster connection with others, allowing for emotional expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There is considerable literature on the [http://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/podcast/is-religion-special-a-critical-look-at-religion-wellbeing-and-prosociality/ relationship] between religion and health. More than 3000 empirical studies have examined relationships between religion and health, including more than 1200 in the 20th century,&lt;ref name=khandbook2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koenig |authorlink1=Harold G.

Psychologists consider that there are various ways in which religion may benefit both physical and mental health, including encouraging healthy lifestyles, providing social support networks and encouraging an optimistic outlook on life; prayer and meditation may also help to benefit physiological functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, religion is not a unique source of health and well-being, and there are benefits to nonreligiosity as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galen|first=Luke William|last2=Kloet|first2=James D.|date=2011-09-01|title=Mental well-being in the religious and the non-religious: evidence for a curvilinear relationship|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13674676.2010.510829|journal=Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture|volume=14|issue=7|pages=673–689|doi=10.1080/13674676.2010.510829|issn=1367-4676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal "American Psychologist" published important papers on this topic in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;see those by Miller and Thoresen (2003) and Powell, Shahabi and Thorsen (2003); see also the article by Oman and Thoresen, in [[Raymond Paloutzian|Paloutzian]] and Park (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
Haber, Jacob and Spangler have considered how different dimensions of religiosity may relate to health benefits in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, Jacob &amp; Spangler, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and personality===
{{main|Religion and personality}}
Some studies have examined whether there is a "religious personality." Research suggests that people who identify as religious are more likely to be high on agreeableness and conscientiousness, and low on psychoticism, but unrelated to other Big Five traits. However, people endorsing fundamentalist religious beliefs are more likely to be low on Openness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Religion and prejudice===
To investigate the salience of religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some studies have shown that greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification.

Recently, [[Conversion therapy|reparative or conversion therapy]], a term used to describe a therapeutic process to change an individuals sexuality has been the subject of scrutiny and has been condemned by some governments, LGBT charities and therapy/counselling professional bodies.

== Religion and drugs ==
{{Main|Religion and drugs}}
The American psychologist [[James H. Leuba]] (1868–1946), in ''A Psychological Study of Religion'', accounts for mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he considered to be necessary if religious psychology were to be looked at scientifically. Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.

[[William James]] was also interested in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with [[nitrous oxide]] and even peyote. He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others they are certainly ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.

== Religion and mental illness ==
{{see also|Religion and schizophrenia|Mental health of Jesus}}

Although many researches have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious beliefs, practices, and experiences may be linked to [[mental illness]]es of various kind&lt;ref name="JNCN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=Journal of Neuropsichiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=September 2011 |pages=410–426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |cid= |url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214  |access-date=July 25, 2018 |issn=1545-7222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[mood disorders]], [[personality disorders]], and [[psychiatric disorders]]).&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; In 2011, a team of [[psychiatrists]], [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychologists]], [[neurologists]], and [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrists]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]] published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to [[religious delusion]] and [[hyperreligiosity]].&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

They compared the thoughts and behaviors of the most important figures in the [[Bible]] ([[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus Christ]], and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]])&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; with patients affected by mental disorders related to the [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria ([[DSM-IV-TR]]),&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and concluded that these Biblical figures "may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations",&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]]-[[visual hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[Geschwind syndrome]] (Paul especially) and abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

The research went further and also focused on [[Social psychology|social models]] of [[psychopathology]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; analyzing [[new religious movements]] and charismatic [[Cult|cult leaders]] such as [[David Koresh]], leader of the [[Branch Davidians]],&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; and [[Marshall Applewhite]], founder of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]].&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt; The researchers concluded that "If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum."&lt;ref name="JNCN" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is argued to up the potential for therapists to directly utilize religious practices and principles in therapy, such as prayer, forgiveness, and grace. In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious. Drawing from the work of Jung, Brown suggests that "our biases can only be suspended in the extent to which they are no longer our biases".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2017).

London &amp; New York: Routledge (p. 68).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pastoral psychology===
One application of the psychology of religion is in pastoral psychology, the use of psychological findings to improve the [[pastoral care]] provided by [[pastor]]s and other [[clergy]], especially in how they support ordinary members of their [[local church|congregation]]s. Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of [[chaplain]]s in [[healthcare]] and in the [[military]]. One major concern of pastoral psychology is to improve the practice of [[pastoral counseling]]. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as ''[[Pastoral Psychology (journal)|Pastoral Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Christianity]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Theology]]''. In 1984, [[Thomas C. Oden|Thomas Oden]] severely criticized mid-20th-century [[pastoral care]] and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]], and others.&lt;ref name=oden84&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Thisbe - John William Waterhouse.jpg|right|thumb|''Thisbe'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1909.]]

'''Pyramus and Thisbē''' are a pair of ill-fated lovers whose story forms part of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.  The story has since been retold by many authors.

==Plot==
In Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Pyramus and Thisbe are two lovers in the city of [[Babylon]] who occupy connected houses/walls, forbidden by their parents to be wed, because of their parents' rivalry. Through a crack in one of the walls, they whisper their love for each other. They arrange to meet near [[Ninus]]' tomb under a [[mulberry tree]] and state their feelings for each other. Thisbe arrives first, but upon seeing a lioness with a mouth bloody from a recent kill, she flees, leaving behind her veil. When Pyramus arrives he is horrified at the sight of Thisbe's veil in which the lioness had torn and left traces of blood behind, as well as its tracks. Assuming that a wild beast has killed her, Pyramus kills himself, falling on his sword, a typical Babylonian way to commit suicide, and in turn splashing blood on the white mulberry leaves. Pyramus' blood stains the white mulberry fruits, turning them dark. Thisbe returns, eager to tell Pyramus what had happened to her, but she finds Pyramus' dead body under the shade of the mulberry tree. Thisbe, after a brief period of mourning, stabs herself with the same sword. In the end, the gods listen to Thisbe's lament, and forever change the colour of the mulberry fruits into the stained colour to honour the forbidden love.

==Origins==
Ovid's is the oldest surviving version of the story, published in 8 AD, but he adapted an existing [[etiological myth]]. While in Ovid's telling Pyramus and Thisbe lived in [[Babylon]] and [[Ctesias]] had placed the tomb of his imagined king Ninus near that city, the myth probably originated in [[Cilicia]] (part of Ninus' [[Babylonia]]n empire) as Pyramos is the historical Greek name of the local [[Ceyhan River]]. The metamorphosis in the primary story involves Pyramus changing into this river and Thisbe into a nearby spring. A 2nd-century mosaic unearthed near [[Nea Paphos]] on [[Cyprus]] depicts this older version of the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Miller|first1= John F.|last2= Newlands|first2= Carole E.||date= 2014|title= A Handbook to the Reception of Ovid|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7fijBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|location= |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|page= 38-39|isbn= 1118876121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[Image:Gregorio Pagani Píramo y Tisbe Óleo sobre lienzo. 239 x 180 cm. Galería de los Uffizi. Florencia.jpeg|left|thumb|''Pyramus and Thisbe'' by Gregorio Pagani. [[Uffizi Gallery]].]]
The story of ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' appears in [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' as biography number twelve (sometimes thirteen)&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Brown's translation of Giovanni Boccaccio’s ''Famous Women'', pp. 27-30; Harvard University Press 2001; {{ISBN|0-674-01130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his ''[[Decameron]]'', in the fifth story on the seventh day, where a desperate housewife falls in love with her neighbor, and communicates with him through a crack in the wall, attracting his attention by dropping pieces of stone and straw through the crack.

In the 1380s, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and [[John Gower]], in his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', were the first to tell the story in [[English language|English]]. Gower altered the story somewhat into a cautionary tale. John Metham's ''[[Amoryus and Cleopes]]'' (1449) is another early English adaptation.

The tragedy of [[Romeo and Juliet]] ultimately sprang from Ovid's story. Here the star-crossed lovers cannot be together because Juliet has been engaged by her parents to another man and the two families hold an ancient grudge. As in Pyramus and Thisbe, the mistaken belief in one lover's death leads to consecutive suicides. The earliest version of Romeo and Juliet was published in 1476 by [[Masuccio Salernitano]], while it mostly obtained its present form when written down in 1524 by [[Luigi da Porto]]. Salernitano and Da Porto both are thought to have been inspired by Ovid and Boccaccio's writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Prunster |first= Nicole|date=2000|title= Romeo and Juliet Before Shakespeare: Four Early Stories of Star-crossed Love|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qAtaTo_h4Y4C|location= Toronto|publisher= Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies|page=|isbn=0772720150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s most famous 1590s adaptation is a dramatization of [[Arthur Brooke (poet)|Arthur Brooke]]'s 1562 poem ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]'', itself a translation of a French translation of Da Porto's novella.

In Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (Act V, sc 1), written in the 1590s, a group of "[[Mechanical (character)|mechanicals]]" enact the story of "Pyramus and Thisbe". Their production is crude and, for the most part, badly done until the final monologues of [[Nick Bottom]], as Pyramus and [[Francis Flute]], as Thisbe. The theme of forbidden love is also present in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (albeit a less tragic and dark representation) in that a girl, [[Hermia]], is not able to marry the man she loves, [[Lysander (Shakespeare)|Lysander]], because her father [[Egeus]] despises him and wishes for her to marry [[Demetrius]], and meanwhile Hermia and Lysander are confident that [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]] is in love with Demetrius.

Spanish poet [[Luis de Góngora]] wrote a ''Fábula de Píramo y Tisbe'' in 1618, while French poet [[Théophile de Viau]] wrote ''Les amours tragiques de Pyrame et Thisbée'', a tragedy in five acts, in 1621.

In 1718 [[Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello]] wrote his only opera "La Tisbe" for Württemberg court. [[François Francoeur]] and [[François Rebel]] composed ''Pirame et Thisbée'', a lyric tragedy in 5 acts and a prologue, with [[libretto]] by [[Jean-Louis-Ignace de La Serre]]; it was played at the Académie royale de musique, on October 17, 1726. The story was adapted by [[John Frederick Lampe]] as a "Mock Opera" in 1745, containing a singing "Wall" which was described as "the most musical partition that was ever heard."&lt;ref&gt;Recorded on Hyperion Records, CDA66759&lt;/ref&gt; In 1768 in [[Vienna]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] composed a serious opera on the tale, titled ''[[Piramo e Tisbe]]''.

[[Edmond Rostand]] adapted the tale, making the fathers of the lovers conspire to bring their children together by pretending to forbid their love, in ''Les Romanesques'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/harvey-schmidt-fantasticks-composer-dies-at-88|title=Harvey Schmidt, Fantasticks Composer, Dies at 88 {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose musical adaptation,
[[Fantasticks]], became the world's longest-running musical.

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}

The '''Seuna''', '''Sevuna''' or '''Yadavas of Devagiri''' (c. 850–1334) was an [[India]]n dynasty, which at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the [[Tungabhadra]] to the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers, including present-day [[Maharashtra]], [[north Karnataka]] and parts of [[Madhya Pradesh]], from its capital at [[Devagiri]] (present-day [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] in modern Maharashtra).

The Yadavas initially ruled as feudatories of the [[Western Chalukyas]]. Around the middle of the 12th century, as the Chalukya power waned, the Yadava king [[Bhillama V]] declared independence. The Yadava kingdom reached its peak under [[Simhana|Simhana II]], and flourished until the early 14th century, when it was annexed by the [[Delhi Sultanate]].

== Etymology ==

The Seuna dynasty claimed descent from the [[Yadava]]s and therefore, its kings are often referred to as the "Yadavas of Devagiri". The correct name of the [[dynasty]], however, is Seuna or Sevuna.&lt;ref name="ref_India_A_History_John_Keay"&gt;{{cite book

}} ''The quoted pages can be read at [https://books.google.com/ Google Book Search].''&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions of this dynasty, as well as those of contemporary kingdoms, the [[Hoysala]], [[Kakatiya dynasty]] and [[Western Chalukyas]] call them ''Seunas''.{{sfn|Suryanath Kamat|1980|pp=136-137}} The name is probably derived from the name of their second ruler, "Seunachandra".

The "Sevuna" (or Seuna) name was brought back into use by [[John Faithfull Fleet]] in his book ''The dynasties of the [[Kanarese]] districts of the Bombay Presidency from the earliest historical times to the Musalman conquest of A.D. 1318''.&lt;ref&gt;The Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts of the Bombay Presidency"(1894) J.F.Fleet, Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (Vol-1, Part-II, Book-III) {{ISBN|81-206-0277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|A.

== Origin ==

The earliest historical ruler of the Seuna/Yadava dynasty can be dated to the mid-9th century, but the origin of the dynasty is uncertain.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=137}} Little is known about their early history: their 13th century court poet [[Hemadri]] records the names of the family's early rulers, but his information about the pre-12th century rulers is often incomplete and inaccurate.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=515}}

The dynasty claimed descent from [[Yadu]], a hero mentioned in the [[Puranas|Puranic]] legends.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=515}} According to this account, found in Hemadri's ''Vratakhanda'' as well as several inscriptions,{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=137}} their ancestors originally resided at [[Mathura]], and then migrated to [[Dvārakā|Dvaraka]] (Dvaravati) in present-day [[Gujarat]]. A [[Jainism|Jain]] mythological legend states that the [[Jain]] saint Jainaprabhasuri saved the pregnant mother of the dynasty's founder [[Dridhaprahara]] from a great fire that destroyed Dvaraka. A family feudatory to the Yadavas migrated from [[Vallabhi]] (also in present-day Gujarat) to [[Khandesh]]. But otherwise, no historical evidence corroborates their connection to Dvaraka. The dynasty never tried to conquer Dvaraka, or establish any political or cultural connections with that region.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=515}} Its rulers started claiming to be descendants of Yadu and migrants from Dvaraka after becoming politically prominent.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}} Dvaraka was associated with [[Yadava|Yadu's descendants]], and the dynasty's claim of connection with that city may simply be a result of their claim of descent from Yadu rather than their actual geographic origin.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|pp=515-516}} The [[Hoysala]]s, the southern neighbours of the dynasty, similarly claimed descent from Yadu and claimed to be the former lords of Dvaraka.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}}

The territory of the early Yadava rulers was located in present-day [[Maharashtra]],{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}} and several scholars (especially Maharashtrian historians{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}}) have claimed a "[[Maratha]]" origin for the dynasty.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=316}} However, [[Marathi language|Marathi]], the language of present-day Maharashtra, began to appear as the dominant language in the dynasty's inscriptions only in the 14th century, before which [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]] were the primary language of their inscriptions.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|p=45}}{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}} Marathi appears in around two hundred Yadava inscriptions, but usually as translation of or addition to Kannada and Sanskrit text. During the last half century of the dynasty's rule, it became the dominant language of epigraphy, which may have been a result of the Yadava attempts to connect with their Marathi-speaking subjects, and to distinguish themselves from the Kannada-speaking Hoysalas.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}} The earliest instance of the Yadavas using the term "''marathe''" as a self-designation appears in a 1311 inscription recording a donation to the [[Vitthal Temple, Pandharpur|Pandharpur temple]],{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=314}} towards the end of the dynasty's rule.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=316}}

Epigraphic evidence suggests that the dynasty likely emerged from a Kannada-speaking background.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|pp=51-54}} Around five hundred Yadava inscriptions have been discovered, and Kannada is the most common language of these inscriptions, followed by Sanskrit.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}} Of the inscriptions found in present-day [[Karnataka]] (the oldest being from the reign of Bhillama II), most are in Kannada language and script; others are in the Kannada language but use [[Devanagari]] script.{{sfn|Suryanath Kamat|1980|pp=136-137}} Older inscriptions from Karnataka also attest to the existence of Yadava feudatories (such as Seunas of Masavadi) ruling in the [[Dharwad]] region in the 9th century, although these feudatories cannot be connected to the main line of the dynasty with certainty.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=137}}{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}} Many of the dynasty's rulers had Kannada names and titles such as "Dhadiyappa", "Bhillama", "Rajugi", "Vadugi" and "Vasugi", and "Kaliya Ballala". Some kings had names like "Simhana" (or "Singhana")  and "Mallugi", which were also used by the [[Kalachuris of Kalyani]], who ruled in present-day Karnataka. Records show that one of the early rulers, Seunachandra II, had a Kannada title, ''Sellavidega''. The rulers had very close matrimonial relationships with Kannada-speaking royal families throughout their rule. Bhillama II was married to Lachchiyavve, who was from a [[Rashtrakuta]] descendant family in Karnataka. Vaddiga was married to Vaddiyavve, daughter of Rashtrakuta chieftain Dhorappa. Wives of Vesugi and Bhillama III were [[Chalukya]] princesess. The early Seuna coins also had Kannada legends engraved on them indicating it was a court language.{{sfn|Suryanath Kamat|1980|pp=136-137}} The early Yadavas may have migrated northwards owing to the political situation in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region,{{sfn|Shrinivas Ritti|1973}} or may have been dispatched by their [[Rashtrakuta]] overlords to rule the northern regions.{{sfn|A. V. Narasimha Murthy|1971|p=32}}

=== As feudatories ===

The earliest historically attested ruler of the dynasty is [[Dridhaprahara]] (c. 860-880), who is said to have established the city of Chandradityapura (modern [[Chandwad fort|Chandor]]).{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}}{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=137}} He probably rose to prominence by protecting the people of [[Khandesh]] region from enemy raiders, amid the instability brought by the [[Tripartite Struggle|Pratihara-Rashtrakuta war]].{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}}

Dridhaprahara son and successor was Seunachandra (c. 880-900), after whom the dynasty was called Seuṇa-vaṃśa and their territory was called Seuna-desha.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=138}}{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}} He probably became a [[Rashtrakuta]] feudatory after helping the Rashtrakutas against their northern neighbours, the [[Paramara]]s.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=138}} He established a new town called Seunapura (possibly modern [[Sinnar]]).{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=516}}

Not much information is available about Seunachandra's successors — Dhadiyappa (or Dadhiyappa), Bhillama I, and Rajugi (or Rajiga) — who ruled during c. 900-950.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=138}}{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=517}} The next ruler Vandugi (also Vaddiga I or Baddiga) raised the family's political status by marrying into the imperial Rashtrakuta family. He married Vohivayya, a daughter of Dhorappa, who was a younger brother of the Rashtrakuta emperor [[Krishna III]]. Vandugi participated in Krishna's military campaigns, which may have resulted in an increase in his fief, although this cannot be said with certainty.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=517}}

Little is known about the next ruler, Dhadiyasa (c. 970-985).{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=517}} His son [[Bhillama II]] acknowledged the suzerainty of the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani|Kalyani Chalukya]] ruler [[Tailapa II]], who overthrew the Rashtrakutas. As a Chalukya feudatory, he played an important role in Tailapa's victory over the [[Paramara]] king [[Vakpati Munja|Munja]].{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=138}} Bhillama II was succeeded by Vesugi I (r. c. 1005-1025), who married Nayilladevi, the daughter of a Chalukya feudatory of Gujarat. The next ruler Bhillama III is known from his Kalas Budruk grant inscription.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=518}} He married Avalladevi, a daughter of the Chalukya king [[Jayasimha II (Western Chalukya dynasty)|Jayasimha II]], as attested by a [[Vasai]] (Bassein) inscription. He may have helped his father-in-law Jayasimha and his brother-in-law [[Someshvara I]] in their campaigns against the Paramara king [[Bhoja]].{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam |1957|p=138}}{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=518}}

The Yadava power seems to have declined over the next decade, during the reigns of Vesugi II (alias Vaddiga or Yadugi) and Bhillama IV, for unknown reasons. The next ruler was Seunachandra II, who, according to the Yadava records, restored the family's fortunes just like the god [[Vishnu|Hari]] had restored the earth's fortunes with his [[varaha]] incarnation. Seunachandra II appears to have ascended the throne around 1050, as he is attested by the 1052 [[Deolali Pravara|Deolali]] inscription. He bore the title ''Maha-mandaleshvara'' and became the overlord of several sub-feudatories, including a family of [[Khandesh]]. A 1069 inscription indicates that he had a ministry of seven officers, all of whom bore high-sounding titles.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=518}} During his tenure, the Chalukya kingdom saw a war of succession between the brothers [[Someshvara II]] and [[Vikramaditya VI]]. Seunachandra II supported Vikramaditya (who ultimately succeeded), and rose to the position of ''Maha-mandaleshvara''.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam |1957|p=138}} His son Airammadeva (or Erammadeva, r. c. 1085-1105), who helped him against Someshvara II, succeeded him. Airammadeva's queen was Yogalla, but little else is known about his reign.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam |1957|p=139}} The Asvi inscription credits him with helping place Vikramaditya on the Chalukya throne.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=518}}

Airammadeva was succeeded by his brother Simhana I (r. c. 1105-1120).{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=518-519}} The Yadava records state that he helped his overlord Vikramaditya VI complete the ''Karpura-[[vrata]]'' ritual, by getting him a ''karpura'' elephant. A 1124 inscription mentions that he was ruling the Paliyanda-4000 province (identified as the area around modern [[Paranda]]).{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam |1957|p=139}} The dynasty's history over the next fifty years is obscure. The 1142 [[Anjaneri]] inscription attests the rule of a person named Seunachandra, but Hemadri's records of the dynasty do not mention any Seunachandra III; historian [[R. G. Bhandarkar]] theorized that this Seunachandra may have been a Yadava sub-feudatory.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=519}}

The next known ruler Mallugi (r. c. 1145-1160) was a loyal feudatory to the Chalukya king [[Tailapa III]]. His general Dada and Dada's son Mahidhara fought with Tailapa's rebellious [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuri]] feudatory [[Bijjala II]]. He extended his territory by capturing Parnakheta (modern Patkhed in [[Akola district]]).{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=519}} The Yadava records claim that he seized the elephants of the king of [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]], but do not provide any details.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam |1957|p=139}} He also raided the kingdom of the [[Kakatiya]] ruler Rudra, but this campaign did not result in any territorial gains for him.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=519}} Mallugi was succeeded by his elder son Amara-gangeya, who was succeeded by his son Amara-mallugi (alias Mallugi II). The next ruler Kaliya-ballala, whose relationship to Mallugi is unknown, was probably an usurper. He was succeeded by [[Bhillama V]] around 1175.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=519}}

=== Rise as a sovereign power ===

At the time of [[Bhillama V]]'s ascension in c. 1175, his nominal overlords — the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani|Chalukyas]] — were busy fighting their former feudatories, such as the [[Hoysala]]s and the [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuris]].{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=522}} Bhillama raided the northern [[Chaulukya|Gujarat Chaulukya]] and [[Paramara]] territories, although these invasions did not result in any territorial annexations. The [[Chahamanas of Naddula|Naddula Chahamana]] ruler [[Kelhana]], who was a Gujarat Chaulukya feudatory, forced him to retreat.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=523}} Meanwhile, the Hoysala ruler [[Veera Ballala II|Ballala II]] invaded the Chalukya capital Kalyani, forcing Bhillama's overlord [[Someshvara IV|Someshvara]] to flee. Around 1187, Bhillama forced Ballala to retreat, conquered the former Chalukya capital Kalyani, and declared himself a sovereign ruler.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=524}}

According to Hemadri, he then established the [[Devagiri]] city, which became the new Yadava capital.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam |1957|p=140}}

In the late 1180s, Ballala launched a campaign against Bhillama, and decisively defeated his army at [[Soratur]].{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=525}} The Yadavas were driven to the north of the [[Malaprabha River|Malaprabha]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]] rivers, which formed the Yadava-Hoysala border for the next two decades.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=525}}

=== Imperial expansion ===

Bhillama's son [[Jaitugi]] successfully invaded the [[Kakatiya]] kingdom around 1194, and forced them to accept the Yadava suzerainty.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=529}}{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=143}}

Jaitugi's son [[Simhana]], who succeeded him around either 1200{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=144}} or 1210,{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=531}} is regarded as the dynasty's greatest ruler.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=144}} At its height, his kingdom probably extended from the [[Narmada River]] in the north to the [[Tungabhadra River]] in the south, and from the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west to the western part of the present-day [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] in the east.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=147}} He launched a military campaign against the Hoysalas (who were engaged in a war with the [[Pandya kingdom|Pandyas]]), and captured a substantial part of their territory.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=532}}{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=145}} The [[Ratta dynasty|Rattas of Saundatti]], who formerly acknowledged the Hoysala suzerainty, became his feudatories, and helped him expand the Yadava power southwards.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=145}} In 1215, Simhana successfully invaded the northern [[Paramara]] kingdom. According to Hemadri, this invasion resulted in the death of the Paramara king [[Arjunavarman]], although this claim is of doubtful veracity.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=534}} Around 1216, Simhana defeated the [[Shilahara#Kolhapur branch|Kohalpur Shilahara]] king [[Bhoja II (Shilahara dynasty)|Bhoja II]], a former feudatory, who had asserted his sovereignty. The Shilahara kingdom, including its capital [[Kolhapur]], was annexed to the Yadava kingdom as a result of this victory.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=533}}{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=145}}

In 1220, Simhana sent an army to the [[Lata (region)|Lata]] region in present-day [[Gujarat]], whose rulers kept shifting his allegiance between the Yadavas, the Paramaras, and the [[Chaulukya]]s.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=535}} Simhana's general Kholeshvara killed the defending ruler Simha, and captured Lata.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|pp=535-536}} Simhana then appointed Simha's son Shankha as a Yadava vassal in Lata.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=536}} Sometime later, the Chaulukya general Lavanaprasada invaded Lata, and captured the important port city of [[Khambhat]]. Simhana's feudatory Shankha invaded Chaulukya-controlled territory twice, with his help, but was forced to retreat.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|pp=536-537}} The Chaulukya-Yadava conflict came to end in c. 1232 with a peace treaty.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=537}} In the 1240s, Lavanaprasada's grandson Visaladeva usurped the power in Gujarat, and became the first [[Vaghela dynasty|Vagehla]] monarch. During his reign, Simhana's forces invaded Gujarat unsuccessfully, and the Yadava general Rama (a son of Kholeshvara) was killed in a battle.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=146}}

Several Yadava feudatories kept shifting their allegiance between the Yadavas and the Hoysalas, and tried to assert their independence whenever presented with an opportunity. Simhana's general Bichana subdued several such chiefs, including the Rattas, the Guttas of [[Dharwad]], the [[Kadambas of Hangal]], and the [[Kadambas of Goa]].{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=538}} The Kakatiya king Ganapati served him as a feudatory for several years, but assumed independence towards the end of his reign. However, Ganapati did not adopt an aggressive attitude towards the Yadavas, so no major conflict happened between the two dynasties during Simhana's reign.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|pp=538-539}}

Simhana was succeeded by his grandson [[Krishna of Devagiri|Krishna]] (alias Kannara), who defeated the invaded the Paramara kingdom, which had weakened because of invasions from the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. He defeated the Paramara king sometime before 1250, although this victory did not result in any teritorial annexation.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=544}} Krishna also attempted an invasion of the Vaghela-ruled Gujarat, but this conflict was inconclusive, with both sides claiming victory.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=544}}{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=148}} He also fought against the Hoysalas; again, both sides claim victory in this conflict.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=148}}

Krishna's younger brother and successor [[Mahadeva of Devagiri|Mahadeva]] curbed a rebellion by the [[Shilahara#North Konkan (Thane branch)|Shilaharas]] of northern [[Konkan]], whose ruler [[Someshvara (Shilahara dynasty)|Someshvara]] had attempted to assert his sovereignty.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=546}} He invaded the eastern [[Kakatiya]] kingdom, taking advantage of rebellions against the Kakatiya queen [[Rudrama Devi|Rudrama]],{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=547}} but this invasion appears to have been repulsed.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=150}} He also invaded the southern [[Hoysala]] kingdom, but this invasion was repulsed by the Hoysala king [[Vira Narasimha II|Narasimha II]].{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=547}} Mahadeva's Kadamba feudatories rebelled against him, but this rebellion was suppressed by his general Balige-deva around 1268.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=547}}

Mahadeva was succeeded by his son [[Ammana]], who was dethroned by Krishna's son [[Ramachandra of Devagiri|Ramachandra]] after a short reign in 1270.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|pp=548-549}}{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=151}} During the first half of his reign, Ramachandra adopted an aggressive policy against his neighbours. In the 1270s, he invaded the northern [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]] kingdom, which had been weakened by internal strife, and easily defeated the Paramara army.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=549}} The Yadava army was also involved in skirmishes against their north-western neighbours, the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghelas]], with both sides claiming victory.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=549}}{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=152}} In 1275, he sent a powerful army led by Tikkama to the southern Hoysala kingdom. Tikkama gathered a large plunder from this invasion, although ultimately, his army was forced to retreat in 1276.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=550}} Ramachandra lost some of his territories, including [[Raichur Fort|Raichur]], to the Kakatiyas.{{sfn|T. V. Mahalingam|1957|p=152}}

The Purushottamapuri inscription of Ramachandra suggests that he expanded the Yadava kingdom at its north-east frontier. First, he subjugated the rulers of Vajrakara (probably modern Vairagarh) and Bhandagara (modern [[Bhandara, Maharashtra|Bhandara]]).{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=551}} Next, he marched to the defunct [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] kingdom, and occupied the former Kalachuri capital Tripuri (modern Tewar near [[Jabalpur]]). He also constructed a temple at [[Varanasi]], which suggests that he may have occupied Varanasi for 2-3 years, amid the confusion caused by the [[Delhi Sultanate]]'s invasion of the local [[Gahadavala]] kingdom.{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=551}} He crushed a rebellion by the Yadava feudatories at [[Khed, Ratnagiri|Khed]] and [[Sangameshwar]] in [[Konkan]].{{sfn|A. S. Altekar|1960|p=551}}

=== Decline ===

In 1278, Ramachandra appears to have defeated the Turkic invaders from the [[Delhi Sultanate]], as a Sanskrit royal inscription of that year glorifies him as a "Great Boar in securing the earth from the oppression of the Turks".&lt;ref&gt;Eternal Garden: Mysticism, History, and Politics at a South Asian Sufi Center  by Carl W. Ernst p.107&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1294, [[Ala-ud-din Khalji]] of the Delhi Sultanate successfully [[Alauddin Khalji's raid on Devagiri|raided Devagiri]].

In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by [[Malik Kafur]], accompanied by Khwaja Haji, to Devagiri. The Muslim governors of Malwa and Gujarat were ordered to help Malik Kafur. Their huge army conquered the weakened and [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|defeated]] forces of Devagiri almost without a battle. Ramachandra was taken to Delhi. Khalji reinstated Ramachandra as governor in return for a promise to help him subdue the Hindu kingdoms in [[South India]]. In 1310, Malik Kafur mounted an assault on the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya kingdom]] from Devagiri.&lt;ref name="ref_India_A_History_John_Keay"/&gt;

== Literature ==

=== Marathi ===

The Yadavas were the first major dynasty to use Marathi as an official language.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2001|p=211}} Earlier, both Sanskrit and Kannada had been used in present-day Maharashtra; subsequently, at least partly due to the efforts of the Yadava rulers, Marathi became the dominant language of the region.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2001|p=212}} Even if they were not of Marathi origin, towards the end of their reign, they certainly identified with the Marathi language.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=316}} The early Marathi literature emerged during the Yadava rule, because of which some scholars have theorized that it was produced with support from the Yadava rulers.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=74,86}} However, there is no evidence that the Yadava royal court directly supported the production of Marathi literature with state funds, although it regarded Marathi as a significant language for connecting with the general public.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=x,74}}

[[Hemadri]], a minister in the Yadava court, attempted to formalize Marathi with Sanskrit expressions to boost its status as a court language.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2001|pp=211-212}} Saint-poet [[Dnyaneshwar]] wrote ''[[Dnyaneshwari]]'' (c. 1290), a Marathi-language commentary on the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', during Ramachandra's rule. He also composed devotional songs called ''abhanga''s. Dnyaneshwar gave a higher status to Marathi by translating the sacred [[Bhagavad Gita|Geeta]] from [[Sanskrit]]. Mukundaraja wrote the Marathi-language philosophical treatises ''Paramamrita'' and ''Vivekasindhu'' during the Yadava period.{{sfn|Onkar Prasad Verma|1970|p=266}} The [[Mahanubhava]] religious sect, which became prominent in present-day Maharshtra during the late Yadava period, boosted the status of Marathi as a literary language.{{sfn|Onkar Prasad Verma|1970|p=266}} Mahimabhatta wrote ''Lilacharita'', a biography of the sect's founder [[Chakradhara]]. The text claims that Hemadri (who was a [[Brahmanism|Brahmanist]]) was jealous of Chakradhara's popularity, and the Yadava king Ramachandra ordered killing of Chakradhara, who escaped with his yogic powers. The claim is of doubtful historicity.{{sfn|A. V. Narasimha Murthy|1971|p=32}}

=== Kannada ===

Kannada was one of the court languages during early Seuna times, as is evident from a number of Kannada-language inscriptions (see [[#Origin|Origin]] section). Kamalabhava, patronised by Bhillama V, wrote ''Santhishwarapurana''. Achanna composed ''Varadhamanapurana'' in 1198. Amugideva, patronised by Simhana II, composed many ''[[Vachanas]]'' or devotional songs. Chaundarasa of [[Pandharapur]] wrote ''Dashakumara Charite'' around 1300.&lt;ref name="kamala1"&gt;R.

[[Simhana]] patronized [[Changdev Maharaj|Changadeva]] and the Kannada poet Kamalabhava.

=== Sanskrit ===

[[Simhana]] was a great patron of learning and literature. He established the college of astronomy to study the work of celebrated astronomer [[Bhaskaracharya]]. The [[Sangita Ratnakara]], an authoritative [[Sanskrit]] work on [[Music of India|Indian music]] was written by [[Sharngadeva|Śārṅgadeva]] (or Shrangadeva) during Simhana's reign.&lt;ref name="GSMann"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gurinder Singh Mann | title = The Making of Sikh Scripture |year=2001 |publisher = Oxford University Press US |isbn = 0-19-513024-3 |page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hemadri]] compiled the encyclopedic Sanskrit work ''Chaturvarga Chintamani''. He is said to have built many temples in a style known after him – ''Hemadapanti''.&lt;ref name="palkhi"&gt;{{cite book |author=Digambar Balkrishna Mokashi | title = Palkhi: An Indian Pilgrimage |year=1987 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-461-2 | page = 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many books on ''vaidhyakshastra'' (medical science) and he introduced and supported [[Pearl millet|bajra]] cultivation.&lt;ref name="kolarkar"&gt;Marathyancha Itihaas by Dr. S.G Kolarkar, p.4, Shri Mangesh Prakashan, Nagpur.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shaman''' is an alternate playable [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character class]] in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]]. The shaman has been published or republished many distinct forms over the decades. There are two main shaman concepts in D&amp;D: monsters who cast clerical or druidic spells, and a human or demi-human PC class. The spell-casting monsters are generally treated as primitive or unsophisticated clerics or clerics of uncivilized or inhuman deities. For those iterations that treat the shaman as something other than a priest of uncivilized deities, the shaman gains power from animistic spirits instead of, or in addition to, a deity, force, or philosophy. These spirits may be ancestors, animal spirits, or spirits of the land.

The PC versions of the shaman class generally present it as a priest of an animistic or spirit-based religion on-par with the deity-based religions found elsewhere in D&amp;D.

The basic D&amp;D shaman ([[The Golden Khan of Ethengar]]) and shamani ([[The Atruaghin Clans]]), three second edition shaman classes (Shaman; Complete Barbarian's Handbook; Spells and Magic or Faith and Avatars), two third edition shaman classes (3.0 Oriental Adventures; 3.5 Spirit Shaman in Complete Divine) and one fourth edition shaman (Players Handbook II) are all fully implemented Shaman classes meant for PC use in the game.

==Conceptual basis==
The shaman in D&amp;D covers two notions of [[Shamanism]]. The first is as a primitive magician or priest, opposed to a more civilized European priest viewed through the lenses of the [[Catholic Church]] or [[Greco-Roman paganism]]. The Druid was meant to represent other types of pagan priests, such as a [[Druidism|Celtic priest]]. This version of the shaman is applied to monsters in the basic D&amp;D game, as well as the first and second edition games. Remnants of this point of view can be seen in later edition monsters, which have spellcasting variants labeled shamans.

The second notion of the shaman is as a priest of an animistic religion. In this interpretation, the shaman is seen as an optional PC class who performs many of the functions of the cleric: healing, divination or oracles, ceremonies, etc. Rather than venerating a deity from the D&amp;D pantheon, however, shamans deal with spirits of nature, ancestors, elemental spirits, animal spirits, and the like.

==Publication history==

===''Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===
The shaman concept was covered numerous times in the late 80s and early 90s for the Master ruleset of the basic ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game. In this line, the Shaman and Wicca are options for monster classes to access cleric or magic-user spells. ''[[The Orcs of Thar]]'' (1988) covers [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcish]] shamans,&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this shaman is again presented as a magical option for monster classes in ''[[Top Ballista]]'' (1989) and was again repeated in The Shadow Elves (GAZ13, 1990).

''[[The Golden Khan of Ethengar]]'' (GAZ12, 1989), however, includes rules for a full-fledged shaman character class.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; Unlike other classes presented in the Golden Khan, the Shaman is treated as a distinct class which is unlike the use of the term for any primitive or tribal cleric. This may be the first incarnation of the Shaman as a viable PC class. This shaman class is similar to the Cleric though the spell list is different and this shaman does not have the ability to turn undead. Instead, this shaman gains a spirit guide, keen senses, the ability to speak with animals, and the ability to shapeshift into animal form.

A thematically similar, though mechanically different, class is introduced as the Shamani in The Atruaghin Clans (GAZ14, 1991). It does not gain the abilities of the Golden Khan shaman class, but instead has an ability to detect poisons and advances at a faster rate.

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 1st edition===
Dragon Magazine 141 (1989) covers the shaman as a primitive, humanoid priest for the AD&amp;D game. Additionally, the first edition [[Oriental Adventures]] book presents the [[Shugenja (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|shukenja]] class, which is the basis for the later third edition [[Oriental Adventures]] shaman class.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===

'''Shaman''' is a term which often referred to humanoid clerics or priests (i.e. tribal or primitive priests), particularly those of the so-called savage species from ''[[The Complete Book of Humanoids]]''. This usage is a holdover from earlier iterations of the shaman concept as NPC primitive spellcasters.

The '''Shaman''' character class was introduced anew in the 2nd Edition Supplement, ''[[Shaman (accessory)|Shaman]]'' (1995). It used a nonstandard spellcasting mechanic whereby spells are not memorized each day, but can be cast multiple times until a wisdom check is failed. It was not further developed (although it was briefly mentioned as the source of power of one of Ravenlofts minor Darklords on an island of terror). This shaman may have been affiliated with a tribe, a natural hermit, or a social outcast. The tribalist, solitary, and spiritualist had their own spell lists, though shamans could also draw spells from other shaman spell lists or the general priest list. This version of the shaman begins to distance itself from the notion of the tribal or primitive priest (worshiping savage deities instead of civilized ones), though the uncivilized origin is still viewed as an important aspect of the class.

Also in 1995, the Complete Barbarian's Handbook introduced another shaman class. This one is much closer to priests of a specific mythoi, but still represents an uncivilized or primitive priest class. This shaman gains major access to different spheres that the Cleric does, and shares some features with the Barbarian Fighter, also presented in the book.

Another '''Shaman''' character class was introduced in the ''[[Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic]]'' (1995) supplement (an identical version appeared in ''Faiths &amp; Avatars''), which resembles the standard Cleric, though it draws spells from different spheres and has the ability to contact spirits for aid. In this iteration, the Shaman is a sub-class of the cleric, alongside the crusader, druid, monk, and mystic. These six priest classes are intended to broadly represent the priests of any D&amp;D religion, and complement or even replace the vast multitude of specialty priest classes.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition===
The '''Shaman''' is a character class in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#3.0 edition|3.0 edition]] that was introduced in the [[Oriental Adventures#3rd edition era|''Oriental Adventures'']] campaign supplement.

The shaman in the Third Edition of the game is a variant of the ''shukenja'' of the First Edition ''Oriental Adventures''. (A character class called the [[Shugenja (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|shugenja]] also appears in ''Oriental Adventures'' 3.0 which is a similar spellcasting class but differs because of its elemental theme.) This shaman is more akin to a shinto priest, rather than the real-world shugenja. The shaman is considered the oriental equivalent of the [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|cleric]], although it also shares abilities with the [[Monk (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|monk]] and [[Druid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|druid]] classes. Like clerics, shamans derive their spells from divine energy in general and from powerful entities; they propitiate spirits of an animistic religious system rather than deities, forces, or philosophies (although deities may also exist as extremely powerful spirits). These spirits embody the domains from which shamans gain powers and domain spells. A few domains are identical to clerical domains listed in the ''[[Player's Handbook]]''; some are unique to the shaman and have no direct equivalent to any clerical domain. Unlike a cleric, at higher levels a shaman can learn a third domain and prepare two domain spells per day for certain spell levels. In general, a shaman's spell list is more nature-oriented than the cleric's. Like the druid, it can gain an animal companion. Its attack progression is identical to a cleric's, while it has a variety of unarmed combat feats similar to the monk. The 3.5 update to the class found in ''Dragon'' magazine issue 318 (April 2004) improves the shaman's combat prowess, such as by granting shamans the ability to inflict extra damage with their unarmed attacks, similar to those of monks.

The vanara, a monkey-like humanoid race also published in ''Oriental Adventures'', has Shaman as its favored class.

Third edition also released two other shaman-like classes. In 3.5, the ''[[Complete Divine]]'' contains the Spirit Shaman class, which spontaneously casts spells, but can still change prepared spells daily. The spirit shaman also has numerous abilities which relate to spirits and incorporeal things, and as such is a much more direct successor to the basic D&amp;D Golden Khan shaman.

The Dragon Shaman class, however, from the ''Player's Handbook II'' is mechanically related to the Marshal, rather than being a Divine caster class. The Dragon Shaman does not have any relationship to spirits in a general sense, though it does have a totem dragon spirit. As such, it is peripheral to the shaman concept as portrayed in D&amp;D.

Green Ronin Publishing released a 3.0 '''Shaman''' in '''The Shaman Handbook''' as part of their Master Class series. They cast divine spells spontaneously, like a sorcerer. The book also contains a number of Prestige Classes.

UKG Publishing released a 3.5 '''Shaman''' in '''The Enduring: Witches &amp; Shaman''' in June 2007. It uses the same advancement and spellcasting progression as a druid, but (instead of ''wildshape'') gains lycanthropic abilities as it progresses, becoming a were-shaman (a natural lycanthrope) at upper levels.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition===
The Shaman&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ex/20080421a 4th Edition Excerpts: Warlord&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.gleemax.com/showpost.php?p=15873273&amp;postcount=3951 Wizards Community - View Single Post - The one and only "Ask the Realms authors/designers thread" 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is among the classes included in the 4th edition ''Player's Handbook 2'' (March 2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0786952881&lt;/ref&gt; The Shaman class has the Primal power source and the Leader role, and has a clear link with the primal spirits of the earth; most of his/her powers call upon or otherwise make use of [[spirit]]s. Continuing with this spiritual link, all Shamans receive a Spirit Companion—the class is distinctive for being the first Fourth Edition class to have a companion as a standard feature (The Sentinel Druid also gains an animal companion). While the spirit companion may have any appearance the player wishes, the flavor and artwork included in the book depict it as an animal spirit, and the provided Shaman builds are named after possible appearances (Panther and Bear). Additional builds were added in Primal Power and the Dark Sun Campaign Setting. Many of the Shaman's powers use the Spirit keyword, meaning they use the spirit as their origin point and derive line of sight and effect from it; these are flavored as the Shaman commanding the spirit to attack the Shaman's enemies. The Shaman can even use opportunity actions to attack enemies moving past the spirit, giving it the mechanical feeling of an ally actively engaged in combat.

Along with damage, Shaman attacks carry some type of rider effect that either benefit allies or harm enemies next to the companion spirit, such as temporary hit points or a bonus to attack rolls. Additionally, allies next to the spirit can gain additional [[hit points]] when the Shaman uses his healing abilities. This allows the Shaman to use the spirit as a mobile source of aid, able to be moved to where it is most useful. Since he must consider the positioning of two entities rather than one, and is able to use both ranged and melee attacks from two sources, the Shaman is a complex Leader class to play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbpye.net/wp/2009/02/09/4e-shaman-preview-phb2/ Review: 4e Shaman Preview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shinreikyo''' (神霊教 ''Shinreikyō'') is a [[Japanese new religions|Japanese new religion]] founded in 1947. It claims to have 100,000 members.

==Founder==
The group claims Kanichi Otsuka (大塚 寛一 ''Ōtsuka Kan'ichi'') as its founder, but his wife Kunie Miyashitain also had a role in the development of the group. Kanichi Otsuka claimed to be a [[child prodigy]] and took the religious name "Kyososama" ("revered founder").  Shinreikyo believes "Kyososama is God made flesh." The group began in [[Nishinomiya]], but by 1953  a site on a hill in the [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]] district of [[Minato, Tokyo]] would become Shinreikyo headquarters.

==Beliefs==
Like many Japanese new religions the group is [[syncretistic]]. The primary connections are likely [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]]. The idea of "Kyososoma" as God made flesh has precedents in various pagan religions, as well as later in Christianity. The sect is [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] in that it believes in a material and spiritual division, but apparently it values both. The group strongly believes in miracles. They also believe the deceased faithful go to heaven through Sublime Transmigration, leaving bodies without [[rigor mortis]] or putrefaction. Also that miracles can occur to animals, plants, and even inanimate objects. That in fact the world is full of miracles.

==Unusual claims==
Adherents believe that their founder knew everything almost at birth due to his connection with/being a Divine Power. They also state that for members "the skull enlarges and expands into a fine rounded shape" due to their faith, making them more intelligent. They state their women suffer from no [[morning sickness]] when pregnant and that their childbirth is naturally without pain.

The [[Second Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 5 November 1556 between the forces of [[Akbar]] and [[Hemu]], a Hindu king of Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |editor-first=John F. |editor-last=Richards |edition=7th |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |origyear=1993 |isbn=9780521566032 |page=13 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrdiVPsFRYIC&amp;pg=PA163 |title=Naukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850 |first=Dirk H.

After a few years, Hemu's supporters, constructed a [[Samadhi]] ([[Hindu]] shrine) over the place where he was beheaded. The place and its surroundings have been slowly encroached upon by the local Muslim people who have converted it into a Muslim durgah. This is the only memorial of Hemu in Panipat but it is in a bad condition.

'''''Sovetish Heymland''''' ([[Yiddish]] סאָוועטיש היימלאַנד - "Soviet Homeland") was a [[Yiddish]]-language literary magazine published by poet and controversial figure [[Aron Vergelis]] in [[Moscow]] as a bi-monthly from 1961 to 1965, then as a monthly until 1991. With the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], the journal no longer received state support. In the early 1960s, ''Sovetish Heymland'' had a circulation of 25,000, the highest ever circulation for a Yiddish-language periodical.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The circulation fell to 16,000 in 1966; to 10,000 in 1971; to 7,000 in 1978; and to 5,000 in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Estraikh, Gennady. "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Sovetish_Heymland Sovetish Heymland]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the journal's circulation had fallen dramatically, donations solicited from the United States, France and Argentina in the early 1990s enabled Vergelis to continue publishing the journal under the name ''Di Yidishe Gas'' (Yiddish די יידישע גאַס - "The Jewish Street") from 1993 until his death in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Shmeruk, Chone. "Twenty-five Years of Sovetish Heymland: Impressions and Criticism," ''Jewish Culture and Identity in the Soviet Union,'' ed. Yaacov Ro’i and Avi Beker, pp. 191–207, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sovetish Heymland'' was developed in the period after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953 as a forum for those Yiddish writers who had survived the repressions of Soviet Yiddish which had occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The title referred back to the Moscow-based Yiddish literary periodicals ''Sovetish'' (1934–1941) and ''Heymland'' (1947–1948), indicating a continuity of Yiddish literary output.&lt;ref&gt;Chernin, Velvel. "Institutionalized Jewish Culture in the 1960s to the mid-1980s," ''Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union,'' ed. Yaacov Ro'i, pp. 226-236, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the official Yiddish periodical of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]], one of the main aims of the journal was to disseminate Soviet propaganda among Yiddish-speaking Jewish [[Communists]] in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. In addition, the publication of a highly literary Yiddish-language journal was meant to show that Yiddish and Yiddish cultural institutions were not disappearing, but that there was in fact a Yiddish revival occurring in the [[Soviet Union]], and that ''Sovetish Heymland'' in particular was taking the lead in maintaining Yiddish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Moskovich, Wolf. "An important event in Soviet Yiddish cultural life: The new Russian‐Yiddish dictionary," ''Soviet Jewish Affairs,'' vol. 14 no. 3, pp. 31-49, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this propaganda, Vergelis published numerous anti-[[Zionist]] and anti-[[Israel]] articles. Vergelis' controversial reputation as a tool of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and the [[Communist]] government is based largely on these articles, as well as several articles attacking his critics from outside the Soviet Union. In addition, the fact that ''Sovetish Heymland'' was authorized by the government indicated to some that Vergelis was merely a mouthpiece for Soviet propaganda.

In addition to literary articles, the journal published materials on Jewish folklore, history, language and literature in Yiddish, the magazine also collected biographical and bibliographical material about Jewish writers. In the 25th anniversary issue of ''Sovetish Heymland'' in August 1986, Vergelis announced that the journal had published 76 novels, 109 novellas, 1,478 short stories, 6,680 poems, and 1,628 articles dealing with literary
criticism and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;''Sovetish Heymland'', 1986, volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also one of the few periodicals to encourage the younger generation of Soviet Yiddish writers.&lt;ref&gt;Estraikh, Gennady. "[http://yiddish2.forward.com/node/3811 Sovetish Heymland: The Journal that Appeared 50 Years Ago]." ''Forverts'', July 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As the only Yiddish-language journal that was officially allowed by the Soviet authorities from the 1960s through the 1980s, ''Sovetish Heymland'', under the editorship of Vergelis, was connected with almost all of the period's cultural output. Vergelis became an "unofficial censor of all Yiddish-language literature and the chief [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] consultant on matters relating to Soviet Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Chernin, Velvel. "Institutionalized Jewish Culture in the 1960s to the mid-1980s," ''Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union,'' ed. Yaacov Ro'i, pp. 226-236, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The God Argument: The Case against Religion and for Humanism''''' is a 2013 book by the [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], [[A. C. Grayling]], in which he counters the [[arguments for the existence of God]], and puts forward humanism as an alternative to [[religion]].

Grayling is concerned with tone. He states that he wrote the first half of the book "thoroughly and calmly to examine all the arguments offered in support of [[religious beliefs]]",&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21575732-two-books-offer-fresh-views-humanism-search-ungodly | title=Atheism In search of the ungodly | work=Economist | date=April 6, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of God, which he argues against in the first half of the book.

In the other half, he proposes humanism as a suitable substitute of religion for a [[moral]] life or what he calls a "good life". According to his definition of humanism, if one believes that moral choices should be grounded in "the responsible use of [[reason]]" and "human experience in the real world" then one is a humanist.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/07/god-argument-humanism-grayling-review | title=The God Argument: the Case Against Religion and For Humanism by AC Grayling – review | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=7 March 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Xiuzhen tu''' ({{zh|s=修真图|t=修真圖|p=''Xiūzhēn tú''|w=''Hsiu-chen t'u''}}) is a [[Daoist]] diagram of the human body illustrating principles of ''[[Neidan]]'' 內丹 "[[Internal alchemy]]", [[Chinese astrology]], and [[cosmology]].

==Title==
The title ''Xiuzhen tu'' combines three [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words:
*''xiu'' [[Wikt:修|修]] "embellish, decorate; repair, overhaul; study, cultivate; build, construct; trim, prune; write, compile"
*''zhen'' [[Wikt:真|真]] "true; real; genuine" or (Daoist) "original, unspoiled character of a person; ultimate reality; a ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' transcendent".
*''tu'' [[Wikt:圖|圖]] "picture; drawing; chart; map; plan"
Common examples of this special Daoist ''zhen'' "ultimate truth" meaning include ''[[Zhenren]]'' 真人 "true person; Spiritual Master" and ''[[Quanzhen]]'' 全真 "complete truth; Quanzhen School".

''Xiuzhen tu'' is translated into English as:
*"Illustration of Developing Trueness" (Alphen and Aris 1995:170)
*"Chart of the Cultivation of Perfection" (Kohn 2000:487)
*"Diagram of Cultivating Perfection" (Komjathy 2004:53)
*"Chart for the Cultivation of Perfection" (Despeux 2008:767)

''Xiuzhen'' ({{zh|c=修真|p=''xiūzhēn''|w=''hsiu-chen''|l=cultivate truth}}) is an uncommon word associated with Daoism. It first appears in [[Ge Hong]]'s (4th century CE) ''[[Baopuzi]]'' 抱朴子 (行品 chapter), which says ''xiuzhen'' practices characterize a ''daoren'' 道人 "Daoist". ''Xiushen'' 修身 and ''xiudao'' 修道 are more common synonyms of ''xiuzhen'' that occurred centuries earlier in pre-[[Han Dynasty|Han]] [[Chinese classic texts]].

''Xiushen'' ({{zh|c=修身|p=''xiūshēn''|w=''hsiu-shen''|l=cultivate oneself}}) is a basic moral principle of [[Chinese philosophy]]. In [[Confucianism]], ''xiushen'' is the ethical basis for social order. The ''[[Great Learning]]'' (tr. Legge 1893:266) says ancient rulers utilized "self cultivation": "Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy." In [[Daoism]], ''xiushen'' refers to a supernatural "self cultivation". The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (tr. Mair 1994:96) claims it can result in long life: "Carefully guard your body, and leave other things to prosper themselves. I guard the one so as to dwell in harmony. Thus have I cultivated my person for one thousand two hundred years and my physical form has still not decayed."

''Xiudao'' ({{zh|c=修道|p=''xiūdào''|w=''hsiu-tao''|l=cultivate the Way}}) means "practice a religious regimen; follow religious rules; enter a monastery". The first sentence in the Confucian ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'' (tr. Legge 1893:124) associates ''xiudao'' with ''jiao'' [[Wikt:教|教]] "teach; instruct": "What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction."

==History==
The ''Xiuzhen tu'' text probably dates "from the early 19th century" (Komjathy 2004:53) and exists in several versions, some with variant titles like ''Xiuzhen quantu'' 修真全圖 "Cultivation of Perfection Complete Diagram". All editions are associated with the [[Dragon Gate Taoism|Longmen]] "Dragon Gate" sect of the Quanzhen school of Daoism. Catherine Despeux (2008:770) lists five extant versions: a [[stele]] at the Sanyuan Gong 三元宮 "Three Primes Palace" in [[Guangzhou]] (dated 1812); printed versions from the [[Wudang Mountains]] (1924 reprint of 1888), [[Shanghai]] (1920), and [[Chengdu]] (1922); and a version at the [[White Cloud Temple]] in [[Beijing]] (undated).

The ''Xiuzhen Tu'' resembles the better-known ''[[Neijing Tu]]'' 內經圖 "Inner Pathways Diagram". Both these anatomical charts with Daoist ''Neidan'' symbolism derive from the earliest diagrams attributed to Yanluozi 煙蘿子 ([[floruit|fl.]] 10th century) and conserved in the 1250 CE ''Xiuzhen shishu'' 修真十書 "Cultivating Perfection Ten Books" (Kohn 2000:521).

==Contents==
Contrasted with the ''Neijing tu'', the ''Xiuzhen tu'' pictures the meditator's body in a front view rather than side, and includes a longer textual portion, which describes ''Neidan'' practices, [[lunar phase]]s, and ''Leifa'' 雷法 "Thunder Rites" associated with the [[Zhengyi Dao]] movement of the [[Tianshi Dao]] "Way of Celestial Masters".

Despeux summarizes ''Xiuzhen tu'' differences.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The elements that distinguish this chart from the ''Neijing tu'' are mainly related to the Thunder Rites (''leifa'') – in particular, the spiral at the level of the kidneys, the nine "orifices of hell" at the base of the spine, and the three curls at the top of the head that represent the three primordial breaths according to the ''Tianxin zhengfa'' tradition. The chart also represents the main parts of the body, including the Cinnabar Fields (''[[dantian]]''), the Three Passes (''sanguan'', represented by the three chariots) of the back, the throat, the paradisiacal and infernal worlds, and the body's divinities according to the ''Huangting jing'', and also shows the firing process (''huohou''). The whole is reminiscent of a talisman illustrating a divine body that connects to the sacred world. (2008:770)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time, the ''Xiuzhen tu'' underscores cosmological elements. In particular, the human figure is surrounded by thirty black and white circles that represent the days of the lunar month, one of the models of the Neidan "fire phases". The trigrams arranged around the figure (Zhen ☳, Dui ☱, Qian ☰, Xun ☴, Gen ☶, and Kun ☷) represent the six stages of the lunar cycle, each of which is made of five days.
