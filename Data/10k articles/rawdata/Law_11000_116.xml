An '''Act of Sederunt''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|r|ə|n|t}} {{respell|sə|DERR|ənt}}; meaning a meeting or sitting of a court) is [[secondary legislation]] made by the [[Court of Session]], the [[Supreme court|supreme]] [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] court of [[Scotland]], to regulate the proceedings of Scottish courts and [[tribunal]]s hearing civil matters.&lt;ref name="dsl_sederunt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/sederunt | title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Sederunt n., adj. | publisher=Scottish Language Dictionary | work=Scottish National Dictionary | date=2004 | accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RobertBurnsVideos|title=Robert Burns - Act Sederunt of the Session (read by  Paul Young)|date=2010-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjbyNYNGooA|accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Subordinate Legislation Committee - Scottish Parliament: 18th December 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjUEWRzzQwY|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally made under an [[Act of the Parliament of Scotland]] of 1532, the modern power to make Acts of Sederunt is largely derived from the [[Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014]].&lt;ref name="2014-asp-18"&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|type=act|year=2014|chapter=18|act=Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|[ss. 23, 39, 62, 72, 75-76, 98, 103-106, 115; sch. 5 paras. 11, 31]}}--&gt; Since 2013, draft Acts have also been prepared by the [[Scottish Civil Justice Council]] and submitted to the Court of Session for approval.&lt;ref name="2013-asp-3"&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|type=act|year=2013|chapter=3|act=Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Act 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[s. 2]}}

==History==

===College of Justice Act 1532===
The Court of Session—more accurately the [[College of Justice]]—was established by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] under [[James V]] in 1532. The Act of Parliament establishing the Court, later named the [[College of Justice Act 1532]], provided that the Court would have "such [...] rules and statutes as shall please the king's grace to make and give to them" and "ordain[ed] the same to have effect in all points and [that the] processes, sentences and decreets shall have the same strength, force and effect as the decreets of the lords of session had in all times bygone." That is, that the rules of the Court of Session were to be made by the King and to have the same force as the [[decree]]s of the [[Lords of Session]] had before.&lt;ref name="rps_1532-6"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1532/6 | title=College of Justice Act 1532 | publisher=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland | year=1532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mackenzie_institute-of-law-scotland"&gt;{{citation|title=An institute of the law of Scotland: in four books : in the order of Sir George Mackenzie's Institutions of that law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIEDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q=|year=1824|quote=for the court of session have a delegated power from the parliament, to make such statutes as they think proper for the ordering of process and the expediting of justice, 1540, "C.93"|author1=John Erskine|author2=George Mackenzie|author3=James Ivory|periodical=19th-century legal treatises|issue=4217-4230|page=16|publisher=Bell &amp; Bradfute|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College of Justice Act 1540===
Although established in 1532, it wasn't until the passing of the [[College of Justice Act 1540]] (originally titled ''Ratification of the institution of the college of justice'') that the Court of Session gained the power to make law through Acts of Sederunt. The Act granted the [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]], the Vice-President, and the [[Senators of the College of Justice]] the "power to make such acts, statutes and ordinance as they shall think expedient for ordering of processes and the hasty expedition of justice."&lt;ref name="rps_1540-12-64"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1540/12/64 | title=College of Justice Act 1540 | publisher=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland | year=1540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courts Act 1672===
{{see also|High Court of Justiciary|Acts of Adjournal}}

The [[Courts Act 1672]] (originally ''Act concerning the regulation of the judicatories'') created the [[High Court of Justiciary]], the supreme [[Criminal law|criminal]] court of Scotland, by attaching five of the Lords of Session to the Lord Justice General and [[Lord Justice Clerk]]. The Courts Act also provided that "the judges of that court [...] regulate the inferior officers thereof, and order every other thing concerning the said court," and so created the distinction between Acts of Sederunt and [[Acts of Adjournal]] which continues to exist to this day.&lt;ref name="rps_1672-6-50"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1672/6/50 | title=Courts Act 1672 | publisher=Records of the Parliaments of Scotland | year=1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell_dictionary-of-law-scotland"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/adictionaryandd01rossgoog | title=A Dictionary and Digest of the Law of Scotland, with short explanations of the most ordinary English law terms | publisher=Bell &amp; Bradfute | author1=Bell, William | year=1861 | pages=122 | author2=Ross, George | quote='''Books of Adjournal.''' The records of the Court of Justiciary. [...] The power of the Court of Justiciary to pass acts of adjournal regulating the procedure of the court is conferred by 1672, c. 16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 19th-century reforming of the High Court of Justiciary, all Lords of Session were ''[[ex officio]]'' Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, instead of the original five ordained by the Courts Act.&lt;ref name="1887-c-35"&gt;{{cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1887|chapter=35|act=Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[s. 44]}} Although that reformation was repealed, its effect was replicated by the [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]], which provided that the Lord President of the Court of Session was also to hold the office of Lord Justice General.&lt;ref name="1995-c-46"&gt;{{cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1995|chapter=45|act=Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[s. 1]}}

===Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933===
The powers of the Court of Session to make Acts of Sederunt were partially consolidated by the [[Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933]], which also made significant changes to the structure and operations of the Court. One of these significant changes was the establishing of a Rules Council, composed of the Lord President as well as Court of Session judges and practising lawyers, to propose Acts of Sederunt to the Court. The Act also created a Sheriff Court Rules Council, to carry out the same functions but in relation to the [[sheriff courts]].&lt;ref name="1933-c-41"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1933|chapter=41|act=Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[ss. 18, 35]}}

===Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971===
The [[Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971]] enabled the Court of Session to regulate the sheriff courts and Sheriff Appeal Court when they heard civil matters. The Act also dissolved the Sheriff Court Rules Council created by the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933, and created a new Sheriff Court Rules Council to continually review sheriff court procedure and submit to the Court of Session draft Acts of Sederunt for regulating sheriff courts.&lt;ref name="1971-c-58"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1971|chapter=58|act=Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[ss. 33–34]}}

===Court of Session Act 1988===
The [[Court of Session Act 1988]] was another consolidating Act, now with sections relating to Acts of Sederunt largely repealed or modified by the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, that also altered the structure of the Court of Session. The remaining powers to make Acts of Sederunt relate to [[summary trial]]s—although the actual power is now derived from the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014—and the considering of applications to appeal to the [[Inner House]] by a single judge.&lt;ref name="1988-c-36"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1988|chapter=36|act=Court of Session Act 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[ss. 26, 31A]}}

===Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Act 2013===
The Court of Session Rules Council and Sheriff Court Rules Council were dissolved by the [[Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Act 2013]], which established the Scottish Civil Justice Council as their replacement. Originally, the Council's only function in relation to Acts of Sederunt was to prepare draft civil procedure rules for the Court of Session and sheriff courts, but this was expanded by the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 to include preparing draft procedural rules for the Sheriff Appeal Court and draft fees rules, and by the Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016 to include draft inquiry procedure rules.&lt;ref name="2013-asp-3" /&gt;{{rp|[s. 2]}}&lt;ref name="2014-asp-18" /&gt;{{rp|[Sch. 5 paras. 18, 31]}}&lt;ref name="2016-asp-2" /&gt;{{rp|[Sch. 1 para. 1]}}

===Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014===
The majority of the Court of Session's current power to regulate is derived from the [[Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014]], which consolidated many of the existing powers and, in conjunction with the [[Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014]], extended the power of the Court of Session to enable the Court to make rules for tribunals.&lt;ref name="2014-asp-10"&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=act|year=2014|chapter=10|act=Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[s. 68]}}&lt;ref name="2014-asp-18"/&gt;

===Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016===
The Court of Session's power to create Acts of Sederunt was extended by the [[Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016]] to include the power to regulate the practice and procedure of [[Public inquiry|public inquiries]] and [[fatal accident inquiry|fatal accident inquiries]].&lt;ref name="2016-asp-2"&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|type=act|year=2016|chapter=2|act=Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[s. 36]}}

Since its founding the Court of Session was given considerable scope to regulate its own affairs through Acts of Sederunt.&lt;ref name="Rule Making"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Institute"&gt;{{citation| title=An institute of the law of Scotland: in four books : in the order of Sir George Mackenzie's Institutions of that law | author1=John Erskine | author2=George Mackenzie | author3=James Ivory | year=1824 | page=16 | periodical=19th-century legal treatises | issue=4217-4230 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIEDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q= | publisher=Bell &amp; Bradfute | quote=for the court of session have a delegated power from the parliament, to make such statutes as they think proper for the ordering of process and the expediting of justice, 1540, "C.95" | accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sederunt"&gt;{{citation| title=A Handbook of the Law of Scotland | author=James Lorimer | year=2000 | page=3 | isbn=0-543-96733-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlpWicPntA4C&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Act%20of%20Sederunt%201540%20c.%2093&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=Act%20of%20Sederunt%201540%20c.%2093 | publisher=Adamant Media Corporation | quote=the Court having a delegated power from Parliament to "make sik actes, statutes, and ordinances, as they sall thinke expedient, ordouring proces, and haistie expedition of justice." | accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court shared this power with the [[Parliament of Scotland]] until 1540 when it was given the exclusive power to pass Acts of Sederunt by [[List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament to 1707#1540|c.93 of that year]].

The powers of Acts of Sederunt extended into [[primary legislation]] with the Lords of Session passing Acts which created [[Precedent|judicial precedent]] without any case being subject to [[adjudication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=The land laws, as they affect landowners, farmers, workers, and consumers. | year=1879 | pages=6–7 | periodical=LSE Selected Pamphlets | jstor=60217587 | quote=In 1756 the Judges of the Court of Session in Scotland, not in any case which was judicially before them, but assuming the functions of Parliament, passed an Act "Anent removings."| publisher=null}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was found questionable in a letter address to [[Robert Peel]]; who was [[Home Secretary]] in 1823.&lt;ref name="Peel 5"&gt;{{citation| title=A letter to the Right Hon.

The [[Faculty of Advocates]], the body of [[counsel]] with rights of audience in the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary, is constituted as part of the College of Justice with its power to admit new advocates (called "intrants") devolved to it by the Court of Session by Acts of Sederunt.  The court having regulated who may serve as [[counsel]] from its founding through in acts of 1532 and 1590.&lt;ref name="Profession 1"&gt;{{citation| title=The Origins of the Legal Profession in Scotland  | author=R.

Section 4 of the [[Divorce Jurisdiction, Court Fees and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1983]] removed the power of the Court of Session to regulate fees payable to the courts and legal agents covered by the Legal Aid system, with the power to make orders transferred to the Secretary of State.&lt;ref name="Legal Aid"&gt;{{citation | date=1983-04-11 | title=Divorce Jurisdiction, Court Fees and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1983 | periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament | volume=1983 | issue=12 | pages=4 | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1983/12/ukpga/c12 |publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]] |quote=The Secretary of State may, by order regulate the fees payable | accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Powers==
As with other secondary legislation, an Act of Sederunt can only make law within the scope set out by an [[enabling act]]—an item of [[primary legislation]] from which power to make secondary legislation is derived. Most powers of the Court of Session were consolidated into the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, but other powers continue to be provided by the [[Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937]], the Court of Session Act 1988, the [[Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008]], the [[Legal Services (Scotland) Act 2010]], the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014, the Inquiries into Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths etc. (Scotland) Act 2016, and others.

A non-exhaustive summary of these powers is provided below. In exercising these powers, the Court of Session can amend or [[repeal]] any [[enactment (British legal term)|enactment]], including primary legislation, if it relates to matters an Act of Sederunt may cover.&lt;ref name="2014-asp-18" /&gt;{{rp|[s. 103(3)]}}

Note, however, that the power to regulate admission into the Faculty of Advocates is effectively delegated from the Court of Session to the Faculty, as the Court legislated to require that those seeking admission meet criteria set out by the Faculty.&lt;ref name="2011-ssi-312"&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=ssi|year=2011|number=312|ssi=Act of Sederunt (Regulation of Advocates) 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of harassment==
In February 2005, Anjali Gupta filed a case against three of her superiors at a police station in Bangalore. The police asked her to resolve the issue with her superiors. Anjali Gupta later approached the [[Karnataka High Court]], demanding an enquiry by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/dec/08anjali1.htm|title=IAF Anjali Gupta: The woman who rocked the Indian Air Force|publisher=rediff NEWS|date=8 December 2005|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after Anjali Gupta alleged in a TV interview that she was a victim of [[sexual harassment]] at the workplace, [[General court-martial|General Court Martial]] (GCM) proceedings against her were initiated.

==Trial &amp; dismissal==
She was placed under house arrest after she made a statement before the Karnataka State Commission for Women that she "''is on the verge of taking her life''" because of alleged harassment by her superiors. IAF administration had her examined by a panel of psychiatrists comprising doctors from [[National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences]] and Institute of Aerospace Medicine. She was later admitted to Command Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/06/03/stories/2005060315202000.htm|title=Anjali Gupta released|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=3 Jun 2005|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Falsely claiming travel allowance and throwing a breakfast parcel of her senior's were among the fifteen offenses she was initially accused of.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31600">An '''appanage''' or '''apanage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ə|n|ɪ|dʒ|}}) or {{lang-fr|'''apanage'''}} ({{IPA-fr|a.pa.naʒ}}) is the grant of an estate, title, office, or other thing of value to a younger male child of a sovereign, who would otherwise have no inheritance under the system of [[primogeniture]]. It was common in much of Europe.

The system of appanage greatly influenced the territorial construction of France and the [[States of Germany|German states]], and explains why many of the former [[provinces of France]] had [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] which were [[cadency|modified]] versions of the king's arms.

==Etymology==
[[Late Latin]] ''*appanaticum'', from ''appanare'' or ''adpanare'' 'to give bread' (''panis''), a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for food and other necessities, hence for a "subsistence" income, notably in kind, as from assigned land.

==Original appanage: in France==

===History of the French appanage ===
An appanage was a concession of a fief by the sovereign to his younger sons, while the eldest son became king on the death of his father. Appanages were considered as part of the inheritance transmitted to the puîsné (French ''puis'', "later", + ''né'', "born [masc.]") sons; the word ''Juveigneur'' (from the Latin comparative ''iuvenior'', 'younger [masc.]'; in Brittany's customary law only the youngest brother) was specifically used for the royal princes holding an ''appanage''. These lands could not be sold, neither hypothetically nor as a dowry, and returned to the royal domain on the extinction of the princely line. Daughters were excluded from the system: [[Salic law]] then generally prohibited daughters from inheriting land and also from acceding to the throne.

The system of appanage has played a particularly important role in France. It developed there with the extension of royal authority from the 13th century, then disappeared from the late Middle Ages with the affirmation of the exclusive authority of the royal state. It strongly influenced the territorial construction, explaining the arms of several provinces. The prerogative of Burgundy is also the origin of the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch States, through the action of its dukes favored by their position in the court of the kings of France.

Appanages were used to sweeten the pill of the [[primogeniture]]. It has traditionally been used to prevent the revolt of younger sons who would otherwise have no inheritance, while avoiding the weakening of the kingdom by equal division. Indeed, according to Frankish custom, the inheritance was to be divided among the surviving sons. The kingdom was considered family property, and so many divisions occurred under the [[Merovingians]] (the first following the death of [[Clovis I]] in 511), and later under the rule of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]] in which the Treaty of Verdun of 843 gave birth to independent territories.

The consequences of equal division (dismemberment of the kingdom, civil wars, conflicts between heirs, etc.) led to the adoption of the appanage system, which has the advantage of diverting the claim of younger sons to the crown, which was the inheritance of the eldest. In addition, over time, the system guarantees the unity of the royal domain to the senior heir.

[[Hugh Capet]] was elected [[List of French monarchs#Capetian Dynasty (987–1792)|King of the Franks]] on the death of [[Louis V of France|Louis V]] in 987. The Capetian dynasty broke away from the Frankish custom of dividing the kingdom among all the sons. The eldest son alone became King and received the royal domain except for the appanages. Unlike their predecessors, their hold on the crown was initially tenuous. They could not afford to divide the kingdom among all their sons, and the royal domain (the territory directly controlled by the king) was very small, inititially consisting solely of the [[Île-de-France]]. Most of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetians]] endeavored to add to the [[Crown lands of France|royal domain]] by the incorporation of additional fiefs, large or small, and thus gradually obtained the direct lordship over almost all of France.

The first king to create an appanage is [[Henry I of France]] in 1032, when he gave the Duchy of Burgundy to his brother Robert I, whose descendants retained the duchy until 1361 with the extinction of the first Capetian [[House of Burgundy]] by the death of Philip de Rouvres. Louis VIII and Louis IX also created appanages. The king who created the most powerful appanages for his sons was [[John II of France]]. His youngest son, [[Philip the Bold]], founded the second Capetian House of Burgundy in 1363. By marrying the heiress of Flanders, Philip also became ruler of the Low Countries.

King [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] tried to remove the appanage system, but in vain. Provinces conceded in appanage tended to become ''de facto'' independent and the authority of the king was recognized there reluctantly. In particular the line of [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Dukes of Burgundy]] caused considerable trouble to the French crown, with which they were often at war, often in open alliance with the English.  Theoretically appanages could be reincorporated into the royal domain but only if the last lord had no male heirs. Kings tried as much as possible to rid themselves of the most powerful appanages. [[Louis XI]] retook the Duchy of Burgundy at the death of its last duke, [[Charles the Bold]]. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] confiscated the [[Duke of Bourbon|Bourbonnais]], after the treason in 1523 of his commander in chief, [[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon]], the 'constable of Bourbon' (died 1527 in the service of [[Emperor Charles V]]).

The first article of the [[Edict of Moulins]] (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. The ''apanagist'' (incumbent) therefore could not separate himself from his appanage in any way.

After [[Charles V of France]], a clear distinction had to be made between titles given as names to children in France, and true appanages. At their birth the French princes received a title independent of an appanage. Thus, the [[Duke of Anjou]], grandson of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], never possessed Anjou and never received any revenue from this province. The king waited until the prince had reached adulthood and was about to marry before endowing him with an appanage. The goal of the appanage was to provide him with a sufficient income to maintain his noble rank. The fief given in appanage could be the same as the title given to the prince, but this was not necessarily the case. Only seven appanages were given from 1515 to 1789.

Appanages were abolished in 1792 before the proclamation of the [[French First Republic|Republic]]. The youngest princes from then on were to receive a grant of money but no territory.

Appanages were reestablished under the first French empire by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and confirmed by the Bourbon restoration-king [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. The last of the appanages, the [[Duke of Orléans|Orléanais]], was reincorporated to the French crown when the Duke of Orléans, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], became king of the French in 1830.

The word ''apanage'' is still used in French figuratively, in a non-historic sense: "to have appanage over something" is used, often in an ironic and negative sense, to claim exclusive possession over something. For example, "cows have appanage over [[prion]]s."

=== List of major French appanages ===

==== Direct Capetians ====
*[[Henry I of France|Henry I]] gave the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to his brother [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy|Robert]].
*[[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] gave the [[County of Dreux]] to his son [[Robert I of Dreux|Robert]]. The lineage of the counts became extinct in 1355, but a cadet line, descended from [[Peter I, Duke of Brittany|Pierre Mauclerc]], became Dukes of Brittany.
*[[Philip II of France|Philip II]] gave his son [[Philippe Hurepel]] the county of Clermont, then the counties of [[County of Domfront|Domfront]] and [[County of Mortain|Mortain]].
*[[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], by his 1225 will, granted
**the [[Count of Artois|County of Artois]] to his second son [[Robert I of Artois|Robert]]. Artois was lost by Robert's male heirs, passing through a female line, and eventually was inherited by the Dukes of Burgundy. [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] seized it upon the death of [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477, but his son returned it to Charles's heirs in preparation for his invasion of Italy in 1493.
**the Counties of [[County of Poitiers|Poitou]] and [[County of Auvergne|Auvergne]] to his fourth son [[Alphonse of Toulouse|Alphonse]]. These returned to the crown when Alphonse died without heirs in 1271.
**the Counties of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[County of Maine|Maine]] to his third son [[John, Count of Anjou|John]]. They returned to the crown when John died without heirs in 1232.
*[[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] endowed
**the Counties of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[County of Maine|Maine]] (1246) to his youngest brother, [[Charles I of Sicily|Charles]]. They passed to Charles's granddaughter, who married Charles, Count of Valois, the younger son of [[Philip III of France|Philip III]], and thence to their son, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]]. When Philip inherited the throne as Philip VI, the lands reverted to the crown.
**the [[Duke of Orléans|County of Orléans]] to his eldest son, Philip. It returned to the crown when he succeeded his father in 1270 as [[Philip III of France|Philip III]].
**the [[County of Valois]] (ca. 1268) to his second son, [[Jean Tristan of France|Jean Tristan]]. This title became extinct upon Jean Tristan's death in 1270.
**the Counties of [[County of Alençon|Alençon]] and [[County of Perche|Perche]] (1268) to his third son, [[Pierre I, Count of Alençon|Pierre]]. This title became extinct on Pierre's death in 1284.
**the [[Counts of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]] (1269) to his fourth son, [[Robert, Count of Clermont|Robert]]. Robert's son, [[Louis I, Duke of Bourbon|Louis]], was later given the [[Duke of Bourbon|Duchy of Bourbon]], which was treated as an appanage, although it was not technically one. Louis later traded Clermont for [[County of La Marche|La Marche]] with his cousin [[Charles IV of France|Charles, Count of Angoulême]], younger brother of King Philip V. These appanages remained in the Bourbon family until they were confiscated due to the treason of [[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon]] in 1527.
*Philip III granted
**the [[County of Valois]] to his second son [[Charles of Valois|Charles]]. Charles was later given the Counties of [[County of Alençon|Alençon]], [[County of Perche|Perche]], and [[County of Chartres|Chartres]] by his brother, [[Philip IV of France]]. Valois passed to Charles's eldest son, Philip upon his death in 1325, and returned to the crown when Philip became King Philip VI in 1328. Alençon and Perche passed to Charles's younger son, [[Charles II, Count of Alençon|Charles]]. A descendant was raised to the dignity of Duke of Alençon. These titles returned to the crown upon the extinction of the Alençon line in 1525.
**the [[Count of Beaumont-sur-Oise|County of Beaumont-sur-Oise]] to his third son [[Louis d'Évreux|Louis]]. Louis was later given the [[County of Évreux]] by his brother Philip IV. These titles returned to the throne upon the death of Queen [[Blanche I of Navarre|Blanche of Navarre]] in 1441.
*Philip IV endowed
**the [[County of Poitou]] for his second son, [[Philip V of France|Philip]]. This title returned to the throne when Philip became king in 1316.
**the Counties of [[County of La Marche|La Marche]] and [[County of Angoulême|Angoulême]] for his third son, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]. Charles later traded La Marche for the [[County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]] with the [[Duke of Bourbon]]. His titles returned to the throne when Charles became king in 1322.

==== House of Valois ====
*Philip VI endowed
**the [[Duchy of Normandy]] for his elder son [[John II of France|John]]. This title returned to the throne when John succeeded his father in 1350.
**the [[Duchy of Orléans]] for his younger son [[Philip of Valois, Duke of Orléans|Philip]]. This title returned to the throne when Philip died without issue in 1375.
*John II ''the Good'', on his departure to England in 1360, granted
**the Duchies of [[Duke of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[Counts and Dukes of Maine|of Maine]] to his second son [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis]]. This title returned to the throne upon the death of duke [[Charles IV, Duke of Anjou|Charles IV]], Louis I's great-grandson, in 1481.
**the Duchies of [[Duchy of Berry|Berry]] and [[Rulers of Auvergne|of Auvergne]] to his third son [[John, Duke of Berry|John]]. These titles returned to the throne upon John's death without male issue in 1416.
**In 1363, John II granted the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to his fourth son [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]]. Upon the death of Philip's great-grandson [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477, King Louis XI claimed the reversion of Burgundy and seized the territory. It continued to be claimed, however, by Charles's daughter [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary]] and her heirs. When Mary's grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] defeated and captured [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, he forced Francis to sign a treaty recognizing him as Duke of Burgundy, but Francis disavowed the treaty when he was released, and the cession was revoked by the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] four years later. Charles and his heirs reserved their claims, however, and this reservation was repeated as late as the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, when [[Philip IV of Spain]] continued to reserve his rights to the Duchy.
*[[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] granted the [[Duchy of Orléans]] and the [[County of Angoulême]] to his brother [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans|Louis]] in 1392. The Duchy of Orléans returned to the crown when Louis I's grandson became [[Louis XII of France]] in 1498. The County of Angoulême returned to the crown when Louis I's great-grandson became [[Francis I of France]] in 1515.
*Louis XI granted the Duchies of [[Duchy of Berry|Berry]], [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], and [[Duchy of Guyenne|Guyenne]] to his younger brother [[Charles de Valois, Duc de Berry|Charles]]. These titles returned to the crown when Charles died in 1472.
*[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] granted the Duchies of [[Duchy of Orléans|Orléans]], [[Duchy of Angoulême|Angoulême]], and [[Duchy of Châtellerault|Châtellerault]] and the Counties of [[County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]] and [[County of La Marche|La Marche]] to his second surviving son, [[Charles II de Valois, Duke of Orléans|Charles]] in 1540. To this was added the [[Duke of Bourbon|Duchy of Bourbon]] in 1544. These titles returned to the crown when Charles died without issue in 1545.
*[[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] granted
**the Duchies of [[Duchy of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[Duchy of Bourbonnais|Bourbonnais]] and the [[County of Forez]] to the older of his two brothers, [[Henry III of France|Henry]], in 1566. He added the [[Duke of Auvergne|Duchy of Auvergne]] to these holdings in 1569. The titles returned to the crown when Henry succeeded his brother in 1574.
**the Duchies of [[Duchy of Alençon|Alençon]] and [[Duchy of Château-Thierry|Château-Thierry]] and the Counties of [[County of Perche|Perche]], [[County of Mantes|Mantes]], and [[County of Meulan|Meulan]] to his youngest brother, [[François, Duc d'Anjou|Francis]] in 1566. To this he later added the [[Duchy of Évreux]] and the [[County of Dreux]] in 1569. Francis's other brother, Henry III, increased his holdings still further in 1576, granting him the Duchies of [[Duchy of Anjou|Anjou]], [[Duchy of Touraine|Touraine]], and [[Duchy of Berry|Berry]] and the [[County of Maine]]. All these titles returned to the crown upon Francis's death without issue in 1584.

==== House of Bourbon ====
*[[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] granted the Duchies of [[Duchy of Orléans|Orléans]] and [[Duchy of Chartres|Chartres]] and the [[County of Blois]] to his younger brother [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans|Gaston]] in 1626. To this was added the [[Duchy of Valois]] in 1630. These titles returned to the crown on Gaston's death without male issue in 1660.
*[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] granted
**the Duchies of [[Duchy of Orléans|Orléans]], [[Duchy of Chartres|Chartres]], and [[Duchy of Valois|Valois]] to his brother, [[Philippe I, duc d'Orléans|Philippe]] in 1661. To this was added the [[Duchy of Nemours]] in 1672. These titles passed to his descendants and were abolished during the Revolution in 1790. They were restored to the heir at the time of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] in 1814. At the accession of [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], these titles merged into the crown.
**the Duchies of [[Duchy of Alençon|Alençon]] and [[Duchy of Angoulême|Angoulême]] and the [[County of Ponthieu]] to his third grandson, [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)|Charles, duc de Berry]] in 1710. These titles returned to the crown upon his death without surviving issue in 1714
*[[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] granted
**the [[Duchy of Anjou]] and the Counties of [[County of Maine|Maine]], [[County of Perche|Perche]], and [[County of Senonches|Senonches]] to his second surviving grandson, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas, comte de Provence]] in 1771. Louis was further given the [[Duchy of Alençon]] by his brother [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1774. These titles were abolished during the Revolution in 1790. When the monarchy and apanages were restored in 1814, Louis had inherited the throne as Louis XVIII, and his titles merged into the crown.
**the Duchies of [[Duchy of Auvergne|Auvergne]], [[Duchy of Angoulême|Angoulême]] and [[Duchy of Mercœur|Mercœur]] and the [[Viscounty of Limoges]] to his youngest grandson [[Charles X of France|Charles, comte d'Artois]] in 1773. To this was added in 1774 by his brother, Louis XVI the [[Marquisate of Pompadour]] and the [[Viscounty of Turenne]]. In 1776, Louis XVI deprived Charles of Limoges, Pompadour, and Turenne, and gave him in exchange the Duchies of [[Duchy of Berry|Berry]] and [[Duchy of Châteauroux|Châteauroux]], the Counties of [[County of Argenton|Argenton]] and [[County of Ponthieu|Ponthieu]], and the [[Seigneur de Henrichemont|Lordship of Henrichemont]]. In 1778, the apanage was further reshaped, with Auvergne and Mercœur removed and replaced with the [[County of Poitou]], leaving Charles with a final apanage consisting of the Duchies of Angoulême, Berry, and Châteauroux, the Counties of Argenton, Ponthieu, and Poitou, and the Lordship of Henrichemont. These titles were abolished during the Revolution in 1790, but were restored at the time of the Restoration in 1814. They merged into the crown when Charles became king in 1824.

Although Napoleon restored the idea of apanage in 1810 for his sons, none were ever granted, nor were any new apanages created by the restoration monarchs.

==Western feudal appanages outside France==

===Appanages within Britain===

English and British monarchs frequently granted appanages to younger sons of the monarch. Most famously, the Houses of [[House of York|York]] and [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]], whose feuding over the succession to the [[List of English monarchs|English throne]] after the end of the main line of the [[House of Plantagenet]] caused the [[Wars of the Roses]], were both established when the [[Duke of York|Duchies of York]] and [[Duke of Lancaster|Lancaster]] were given as appanages for [[Edmund of Langley]] and [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], the younger sons of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].

In modern times, the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] is the permanent statutory appanage of the monarch's eldest son, intended to support him until such time as he inherits the Crown.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;{{cite book |title=The Companion to British History |last=Arnold-Baker |first=Charles |coauthors= |year=2001 |isbn=978-0415185837 |page=43 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D71aIFaur3EC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22duchy+of+Cornwall%22+appanage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U2-w6zOXVp&amp;sig=qHEvsQnGdeyDpMGcCLpE-3V0Qw8&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22duchy%20of%20Cornwall%22%20appanage&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other titles have continued to be granted to junior members of the royal family, but without associated grants of land directly connected with those titles, any territorial rights over the places named in the titles, or any income directly derived from those lands or places.

====Scotland====
The defunct [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] was granted as an appanage to the future [[David I of Scotland]] by his brother Edgar, King of Scots. Remnants of this can be found within the patrimony of the [[Prince of Scotland]], currently [[Charles, Duke of Rothesay]].

===Kingdom of Jerusalem===
In the only [[crusader state]] of equal rank in protocol to the states of Western Europe, the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon]] was often granted as an appanage.

===Brigantine Portugal===
With the installation of the [[House of Braganza]] on the Portuguese throne in 1640, an official appanage was created for the second eldest son of the monarch, the [[House of the Infantado]]. The Infantado included several land grants and palaces, along with a heightened royal pension.

==Equivalents outside Western Europe==
The practice is certainly not unique to western feudalism
* The principalities of [[European Russia]] had a similar practice; an appanage given to a younger male of the royal family was called an ''udel''. The frequency and importance of the custom was particularly important between the mid-13th and the mid-15th centuries; some historians refer to this era as "the appanage period".
* In [[Medieval Serbia]], an appanage was predominantly given to a younger brother of the supreme ruler, called a ''[[Župa]]''. Its use began in the 9th century and continued into the 14th century, with the fall of the [[Serbian Empire]].
* In the [[Indian subcontinent]], the ''[[jagir]]'' (a type of fief) was often thus assigned to individual junior relatives of the ruling house of a [[princely state]], but not as a customary right of birth, though in practice usually hereditarily held, and not only to them but also to commoners, normally as an essentially meritocratic grant of land and taxation rights (guaranteeing a "fitting" income, in itself bringing social sway, in the primary way in a mainly agricultural society), or even as part of a deal.
*The seniormost female in the [[Travancore royal family]] held the estate of [[Attingal]], also known as the Sreepadam Estate in appanage for life. All the income derived from this {{convert|15000|acre|km2}} estate was the private property of the senior maharani, alternatively known as the Senior Rani of Attingal (''Attingal Mootha Thampuran'').
*The Javanese kingdom of [[Majapahit]], which dominated eastern Java in the 14th and 15th centuries, was divided into ''nagara'' (provinces). The administration of these ''nagara'' was entrusted to members of the royal family, who bore the title of ''Bhre'' i. e. ''Bhra i'', "lord of" (the word ''bhra'' being akin to the [[Thai language|Thai]] ''[[Phra]]''), followed by the name of the land they were entrusted with: for example a sister of king [[Hayam Wuruk]] (r. 1350-1389) was "Bhre Lasem", "lady of [[Lasem]]".

===Appanage system of the Mongol Empire and Mongolian monarchs===
The royal family of the [[Mongol Empire]] owned the largest appanages in the world because of their enormous empire. In 1206, [[Genghis Khan]] awarded large tracts of land to his family members and loyal companions, most of whom were of common origin. Shares of booty were distributed much more widely. Empresses, princesses, and meritorious servants, as well as children of concubines, all received full shares including war prisoners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Weatherford, Jack. ''Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world'', p.220-227&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kublai summoned two siege engineers from the [[Ilkhanate]], and after their success rewarded them with lands. After the Mongol conquest in 1238, the port cities in [[Crimea]] paid [[List of Khans of the Golden Horde|the Jochids]] custom duties and the revenues were divided among all Chingisid princes in Mongol Empire in accordance with the appanage system.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter. ''Dissolution of Mongol Empire'', pp. 186-243&lt;/ref&gt; As loyal allies, the Kublaids in East Asia and the Ilkhanids in [[Persia]] sent clerics, doctors, artisans, scholars, engineers and administrators to and received revenues from the appanages in each other's khanates.

The [[Great Khan]] [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]] divided up shares or appanages in [[Persia]] and made redistribution in Central Asia in 1251-1256.&lt;ref&gt;René Grousset ''The Empire of Steppes'', p.286&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Chagatai Khanate]] was the smallest in size, the Chagatai Khans held the cities of [[Kath, Uzbekistan|Kat]] and [[Khiva]] in [[Khorazm]], and some cities and villages in [[Shanxi]] and [[Iran]], as well as their nomadic grounds in Central Asia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The first [[Ilkhan]], [[Hulagu]], owned 25,000 households of silk-workers in China, valleys in [[Tibet]], and lands in Mongolia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  In 1298, his descendant [[Ghazan]] of Persia sent envoys with precious gifts to the Great Khan [[Temür Khan]], and asked for the share of lands and revenues held by his great-grandfather in the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan lands]] (China and Mongolia). It is claimed that Ghazan received revenues that were not sent since the time of Möngke Khan.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jackson, Peter. "From Ulus to Khanate: the making of Mongol States, c. 1220-1290" in ''The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy'', pp. 12-38&lt;/ref&gt;

The appanage holders demanded excessive revenues and freed themselves from taxes. Ögedei decreed that nobles could appoint [[darughachi]] and judges in the appanages instead of direct distribution without the permission of the Great Khan, thanks to the brilliant [[Khitan people|Khitan]] minister [[Yelü Chucai]]. Both [[Güyük Khan|Güyük]] and Möngke restricted the autonomy of the appanages, but Kublai Khan continued Ögedei's regulations. Ghazan also prohibited any misfeasence of appanage holders in the Ilkhanate, and Yuan councillor Temuder restricted Mongol nobles' excessive powers in appanages in China and Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History of China''&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai's successor Temür abolished imperial son-in-law King [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo]]'s 358 departments which caused financial pressures to Korean people, though, Mongols gave them some autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of Gaoli'' Chongson&lt;/ref&gt;

The appanage system was severely affected beginning with the civil strife in the Mongol Empire in 1260-1304.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher P. ''Encyclopedia of the Mongol Empire and Mongolia'', p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this system survived. For example, [[Abagha]] of the Ilkhanate allowed [[Möngke Temür]] of the [[Golden Horde]] to collect revenues from [[silk]] workshops in northern Persia in 1270, and [[Baraq (Chagatai Khan)|Baraq]] of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] sent his Muslim [[vizier]] to the Ilkhanate in 1269, ostensibly to investigate his appanages there. (The vizier's real mission was to spy on the Ilkhanids.)&lt;ref&gt;A COMPENDIUM OF CHRONICLES: Rashid al-Din's Illustrated History of the World (The Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, VOL XXVII) {{ISBN|0-19-727627-X}} or Reuven Amitai-Preiss (1995), ''Mongols and Mamluks: The Mamluk-Īlkhānid War, 1260–1281'', pp. 179-225.

During the reign of [[Tugh Temür]], Yuan court received a third of revenues of the cities of Transoxiana ([[Mawarannahr]]) under Chagatai Khans while Chagatai elites such as [[Eljigidey]], [[Duwa Temür]], [[Tarmashirin]] were given lavish presents and sharing in the Yuan Dynasty's patronage of [[Buddhist temple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;W.

Allsen ''Sharing out the Empire 172-190''&lt;/ref&gt; H. H. Howorth noted that Ozbeg's envoy required his master's shares from the Yuan court, the headquarters of the Mongol world, for the establishment of new post stations in 1336.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Howorth '' History of the Mongols'', Vol II, p.172&lt;/ref&gt; This communication ceased only with the breakup, succession struggles and rebellions of Mongol Khanates.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Ilkhanate broke up in 1335; the succession struggles of the [[Golden Horde]] and the [[Chagatai Khanate]] started in 1359 and 1340 respectively; the Yuan army fought against the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] since the 1350s.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Mongol Empire in 1368, the Mongols continued the tradition of appanage system. They were divided into districts ruled by hereditary noblemen. The units in such systems were called ''Tumen'' and ''Otog'' during [[Northern Yuan Dynasty]] in Mongolia. However, the [[Oirats]] called their appanage unit ''ulus'' or ''anggi''. Appanages were called [[Eight Banners|banners]] (Khoshuu) under the [[Qing Dynasty]].

The '''Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI)''' is a proposed regulatory body in India for uses of biotechnology products including [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs).&lt;ref name=press_rel/&gt; The institute was first suggested under the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) draft bill prepared by the [[Department of Biotechnology]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=ver2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft: National Biotechnology Regulatory Bill, 2008|url=https://www.indiaoppi.com/sites/default/files/PDF%20files/DRAFT%20NATIONAL%20BIOTECHNOLOGY%20REGULATORY%20BILL,%202008.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has undergone several revisions.&lt;ref name=2010_limbo&gt;{{cite news|title=BRAI Bill leaves biotech commercialisation in limbo|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/brai-bill-leaves-biotech-commercialisation-in-limbo/article621692.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bill has faced opposition from farmer groups and anti-GMO activists.&lt;ref name=suman_sahai&gt;{{cite news|title=Activists oppose Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India bill|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-activists-oppose-biotechnology-regulatory-authority-of-india-bill-1858894|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no_brai_plz&gt;{{cite news|title=No BRAI Bill, Please|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/no-brai-bill-please/article5052683.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[Business Line]]|date=23 August 2013|author=Shaheen Contractor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
On 23 January 2003, India ratified the [[Cartagena Protocol]] which protects [[biodiversity]] from potential risks of [[genetically modified organism]]s, the products of modern biotechnology. The protocol requires setting up of a regulatory body.&lt;ref name=CPB&gt;{{cite web |title=Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) |url=https://www.moef.nic.in/division/cartagena-protocol-biosafety-cpb |publisher=[[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]] |accessdate=24 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707010921/http://www.moef.nic.in/division/cartagena-protocol-biosafety-cpb |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Genetic Engineering Approvals Committee, a body under the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]] is responsible for approval of genetically engineered products in India. If the bill is passed, the responsibility will be taken over by the Environment Appraisal Panel, a sub-division of the BRAI.&lt;ref name=2010_limbo/&gt;

According to the bill, BRAI will have a Chairperson, two full-time members and two part-time members; all will be required to have expertise in [[life science]]s and biotechnology in agriculture, health care, environment and general biology. The bill also proposes setting up an inter-ministerial  governing body, to oversee the performance of BRAI, and a National Biotechnology Advisory Council of stakeholders to provide feedback on the use of  [[biotechnology]] products and organisms in the society.&lt;ref name=press_rel/&gt; The regulatory body will be an autonomous and statutory agency to regulate the research, transport, import, and manufacture [[biotechnology]] products and organisms.&lt;ref name=press_rel&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Authority to be Set Up on Bio-Technology|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=84347|publisher=Press Information Bureau, [[Government of India]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Suman Sahai]], founder of the [[Gene Campaign]], has called the bill flawed. According to her, the bill is proposing new institutes without clearly defining their powers and responsibilities. She has also stated that the bill was introduced without consulting the people who will be affected by the bill.&lt;ref name=suman_sahai/&gt; 

[[P. M. Bhargava]], founder of the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]], has also opposed the bill. He has called the bill unconstitutional, as agricultural policy is the domain of state governments. He pointed out that the bill proposes formation of several subdivisions and has argued that they will consist of bureaucrats with no scientific knowledge. He has accused the [[Department of Biotechnology]], which will be involved in selection of members, as a promoter of genetic technology in India. He has pointed out that the broadly defined term "confidential commercial information" has been kept outside the purview of the [[Right to Information Act]]. He had stated that the bill uses vague wordings which would criminalize sequencing or isolation of DNA and PCR techniques, requiring approval for each usage. Thus, hindering research and education. He pointed out the bill has no provision for mandatory labelling of GM foods. He criticized giving the body power to punish parties making false or misleading statements about GM crops, calling it unprecedented.&lt;ref name=bhargava&gt;{{cite news|title=Unconstitutional, unethical, unscientific|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/unconstitutional-unethical-unscientific/article2752711.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=5 January 2012|author=[[Pushpa Mittra Bhargava|Pushpa M. Bhargava]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2010, [[Jairam Ramesh]], then Environment Minister, pointed out that the body is only deals with safety and efficacy of biotechnology products. The issue of commercialization has been left unaddressed. The decisions regarding commercialization can fall under the purview of [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]], [[Ministry of Health]], [[Ministry of Agriculture]], or [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=2010_limbo/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises]] (ABLE) has supported the bill. J.S. Rehman, an entomologist and a former member of the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation, has stated that most protesters associate genetic engineering with [[Monsanto]], as a result development of Indian biotech is being hindered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let’s unMonsanto the debate|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/blogs/blogs-the-copernican/article5085741.ece|accessdate=1 April 2014|date=2 September 2013|author=Vasudevan Mukunth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Patent law}}
'''Business method patents''' are a class of patents which disclose and [[claim (patent)|claim]] new [[methods of doing business]].  This includes new types of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]], insurance, banking and [[tax|tax compliance]] etc. Business method patents are a relatively new species of patent and there have been several reviews investigating the appropriateness of patenting business methods. Nonetheless, they have become important assets for both independent inventors and major corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091155/http://www.insurancenetworking.com/protected/article.cfm?articleId=3505 Rutkowski, T. "Carriers Unaware of IP Ownership Threats and Opportunities", Insurance Networking News, August 1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In general, [[invention]]s are eligible for patent protection if they pass the tests of [[patentability]]: [[patentable subject matter]], [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step or non-obviousness]], and [[industrial applicability]] (or [[utility (patent)|utility]]).

A business method may be defined as "a method of operating any aspect of an economic enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_Review_of_Patenting_of_Business_Systems_Archived.pdf|title=REPORT ON A REVIEW OF THE PATENTING OF BUSINESS SYSTEMS|date=September 2003|publisher=ADVISORY COUNCIL ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY|accessdate=17 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228215505/http://www.acip.gov.au/pdfs/ACIP_Final_Report_Review_of_Patenting_of_Business_Systems_Archived.pdf|archivedate=February 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===France===
[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]]On January 7, 1791, France passed a patent law that stated that "Any new discovery or invention, in all types of industry, is owned by its author...".  Inventors paid a fee depending upon the desired term of the patent (5, 10, 15 years), filed a description of the invention and were granted a patent.  There was no preexamination.  Validity was determined in courts.  14 out of 48 of the initial patents were for financial inventions. In June 1792, for example, a patent was issued to inventor F. P. Dousset for a type of [[tontine]] in combination with a [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA1-PA559&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1900&amp;id=cEYFAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Description des Machines et Procédés Specifies Dans Les Brévets D’Invention, De Perfectionnement et D’Importation, 1811 pp 544 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These patents raised concerns and were banned and declared invalid in an amendment to the law passed in 1792.

===Britain===
In Britain, a patent was issued in 1778 to John Knox for a “[p]lan for assurances on lives of persons from 10 to 80 years of age.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentlyo.com/08-964bsunitedstates.pdf  Bilski v. Kappos, USPTO Brief for the Respondent, September 30, 2009, p30] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007123319/http://www.patentlyo.com/08-964bsunitedstates.pdf |date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time in British law, patents could only be issued for manufactured objects, not manufacturing processes.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===United States===
{{update|section|date=September 2014}}
Patents have been granted in the United States on methods for doing business since the US patent system was established in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/busmethp/index.html#origins “Automated Financial or Management Data Processing Methods (Business Methods)”] USPTO white paper’&lt;/ref&gt;  The first financial patent was granted on March 19, 1799, to Jacob Perkins of Massachusetts for an invention for "Detecting Counterfeit Notes." All details of Mr. Perkins' invention, which presumably was a device or process in the printing art, were lost in the great [[X-Patent#The 1836 fire|Patent Office fire of 1836]]. Its existence is only known from other sources.

[[Image:Lottery patent header.JPG|thumb|300px|Header from 1840 {{cite patent|US|1700}} on a new type of private lottery.]]
The first financial patent for which any detailed written description survives was to a printing method entitled "A Mode of Preventing Counterfeiting" granted to John Kneass on April 28, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/busmethp/x2301.html Kneass, John, “A Mode of Preventing Counterfeiting”, US patent x2301]&lt;/ref&gt; The first fifty years of the U.S. Patent Office saw the granting of forty-one financial patents in the arts of bank notes (2 patents), bills of credit (1), bills of exchange (1), check blanks (4); detecting and preventing counterfeiting (10), coin counting (1), interest calculation tables (5), and lotteries (17).

On the other hand, cases such as ''Hotel Security Checking Co. v. Lorraine Co.'', 160 F. 467 (2d Cir. 1908), which held that a bookkeeping system to prevent embezzlement by waiters was unpatentable, were often read to imply a "business method exception", in which business methods are unpatentable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/patent/comments/96_1327.htm  | title=commentary on ''State Street Bank'' |author1=P. Jason Hadley |author2=Jung Hahm |author3=Tanya Harding |author4=Steven Lee |author5=Malcolm T. Meeks |author6=Richard Polidi | publisher=University of Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such case was ''Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons v. Marzell'', 180 F.2d 26 (D.C. Cir. 1950), in which the court held that a patent on “blind testing” whiskey blends for consumer preferences would be “a serious restraint upon the advance of science and industry” and therefore should be refused.

[[File:Growth in Business Method Patents.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram showing the growth of business method patents]]

====The change in practice in the 1990s====
For many years, the USPTO took the position that "methods of doing business" were not patentable.  With the emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of patent applications on internet or computer enabled methods of doing commerce, however, USPTO found that it was no longer practical to determine if a particular computer implemented invention was a technological invention or a business invention.  Consequently, they took the position that examiners would not have to determine if a claimed invention was a method of doing business or not.  They would determine patentability based on the same statutory requirements as any other invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.emory.edu/fedcircuit/july98/96-1327.wpd.html State Street Bank v. Signature Financial, decided July 23, 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829183009/http://www.law.emory.edu/fedcircuit/july98/96-1327.wpd.html |date=August 29, 2008 }}, citing the then current [[Manual of Patent Examining Procedure|MPEP]] Sec. 706.03(a) (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bitlaw.com/source/mpep/2106.html |title=MPEP 2106 PATENT SUBJECT MATTER ELIGIBILITY |website=bitlaw.com  |date= |accessdate=27 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent allowance of patents on computer implemented methods for doing business was challenged in the 1998 ''[[State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group]]'', (47 [[United States Patents Quarterly|USPQ]] 2d 1596 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|CAFC]] 1998)).  The court affirmed the position of the USPTO and rejected the theory that a "method of doing business" was excluded subject matter. The court further confirmed this principle with ''[[AT&amp;T Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc.]]'', (50 USPQ 2d 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).

The USPTO continued to require, however, that business method inventions must apply, involve, use or advance the "technological arts" in order to be patentable.  This was based on an unpublished decision of the U.S. [[Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences]], ''[[Ex Parte Bowman]]'', 61 USPQ2d 1665, 1671 (Bd Pat. App. &amp; Inter. 2001).  This requirement could be met by merely requiring that the invention be carried out on a computer.

====The reaction against business method patents after 2000====
In October 2005 the USPTO's own administrative judges overturned this position in a majority decision of the board in ''[[Ex Parte Lundgren]]'', Appeal No. 2003-2088 (BPAI 2005).  The board ruled that the "technological arts" requirement could not be sustained,&lt;ref&gt;[http://patentlaw.typepad.com/patent/2005/10/patent_board_el.html http://patentlaw.typepad.com/patent/2005/10/patent_board_el.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as no such requirement existed in law.

In light of Ex Parte Lundgren, the USPTO has issued interim guidelines for patent examiners to determine if a given claimed invention meets the statutory requirements of being a process, manufacture, composition of matter or machine (35 USC 101).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/guidelines101_20051026.pdf# |title=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/guidelines101_20051026.pdf |access-date=October 29, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029223225/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/guidelines101_20051026.pdf# |archive-date=October 29, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines assert that a process, including a process for doing business, must produce a concrete, useful and tangible result in order to be patentable.  It does not matter if the process is within the traditional technological arts or not.  A price for a financial product, for example, is considered to be a concrete useful and tangible result (see [[State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group]]).

The USPTO has reasserted its position that literary works, compositions of music, compilations of data, legal documents (such as [[Insurance contract|insurance policies]]), and forms of energy (such as data packets transmitted over the Internet), are not considered "manufactures" and hence, by themselves, are not patentable.  Nonetheless, the USPTO has requested comments from the public on this position.

In 2006, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] of the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]  cast aspersions on business method patents when he commented that some of them were of "potential vagueness and suspect validity".  This was expressed in a [[concurring opinion]] to the case of ''[[eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.]]'', 126 S. Ct. 1837 (2006), Kennedy, J., concurring, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been considerable speculation as to how this opinion might affect future business method patent litigation, particularly where a patent owner seeks an injunction to stop an infringer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patenthawk.com/blog/2006/05/injunction_mud.html “Injunction Mud” The Patent Prospector, May 16, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, three Justices (Breyer, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ.) dissented from the dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted in ''Laboratory Corp. of Am. Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;548 U.S. 124 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that ''State Street'' enunciated an erroneous legal test under which processes that the Supreme Court had held patent-ineligible would be held patent-eligible.

====The ''Bilski'' case - 2010====

In ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]'', 561 U.S. 593 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the [[machine-or-transformation test]] is not the sole test for determining whether a claim comes within the "process" subject matter of the Patent Act and is thus patent eligible. Rather than being an exclusive test for eligibility, the machine-or-transformation test is "a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under §&amp;nbsp;101. With respect to the facts of the case before it, the Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit's ''en banc'' rejection of an application for a patent on a method of stabilizing cost inputs in the energy industry by hedging price rises against decreases. The Court held that the investment strategy set forth in the application was an "abstract idea," making it ineligible under that exception to the general subject-matter areas listed in the Patent Act.

The Supreme Court's decision in ''Bilski v. Kappos'' affirmed but sharply qualified the Federal Circuit's 2008 ''en banc'' decision in ''[[In re Bilski]]''.&lt;ref&gt;545 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (''en banc'').&lt;/ref&gt; The decision announced a "machine-or-transformation" test of patent eligibility that, if it had been accepted as the exclusive for process patents, would have made ineligible many business-method patents granted in the last decade. Although the Supreme Court rejected its exclusive use, the test is still important as a "useful and important clue" for determining patent eligibility of claimed process inventions. Under this test. first, processes that transform an article from one state or thing to another are patent eligible regardless of whether their use requires a machine. Processes involving transformation of abstract financial data, such as that claimed in machine format in ''State Street'', are probably patent ineligible. Second, processes that do not make patent-eligible transformations are patent eligible only if they are claimed to be carried out with a “particular machine.” It appears that a programmed general-purpose digital computer is not a ''particular machine'', for this purpose. It is unclear from ''Bilski'' whether a particular machine must be novel and nonobvious, and specially adapted for carrying out the new process.  The Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[Parker v. Flook]]''&lt;ref&gt;437 U.S. 584 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; seems to call for that, but the ''Bilski'' court did not choose to opine on this point at that time.&lt;ref&gt;The two-branch test is based on the decisions of the Supreme Court in its patent-eligibility trilogy some three decades ago – ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]'', 409 U.S. 63 (1972); ''Parker v. Flook'', 437 U.S. 584 (1978); and ''Diamond v. Diehr'', 450 U.S. 175 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'' refused to hold business methods categorically ineligible on any ground. Judge Mayer's dissent, however, seconded by Judges Dyk's and Linn's concurring opinion, insisted that the US patent system is limited to technology and therefore it excludes trade and business expedients. Judge Mayer equated the US Constitution's limitation of patent grants to the "useful arts"&lt;ref&gt;Article I, section 8, clause 8 of the Constitution Gives Congress the power “To promote the Progress of…useful Arts” by granting patents. The Supreme Court has held that the grant of power is also a limitation on congressional power. [[Graham v. John Deere Co.]], 383 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; to a limitation to technology, relying on [[case law]] stating that technology is the modern equivalent of useful arts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Malla Pollack, ''The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents'', 28 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech. L.J. 61, 96 (2002; Micro Law, "What Kinds of Computer-Software-Related Advances (if Any) Are Eligible for Patents? Part II: The Useful Arts Requirement," IEEE MICRO (Sept.-Oct. 2008) (available at http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/KindsElg-II.pdf and http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4659278&amp;isnumber=4659262.pdf ).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] proposed rules that would require tax filers who paid a license fee for a [[tax patent]] to declare that to the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=IRS-2007-0112-0001   IRS Patent Transactions Rule Changes, Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 186 / Wednesday, September 26, 2007 / Proposed Rules 54615]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The ''Alice'' case - 2014====

Several years later, in ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]'', the Supreme Court readdressed the patent eligibility of a business method. It held patent ineligible a method of securing intermediated settlement—a form of electronic escrow. In invalidating Alice's patent, the Court announced a two-step test based on the Court's earlier decisions in ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' and ''[[Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.]]'' This test first determines whether the claimed invention is directed to an abstract idea, law of nature, mathematical formula, or similar abstraction, If it is, the court is to proceed to the second step—determining whether the way the claimed invention implements the abstraction contains an inventive concept, as contrasted with being routine and conventional. Under the ''Alice'' test, the claimed invention is patent eligible only if it contains an inventive concept.

The USPTO business method examining work groups responded quickly to the Alice decision.  Allowances per month for patents related to finance dropped to 10% of their pre Alice value.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/cipa-journal/docs/cipa-2017-07-july-august-2017?e=2508290 Mark Nowotarski “Surviving Alice in the Finance Arts", CIPA Journal, July/August 2017 p 20 -23]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Patent Trial and Appeal Board]] has reacted in a similar manner.  Only about 20% of the appealed business method rejections by patent examiners are getting reversed by the board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilskiblog.com/blog/2017/09/surviving-alice-with-an-appeal.html Mark Nowotarski, "Surviving Alice with an Appeal", Bilski Blog, 21 September 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jurisdictions ==

Whether a business method is regarded as patentable subject matter depends on the legal [[jurisdiction]]. The [[World Trade Organization]]’s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) does not specifically address business method patents.

=== Australia ===

There is no general prohibition on the patentability of business methods in Australia. Their patentability is determined by applying the tests used to determine the patentability of any type of invention. However, in the decision of ''Grant v Commissioner of Patents'' [2006] FCAFC 120, at paragraph [47], the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia held that a business method will only be patentable if it has a physical aspect, being a concrete, tangible, physical, or observable effect or phenomenon. Accordingly, 'pure' business methods, being those that do not have a physical aspect, are not patentable in Australia.

It has been suggested that ''Grant v Commissioner of Patents'' was wrongly decided because the court failed to properly apply the existing law as set out in the decision of the High Court of Australia in ''[[National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents (1959) 102 CLR 252]]'' and that the court should not have imposed a physical aspect requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Ben McEniery, ‘Patents for Intangible Inventions in Australia After Grant v Commissioner of Patents (Part 1)’ (2007) 13(2) Computer and Telecommunications Law Review 70; [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00007006/01/7006.pdf (Online eprints version)] and Ben McEniery, ‘Patents for Intangible Inventions in Australia After Grant v Commissioner of Patents (Part 2)’ (2007) 13(3) Computer and Telecommunications Law Review 100 [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00007444/01/7444.pdf (Online eprints version)].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Subject matter in patent law in Canada}}
A business method must be more than an abstract idea or theorem, otherwise it is not patentable in Canada.  In order to be patentable, the business method must have a practical application.

However, a business method that is an abstract idea does not become patentable merely because it has a practical application.  For example, a particular business method that is an abstract idea does not become patentable merely because it is programmed into a computer as an algorithm.  For a business method to be patentable, the algorithm cannot be the whole invention, but only one aspect of a novel combination.  See ''Amazon.com, Inc. v The Attorney General of Canada, 2011 FCA 328, November 24, 2011''&lt;ref&gt;[http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2011/2011fca328/2011fca328.pdf Amazon.com, Inc. v The Attorney General of Canada, 2011 FCA 328, November 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Patent law of the People's Republic of China}}
In April 2017, SIPO (i.e. the Chinese patent office) revised it's patent examination guidelines to allow the patenting of business methods provided the method had technical features.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/cipa-journal/docs/cipa-2017-07-july-august-2017?e=2508290 Toby Mak, “SIPO update”, CIPA Journal, July/August 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
According to Brazilian Patent Law 9279, "''commercial, accounting, financial, educational, advertising, raffling, and inspection schemes, plans, principles or methods''" are not considered to be inventions or Utility Models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_html.jsp?lang%3DEN%26id%3D515 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007173417/http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_html.jsp?lang=en&amp;id=515 |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Patent Convention ===
Under the [[European Patent Convention]], "[s]chemes, rules and methods for (...) doing business" are not regarded as inventions and are not [[patentability|patentable]], "to the extent that a European patent application or European patent relates to such subject-matter or activities as such".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2)(c) and (3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the claimed subject-matter "specifies an apparatus or a technical process for carrying out at least some part of the scheme, that scheme and the apparatus or process have to be examined as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|g|ii|3|5}}: "Schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business".&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case, the claimed subject-matter is considered to be of a technical nature and is not barred from patentability under {{EPC Article|52|2)(c) and (3}}. It then has to be assessed, as a second step, whether the invention involves an inventive step, considering that the "features which do not contribute to the technical character of the invention cannot support the presence of an inventive step".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|g|vii|5|4}}: "Claims comprising technical and non‑technical features".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Per Chapter II, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035914/http://www.ipindia.nic.in/IPActs_Rules/updated_Version/sections/ps3.html Section 3], part (k) of the Indian Patent Act, business methods are not patentable per se. However they are patentable if a new method solves a "technical" problem and an apparatus/system is involved.

=== United States ===
Current US case law ''[[Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International]]'' (decided June 2014) requires that in order for a business method to be patentable, it must be “significantly more” than simply implementing a well-known business process on a computer.  The immediate response of the USPTO to this decision as of July 2014 has been to essentially stop allowing business method patents.  The key issue is that examiners do not yet have clear guidance as to what is allowable under the Alice decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kilpatricktownsend.com/~/media/Files/articles/2014/Post-Alice%20Exam%20Stats%20In%20Software%20Art%20Units%20A%20Bleajer%20Road.ashx Kate Gaudry, Tomas Franklin, “Post-Alice Exam Stats In Software Art Units: A Bleaker Road”, Law360 3 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
In the 8th edition of the [[International Patent Classification]] (IPC), which entered into force on January 1, 2006, a special subclass has been created for business methods: "[http://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/#refresh=page&amp;symbol=G06Q G06Q]" (Data processing systems or methods, specially adapted for administrative, commercial, financial, managerial, supervisory or forecasting purposes). In the previous editions, business methods were classified in "G06F 17/60". This is purely a classification matter and will not change the patent laws however.

US patents describing methods of doing business that involve the use of a computer are [[United States Patent Classification|classified]] in Class 705 ("data processing: financial, business practice, management or cost/price determination"). Class 705 includes sub-categories for industries such as health care, insurance, electronic shopping, inventory management, accounting, and finance.

'''Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson''' (23 April 1947 – 29 September 2004) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] criminal who was a suspect in the 1986 [[assassination of Olof Palme]], the Prime Minister of Sweden. In 1988 he was convicted of the murder in district court but acquitted on appeal the following year.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early life===
Pettersson grew up in a middle-class family in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] outside of [[Stockholm]] and later moved to the suburb [[Sollentuna Municipality|Sollentuna]]. In his youth he attended a theatrical school (''Calle Flygares teaterskola'') where he was considered very promising by at least one of his teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.bjure.se/juli08.html |title=Christer Pettersson var i sin ungdom en lovande skådespelare |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811193642/http://www.bjure.se/juli08.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}, Bjure.se.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pettersson suffered a head injury that he would never fully recover from. Subsequent to his injury, Petterson began a period of substance abuse which would eventually force him to drop out of school.

In 1970, he killed a man in a street of Stockholm, seemingly without any provocation, in what the Swedish press dubbed the "bayonet murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/vem-var-egentligen-christer-pettersson/|title=Vem var egentligen Christer Pettersson?|work=Expressen|access-date=2018-02-22|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pettersson was sentenced to closed psychiatric care for manslaughter for the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/krim/article22056482.ab|title=Ny dokumentär visar en annan sida av Christer Pettersson|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=2018-02-22|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After less than two years he was released and continued a life of [[petty crime]], which financed his alcohol and [[drug abuse]].

===Tried for the murder of Olof Palme===
{{see also|Olof Palme assassination}}
On the night of 28 February 1986, the Swedish [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic]] Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] was shot and killed in Stockholm as he walked home from a cinema with his wife, [[Lisbet Palme]]. Pettersson was accused of Palme's murder after an extensive investigation by the Swedish police. He was picked out from a [[identity parade|police lineup]] by Lisbet Palme. The original tip-off leading to the incrimination of Pettersson has been described by some as very dubious. Although the .357-caliber Magnum pistol used to kill Palme was never found, Pettersson was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in 1988. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

However, in 1989 he was freed after an appeal court cited lack of evidence, including the missing murder weapon. It also questioned the reliability of Lisbet Palme's identification. Pettersson was awarded about $50,000 in compensation for [[defamation]] by the police and for wrongful imprisonment. He quickly spent the money on alcohol and drugs, but was able to augment his income through selling TV and newspaper interviews. In some of those interviews &amp;ndash; particularly on [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] &amp;ndash; Pettersson admitted to killing Olof Palme, but his confession was not treated seriously. On several occasions Pettersson pointed out that he himself was a "Social Democrat", and liked Olof Palme. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In 1998, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] rejected a prosecutor's appeal to retry Pettersson, citing that evidence was not strong enough to place him at the scene of the shooting. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Coma and death===
[[File:CrillePpopartsthlm.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stockholm [[street art]] depicting Christer Pettersson, 2006]]
On 29 September 2004 Pettersson died at the [[Karolinska University Hospital]] after he supposedly fell and suffered a [[cerebral haemorrhage]]. He had been in a coma since 16 September 2004 when he underwent emergency surgery for unspecified head injuries. Pettersson had reported being harassed by the police on 15 September, the day before he was found with head injuries, with unsubstantiated rumors circulating that he was a victim of police violence. Pettersson was buried in his hometown [[Sollentuna Municipality|Sollentuna]] in January 2005.

Shortly before Pettersson was taken to hospital, he had contacted the son of Olof Palme, Mårten Palme, explaining he had something to tell the family. Palme said he was willing to meet Pettersson if he was ready to confess to the murder. But the meeting did not take place, and what Pettersson had to tell was never revealed.

According to a documentary aired on the Swedish television channel [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] in February 2006, associates of Pettersson claimed that he had confessed to them his role in Olof Palme's murder, but with the explanation that it was a case of [[mistaken identity]]. Apparently, Pettersson had intended to kill a drug dealer, dressed in similar clothing, who often walked along the same street at night. The show also suggested that there was greater police awareness than previously acknowledged due to surveillance of drug activity in the area. The police had several officers in apartments and cars along those few blocks of Sveavägen but, 45&amp;nbsp;minutes before the murder, the police monitoring ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,784450,00.html |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |title=Han erkände – före sin död |trans-title=He confessed - before he died |first=Lennart |last=Håård |date=2006-02-26 |access-date=26 January 2016 |language=sv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307002001/http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,784450,00.html |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the light of these revelations, Swedish police undertook reviewing the Palme case and Pettersson's role. However, in an op-ed in the newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' on 28 February 2006, two senior SVT reporters criticised the TV documentary severely, claiming that the filmmaker had fabricated a number of statements while omitting other contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=572&amp;a=525028&amp;previousRenderType=2 Dagens Nyheter debunking the documentary (Swedish)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081806/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=572&amp;a=525028&amp;previousRenderType=2 |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronological Table does not list either [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Personal or Local Acts]],&lt;ref&gt;Online tables are maintained for these Acts:&lt;br/&gt;[[Chronological Table of Private and Personal Acts]][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes/chron-tables/private]&lt;br/&gt;[[Chronological Table of Local Acts]][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes/chron-tables/local]&lt;/ref&gt; Acts passed by the old [[Parliament of Ireland]] (to 1800), Acts passed by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] (1921-1972), Measures passed by the short-lived [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1973)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] (1973&amp;ndash;1974), nor Acts passed by the modern [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] (from 1999).

The Acts and Measures (other than the Acts of the old Parliament of Scotland) are arranged in order of their chapter number for each session (before 1963) or calendar year.  For each Act or Measure the Table states to what extent, and by what legislation, it has been amended or [[repeal]]ed.

The Convention was mandated to consider eight specified issues, and also selected two others to discuss. [[Government of the 31st Dáil|The government]] was not obliged to proceed with any amendment proposal, but committed to respond formally to each recommendation and debate it in the Oireachtas. {{As of|December 2015}}, the government had formally responded to six of the Convention's nine reports, and put two of its proposals to [[referendum]] on 22 May 2015: [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|to mandate legal same-sex marriage]] and [[Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2015|to reduce the age of eligibility for the presidency from 35 to 21]]. The former was accepted, and the latter rejected.

==Operation==
The Convention was established pursuant to [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s in each house of the [[Oireachtas]] in June 2012.&lt;ref name="dail20120710"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seanad20120712"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it1224319966747"/&gt; It was to meet on at least eight Saturdays over the course of a year.&lt;ref name="rte20121009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d20121009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thejournal20120921"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it1224326240778"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1107/1224326240778.html |title=President welcome at reform discussion |date=7 November 2012 |first=Déaglán |last=de Bréadún |accessdate=16 November 2012 |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural meeting was on 1 December 2012 at [[Dublin Castle]],&lt;ref name="thejournal20120921" /&gt; and working sessions begin in late January 2013,&lt;ref name="it1224326240778"/&gt; with later sessions to be held elsewhere in the state and in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="rte20121009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1009/constitutional-convention.html|title=Constitutional Convention to meet on Saturdays|date=9 October 2012|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d20121009"&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/Debates%20Authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail2012100900018?opendocument#Constitutional%20Convention Dáil debates 9 October 2012 Vol.773 No.12 pp.18–23]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[plenary session]]s are open to the public, and [[live streaming|streamed live]]. The Convention's secretariat is called the Constitutional Convention Office, led by [[civil servant]]s from the [[Department of the Taoiseach]].&lt;ref name="dail20120710"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Work_Of_The_Department/Organisation%20Chart/|title=Organisation Chart|publisher=Department of Taoiseach|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary is Art O’Leary, previously Director of Committees, Information and Communications of the Oireachtas, who is on secondment to the Department of the Taoiseach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ie/egovernment-events/october-2012/|title=Conference on Social Media and Public Services|date=3 October 2012|publisher=Department of Justice and Equality|quote=Mr Art O’Leary, Secretary to the Constitutional Convention|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/committees29thdail/secretariat.htm|title=Committee Secretariat (Joint and Select Committees), Information and Communications|work=Houses of the Oireachtas Service|publisher=Oireachtas|date=15 August 2011|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/michelle/Organisation-Structure-25-October-2012.pdf|title=Organisation Structure October 2012|date=October 2012|work=Houses of the Oireachtas Service|quote=Art O’Leary and Elaine Gunn, Principal Officers, are on secondment to the Department of the Taoiseach|accessdate=25 November 2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agenda===
The establishing resolution set the following agenda items:&lt;ref name="dail20120710"/&gt;

# reducing the [[President of Ireland|presidential]] [[term of office]] to five years and aligning it with the [[Local elections in the Republic of Ireland|local]] and [[European Parliament elections|European]] elections;
# reducing the [[voting age]] to 17;
# review of [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|the Dáil electoral system]];
# giving [[Irish diaspora|citizens resident outside the State]] the right to vote in [[Irish presidential election|presidential elections]] at Irish embassies, or otherwise;
# provision for [[Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland|same-sex marriage]];
# amending the clause on the role of [[Constitution of Ireland#Status of women|women in the home]] and encouraging greater participation of women in public life;
# increasing the participation of [[women in politics]];
# [[Blasphemy law in the Republic of Ireland|removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution]]; and
# following completion of the above reports, such other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by it

The first two items were to be considered first, with recommendations due for report to the Oireachtas within two months of the Convention's first meeting.&lt;ref name="dail20120710"/&gt; The other specified issues were considered in turn until November 2013, and two other issues were then chosen, Dáil reform and [[Economic, social and cultural rights]].&lt;ref name="pr20131217"/&gt;

==Members==

===Chair===
The chairman was appointed by the Government.&lt;ref name="dail20120710"/&gt; Finding a suitable willing candidate took longer than expected.&lt;ref name="rte20121009"/&gt; On 24 October 2012, it was announced that the chairman would be [[Tom Arnold (economist)|Tom Arnold]], an economist who is chief executive of the charity [[Concern (charity)|Concern]] and chair of the trust which runs ''[[The Irish Times]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1024/breaking34.html|title=Arnold named chair of reform body|last=O'Halloran|first=Marie|author2=Michael O'Regan|date=24 October 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold is being paid for his work, and was to step down from his role at Concern in 2013 as the Convention's workload increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/index.php/2012/10/tom-arnold-of-concern-appointed-chairperson-of-the-consitutional-convention/?cat=12 |publisher=Government of Ireland |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2012 |title=Tom Arnold of Concern Appointed Chairperson of the Constitutional Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Arnold addressed the Seanad on the Convention's work to date. He listed the principles under which it operated as openness, fairness, equality of voice, efficiency, and collegiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014011600008?opendocument#H00100|title=Address to Seanad Éireann by Mr. Tom Arnold|date=16 January 2014|work=Seanad Éireann debates|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizens===
The 66 random citizens were chosen by a [[opinion poll|polling]] company to reflect the age, regional, and gender balance of the electorate.&lt;ref name="thejournal20120921"/&gt; For each of the 66, a similar-profile alternate was also selected.&lt;ref name="thejournal20120921"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/constitutional-convention-to-begin-in-october-604453-Sep2012/|title=Constitutional Convention aims to begin discussions next month|last=Reilly|first=Gavan|date=21 September 2012|work=thejournal.ie|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of citizen members, only their names and [[counties of Ireland|county]] or [[Dublin postal district]] were published, rather than their full postal address.&lt;ref name="memberslist"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=d0c3ed87-5f3e-e211-a5a0-005056a32ee4 |title=Members of the Convention |accessdate=3 January 2013 |publisher=Constitutional Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was agreed after the polling company, Behaviour and Attitudes, reported that some of those selected were worried about being "bombarded" by [[lobbyist]]s and [[pressure group]]s.&lt;ref name="it1224326607475"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1115/1224326607475.html |title=Citizens on Constitution body to have anonymity |first=Harry |last=McGee |date=15 November 2012 |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislators===
Thirty-three places were reserved for members of the [[legislature]]s of the [[Republic of Ireland]] (Oireachtas) and [[Northern Ireland]] ([[Northern Ireland Assembly]]). Six parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly were each invited to send one representative.&lt;ref name="cwauqlojojcw"/&gt;  Four accepted, while the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Ulster Unionist Party]] declined, regarding the Convention as internal to the Republic.&lt;ref name="it1224327341662"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1201/1224327341662.html|title=Unionist parties decline invitation|last=Minihan|first=Mary|date=1 December 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining places, 29 in the event, were divided between the Oireachtas groups so as to be "impartially representative of the Houses".&lt;ref name="dail20120710"/&gt; Each Oireachtas group is represented, roughly proportional to their total numbers in both houses ([[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] and [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]]), including the Dáil [[technical group]] and the Seanad [[independent (politician)|independent]] group. [[Sinn Féin]] has a joint delegation from both legislatures.&lt;ref name="presssf"/&gt;

==Background==
In the 2007–2011 Oireachtas ([[30th Dáil]] and [[23rd Seanad]]) the joint committee on the constitution produced a report on the electoral system which recommended that the issue be discussed by a "Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform" and sketched out the structure of such an assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Suteu 2015, p.264; {{cite web |url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/AWData/Library3/Final_Report_PdF.pdf |format=PDF |author=Joint Committee on the Constitution |title=Fourth report : Article 16 of the Constitution: review of the electoral system for the election of Members to Dáil Éireann |publisher=Oireachtas |accessdate=8 June 2018 |date=July 2010 |location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, a group of academics set up a participatory democracy initiative called "We the Citizens", which in June 2011 ran a trial citizens' assembly of 100 randomly selected citizens at the [[Royal Hospital Kilmainham]].&lt;ref&gt;Suteu 2015, p.265; {{cite web |title=Original About Us |url=http://www.wethecitizens.ie/original-about-us/ |publisher=We the Citizens |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
In February 2012, the government proposed that the convention would have 100 members, as follows:&lt;ref name="merrionstreet20120328" /&gt;
* a chairperson "of exceptional ability with a high degree of public acceptability"
* 66 ordinary citizens selected at random from the [[electoral register]] (on the model of a [[citizens assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://per.gov.ie/2011/12/14/address-by-mr-brendan-howlin-t-d-minister-for-public-expenditure-and-reform-2011-macgill-forum/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712193500/http://per.gov.ie/2011/12/14/address-by-mr-brendan-howlin-t-d-minister-for-public-expenditure-and-reform-2011-macgill-forum/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Address to 2011 MacGill Forum |last=Howlin |first=Brendan |date=14 December 2011 |publisher=Department of Public Expenditure and Reform |accessdate=9 April 2012 |location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* one member nominated by each [[List of political parties in Northern Ireland|political party in Northern Ireland]]. The precise number would depend on which parties accepted the offer: some [[Irish republican]] parties have practised [[abstentionism]], while [[Ulster unionist]] parties did not accept invitatations to previous Dublin fora — the [[New Ireland Forum]] (1983–84) and the [[Forum for Peace and Reconciliation]] (1994–2002).
* the balance from members of the [[Oireachtas]] proportion to party strength.

Tom Arnold summarised the Convention's working methods thus:&lt;ref name="it1744924"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/inside-the-convention-on-the-constitution-1.1744924|title=Inside the  Convention on the Constitution|last=Arnold|first=Tom|date=1 April 2014|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Convention met over 10 weekends of a day and a half. Each meeting had three components: presentation by experts of papers which had been circulated in advance; debate between groups advocating on either side of an issue; and roundtable discussions involving facilitators and notetakers. On Sunday morning the members considered again the discussions of the previous day and voted on a ballot paper which reflected the details of the debate.

===Presidential elections, voting age ===
The first plenary session took place over the weekend of 26 and 27 January 2013.  The topics of deliberation of this first session included, among other things, lowering the voting age, reducing the length of the presidential term of office, and aligning presidential elections with those for local authorities and the European Parliament.  The following are some of the more important results from the first plenary session.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.constitution.ie/ConventionVideos.aspx?cid=10 Video of the Concluding Remarks of the Chairman.]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the delegates who were present and voted, 52% voted in favour of reducing the voting age, while 47% voted against any such reduction.&lt;ref&gt;The number of voting delegates is not noted orally or in the slides during the chairman’s concluding remarks.&lt;/ref&gt; 38% of delegates voted that, if the voting age were to be reduced, it should be reduced to 17; 48% voted in favour of it being reduced to 16. As for the issue of making changes related to the [[President of Ireland|office of the president]], 57% voted against and 43% voted in favour of a reduction in the presidential term.  80% of delegates cast their vote against aligning presidential with local and European elections.  94% of delegates voted in favour of giving citizens a greater say in the nomination of presidential candidates.

===Role of women===
The second plenary session took place over the weekend of 16 and 17 February 2013.  The topics of deliberation of this second session included, among other things, amending the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] to place a duty on the Irish State to enhance women's participation in politics and public life, and altering Article 41.2.1 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] related to women in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2013/0218/1224330165062.html |title=Convention favours gender equality and change to ‘women in home’ clause |last=Minihan|first=Mary|date=18 February 2013|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  50% of delegates voted against and 49% in favour of placing a positive duty on the State to take action to increase women's participation in politics and public life.  97% of delegates voted in favour of the following statement: “Leaving aside the Constitution, would you like to see more government action to encourage greater participation of women in politics and public life?” 89% of delegates agreed that the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] should be amended to include “gender-inclusive” language.  62% of delegates supported and 37% were against the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] being amended to include an “explicit provision on gender equality”.  88% of delegates disagreed that Article 41.2.1 should be left unchanged.  98% of delegates voted that were Article 41.2.1 to be changed, it should be made “gender-neutral” to include other careers in the home.

===Issues chosen by the Convention===
The terms of reference allowed the Convention to consider "other issues, time permitting". These were originally scheduled for discussion on 30 November–1 December 2013, just before the anniversary of its inaugural ceremonial meeting.&lt;ref name="ConventionCalendar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=873ff73a-11c9-e211-a5a0-005056a32ee4|title=Calendar for 2013|publisher=Constitutional Convention|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A May 2013 motion to consider the [[Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2013|proposed abolition of the Seanad]] was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/convention-rejects-call-for-seanad-debate-29279438.html|title=Convention rejects call for Seanad debate|last=Kelly|first=Fiach|date=20 May 2013|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention announced on 14 October 2013 a series of meetings at which the general public was invited to suggest topics for the Convention to consider. The meetings took place between 23 October and 25 November, in Cork, Galway, Waterford, Dublin, Sligo, Athlone, and  Monaghan. These meetings supplement the pre-existing facility to submit online proposals, of which "a couple of thousand" had been received by the time of the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/constitutional-convention-announces-public-meetings-nationwide-610056.html|title=Constitutional Convention announces public meetings nationwide|date=14 October 2013|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, two topics were chosen: Dáil reform and Economic, Social and Cultural (ESC) rights.&lt;ref name="pr20131217"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=922d30df-2067-e311-877e-005056a32ee4|title=Convention on the Constitution chooses (i) Dáil Reform and  (ii) Economic, Social and Cultural rights for discussion at their final two meetings in February 2014|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Convention on the Constitution|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were discussed in February 2014.&lt;ref name="pr20131217"/&gt;

In February 2014, the convention recommended for inclusion in the Constitution the following ESC rights: [[right to housing]]; [[social security]]; essential [[health care]]; [[disability rights]]; [[Linguistic rights|linguistic]] and [[cultural rights]]; and rights covered in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name="cc20140223"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=adc4c56a-a09c-e311-a7ce-005056a32ee4|title=Constitutional Convention Votes in Favour of Reforming Economic, Social &amp; Cultural Rights in the Constitution |date=23 February 2014|publisher=Constitutional Convention|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delayed response==
Although the resolution required the government to respond officially within four months of receiving a report from the Convention, this deadline was missed for the fourth and subsequent reports, for which no formal response was made by the time the Dáil adjourned for its summer recess on 17 July 2014.&lt;ref name="q30774_14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014071500055#WRD03600|title=Written Answers No.123: Constitutional Convention Recommendations  (30774/14)|date=15 July 2014|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|page=55|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taoiseach apologised and blamed the delay on the time taken by civil servants to analyse the reports prior to their being considered by the cabinet.&lt;ref name="q30774_14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail2014070900021"/&gt; He stated that "Obviously, the Government will not be able to hold all the referendums and must make a decision on what ones it should hold in conjunction with the marriage equality referendum next spring."&lt;ref name="dail2014070900021"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070900021?opendocument#N9 |title=Order of Business |date=9 July 2014 |work=Dáil Éireann debates |publisher=Oireachtas |page=21 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Kenny responded to [[Seán Ó Fearghaíl]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800022#U02600|title=Order of Business (Continued)|date=18 November 2015|work=Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:I have given an undertaking — I might need the Deputy's help — to set aside time in the remaining weeks of this Dáil session for a proper debate here on the outstanding reports from the Constitutional Convention. Some of the issues it raised actually required quite a deal of work in different Departments. I have given that undertaking and I hope to be able to honour it.

In December 2015, Kenny accepted responsibility for the delay again.&lt;ref name="dail2015121500033"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121500033#N9|title=Order of Business|date=15 December 2015|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responses to the four remaining reports were delivered on 14 January 2016 by [[Minister of State (Ireland)|junior minister]]s [[Paul Kehoe]] and [[Ann Phelan]].&lt;ref name="dail2016011400039" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Noel Whelan (politician)|Noel Whelan]] described the February 2012 proposal as "something that is one part [[Oireachtas committee]] and two parts [[focus group]], with an advisory role only and which will, at least initially, deal with what are essentially insignificant constitutional provisions".&lt;ref name="it1224312372419" &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0225/1224312372419.html|title=Constitutional convention will have its remit severely pruned|last=Whelan|first=Noel|date=25 February 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fintan O'Toole]] in June 2012 compared the Convention to the [[Citizens Union]], a reformist political organisation which [[Tammany Hall]] did not bother suppressing so long as did not threaten its hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0626/1224318725805.html|title=Tammany Hall lives on in feeble reforms|last=O'Toole|first=Fintan|date=26 June 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty NGOs produced an open letter calling for the Convention to examine [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0627/breaking38.html|title=Appeal over constitutional convention|author=Press Association|date=27 June 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.amnesty.ie/news/rights-groups-call-constitutional-convention-examine-human-rights |title=Rights groups call for Constitutional Convention to examine human rights |date=27 June 2012 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=14 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902164041/http://amnesty.ie/news/rights-groups-call-constitutional-convention-examine-human-rights |archivedate=2 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debate on the July Dáil resolution, opposition politicians criticised the composition, agenda, and limited power of the proposed Convention.&lt;ref name="dail20120710"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0711/1224319793208.html|title=Taoiseach stresses role of citizens in new body|last=O'Halloran|first=Marie|date=11 July 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in July, the [[Patrick MacGill]] [[summer school]] in [[Glenties]] had a seminar with academics and politicians discussing the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.donegalcoco.public-i.tv/core/portal/webcast_interactive/84132 |title=A Broad Agenda of Reform for the Constitutional Convention |date=24 July 2012 |work=2012 Patrick MacGill summer school |publisher=[[Donegal County Council]] |accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''Irish Times'' editorial called the Convention "all form and little substance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0712/1224319859657.html|title=The way politics is done|date=12 July 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' described it as "unelected and powerless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/fine-words-dont-do-collins-justice-3203790.html|title=Fine words don't do Collins justice|date=20 August 2012|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Collins (journalist)|Stephen Collins]] wrote that [[Irish children's rights referendum, 2012|the November 2012 referendum on children's rights]], with low turnout and unexpectedly high No-vote, suggested "putting such relatively minor issues [as those of the Convention] to the people in a referendum could easily rebound".

Some [[civil society]] groups complained that they ought to have been directly represented at the convention, instead of being expected to make written submissions and hope for an invitation to address one of its meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Suteu 2015, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; Fears expressed by commentators included that legislator members would control the process to the detriment of the citizen members, and that the demographic averaging of the membership would reduce input from marginalised minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Suteu 2015, pp.267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Wall of [[Swansea University]] wrote in July 2013 that he was impressed by the Convention's operation and the substance of its reports, and hopeful that the government would not simply reject any recommendations it found inconvenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-change-we-can-believe-in-ireland%E2%80%99s-constitutional-convention-has-delivered-1003278-Jul2013/|title=Column: Change we can believe in?

In January 2015, [[Harry McGee]] of ''The Irish Times'' wrote, "Only two of 18 recommendations for constitutional change made by the Convention on the Constitution are to be put to referendum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/only-two-proposals-for-constitution-referendum-1.2079176|title=Only two proposals for Constitution referendum|last=McGee|first=Harry|date=26 January 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, David Farrell commended the level of public engagement with the Convention and its efficient use of its small budget, but said its credibility was undermined by the government's dismissive responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/david-farrell-constitutional-convention-brand-is-in-jeopardy-1.2142826|title=: Constitutional Convention ‘brand’ is in jeopardy|last=Farrell|first=David|date=17 March 2015|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fintan O'Toole similarly praised the Convention's work, and suggested the government's tepid response would increase public cynicism with politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-how-hopes-raised-by-the-constitutional-convention-were-dashed-1.2123435|title=: How hopes raised by the Constitutional Convention were dashed|last=O'Toole|first=Fintan|date=3 March 2015|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, [[David Van Reybrouck]] commended the Constitutional Convention and its successor the [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] as models that other European countries could usefully imitate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/why-ireland-s-citizens-assembly-is-a-model-for-europe-1.2876808|title=Why Ireland’s citizens’ assembly is a model for Europe|last=Humphreys|first=Joe|date=27 November 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoiseach Enda Kenny said in June 2015 that "While there was unanimous support for a second convention in the [Convention's final] report, it was acknowledged that this is an exercise that can only be achieved once in the lifetime of any Dáil".&lt;ref name="dail2015060900026"/&gt;

In the buildup to [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]], various politicians proposed changes to [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Irish abortion law]], including repeal of the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]]. In November 2015,  Kenny promised "a Citizen's Convention on the constitution, or whatever title would be appropriate" to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/taoiseach-denies-rift-with-fine-gael-deputy-leader-minister-reilly-over-abortion-referendum-34240255.html|title=Taoiseach denies rift with Fine Gael deputy leader Minister Reilly over abortion referendum - Independent.ie|last=Hand|first=Lise|date=27 November 2015|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/1127/749698-abortion/|title=Kenny would call forum on abortion if re-elected|date=27 November 2015|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of the 32nd Dáil|Fine Gael–independent minority government]] formed after the 2016 election has committed to establishing "[[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|a Citizens' Assembly]], within six months, and without participation by politicians, and with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues over an extended time period."&lt;ref name="Programme_for_Partnership_Government"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/MerrionStreet/en/ImageLibrary/Programme_for_Partnership_Government.pdf#page=154 |format=PDF|title=A Programme for a Partnership Government|date=11 May 2016|publisher=Government of Ireland|page=153|accessdate=1 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly will not be restricted to constitutional issues, but three such issues specifically mentioned are the Eighth Amendment, [[fixed term parliament]]s, and "the manner in which referenda are held (e.g. should ‘super referendum days’, whereby a significant number of referenda take place on the same day, be held)."&lt;ref name="Programme_for_Partnership_Government"/&gt;

{{Contract law}}

A '''contract of sale''', '''sales contract''', '''sales order''', or '''contract for sale'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=contract+of+sale%2Ccontract+for+sale%2Csales+contract%2Csales+agreement%2Csales+order&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ccontract%20of%20sale%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccontract%20for%20sale%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20contract%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20agreement%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20order%3B%2Cc0 Google Ngram Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal [[contract]] for the purchase of assets (goods or property) by a buyer (or purchaser) from a seller (or vendor) for an agreed upon value in money (or money equivalent). 

An obvious ancient practice of exchange, in many [[common law]] jurisdictions, it is now governed by statutory law. See [[commercial law]].

Contracts of sale involving [[good (economics)|goods]] are governed by Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in most [[jurisdiction]]s in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. However in [[Quebec]], such contracts are governed by the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] as a [[nominate contract]] in the book on the [[law of obligations]]. In Muslim countries it is governed by [[sharia]] (Islamic law).

A contract of sale lays out the terms of a transaction of goods or services, identifying the goods sold, listing delivery instructions, inspection period, any warranties and details of payment.

In [[architecture]], a '''daylight factor''' (DF)&lt;ref&gt;http://patternguide.advancedbuildings.net/using-this-guide/analysis-methods/daylight-factor&lt;/ref&gt; is the ratio of the light level inside a structure to the light level outside the structure. It is defined as:
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;big&gt;''DF = (Ei / Eo) x 100%''&lt;/big&gt;

where,
''Ei'' = illuminance due to daylight at a point on the indoors working plane,
''Eo'' = simultaneous outdoor illuminance on a horizontal plane from an unobstructed hemisphere of overcast sky.

To calculate ''Ei'', requires knowing the amount of outside light received inside of a building. Light can reach a room via through a glazed window, rooflight, or other aperture via three paths:
* Direct light from a patch of sky visible at the point considered, known as the sky component (''SC''),
* Light reflected from an exterior surface and then reaching the point considered, known as the externally reflected component (''ERC''),
* Light entering through the window but reaching the point only after reflection from an internal surface, known as the internally reflected component (''IRC'').

The sum of the three components gives the illuminance level (typically measured in [[lux]]) at the point considered:
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;big&gt;''Illuminance = SC + ERC + IRC''&lt;/big&gt;

The daylight factor can be improved by increasing SC (for example placing a window so it "sees" more of the sky rather than adjacent buildings), increasing ERC (for example by painting surrounding buildings white), increasing IRC (for example by using light colours for room surfaces). In most rooms, the ceiling and floor are a fixed colour, and much of the walls are covered by furnishings. This gives less flexibility in changing the daylight factor by using different wall colours than might be expected&lt;ref&gt;Simm, S. and Coley, D., 2011. The relationship between wall reflectance and daylight factor in real rooms. Architectural Science Review, 54 (4), pp. 329-334.  &lt;/ref&gt; meaning changing SC is often the key to good daylight design.

[[File:Daylight factor study colour plot.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A study of daylight factors within a single storey building resulting from different perimeter glazing and rooflight designs and glass types. Undertaken using the IES Radiance software Module.]]

Architects and engineers use daylight factors in [[architecture]] and building design to assess the internal natural lighting levels as perceived on working planes or surfaces. They use this information to determine if light is sufficient for occupants to carry out normal activities. The design day for daylight factor calculations is based on the standard CIE overcast Sky for 21 September at 12:00pm, and where the ''Ground Ambient'' light level is 11921 Lux. CIE being the ''Commission Internationale de l´Eclairage'', or ''[[International Commission on Illumination]]''.

Calculating daylight factors requires complex repetition of calculations and thus is generally undertaken using a complex software product such as [[Radiance (software)|Radiance]]. This is a suite of tools for performing ''lighting simulation'', which includes a [[rendering (computer graphics)|renderer]] as well as many other tools for measuring simulated light levels. It uses [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] to perform all lighting calculations. One failing in many of these calculations is that they are often completed without wall hangings or furniture against the walls. This can lead to higher predictions of the daylight factor than is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Simm, S. and Coley, D., 2011. The relationship between wall reflectance and daylight factor in real rooms. Architectural Science Review, 54 (4), pp. 329-334.  &lt;/ref&gt; 

To assess the effect of a poor or good daylight factor, one might compare the results for a given calculation against published design guidance. In the UK this is likely to be [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers|CIBSE]] Lighting Guide 10 (LG10-1999), which broadly bands average daylight factors into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;CIBSE Lighting Guide 10: Daylighting and window design, Year: 1999, {{ISBN|0-900953-98-5}}, Publisher: CIBSE&lt;/ref&gt;

* Under 2 – Not adequately lit – artificial lighting is required
* Between 2 and 5 – Adequately lit but artificial lighting may be needed part of the time
* Over 5 – Well lit – artificial lighting generally not required, except at dawn and dusk – but glare and solar gain may cause problems

The '''Declaration of Internet Freedom''' is a 2012 online declaration in defense of [[online]] [[:wikt:freedom|freedoms]] signed by a number of prominent organisations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group calls for Internet freedom |author=Éanna Ó Caollaí |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0702/breaking55.html |newspaper=Irish Times |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defining the 'We' in the Declaration of Internet Freedom |author=Nancy Scola |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/defining-the-we-in-the-declaration-of-internet-freedom/259485/ |newspaper=Irish Times |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable signatories include [[Amnesty International]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], and the [[Mozilla Foundation]], among others.

The declaration supports the establishment of five basic principles for [[Internet]] [[policy]]:

* Non-[[censorship]] of the internet
* [[Universal access]] to [[Broadband|fast]] and affordable networks
* Freedom to connect, communicate, create and innovate over the Internet.
* Protection for new technologies and innovators whose innovations are abused by users.
* [[Privacy law|Privacy rights]] and the ability for Internet user to control information about them is used.

The declaration started to be translated through a collaborative effort started by [[Global Voices Online]] in August 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Global: A Marathon to Translate the Declaration of Internet Freedom |author=Paula Goes |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/07/26/translation-declaration-internet-freedom/ |work=Global Voices Online |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the first week of August, it had been made available into 70 languages, almost half of which were provided by [[Project Lingua]] volunteer translators.

:''For the [[English law]], see [[duty of care in English law]]. For [[Duty of care]] in the Tort context, see [[Duty of care]].''

In United States [[corporation]] and business association [[law]] (particularly [[Delaware]] law and the [[Revised Model Business Corporation Act]]), a '''duty of care''' is part of the '''fiduciary duty''' owed to a corporation by its directors. The other aspects of [[fiduciary duty]] are a director's [[Duty of Loyalty]] and (possibly) [[duty of good faith]]. 

Put simply, a director owes a [[duty]] to exercise good business judgment and to use ordinary care and prudence in the operation of the business. They must discharge their actions in good faith and in the best interest of the corporation, exercising the care an ordinary person would use under similar circumstances.

Directors' decisions are typically protected under the [[business judgment rule]], unless they breach one of these duties or unless the decision constitutes waste. A breach of fiduciary duty will typically remove a director's decision from business judgment protection and require that the director show [[entire fairness]].

== Waste ==

Directors have a duty not to waste corporate assets by overpaying for property or employment services. Thus the definition of waste is an exchange so one-sided that no business person of ordinary, sound judgment could conclude the corporation has received adequate consideration. This is difficult to prove in a court of law.

== Case law ==

The duty of care has been set out or clarified in a number of decisions. Among the important duty of care cases are:

''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'' (setting out duty to be reasonably informed in decision-making).

[[Caremark (court decision)|Caremark]], [[Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co.]], [[Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Inc.]] (setting out duty of supervision and knowledge of company finances).

== Statutes ==

The Duty of Care is set out in the Model Business Corporation act sections 8.30 and 8.31. There is no statutory codification of the Duty of Care in the Delaware General Corporation Law.

== Exculpation ==

Both Delaware and the Model Act allow for directors to be exculpated for some breaches of the duty of care. The exculpation provisions are found in Delaware General Corporate Law section 102(b)(7) and in Model Act section 2.02(b)(4).

== Criticisms ==

It is very difficult for a director to be found in breach of this duty as the business judgment presumption insulates directors from much of their liability. There is little accountability for corporate directors to shareholders, although some still exists. For example, a director for Disney was let go after 14 months of work with about $150MM in compensation, more than his entire employment contract. In Brehm v. Eisner, a Delaware Supreme Court decision from 2000,&lt;ref&gt;746 A. 2d 244 (Del. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found that the Business Judgment Rule shielded the Board, which the Court found to have exercised ''bad business judgment'', since it essentially complied with the Van Gorkom procedural requirement of informing themselves via an expert before approving the severance package. Thus the rule seems to protect even terrible business decisions from judicial review. The counter argument is that shareholders are free to sell their stocks in the open market. Of course, some bad business decisions by the board may well affect the shareholders' ability to do so.
Note, however, that this case was decided under Delaware's rather extreme codification of the Business Judgment Rule, §102(b)(7), which allows the Corporation to shield its board members from liability for almost anything short of outright bad faith.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">The '''Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law''' Moot is an [[moot court|international moot competition]] for young practicing lawyers organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. Whereas most moot competitions are only for students still in [[law school]] or who have not been [[bar (law)|called to the bar]], the ECC-SAL Moot is only open to lawyers who have been qualified for practice for no more than three years. The first edition of the moot was held in 2012. The moot is open to lawyers from Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Korea, and is mainly judged by lawyers (including [[Queen's Counsel]] and [[Senior Counsel]]), academics, and judges in the region. It typically involves a commercial dispute between parties before the [[Singapore International Commercial Court]]. The top eight teams that qualify from the preliminary phase (two rounds) proceed to the knockout stages.

The '''Essex School''' constitutes a variety of [[discourse analysis]], one that combines theoretical sophistication – mainly due to its reliance on the [[post-structuralist]] and psychoanalytic traditions and, in particular, on the work of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], etc. – with analytical precision,{{Verify source|date=December 2013}} since it focuses predominantly on an in-depth analysis of political discourses in [[late modernity]]. 

Founding figures of this approach are [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]], two [[post-Marxist]] political theorists, who, disillusioned with economic reductionism, tried, since the 1970s, to reinterpret [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]]’s theory of [[hegemony]] to highlight the role of meaning and of processes of interpellation and identification in the creation of political identities and in the articulation and sedimentation of political discourses and hegemonic orders. The paradigmatic formulation of this innovative orientation and of its various conceptual innovations can be found in Laclau’s and Mouffe’s ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'', first published in 1985, as well as in many subsequent contributions of the two thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;See Laclau, Ernesto &amp; Mouffe, Chantal, ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy'', London: Verso, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The approach developed by Laclau and Mouffe and the theoretical traditions influencing their thought – mainly Saussurean linguistics, Lacanian psychoanalysis and deconstruction – provided the teaching backbone of the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis Laclau founded at the [[University of Essex]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme website: http://www.essex.ac.uk/ida/&lt;/ref&gt; Already from its inception, the programme attracted many MA and PhD students from around the globe, especially from Argentina, Mexico, Greece, Denmark, Spain, the US and the UK. Many PhD theses further developing Laclau’s and Mouffe’s discourse theory and/or applying it in the empirical analysis of concrete empirical cases have since been completed. Graduates of the programme are now employed by universities in many parts of the world, while the programme itself is run by three members of staff at Essex: [[Aletta Norval]], David Howarth and Jason Glynos, all ex-PhD students of Laclau. Academics associated with the programme have also set up a World Network in Ideology and Discourse Analysis,&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.essex.ac.uk/idaworld/&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a web-based channel of communication between its 203 registered members and has also organized the Inaugural World Conference in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, which took place from 8-10 September 2008 at Roskilde University, Denmark, with Ernesto Laclau as keynote speaker.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://magenta.ruc.dk/isg/discourse/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Apart from setting up a distinct graduate programme, now in its third decade, three other factors are indicative of the increasing international recognition and the gradual institutionalization of the research tradition initiated by Laclau and Mouffe: (i) The activities of the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences, also founded by Laclau at the University of Essex (and now co-directed by Norval and Howarth), which functioned as the intellectual hub of the Ideology and Discourse Analysis group;&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/Theostud/&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) The publication, from 2000 onwards, of a series of monographs, edited collections and textbooks by members of the group, some of them based on the doctoral research conducted within the programme;&lt;ref&gt;Especially see: Howarth, David, ''Discourse'', Buckingham: Open University Press, 2000; Howarth, David, Norval, Aletta &amp; Stavrakakis, Yannis (eds) ''Discourse Theory and Political Analysis: identities, hegemonies and social change''. Manchester - New York: Manchester University Press – St Martin's Press, 2000; and Howarth, David &amp; Torfing, Jacob (eds) ''Discourse Theory in European Politics'', Houndmills: Palgrave, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) The inclusion of the orientation developed by Laclau and Mouffe and their students as a distinct research direction within the field of discourse analysis in textbooks and introductions to the field published by independent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Phillips, Louise &amp; Jorgensen, Marianne, ''Discourse Analysis as Theory and Method''. London: Sage, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of all these developments, the distinct identity of the group and of its research output gradually triggered a process of naming. From 2003 onwards, when critics wanted to refer to the work of members of the group, they used the phrase ‘the Essex School’,&lt;ref&gt;See Townshend, Jules, ‘Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 5, 2003, pp. 129–142, and ‘Laclau and Mouffe’s Hegemonic Project: The Story So Far’, ''Political Studies'', 52, 2004, pp. 269-288.&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely used by both members of the group and ‘outsiders’.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Robinson, Andrew, ‘The Politics of Lack’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 6, 2004, pp. 259-269; Selg, Peeter &amp; Ventsel, Andreas, ‘An Outline of a Semiotic Theory of Hegemony’, ''Semiotica'', 182, 2010, pp. 443-474; Soage, Ana, ‘La teoria del discurso de la escuela de Essex an su contexto teorico’, clac circulo, no. 25, 2006: http://www.ucm.es/info/circulo/no25/soage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Essex School does not limit the research direction of its ‘members’, each one of whom develops her or his own orientation independently; it offers, however, a loose framework within which a multitude of theoretical and political interventions can flourish, enriching the original vision of Laclau and Mouffe.

'''Francesco Parisi''' (born May 31, 1962) is a legal scholar and [[economist]], working primarily in the [[United States]] and [[Italy]]. He is currently{{when|date=July 2018}} the Oppenheimer Wolff &amp; Donnelly Professor of Law at the [[University of Minnesota Law School]] and Distinguished Professor of Economics at the [[University of Bologna]]. Parisi specializes in the [[law and economics|economic analysis of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author SSRN Rank|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=227722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leiter|first=Brian|title=Law School Reports|url=http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2006/03/parisi_from_geo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leiter|first=Brian|title=Law School Reports|url=http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2012/07/top-law-faculties-in-terms-of-scholarly-impact-2007-through-2011-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His research uses formal models and technical results in areas from [[international law]] to [[behavioral economics|behavioral law and economics]] to [[tort law]].

==Education==

Parisi earned his [[law degree]] at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] in 1985. He later studied at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he obtained an LL.M. (1988) and J.S.D. (1990). He taught briefly at [[Louisiana State University Law Center]] before moving to [[George Mason University School of Law]]. While an associate professor at George Mason, Parisi obtained an M.A. in [[economics]] at Berkeley, later earning a Ph.D. in economics from [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Page CV|url=http://www.law.umn.edu/uploads/f2/5b/f25be5e85c939c2c3287861d9450d24d/Parisi-CV-2-2013.pdf|access-date=2013-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923180139/http://www.law.umn.edu/uploads/f2/5b/f25be5e85c939c2c3287861d9450d24d/Parisi-CV-2-2013.pdf#|archive-date=2014-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
After lecturing briefly at University of California, Berkeley (1990–91) and Louisiana State University Law Center (1991–93), Parisi was a member of the faculty of George Mason University School of Law from 1993 to 2006. The University of Minnesota Law School recruited Parisi in 2006.

At the University of Minnesota, Parisi has taught methodological courses in law and economics, including seminars in [[game theory]], [[public choice]], and [[social choice]]. Since 2002, Parisi has split his time between teaching in the United States and Italy. He taught at the [[University of Milan]] from 2002 to 2006 and has taught at the University of Bologna since 2006, where he remains a member of the economics faculty.

Parisi's has written on a number of legal topics. His early writings included historical and comparative analyses of the evolution of the law; more recent research has been entirely in the domain of law and economics. Parisi's work is often technical, relying on mathematical models and formal proofs to establish a practical point about the incentive structure of the law. In particular, his work often focuses on logical symmetries, secondary effects, and evolutionary changes in the law.

Parisi is a founding member of both the [[American Law &amp; Economics Association]] and [[Italian Society for Law and Economics]]. He has served as editor-in-chief of the [[Review of Law and Economics]], and is general editor (with [[Richard Posner]]) of the reference series ''Economic Approaches to Law'' and ''Research Handbooks in Law and Economics''.

{{slavery}}
The '''Fugitive Slave Law''' or '''Fugitive Slave Act''' was passed by the [[United States Congress]] on September 18, 1850&lt;ref name="cobb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4039140/fugitive-slace-act-165/|title=One of American History's Worst Laws Was Passed 165 Years Ago|last=Cobb|first=James C.|date=18 September 2015|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]] between [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[slavery|slave-holding]] interests and [[northern United States|Northern]] [[Free Soil Party|Free-Soilers]].

The Act was one of the most controversial elements of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a "[[slave power]] conspiracy". It required that all escaped slaves, upon capture, be returned to their masters and that officials and citizens of free states had to cooperate. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] nicknamed it the "Bloodhound Law" for the [[bloodhound|dogs]] that were used to track down runaway slaves.&lt;ref name="Nevins"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Allan |authorlink=Allan Nevins|title=Ordeal of the Union: Fruits of Manifest Destiny, 1847–1852 |year=1947|volume=1|publisher=Collier Books |isbn=002035441X}} {{ISBN|978-0020354413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Events leading to US Civil War}}
By 1843, several hundred slaves a year were successfully escaping to the North, making slavery an unstable institution in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].&lt;ref name="Nevins"/&gt;

The earlier [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] was a Federal law which was written with the intent to enforce [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Fugitive Slave Clause|Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution]], which required the return of runaway slaves. It sought to force the authorities in free states to return fugitive slaves to their masters.

Many Northern states wanted to circumvent the Fugitive Slave Act. Some jurisdictions passed "[[personal liberty laws]]", mandating a jury trial before alleged fugitive slaves could be moved; others forbade the use of local jails or the assistance of state officials in the arrest or return of alleged fugitive slaves.

The [[Missouri Supreme Court]] routinely held with the laws of neighboring free states, that slaves who had been voluntarily transported by their owners into free states, with the intent of the masters' residing there permanently or indefinitely, gained their freedom as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |quote=Missouri courts on a number of occasions had granted freedom to slaves whose owners had taken them for long periods of residence in free states or territories |title=America in 1857: A Nation on the Brink |first=Kenneth M. |last=Stampp |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1990 |page=84 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fugitive Slave Law]] dealt with slaves who escaped to free states without their master's consent. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled, in ''[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]'' (1842), that states did not have to offer aid in the hunting or recapture of slaves, greatly weakening the law of 1793.

After 1840, the black population of rural [[Cass County, Michigan]], grew rapidly as families were attracted by white defiance of discriminatory laws, by numerous highly supportive Quakers, and by low-priced land. Free and runaway blacks found Cass County a haven. Their good fortune attracted the attention of southern slaveholders. In 1847 and 1849, planters from Bourbon and Boone counties in northern Kentucky led raids into Cass County to recapture runaway slaves.  The raids failed but the situation contributed to Southern demands in 1850 for passage of the strengthened Fugitive Slave Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benjamin C. |last=Wilson |title=Kentucky Kidnappers, Fugitives, and Abolitionists in Antebellum Cass County Michigan |journal=[[Michigan History (magazine)|Michigan History]] |year=1976 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=339–358 |doi= |issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern politicians{{who|date=September 2015}} often exaggerated{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} the number of escaped slaves and often blamed escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights. Since there was no way to confirm the number of runaway slaves,{{dubious|date=September 2015}} Congress enacted stricter laws regarding [[fugitive slaves in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gara|first1=Larry|title=Underground Railroad|publisher=National Park Service|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New law==
[[File:Cartoon Supporting the Fugitive Slave Act (1851).jpg|thumb|left|Print by E. W. Clay, an artist who published many proslavery cartoons, supports the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. In the cartoon, a Southerner mocks a Northerner who claims his goods, several bolts of fabric, have been stolen. "They are fugitives from you, are they?" asks the slaveholder. Adopting the rhetoric of abolitionists, he continues, "As to the law of the land, I have a higher law of my own, and possession is nine points in the law."]]

In response to the weakening of the original fugitive slave act, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 penalized officials who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave, and made them liable to a fine of $1,000 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1850|r=-3}}}} in present-day value). Law-enforcement officials everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of being a runaway slave on as little as a [[claimant]]'s sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf.&lt;ref name="williams1921"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 4 | pages = 150–60 | last = Williams | first = Irene E. | title = The Operation of the Fugitive Slave Law in Western Pennsylvania from 1850 to 1860 | journal = Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine | accessdate = May 21, 2013 | year = 1921 | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qA8QAQAAMAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Fugitive+Slave+Law+of+1850&amp;ots=i7S4IROEn3&amp;sig=IPg_xNqGDAxCovQeCpFRtB3kp20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers who captured a fugitive slave were entitled to a bonus or promotion for their work.

Slave owners needed only to supply an [[affidavit]] to a Federal marshal to capture an escaped slave. Since a suspected slave was not eligible for a trial, the law resulted in the kidnapping and conscription of free blacks into slavery, as suspected fugitive slaves had no rights in court and could not defend themselves against accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Slavery: A World History|first= Milton|last=Meltzer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMc-y3ya9UC|page= 225|publisher= Da Capo Press|location=New York|year=1971 |isbn=978-0-306-80536-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act adversely affected the prospects of slave escape, particularly in states close to the North. One study finds that while slave prices rose across the South in the years after 1850 it appears that "the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act increased prices in border states by 15% to 30% more than in states further south", illustrating how the Act altered the chance of successful escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lennon|first=Conor|date=August 1, 2016|title=Slave Escape, Prices, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/689619|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=59|issue=3|pages=669–695|doi=10.1086/689619|issn=0022-2186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nullification===
In 1855, the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] became the only state high court to declare the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional, as a result of a case involving fugitive slave [[Joshua Glover]] and [[Sherman Booth]], who led efforts that thwarted Glover's recapture. In 1859 in ''[[Ableman v. Booth]],'' the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the state court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=2485&amp;keyword=booth |title=Booth, Sherman Miller 1812 - 1904|work=Dictionary of Wisconsin biography|publisher=wisconsinhistory.org |year=2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1850, the Vermont legislature passed the "Habeas Corpus Law," requiring Vermont judicial and law enforcement officials to assist captured fugitive slaves. It also established a state judicial process, parallel to the federal process, for people accused of being fugitive slaves. This law rendered the federal Fugitive Slave Act effectively unenforceable in Vermont and caused a storm of controversy nationally. It was considered a "nullification" of federal law, a concept popular in the South among states that wanted to nullify other aspects of federal law, and was part of highly charged debates over slavery. Noted poet and abolitionist [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] had called for such laws, and the Whittier controversy heightened angry pro-slavery reactions to the Vermont law. Virginia governor [[John B. Floyd]] warned that nullification could push the South toward secession, while President [[Millard Fillmore]] threatened to use the army to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act in Vermont. No test events took place in Vermont, but the rhetoric of this flare-up echoed South Carolina's 1832 [[nullification crisis]] and Thomas Jefferson's 1798 [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Kentucky Resolutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Horace K., Jr. |last=Houston |title=Another Nullification Crisis: Vermont's 1850 Habeas Corpus Law |journal=New England Quarterly |volume=77 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=252–272 |jstor=1559746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Jury nullification]]" occurred as local Northern juries acquitted men accused of violating the law. Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]] was a key supporter of the law as expressed in his famous "Seventh of March" speech. He wanted high-profile convictions. The jury nullifications ruined his presidential aspirations and his last-ditch efforts to find a compromise between North and South. Webster led the prosecution against men accused of rescuing [[Shadrach Minkins]] in 1851 from Boston officials who intended to return Minkins to his owner; the juries convicted none of the men. Webster sought to enforce a law that was extremely unpopular in the North, and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] passed him over again when they chose a presidential nominee in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Collison |title='This Flagitious Offense': Daniel Webster and the Shadrach Rescue Cases, 1851-1852 |journal=[[The New England Quarterly]] |volume=68 |issue=4 |year=1995 |pages=609–625 |jstor=365877 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
The Fugitive Slave Law brought the issue home to anti-slavery citizens in the North, as it made them and their institutions responsible for enforcing slavery. "Where before many in the North had little or no opinions or feelings on slavery, this law seemed to demand their direct assent to the practice of human bondage, and it galvanized Northern sentiments against slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shiloh, 1862|last=Groom|first=Winston|publisher=National Geographic|year=2012|isbn=9781426208744|location=Washington, D.C., USA|pages=50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate abolitionists were faced with the immediate choice of defying what they believed to be an unjust law, or breaking with their own consciences and beliefs. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] wrote ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) to highlight the evils of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tl8m84E2iFkC |title=Harriet Beecher Stowe: a life|first=Joan D. |last=Hedrick |authorlink=Joan D.

Many abolitionists openly defied the law. Reverend Luther Lee, pastor of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of [[Syracuse, New York]], wrote in 1855:

{{quote|I never would obey it. I had assisted thirty slaves to escape to Canada during the last month. If the authorities wanted anything of me, my residence was at 39 Onondaga Street. I would admit that and they could take me and lock me up in the Penitentiary on the hill; but if they did such a foolish thing as that I had friends enough on [[Onondaga County]] to level it to the ground before the next morning.&lt;ref name="Lee1882"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Luther|title=Autobiography of the Rev. Luther Lee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA336|accessdate=21 May 2013|year=1882|publisher=Phillips &amp; Hunt|location=New York|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That was far from empty rhetoric. Several years before, in the [[Jerry Rescue]], Syracuse abolitionists freed by force a fugitive slave who was to be sent back to the South and successfully smuggled him to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nyhistory.com/gerritsmith/jerry.htm |title=The Jerry Rescue |work= New York History Net |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Sims]] and [[Anthony Burns]] were both examples of a unsuccessful attempts by opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law to use force to free a captured slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2915.html |title=Anthony Burns captured|work= Africans in America  |publisher=pbs.org |year=2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous examples include Shadrach Minkins in 1851 and [[Lucy Bagby]] in 1861, whose forcible return in 1861 has been cited by historians as important and "allegorical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Hollis |last1=Robbins |authorlink=Hollis Robbins |url=http://www.theroot.com/views/return-segregated-history |title=Whitewashing Civil War History |date=June 12, 2011 |publisher=The Root |accessdate=February 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209142437/http://www.theroot.com/views/return-segregated-history |archivedate=February 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh abolitionists organized groups whose purpose was the seizure and release of any slave passing through the city, as in the case of a free black servant of the Slaymaker family, erroneously "rescued" by black waiters in a hotel dining room.&lt;ref name="williams1921" /&gt;

Other opponents, such as African-American leader [[Harriet Tubman]], simply treated the law as just another complication in their activities. One important consequence was that Canada became a major destination for escaped slaves. The black population of Canada increased from 40,000 to 60,000 between 1850 and 1860, and many reached freedom by the Underground Railroad.&lt;ref name="landon1920negro"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Landon, Fred| title=The Negro migration to Canada after the passing of the fugitive slave act| journal=The Journal of Negro History| year=1920| volume=5| number=1| pages=22–36| jstor=2713499| doi=10.2307/2713499}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pittsburgh, for example, during the September following the passage of the law, organized "squads" of escaped slaves, armed and sworn to "die rather than be taken back into slavery," set out for Canada, with more than 200 men leaving by the end of the month.&lt;ref name="williams1921" /&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] justified refusing to return runaway slaves under the law because the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] were at war. He confiscated the slaves as [[contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] of war and set them free, figuring that the loss of workers would also damage the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Adam |last1=Goodheart |date=April 1, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/magazine/mag-03CivilWar-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=How Slavery Really Ended in America |accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war continued with little progress for the Union side, slavery came to be seen as an institution that needed to be undermined to weaken the Confederacy's economy. As such the US Congress eventually passed legislation that forbade Union forces from returning runaway slaves to their masters, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] consolidated that shifting attitude towards slavery with the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made the institution's destruction an official war goal. Thus, both the spirit and the letter of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 were completely abandoned.

'''Green Star''' is a voluntary sustainability rating system for buildings in [[Australia]]. It was launched in 2003 by the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]. 

The Green Star rating system assesses the sustainability of projects at all stages of the built environment life cycle.  Ratings can be achieved at the planning phase for communities, during the design, construction or fit out phase of buildings, or during the ongoing operational phase.

The system considers assesses and rates buildings, fitouts and communities against a range of environmental impact categories, and aims to encourage leadership in environmentally sustainable design and construction, showcase innovation in sustainable building practices, and consider occupant health, productivity and operational cost savings.

In 2013, the GBCA released a report, ''The Value of Green Star'', which analysed data from 428 Green Star-certified projects occupying 5,746,000 million square metres across Australia and compared it to the ‘average’ Australian building and minimum practice benchmarks.  The research found that, on average, Green Star-certified buildings produce 62% fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 66% less electricity than average Australian buildings.  Green Star buildings use 51% less potable water than average buildings. Green Star-certified buildings also have been found to recycle 96 per cent of their construction and demolition waste, compared to the average 58% for new construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbca.org.au/resources/gbca-publications/the-value-of-green-star/34754.htm Green Building Council of Australia: ''The Value of Green Star'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating system==
Green Star benchmarks projects against the nine Green Star categories of: Management; Indoor Environment Quality; Energy; Transport; Water; Materials; Land Use &amp; Ecology; Emissions and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbca.org.au/green-star/green-star-overview/ Green Building Council of Australia: 'Green Star overview']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within each category are credits which address specific aspects of sustainable building design, construction or performance. Ratings for buildings are available at the design stage ('Design' ratings), at the post-construction phase (known as 'As Built' ratings) or for interior fitouts (‘Interiors’ ratings).

Green Star - Communities rates projects at the community or precinct scale against the categories of: Liveability; Economic Prosperity; Environment; Design; Governance and Innovation.

Green Star certification is a formal process in which an independent assessment panel reviews documentary evidence that a project meets Green Star benchmarks within each credit. The assessment panel awards points, with a Green Star rating determined by comparing the overall score with the rating scale:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Score

! Category
|-
| 10-19

| 45-59
| Four Star
| Best Practice
|-
| 60-56

| Five Star
| Australian Excellence
|-
| 75+
| Six Star

|}

Green Star rating tools for building, fitout and community design and construction reward projects that achieve best practice or above, which means ratings of 1, 2 or 3 are not awarded. Ongoing performance of a building can be rated at any of the 6 star ratings.

Buildings assessed using the Green Star – Performance rating tool will be able to achieve a Green Star rating from 1 – 6 Star Green Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gbca.org.au/green-star/green-star-overview/the-green-star-rating-scale/ | title = The Green Star Rating Scale | publisher = Green Building Council Australia | accessdate = 1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gbcaus.org/docs/GBCA_OfficeExBuildingSHEET.pdf | title = Rating Tool Fact Sheet | publisher = Green Building Council of Australia | accessdate = 1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
More than 1900 projects around Australia have achieved Green Star ratings.  The first building to achieve a Green Star rating was 8 Brindabella Circuit at [[Canberra Airport]], which achieved a 5 Star Green Star – Office Design v1 rating in 2004.  In 2005, [[Council House 2]] in Melbourne became the first building to achieve a 6 Star Green Star – Office Design v1 rating.  [[Flinders Medical Centre]] – New South Wing was the first healthcare facility in Australia to achieve a Green Star rating.  [[Bond University]] Mirvac School for Sustainability achieved the first Green Star rating for an educational facility.  Other well-known Green Star projects include [[1 Bligh Street]] in Sydney and the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]].

== Controversy ==
The launch of the Green Star rating system was met with some scepticism by green groups, which argued that the rating system was funded by mostly development industry companies.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106048784.html Article summarising the launch of Green Star after Australian Financial Review]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was controversy over a proposal to expand the forest certification of timber and composite timber products, but this issue was resolved with the release of the revised ‘Timber’ credit in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/business/green-star-rating-to-focus-on-legal-timber-20091220-l7in.html Sydney Morning Herald: Green Star rating to focus on legal timber]&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been concern over various aspects of the timeframe for awarding of the certification, transfer of properties once awarded, and termination rights.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=59652 Article looking at the application process on Mondaq.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand German|Hannah-Arendt-Preis|date=April 2015}}
The '''Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought''' (German: Hannah-Arendt-Preis für politisches Denken) is a prize awarded to individuals representing the tradition of political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]], especially in regard to [[totalitarianism]].

'''Healthy building''' refers to an emerging area of interest that supports the physical, [[psychological]], and social [[health]] and [[well-being]] of people in buildings and the [[built environment]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/learn/about/576/buildings-health|title=Buildings and Health - GSA Sustainable Facilites Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=sftool.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings can be key promoters of health and well-being since most people spend a majority of their time indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/unhealthy-vs-healthy-office/index.html|title=Is your office making you unhealthy?|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Human Activity Pattern Survey, Americans spend “an average of 87% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6% of their time in enclosed vehicles.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klepeis|first=N. E.|last2=Nelson|first2=W. C.|last3=Ott|first3=W. R.|last4=Robinson|first4=J. P.|last5=Tsang|first5=A. M.|last6=Switzer|first6=P.|last7=Behar|first7=J. V.|last8=Hern|first8=S. C.|last9=Engelmann|first9=W. H.|date=2001|title=The National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS): a resource for assessing exposure to environmental pollutants|journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=231–252|doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500165|issn=1053-4245|pmid=11477521|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthy building can be seen as the next generation of [[Green building]] that not only includes environmentally responsible and resource-efficient building concepts, but also integrates “health, wellness, and human experience in buildings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/articles/healthy-buildings-and-healthy-people-next-generation-green-building|title=Healthy buildings and healthy people: The next generation of green building {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|website=www.usgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits can include “reducing [[absenteeism]] and [[presenteeism]], lowering health care costs, and improving individual and organizational performance.” Healthy building encompasses a wide range of concepts and applications that promote human health which include but are not limited to: site selection and construction, occupant engagement, personal control, [[Green building#Indoor environmental quality enhancement|indoor environmental quality]], [[daylighting]], [[Biophilia hypothesis#Biophilic design|biophilic design]], access to [[Drinking water|potable water]], healthy dining options, exercise in the workplace, and smoking restrictions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Integrated design ==
Healthy building involves many different concepts, fields of interest, and disciplines. As such, taking an integrative or [[integrated design]] approach is essential to successfully creating a healthy building. Forming a diverse and interdisciplinary team early in the process can generate integrated or complementary strategies for improved performance or health impact considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/261/integrative-design-process|title=Integrative Design Process - GSA Sustainable Facilites Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=sftool.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An integrated design team can consist of stakeholders and specialists such as facility managers, architects, building engineers, health and wellness experts, and public health partners. Conducting [[Charrette|charrettes]] with an integrated design team can foster collaboration and help the team develop goals, plans, and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/planning-and-conducting-integrated-design-id-charrettes|title=Planning and Conducting Integrated Design (ID) Charrettes {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings and health components ==
There are many different components that can support health and well-being in buildings.

=== Site selection ===
[[Site selection]] is an important factor in designing a building and ensuring positive health and environmental impacts. Creating a [[Walkability|walkable]] environment that connects people to workplaces, green spaces, public transportation, fitness centers, and other basic needs and services can influence daily physical activity, “the distances people travel to work, the convenience of purchasing healthy foods, and the safety and attractiveness of neighborhoods for walking.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.preventioninstitute.org/publications/strategies-for-enhancing-the-built-environment-to-support-healthy-eating-and-active-living|title=Strategies for Enhancing the Built Environment to Support Healthy Eating and Active Living|last=|first=|date=|website=www.preventioninstitute.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, proximity to green spaces (e.g., parks, walking trails, gardens, and etc.) or therapeutic landscapes can reduce absenteeism and improve well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-11-01|title=Encountering place: A psychoanalytic approach for understanding how therapeutic landscapes benefit health and wellbeing|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829212001293|journal=Health &amp; Place|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1381–1387|doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.07.002|issn=1353-8292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building design ===
There are many aspects of a building that can be designed to support positive health and well-being. For example, creating well-placed collaboration and social areas (e.g., break rooms, open collaboration areas, cafe spaces, courtyard gardens) can encourage social interaction and well-being. Quiet and wellness rooms can provide quiet zones or rooms that help improve well-being and mindfulness. Specifically, a designated lactation room can support nursing mothers by providing privacy and helping them return to work more easily. A lactation room is required for offices with more than 50 employees and recommended for all other offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/nursingmothers/faqBTNM.htm|title=Faqs - Break Time for Nursing Mothers  - Wage and Hour Division (WHD) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another design aspect to consider is [[biophilic design]], which focuses on reconnecting people to the natural environment. Biophilic design has been linked to health outcomes such as stress reduction, enhanced mood, improved cognitive performance, enhanced social engagement, enhanced sleep, and enhanced movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/learn/about/580/biophilic-design|title=Biophilic Design - GSA Sustainable Facilites Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=sftool.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ergonomics]] can also minimize stress and strain on the body by providing ergonomically designed workstations.

=== Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) ===
According to the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), "Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of a building’s environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/default.html|title=CDC - Indoor Environmental Quality - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|date=2017-12-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; IEQ is determined by many factors including [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ), temperature, [[lighting]], and selection of building materials. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) recommends three strategies to improve indoor air quality: source control, improved ventilation, and air cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/improving-indoor-air-quality|title=Improving Indoor Air Quality {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selecting low-emitting products and materials that reduce [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) emissions is one way prevent indoor air pollution. Product characteristics to consider include durability, indoor air quality effects, material transparency, and health impact on building occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/evaluating-and-selecting-green-products|title=Evaluating and Selecting Green Products {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of IEQ that can improve health and well-being include [[thermal comfort]], [http://www.wbdg.org/resources/acoustic-comfort acoustic comfort], and [[integrated pest management]] (IPM).

==== Daylighting ====
[[Daylighting]] refers to providing access to natural daylight, which can be aesthetically pleasing and can reduce energy use. Light has a direct effect on human health because of how it affects [[Circadian rhythm|circadian rhythms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueiro|first=Mariana G|last2=Rea|first2=Mark S|last3=Bullough|first3=John D|date=2006-08-10|title=Does architectural lighting contribute to breast cancer?|journal=Journal of Carcinogenesis|volume=5|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1477-3163-5-20|issn=1477-3163|pmc=1557490|pmid=16901343}}&lt;/ref&gt; If daylighting is not available, supplemental electric lighting can help ensure occupants receive enough light for the [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of circadian rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-governmentwide-policy/office-of-federal-highperformance-buildings/projects-and-research/building-research/circadian-light-for-your-health|title=Circadian Light For Your Health|website=www.gsa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet ===
Providing access to water and healthy, nutritional food is essential to promoting health and a quality environment. The design of a building should take into consideration proximity to water and nutritional foods via cafeterias, vending machines, local stores and restaurants or farmers’ markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fitwel.org/standard|title=Standard {{!}} Fitwel|website=fitwel.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://standard.wellcertified.com/nourishment?_ga=2.169976551.67290029.1533775794-912338317.1532549105|title=Nourishment {{!}} WELL Standard|website=standard.wellcertified.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
Site selection and building design can promote increased physical activity and exercise. Well-lit and accessible stairwells can provide building occupants the opportunity to increase regular physical activity. Fitness centers or an exercise room can encourage exercise during the work day, which can improve mood and performance, leading to improved focus and better work-based relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coulson|first=J.C.|last2=McKenna|first2=Jim|last3=Field|first3=M|date=2008-09-26|title=Exercising at work and self-reported work performance|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235275530_Exercising_at_work_and_self-reported_work_performance|journal=International Journal of Workplace Health Management|volume=1|issue=3|pages=176–197|doi=10.1108/17538350810926534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise can also be promoted by encouraging alternative means of transportation (e.g., cycling, walking, running) to and from the building. Providing facilities such as bicycle storage and locker/changing rooms can increase the appeal of cycling, walking, or running. Active workstations, such as of sit/stand desks, treadmill desks, or cycle desks, can encourage increased movement and exercise as well.

== Occupant engagement ==
While some components of healthy buildings are inherently designed into the built environment, other components rely on the behavioral change of occupants, users, or organizations residing within the building. “Behavioral measures” can be taken to “encourage better public health outcomes: e.g., reducing sedentary behaviors by increasing access to stairways, using more active transportation options, and working at sit-to-stand desks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-governmentwide-policy/office-of-federal-highperformance-buildings/policy/green-building-advisory-committee/advice-letters-and-resolutions|title=Green Building Advisory Committee - Advice Letter and Report: Recommendations for Adoption of Health and Wellness Policies for Federal Facilities|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gsa.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples that can promote health and well-being include establishing [[workplace wellness]] programs, health promotion campaigns, and encouraging activity and collaboration.

== Health and well-being in standards and rating systems ==
There are several international and governmental standards, guidelines, and building rating systems that incorporate health and well-being concepts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/learn/crosswalk|title=GBAC Crosswalk - GSA Sustainable Facilites Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=sftool.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7496">The term '''informational self-determination''' was first used in the context of a German constitutional ruling relating to personal information collected during the 1983 [[Census#Germany|census]]. The German term is '''informationelle Selbstbestimmung'''. It is formally defined as "the authority of the individual to decide himself, on the basis of the idea of self-determination, when and within what limits information about his private life should be communicated to others&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/424513781|title=Reinventing data protection?|date=2009|publisher=Springer|others=Gutwirth, Serge.|isbn=9781402094989|location=[Dordrecht?]|oclc=424513781}}&lt;/ref&gt;." [[Freedom of speech]], protection of privacy, right to active private life, right to education, protection of personal data, and the right to public sector information all fall under the umbrella of informational self-determination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On that occasion, the [[German Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled that: “[...] in the context of modern data processing, the protection of the individual against unlimited collection, storage, use and disclosure of his/her personal data is encompassed by the general personal rights of the [[German constitution]]. This basic right warrants in this respect the capacity of the individual to determine in principle the disclosure and use of his/her personal data. Limitations to this informational self-determination are allowed only in case of overriding public interest.”

Informational [[self-determination]] is often considered similar to the [[right to privacy]] but has unique characteristics that distinguish it from the "right to privacy" in the United States tradition. Informational self-determination reflects Westin's description of privacy: “The right of the individual to decide what information about himself should be communicated to others and under what circumstances” (Westin, 1970). In contrast, the "right to privacy" in the United States legal tradition is commonly considered to originate in [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]]' article, which focuses on the right to ''"solitude"'' (''i.e.'', being "left alone") and in the Constitution's [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which protects persons and their belongings from warrantless search.

=== Views From Germany and The Czech Republic[edit] ===
The German Federal Constitutional Court Population Census Decision comprises a foundation in the improvement of federal data protection laws and is even alluded to as "the very key to the German view on data protection". In this decision, the Court invented the right to informational self-determination as a new constitutional right, which can be viewed as the constitutional basis for the [[right to be forgotten]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kodde|first=Claudia|date=2016-01-02|title=Germany's ‘Right to be forgotten’ – between the freedom of expression and the right to informational self-determination|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13600869.2015.1125154|journal=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology|language=en|volume=30|issue=1-2|pages=17–31|doi=10.1080/13600869.2015.1125154|issn=1360-0869}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[right to be forgotten]] can be viewed as a component of the right to informational self-determination. As this privilege just produces coordinate results when an official authority is involved, the different inquiries concerning private parties and their claims to delete data in the hands of different privates remain unanswered. Furthermore, there is no explicit definition of a [[right to be forgotten]] because it is nearly impossible for something on the internet to be forgotten. Neither the legislator nor the high courts use the term of a [[right to be forgotten]] the way, for instance, the new Draft Data Protection Regulation does. This makes it difficult to give a definite answer to the response to the subject of whether such a privilege can be found in German law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the age of information, countries like the [[Czech Republic]] have resorted to a form of public administration that can be accessed through the internet called [[E-government|eGovernment]]. The purpose of [[E-government|eGovernment]] is to help regulatory procedures, enhance the nature of the administrations and increments inside open division productivity. Additionally, advanced open administrations diminish the authoritative weight on organizations and residents by making their cooperation with open organizations quicker and effective, more advantageous and straightforward, and less expensive. Likewise, utilizing advanced advances as an incorporated piece of governments' modernization methodologies can open further monetary and social advantages for society overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sovová|first=Olga|last2=Sova|first2=Miroslav|last3=Fiala|first3=Zdeněk|date=2017-12-01|title=Privacy protection and e-document management in public administration|url=https://doaj.org/article/49e641551a2b4ddab9932ab124bafe54|journal=Juridical Tribune|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|issn=2247-7195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy Notices[edit] ===
Privacy notices are instruments that are used to educate people of the handling of their own personal data, their rights as data subjects, and '''provide''' any other information required by data protection or privacy laws.Contrary to popular belief, [[European Union]] data protection laws do not require organizations to display a privacy notice on their websites. Although, such notices seem to be logical by-products of data protection and privacy laws, which requires that people are sufficiently informed about the processing of their personal data, these notices are not legally required&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Alsenoy|first=Brendan|last2=Kosta|first2=Eleni|last3=Dumortier|first3=Jos|date=2013-07-05|title=Privacy notices versus informational self-determination: Minding the gap|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F13600869.2013.812594|journal=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=185–203|doi=10.1080/13600869.2013.812594|issn=1360-0869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Perspective[edit] ===
In the United States, there is regularly a more prominent accentuation on the liberty of speech and the freedom of press, than the right to informational self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SZABÓ|first=Anna Barbara|date=January 1, 2016|title=THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DATA PRIVACY|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.xula.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=9&amp;sid=23ea82c0-8326-441e-94c0-59ca5982b647%40sdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=Acta Technica Corvininesis - Bulletin of Engineering|volume=9 Issue 1|pages=101–104|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Law Terms Act 1830''' (11 Geo 4 &amp; 1 Will 4 c 70) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that made various changes to the court system of [[England and Wales]].

Section 8 granted direct [[appeal (law)|appeal]] from the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] to the [[Court of Exchequer Chamber]], rather than indirectly through the [[King's Bench]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornish &amp; Clark (1989) ''p.''25&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 14 abolished the independent [[jurisdiction]] of the courts of session of the [[County Palatine of Chester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activetextdocid=1516541 Reference in the Distress for Rent Act 1737] at the [[UK Statute Law Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yates (1856) ''p.''7&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 15 was repealed by section 56 of, and Part IV of Schedule 11 to, the [[Courts Act 1971]].

In a report dated 27 September 1985, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]] said that section 32 was the only provision that had not been repealed. They said that local consultation had confirmed it was obsolete and unnecessary. They recommended the whole Act be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission. Statute Law Revision: Twelfth Report. Law Com 150. SLC 99. Cmnd 9648. Pages 6 and 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was repealed by Group 1 of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/12/schedule/1/part/I/enacted Part I] of Schedule 1 to the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1986]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1720">A '''loan note''' is a type of [[financial instrument]]; it is a [[contract]] for a [[loan]] that specifies when the loan must be repaid and usually also the interest payable. It is similar to a [[promissory note]] but the differences can be significant in terms of consequences, especially tax consequences. Chief of these is that by specifying the interest payable, the lender may obtain a tax shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/4-107-6780 |title=Practical Law |publisher=Uk.practicallaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loan notes are simple but important instruments in business and finance. A loan note can also be conceived of as a form of deferred payment, and in the UK the tax treatment of loan notes is as either ‘qualifying corporate bonds’ (QCBs), which provide a tax shield, or as ‘non-qualifying corporate bonds’ (non-QCBs) Loan notes may contain other provisions such as convertibility into equity or other kinds of debt, in which case they are called "convertible loan notes". The loan note is one of the most widely used instruments in financing the entrepreneurial venture and in [[Startup company|start-ups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlapiper.com/~/media/Files/Insights/Publications/2014/06/Technology%20Start%20ups.pdf |format=PDF |title=Start-Up Pack : DLA Piper |publisher=Dlapiper.com |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13573">'''Maintenance fees''' or '''renewal fees''' are fees that are paid to maintain a granted [[patent]] in force. Some patent laws require the payment of maintenance fees for pending [[patent application]]s. Not all patent laws require the payment of maintenance fees and different laws provide different regulations concerning not only the amount payable but also the regularity of the payments. In countries where maintenance fees are to be paid annually, they are sometimes called '''patent annuities'''.

==Rationale==
Research is indicating that renewal fees can be used to improve the innovation incentives generated by patent rights.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Professor Mark Schankerman, Professor of Economics at the [[London School of Economics]], cited in [[Jeremy Phillips]], [http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2008/05/strategies-to-improve-patenting-and.html ''"Strategies to Improve Patenting and Enforcement"''], [[IPKat]], 29 May 2008. Consulted on June 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International treaties==

===Paris Convention===
Article 5bis of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] requires that parties to the Convention should provide a six-month grace period for paying maintenance fees:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/trtdocs_wo020.html#P136_18523 Article 5bis] of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]]: ''All Industrial Property Rights: Period of Grace for the Payment of Fees for the Maintenance of Rights; Patents: Restoration''&lt;/ref&gt;

:''(1) A period of grace of not less than six months shall be allowed for the payment of the fees prescribed for the maintenance of industrial property rights, subject, if the domestic legislation so provides, to the payment of a surcharge.
:''(2) The countries of the Union shall have the right to provide for the restoration of patents which have lapsed by reason of non–payment of fees.

===Patent Cooperation Treaty===
International patent applications filed under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] are not subject to the payment of maintenance fees. However, maintenance fees may fall due to designated/elected national and regional offices. If renewal fees have become due by the time the national phase starts, they must be paid before the expiration of the time limit applicable for entering the national phase.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 21 of the [http://www.wipo.int/pct/guide/en/gdvol2/pdf/gdvol2.pdf PCT Applicant’s Guide – Volume II – National Phase]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and regional legislations==

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], maintenance fees for a patent application, or a patent issued from the application, are due on each anniversary of the filing date of the application, beginning on the second anniversary. The amount due each year escalates during the life of the patent or patent application.

If the maintenance fee is not paid (by the applicant or agent of record) by the due date with respect to a patent application, the application is deemed abandoned. The abandoned application may be reinstated within 12 months of the date of abandonment, by filing a request for reinstatement with payment of the maintenance fee that is due and the reinstatement fee.

The maintenance fee for a patent may be paid within a one-year grace period after the due date, with the payment of a late fee. If the required fee has not been paid when the grace period expires, the patent lapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr00142.html|title=Patent Fees|publisher=[[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
No annuity (maintenance) fees need to be paid while applications are pending.&lt;ref&gt;SIPO web site, http://english.sipo.gov.cn/laws/lawregulations/201101/t20110119_566244.html {{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once granted of the patent maintenance fees are due based on the anniversary of application date.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The unpaid fees while the patent was pending have to be paid on grant.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===European Patent Office===
Renewal fees are payable to the [[European Patent Office]] in respect of pending European patent applications in respect of the third year from the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|86|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fees are paid in advance of the year in which they are due (such that the renewal fee for the third year falls due two years from the date of filing) and fall due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|51}} (previously {{EPC 1973 Rule|37}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Renewal fees may not be validly paid more than three months before they fall due, except for the third renewal fee which can be paid up to six months before its due date (in accordance with amended Rule 51(1) EPC entering into force in April 2018).&lt;ref name="EPO-Guid-a-xi-5.2.4"&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|a|x|5|2|4}}: "Renewal fees". (Reflecting the changes to {{EPC Rule|51|1}} as of April 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/service-support/updates/2018/20180320b.html|title=Enhancement of Euro-PCT route: payment of the third year renewal fee|date=March 20, 2018|publisher=EPO|quote=Under amended Rule 51(1) EPC, the third year renewal fee can be paid up to six months before its due date.|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the payment of a renewal fee for a European patent application is not made in due time, the renewal fee may still be validly paid within 6 months of the due date, provided that the additional fee provided by {{EPC Rule|51|2}} is paid within the 6 months as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|51|2}} (previously {{EPC 1973 Rule|37|2}})&lt;/ref&gt; For the calculation of the 6-month additional period, the so-called ''de ultimo ad ultimo'' rule is applied by the EPO.&lt;ref name="EPO-Guid-a-xi-5.2.4"/&gt; According to this rule, the six-month period runs "from the last day of the month to the last day of the month".&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/j910004ep1.htm Decision J4/91 of October 22, 1991], Legal [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Board of Appeal]] 3.1.1 of the European Patent Office. Published in [[Official Journal of the European Patent Office|OJ]] 8/1992, 402.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a renewal fee was due in February 2004, the additional fee fell due on August 31, 2004 (Tuesday), i.e. 6 months from the end of February 2004.

The obligation to pay renewal fees terminates with the payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the year in which the mention of the grant of the European patent is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|86|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, renewal fees are payable to the national offices of the EPC Contracting States in which the European patent is brought into effect. Each Contracting State then pays the [[European Patent Organisation]] a proportion of each renewal fee received for a European patent in that State.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas for a pending European patent application an applicant must pay a single maintenance fee at the EPO, it may be much more costly to pay several maintenance fees to the several national patent offices for maintaining a granted European patent in a number of countries. This however depends on the number of countries in which the patent proprietor wants to maintain its European patent into force. For instance, whereas the renewal fee is 1420 euros for the 10th to 20th year at the EPO (as of April 2010),&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj010/03_10/03_sup10.pdf Supplement 1 to Official Journal 3, 2010, Schedule of fees and expenses applicable as from 1 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; the sum of national renewal fees exceeds respectively 7 000 euros and 20 000 euros for the 10th and 20th year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/vi/index.htm National renewal fees for maintaining a granted European patent]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Or|date=March 2010}}

===Italy===
In a widely criticised move the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] approved the cancellation of all maintenance fees due for Italian patents (including [[European Patent Convention|European patent]]s validated in [[Italy]]), [[utility model]]s and [[industrial design|design]]s, as from January 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.sib.it/engsib/novita/pat/221205.htm
|publisher= Società Italiana Brevetti
|title=Official fees cancelled for patents, utility models and designs in Italy as from 1 January 2006
|date=2005-12-22
|accessdate=2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the fees were reintroduced on January 2, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|publisher=Società Italiana Brevetti
|title=Green Light for Reintroduction of Patent, Utility Model and Design Fees
|date=2007-01-11
|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual amounts of the fees were not announced until April 6, 2007. Consequently, for any fees that fell due between January 2, 2007 and April 30, 2007, the time limit for paying these was extended to June 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Official decision: www.gazzettaufficiale.it,  [http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/gurifulcrum/dispatcher?service=1&amp;datagu=2007-04-06&amp;task=dettaglio&amp;numgu=81&amp;redaz=07A03050&amp;tmstp=1176216592940 ''DECRETO 2 Aprile 2007 Determinazione dei diritti sui brevetti e sui modelli, in attuazione del comma 851, dell'articolo 1, della legge 27 dicembre 2006, n. 296. (GU n. 81 del 6-4-2007 ) - IL MINISTRO DELLO SVILUPPO ECONOMICO di concerto con IL MINISTRO DELL'ECONOMIA E DELLE FINANZE ...'']{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Consulted on May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, including [[Roland Grossenbacher]], then chairman of the [[Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation]], considered that the abolishment of annuity fees in Italy was an error, because, if annuities were abolished, "all patents would remain in force up to the 20th year." &lt;ref name="interview"&gt;[[Managing Intellectual Property]], ''Fees may rise as EPO stresses quality'' (Interview: Roland Grossenbacher), February 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] does not require renewal fees to be paid in respect of pending applications but a granted patent must be renewed on the 4th anniversary of the filing date and every year after that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patent.gov.uk/patent/p-manage/p-changerenew/p-changerenew-renew.htm Renewing your patent] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202222835/http://www.patent.gov.uk/patent/p-manage/p-changerenew/p-changerenew-renew.htm |date=December 2, 2006 }} section on UK Patent Office website and [http://www.patent.gov.uk/patentrules1995.pdf Rule 39] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226114247/http://www.patent.gov.uk/patentrules1995.pdf |date=February 26, 2007 }} of the Patents Rules 1995 (as amended)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, and in contrast to most other European countries and the European Patent Office, the law in the United Kingdom required that renewal fees be paid on the anniversary of the filing date rather than on the last day of the month. [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20052496.htm The Patents (Amendment) Rules 2005], which came into effect on 1 October 2005, ensure that any period prescribed for payment of a renewal fee does not expire until the end of the month in which the renewal date falls.

===United States===
Maintenance fees on [[utility patent]]s in the [[United States]] are due 3½, 7½ and 11½ years after grant of the utility patent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e301581 35 USC 41(b)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; No maintenance fees are due while an application is pending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/qs/ope/fee2009january01_2009may01.htm USPTO FY 2009 FEE SCHEDULE]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Design patent]]s and [[Plant breeders' rights|plant patents]] are not subject to maintenance fees at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2500_2504.htm#sect2504 |title=§ 2504: Patents Subject to Maintenance Fees |website=[[Manual of Patent Examining Procedure]] |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maintenance fees may not be paid in advance;&lt;ref&gt;35 U.S.C. § 41(f) permits maintenance fees to be adjusted every year on October 1 to reflect any fluctuations during the previous 12 months in the [[Consumer Price Index]] as determined by the [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]].  MPEP § 2506.&lt;/ref&gt; the patentee must wait until the payment window opens six months before the due date before paying a maintenance fee.  At the end of the half-year window during which a maintenance fee may be paid, a six-month grace period begins during which a patentee may still pay the maintenance fee along with a small surcharge (as of 2016: $160 for a large entity, $80 for a small entity; and $40 for a micro entity) in order to maintain the patent.&lt;ref&gt;37 C.F.R. § 1.362; MPEP §§ 2501, 2504.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the maintenance fee has not been paid at the conclusion of the grace period, the patent expires for non-payment of maintenance fees.  However, the patent can be revived, by a petition indicating that the non-payment was unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;37 C.F.R. § 1.378; MPEP § 2590.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of the Popular Power for Interior, Justice and Peace''' (Ministerio del Poder Popular para Relaciones Interiores, Justicia y Paz) is one of 39 agencies that make up the executive office of the Venezuelan government . This ministry is also called the '''Ministry of Popular Power for Interior Relations and Justice''' and '''Ministry of Interior and Justice'''.

The ministry is a dependent entity directly under the [[President of Venezuela]].

==History==
Minister [[Jesse Chacon]] said in 2004 that the Ministry of Justice would then be called the Ministry of Interior and Security Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministerio de Interior y Justicia cambia de nombre|url=http://www.aporrea.org/actualidad/n53772.html|website=Apporea|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, President [[Nicolas Maduro]] announced that the ministry took the name of Ministry of Interior, Justice and Peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maduro designa a un militar cercano a Chávez como ministro de Interior|url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2013/04/22/actualidad/1366604649_402330.html|accessdate=26 October 2014|agency=El Pais|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities''', also called the '''Madrid Convention''' was launched by the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/106.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The convention provides a legal framework for the establishment of [[cross-border region]]s. As of 2014, it has been ratified by 39 CoE member states. 

The Convention has two parts. Whereas the first part contains the legally binding regulations of the treaties, the second part lists a series of ‘model agreements’, both for the inter-state and the local levels, as options for possible CBC arrangements. This latter part of the convention is intended for guidance only and has no treaty value. &lt;br /&gt;
The legally binding obligation the Convention puts on the signatory states is to facilitate cross-border cooperation between territorial authorities and to promote the conclusion of agreements that may prove necessary for this purpose (art. 1). Furthermore, the contracting parties commit to encourage any initiative by territorial authorities inspired by the model agreements listed in part two of the Convention. At the same time, the fulfilment of these obligations is subject to a number of clauses. CBC shall not alter the existing powers of the territorial authorities as they are defined in the respective domestic legal orders. The signatory states are also allowed to exclude certain types of authorities from the scope of the Convention. These clauses mean that the fulfilment of the [[international law]] Convention is always limited by national law.&lt;br /&gt;
The second part of the Convention contains various optional ‘model agreements’, grouped in two categories, i.e. inter-state agreements on the one hand, and contracts between [[Local government|local authorities]], on the other. The proposed model agreements provide possible frameworks for varying degrees of co-operation which were drafted according to actually existing CBC treaties and arrangements, such as the 1974 treaty between Luxembourg and the German Land [[Rhineland-Palatinate|Rheinland-Pfalz]]. For instance, the model agreements listed under art. 1.4 and 1.5 were inspired by the such as the 1974 treaty between Luxembourg and the German Land Rheinland-Pfalz Subsequently, they informed a series of further inter-state treaties, enabling local authorities to participate in private and [[public law]] CBC initiatives. &lt;br /&gt;

In 1995, the Convention was supplemented by an Additional Protocol[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/159.htm], ruling that cross-border co-operative arrangements can be set up as independent bodies which may or may not have [[legal personality]]. If the co-operation body does have legal personality, the latter is defined in the law of the country in which its headquarters are located. As stated in art. 4, the co-operation body cannot be empowered to take measures which apply generally or which might affect the rights and freedoms of individuals. It must be specified whether the body is to be considered a public or [[private law]] entity within the respective national legal systems.&lt;br /&gt;
However, the protocol gives the signatory states the option to extend the powers of such co-operation bodies (art. 5). They can be established as public law entities whose decisions have the same [[Rule of law|legal force]] as if they had been taken by the participating authorities themselves. Such bodies can therefore make decisions which are legally binding not only for the participating authorities but also for any individuals affected. In view of the far-reaching implications of such a transnational [[Public benefit corporation|public authority]], Germany, France and Sweden chose to sign the protocol without art. 5. &lt;br /&gt;
The Additional Protocol significantly extends the provisions made by the Madrid Convention.  However, the Convention still does not contain any regulations that override national law. This is why all initiatives have to conform to the national legal systems of the respective countries. Thus, no public law CBC initiative can be based on the CoE Convention and its additional protocols, but must be grounded either in inter-state treaties or at least unilaterally in national law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4982">{{About|standards for human rights institutions|"The Paris Principles: Principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups" (2007)|Free Children from War conference}}

The '''Paris Principles''' were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights held in [[Paris]] on 7–9 October 1991. They were adopted by the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] by Resolution 1992/54 of 1992, and by the [[UN General Assembly]] in its [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|Resolution]] 48/134 of 1993. The Paris Principles relate to the status and functioning of national institutions for the protection and promotion of [[human rights]].

In addition to exchanging views on existing arrangements, the workshop participants drew up a comprehensive series of recommendations on the role, composition, status and also functions of [[national human rights institutions]] (NHRIs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfNationalInstitutions.aspx Text of Paris Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five stipulations==
The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for national institutions, which fall under five headings.

First, the institution shall monitor any situation of violation of human rights which it decides to take up. 
Second, the institution shall be able to advise the Government, the Parliament and any other competent body on specific violations, on issues related to legislation and general compliance and implementation with [[international human rights instruments]]. 
Third, the institution shall relate to regional and [[international organization]]s. 
Fourth, the institution shall have a mandate to educate and inform in the field of human rights. 
Fifth, some institutions are given a quasi-judicial competence.&lt;ref&gt;National Human Rights Institutions - Implementing Human Rights", Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

"The key elements of the composition of a national institution are its independence and pluralism. In relation to the independence the only guidance in the Paris Principles is that the appointment of commissioners or other kinds of key personnel shall be given effect by an official Act, establishing the specific duration of the mandate, which may be renewable." &lt;ref&gt;National Human Rights Institutions - Implementing Human Rights", Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliance with the Paris Principles is the central requirement of the accreditation process that regulates NHRI access to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] and other bodies. This is a [[peer review]] system operated by a subcommittee of the [[Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions|Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20685">The '''parol evidence rule''' is a rule in the [[Common law|Anglo-American common law]] regarding [[contracts]], and governs what kinds of evidence parties to a contract dispute can introduce to identify the specific terms of a contract.{{sfnp|Scott|Kraus|2013|p=539}}  The rule prevents parties who have reduced their agreement to a final written document from later introducing other evidence, such as the content of oral discussions from earlier in the negotiation process, as evidence of a different intent as to the terms of the contract.{{sfnp|Scott|Kraus|2013|p=537}}  The term "parol" derives from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] ''parol'' or ''parole'', meaning "word of mouth" or "verbal", and in medieval times referred to oral pleadings in a court case.&lt;ref&gt;"Parol", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 10th ed. (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The supporting rationale for this rule is that since the contracting parties have reduced their agreement to a single and final writing, extrinsic evidence of past agreements or terms should not be considered when interpreting that writing, as the parties had decided to ultimately leave them out of the contract. In other words, one may not use evidence made prior to the written contract to contradict the writing. A common misconception is that it is a rule of evidence (like the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]]), but that is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17812765538668910988 Casa Herrera, Inc. v. Beydoun]'', 32 Cal. 4th 336, 9 Cal. Rptr. 3d 97, 83 P.3d 497 (2004).  This case reaffirmed that the parol evidence rule is a substantive rule of law and not a mere procedural or evidentiary defense, and then held on that basis that a dismissal of a case on the basis of the parol evidence rule is a favorable termination on the merits sufficient to support a subsequent action for [[malicious prosecution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Contract law}}

The rule applies to parol evidence, as well as other extrinsic evidence (such as written correspondence that does not form a separate contract) regarding a contract.  If a contract is in writing and final to at least one term (integrated), parol or extrinsic evidence will generally be excluded.&lt;ref name=Codelfa&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1982|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto |date=11 May 1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 347}} However, there are a number of exceptions to this general rule, including for partially integrated contracts, agreements with separate consideration, to resolve ambiguities, or to establish contract defenses.

To take an example, Carl agrees in writing to sell Betty a car for $1,000, but later, Betty argues that Carl earlier told her that she would only need to pay Carl $800.  The parol evidence rule would generally prevent Betty from testifying to this alleged conversation because the testimony ($800) would directly contradict the written contract's terms ($1,000).

In order for the rule to be effective, the contract in question must first be a final integrated writing; it must, in the judgment of the court, be the final agreement between the parties (as opposed to a mere draft, for example).

A final agreement is either a partial or complete integration, provided that it has an agreement on its face indicating its finality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Arthur L. |title=The Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule |volume=50 |journal=[[Cornell Law Quarterly]] |publisher=[[Cornell Law School]] |page=161 |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If it contains some, but not all, of the terms as to which the parties have agreed then it is a partial integration. This means that the writing was a final agreement between the parties (and not mere preliminary negotiations) as to some terms, but not as to others. On the other hand, if the writing were to contain all of the terms as to which the parties agreed, then it would be a complete integration. One way to ensure that the contract will be found to be a final and complete integration is through the inclusion of a [[merger clause]], which recites that the contract is, in fact, the whole agreement between the parties.  However, many modern cases have found merger clauses to be only a [[rebuttable presumption]].

The importance of the distinction between partial and complete integrations is relevant to what evidence is excluded under the parol evidence rule. For both complete and partial integrations, evidence contradicting the writing is excluded under the parol evidence rule. However, for a partial integration, terms that supplement the writing are admissible. To put it mildly, this can be an extremely subtle (and subjective) distinction.

To put it simply, (1) If the parties intend a complete integration of the contract terms, no parol evidence within the scope of agreement is permitted. (2) If the parties intended a partial integrated agreement, no parol evidence that contradicts anything integrated is permitted. And (3), if the parol evidence is collateral, meaning it regards a different agreement, and does not contradict the integrated terms, and are not terms any reasonable person would always naturally integrate, then the rule does not apply and the evidence is admissible.

In a minority of U.S. states, (Florida, Colorado, and Wisconsin), the parol evidence rule is extremely strong and extrinsic evidence is always barred from being used to interpret a contract. This is called the [[Four Corners (law)|Four Corners Rule]], and it is traditional/old. In a Four Corners Rule jurisdiction, there are two basic rules. First, the court will never allow parol evidence if the parties intended a full and completely integrated agreement, and second, the court will only turn to parol evidence if the terms available are wholly ambiguous. The policy is to prevent lying, to protect against doubtful veracity, to enable parties to rely dearly on written contracts, and for judicial efficiency.

In most jurisdictions there are numerous exceptions to this rule, and in those jurisdictions, extrinsic evidence may be admitted for the following purposes. This is called the Admission Rule. It favors liberalizing the admission of evidence to determine if the contract was  fully integrated and to determine if the parol evidence is relevant. In these jurisdictions, such as California, one can bring in parol evidence even if the contract is unambiguous on its face, if the parol evidence creates ambiguity. The policy is to get to the actual truth.

The third and final admissibility rule is that under the UCC § 2-202: Parol evidence cannot contradict a writing intended to be the "final expression" of the agreement integrated but may be explained or supplemented by (a) a course of dealing/usage of trade/ course of performance, and by (b) evidence of consistent additional terms unless the writing was also intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

* The court may first determine if the agreement was in fact totally reduced to a written document. In the case of ''State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd'' [[Michael McHugh (judge)|McHugh J]] held the parol evidence rule has 'no operation until it is first determined' that all the terms of the contract are in writing.&lt;ref name="SRA v Heath"&gt;''State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd'' (1986) 7 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 170 at 191, [[NSW Court of Appeal]] [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=7+NSWLR+170 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Australia, the case of ''Saleh v Romanous'', it was held that equitable estoppel triumphs common law rules of parol evidence.&lt;ref name="Saleh v Romanous"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|373|2010|litigants=Saleh v Romanous |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* To prove the parties to a contract. A written agreement to sell land signed by Mrs Kenny at times made reference to Mr Kenny, and the court held that oral evidence was admissible and that she was signing for herself and as an agent for her husband.&lt;ref name="Gilberto v Kenny"&gt;''Gilberto v Kenny'' (1983) 155 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 691  (15 February 1983) [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;
* To prove a condition precedent. In ''Pym v Campbell'' (1865) 119 ER 903, Pym entered into a written contract with Campbell to sell an interest in an invention. The court allowed Campbell to include the oral terms of acknowledgement that the sale was subject to an inspection and approval by an engineer.  The engineer did not approve the invention.
* To prove that the written document is only part of the contract as in ''[[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation]]'',&lt;ref name="Hospital Products  HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1984|litigants=[[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 |date=25 October 1984 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the court found for a written contract to be only part of an agreement. In ''State Rail Authority of NSW'' v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd the court held that the parol evidence rule is persuasive and the evidenciary burden is on the party wishing to establish that the whole contract was not in writing.&lt;ref name="SRA v Heath"/&gt;
* To prove that an implied term of custom or trade usage or past dealings is part of a contract even if not in a written agreement, as in ''[[Hutton v Warren]]''[[Hutton v Warren| [1836] 1 M and W 466]], where the party wishing to add the term bears the evidenciary burden and in this case, a lease had to be read in the light of established custom.
* To prove what is true consideration, not something added to avoid taxes.
* To prove the term or promise is part of a [[collateral contract]].&lt;ref name="Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1919|litigants=Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/64.pdf (1919) 27 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 133] |courtname=auto |date=24 November 1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To aid in the interpretation of existing terms.&lt;ref name=Codelfa/&gt;
* To resolve ambiguity using the ''[[contra proferentem]]'' rule.
* To show, particularly in [[California]], that (1) in light of all the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, the contract is actually ambiguous (regardless of whether the contract's meaning appears unambiguous at first glance), (2) thus necessitating the use of extrinsic evidence to determine its ''actual'' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3574754840919265063 Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage Co.]'', 69 Cal. 2d 33, 39, 69 Cal. Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641  (1968). ''Pacific Gas &amp; Electric'' is one of [[Roger Traynor]]'s most famous (and controversial) opinions, which has been criticized by a number of prominent jurists, including Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  See ''Trident Center v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co.'', 847 F.2d 564 (9th Cir. 1988) and Jeffrey W. Stempel, ''Stempel on Insurance Contracts'', 3rd ed., § 4.02, 4-9, n.16 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
* To disprove the validity of the contract.
* To show that an unambiguous term in the contract is in fact a mistaken transcription of a prior valid agreement. Such a claim must be established by [[clear and convincing evidence]], and not merely by the [[preponderance of the evidence]].
* To correct [[Error|mistakes]].
* To show wrongful conduct such as [[misrepresentation]], [[fraud]], [[duress]], unconscionability (276 N.E.2d 144, 147), or illegal purpose on the part of one or both parties.&lt;ref name=Wollner1999/&gt;
* To show that [[consideration]] has not actually been paid. For example, if the contract states that A has paid B $1,000 in exchange for a painting, B can introduce evidence that A had never actually conveyed the $1,000.
* To identify the parties, especially if the parties have changed names.
* To imply or incorporate a term of the contract.&lt;ref name="Codelfa"/&gt;
* To make changes in the contract after the original final contract has been agreed to. That is, oral statements can be admitted unless they are barred by a clause in the written contract.&lt;ref name=Wollner1999&gt;Wollner KS. (1999). How to Draft and Interpret Insurance Policies, p 10. Casualty Risk Publishing LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for evidence to fall within this rule, it must involve either (1) a written or oral communication made prior to execution of the written contract; or (2) an oral communication made contemporaneous with execution of the written contract. Evidence of a ''later'' communication will not be barred by this rule, as it is admissible to show a later modification of the contract (although it might be inadmissible for some other reason, such as the [[Statute of frauds]]). Similarly, evidence of a collateral agreement - one that would naturally and normally be included in a separate writing - will not be barred. For example, if A contracts with B to paint B's house for $1,000, B can introduce extrinsic evidence to show that A also contracted to paint B's storage shed for $100. The agreement to paint the shed would logically be in a separate document from the agreement to paint the house.

Though its name suggests that it is a procedural evidence rule, the consensus of courts and commentators is that the parol evidence rule constitutes substantive contract law.

Additional information on the parol evidence rule may be found in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 213.

==Examples==
The parol evidence rule is a common trap for consumers. For example:

* Health club contracts.  You enroll in a health club, and the salesperson tells you that the contract can be cancelled.  You later decide you would like to cancel, but the written contract provides that it is non-cancellable.  The oral promises of the salesperson are generally non-enforceable.  However, the salesperson in misleading you into the terms of the contract constitutes a misrepresentation and you may seek to rescind the contract.
* Auto sales agreements.  You purchase a used car, and the salesperson tells you it is "good as new", but the contract provides that the sale is [[as is]].  Again, in most circumstances the written contract controls.  However, this may constitute misrepresentation if it exceeds reasonably accepted "puffing" or "dealers' talk".&lt;ref&gt;''Vulcan Metals Co. v. Simmons Mfg. Co.'', 248 F. 853, 856 (2d Cir. 1918).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Timeshare]]s.  While in certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, a consumer may have a right of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]], some people attend real estate sales presentations at which they may feel pressured into immediately signing binding contracts.  Evidence that the contract was entered into under duress will not be precluded by the parol evidence rule.

==Specific jurisdictions==
'''Australia'''
* In New South Wales, if an entire agreement clause,&lt;ref name=Codelfa/&gt; does not exist in the contract terms, parol evidence rule is a default rule of a completely written contract that the admission of extrinsic evidence is not allowed, and the contract should be understood in an objective approach.&lt;ref name="Mount Bruce Mining"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|2015|litigants=Mount Bruce Mining Pty Limited v Wright Prospecting Pty Limited |courtname=auto |date=14 October 2015 |parallelcite=(2015) 256 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* However there are two exceptions that could overcome the parol evidence rule that extrinsic evidence is admissible: 
Exception 1: the contract is an oral contract or partly written.
Exception 2: parties may have entered into a collateral contract,&lt;ref name="Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer"/&gt; or are establishing an estoppel,&lt;ref name="Saleh v Romanous"/&gt; with rectification, condition precedent, the true consideration, ACL, implied terms.

* There are also exceptions to the parol evidence rule in construing a contract. The first exception is that there is evidence of trade usage, which is well-known, uniform and certain. Appleby v Pursell [1973] 2 NSWLR 879.&lt;ref&gt;''Appleby v Pursell'' [1973] 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 879. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?method=phrase;query=1973%202%20NSWLR%20879;view=date-latest AustLII search].&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, a narrow view of admissibility of extrinsic evidence has been taken, where evidence of surrounding circumstances is only admissible to resolve patent ambiguity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1923|litigants=R W Cameron &amp; Company v L Slutzkin Pty Ltd |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1923/20.pdf (1923) 32 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 81] |date=24 May 1923 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; latent ambiguity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|184|2014|litigants= Mainteck Services Pty v Stein Heurtey |parallelcite= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  and inherent ambiguity in the meaning of the words of a contract.&lt;ref name=Codelfa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Botanic Gardens"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|2002|litigants=Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council |parallelcite=(2002) 240 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 45 |courtname=auto |date=14 February 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court in ''Electricity Generation Corporation v Woodside Energy Ltd''&lt;ref name="Woodside"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|7|2014|litigants=Electricity Generation Corporation v Woodside Energy Ltd |parallelcite=(2014) 251 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 640 |courtname=auto |date=5 March 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; took a different approach to interpreting commercial contracts, considering the "language used by the parties, the surrounding circumstances known to them and the commercial purpose or objects to be secured by the contract" at the "genesis of the transaction".  This necessarily implies consideration of surrounding circumstances and indicates a broader approach may be adopted by the court in the future. The latest view is the narrow view which was described in ''Mount Bruce Mining Pty Limited v Wright Prospecting Pty Limited''.&lt;ref name="Mount Bruce Mining"/&gt;

'''South Africa'''
*In [[South Africa]] the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]], beginning with the landmark ruling in ''KPMG Chartered Accountants (SA) v Securefin Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2009/7.html (2009) 2 All SA 523 (SCA)] par 39.&lt;/ref&gt; redefined the rules relating to the admissibility of evidence that may be used in the interpretation of [[contracts]] in [[South Africa]] and in ''Dexgroup (Pty) Ltd v Trustco Group International (Pty) Ltd'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2013/120.html 2013 6 SA 520 (SCA).]&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court of Appeal gave further clarity on these rules. The starting point is the language of the document and the parol evidence rule prevents evidence to add to, detract from or modify the words contained in the document. However, evidence to prove the meaning of the words, expressions, sentences and terms that constitute the contract, is admissible from the outset irrespective of whether there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in the text – as long as the evidence concerned points to a meaning which the text can reasonably have and the evidence is relevant to prove the common intention of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, Steve [https://www.academia.edu/11379276/Redefining_the_Rules_for_the_Admissibility_of_Evidence_in_the_Interpretation_of_Contracts Redefining the Rules for the Admissibility of Evidence in the Interpretation of Contracts] 2014 De Jure 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Participatory justice''', broadly speaking, refers to the direct participation of those affected most by a particular decision, in the decision-making process itself: this could refer to decisions made in a court of law or by policymakers. Popular participation has been called "the ethical seal of a democratic society" by [[Friedhelm Hengsbach]], a professor of Christian Social Science and Economic and Social Ethics at the Philosophical-Theological College Sankt Georgen in Frankfurt&lt;ref name="Hengsbach"&gt;Hengsbach, Friedhelm (S.J.), "Participatory Justice", essay, n.d., found at [http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2004/03/282037.shtml Portland Independent Media website].

Various authors have claimed that examples of participatory justice date back to civilizations as old as that of the Canadian Aboriginals and Ancient Athenians, even if the terminology had not been in use then.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=Peter|date=May 1977|title=The Administration of Justice in Ancient Athens and in Plato's Laws- Some Comparisons|url=|journal=Politics|volume=12:1|pages=116–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-crowdjury/the-crowdjury-a-crowdsourced-court-system-for-the-collaboration-era-66da002750d8|title=The Crowdjury, a Crowdsourced Judicial System for the Collaboration Era|last=Ast|first=Federico|last2=Sewrjugin|first2=Alejandro|date=November  2015|website=The Crowdjury: A Judicial System for the Internet Era|publisher=A Medium Corporation|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giuduce|first=Michael|date=2006|title=Asymmetrical Attitudes and Participatory Justice|url=|journal=Cardozo Public Law, Policy and Ethics Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Myth of Moral Justice: Why Our Legal System Fails to do What's Right|last=Rosenbaum|first=Thane|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the society of Canadian Aboriginals, citizens were given the opportunity to give their own account of a dispute in public and determine the proper course of action, which sometimes involved issuing a public apology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Elders were viewed as authorities due to their unique knowledge of the circumstances of community members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In ancient Athens, large popular courts, made up of 200 to 1000 randomly selected male citizens, shared in both functions of forming and of applying the law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The term "participatory justice" itself, however, was first used by Bellevue, Washington-based attorney Claire Sherman Thomas in 1984 to describe the process by which people act as responsible participants in the law making process, thereby contributing to causes of social justice.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Claire Sherman|date=1984|title=The Common Law Jury: An Essential Component of Participatory Social Justice|url=|journal=ALSA F.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Gene Stephens first used the term to describe an alternative to the adversarial model of justice system used in court.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;

Both definitions of participatory justice relate to the concept of [[participatory democracy]], which shares similar aspirations: to provide the government with democratic legitimacy and make for a more inclusive, transparent, equal society, by allowing citizens to participate directly in political decision-making and lawmaking processes that affect their lives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Gene|date=1996|title=The Future of Policing: From a War Model to a Peace Model.|url=|journal=The Past, Present, and Future of Criminal Justice|volume=|pages=77–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases, it also refers to the use of [[the Internet]] or a [[television]] [[reality show]] to catch a [[perpetrator]].&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;"Participatory justice," review, February 19, 2008, found at [http://www.connectsafely.org/nfn/netfamilynews/participatory-justice.html Connect Safely website]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, citing Ganzer, Tony, "YouTube's Crime-Fighting Potential Put to Test," [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18334702 NPR story from NPR official website].

==Judicial system==

===Overview===

Participatory justice can refer to the use of [[alternative dispute resolution]], such as [[mediation]], [[conciliation]], and [[arbitration]], in criminal and civil courts, instead of, or before, going to court.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barreaudemontreal.qc.ca/en/avocats/participatory-justice|title=Participatory justice {{!}} Barreau de Montréal|website=www.barreaudemontreal.qc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called "community dispute resolution".&lt;ref name="NYCourts"&gt;New York State Unified Court System, "Alternative Dispute Resolution: Community Dispute Resolution Centers: Frequently Asked Questions", found at [http://www.nycourts.gov/ip/adr/faq.shtml New York State Unified Court System government website].  Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs ([[Non-governmental organizations]]) may get involved in the administration of criminal justice.&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conference20032"&gt;Conference brochure, "Participatory Justice in a Global Economy: The New Rule of Law?", October 2003, Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, found at Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice (CIAJ) website Archived 2004-11-21 at the Wayback Machine.. Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Advisory Commission of Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, delays in sentencing and lack of protection of rights of the accused contribute to attitudes of legal cynicism.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; According to a large cohort of citizens, the guilty are freed while the innocent, and often the black and poor, are harassed.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; The participatory justice model, in turn, attempts to restore public confidence in the legal system.

Whereas the adversarial and disposition system is often slow-functioning, expensive, and inconsistent, the participatory justice model is a cheap and efficient way of resolution-making.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt; Rather than rely on expensive attorneys and expert witnesses, the model relies on volunteers from the community, who are trained in mediation and counseling techniques.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; The resolution is often achieved quicker, because, by reaching a consent agreement implemented by all parties involved, there is no possibility of re-litigation.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; In the participatory justice model, cooperation is valued instead of competition and reconciliation instead of winner-take-all. The need to protect the public and to respect the rights of ordinary citizens to a free but secure society are considered.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; This in turn helps preserve positive relationships between the parties involved.&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt; In modern-day Canada, for instance, community members are involved in almost every step of the judicial process, even before people are arrested and sent to court; community organizations establish working partnerships with police to focus attention on growing social problems, like child abandonment or housing code violations, and prevent crime.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Not only does the participatory justice model promote inclusion, according to several authors, but also socioeconomic equality. The adversarial/dispositional system requires enforcing laws that often represent the will of those with the most educational and monetary resources.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; As Stephens points out, most people who are perpetrators in a particular incident, whether civil or criminal, had also been victims at some point, so every person’s circumstances should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt; Stahn mentions the importance of consulting victims at the reparation stage to determine whether they really believe the person who committed the crime against them is deserving of incarceration.&lt;ref name="stahn20152"&gt;“Reparative Justice after the Lubanga Appeal Judgment: New Prospects for Expressivism and Participatory Justice or ‘Juridified Victimhood’ by Other Means?” Journal of International Criminal Justice, 13(4), pgs. 801-813&lt;/ref&gt; Once used primarily in [[Scandinavia]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]], participatory justice has been "exported" to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Prison&gt;[[Nils Christie|Christie, Nils]], "Limits to Pain", "Chapter 11. Participatory justice," found at [http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/limits_to_pain/chapter11.html Prison Policy website]. Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Peter, and Alice Pell, "North-South partnerships," presentation, SEDPU (Sufficiency Economy, Participatory Development, and Universities), 2003 conference, found at [http://www.sepdu.com/powerpoint/Session5_Calkins.pdf SEDPU website]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, participatory justice serves as a crucial check on state power, that legitimizes the rule of law itself. As long as citizens believe in their ability to contribute to the law making and evaluation process, public consensus supports the rule of law.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Without consensus, the government must rely on the letter of the law and threat of prosecution to maintain order; the government might resort to censorship and surveillance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The law becomes "instead of a vehicle of justice, the instrument of a bureaucratic, institutionalized, dehumanized government."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Therefore, by reducing legal cynicism in communities, participatory justice effectively decreases the likelihood that the state will respond to this cynicism through use of overly punitive justice.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Once used primarily in Scandinavia, Asia, and Africa, participatory justice has been "exported" to the United States and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Dal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIAJ"&gt;Conference brochure, "Participatory Justice in  a Global Economy: The New Rule of Law?", October 2003, Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, found at [http://www.ciaj-icaj.ca/english/community/Banff2003E.pdf Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice (CIAJ) website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121002822/http://www.ciaj-icaj.ca/english/community/Banff2003E.pdf |date=2004-11-21 }}.  Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used in a variety of cases, including between                   "[[Landlord]]s and Tenants, Neighbours, Parents and Children, Families and Schools, Consumers and Merchants ... [and] [[Victimology|victims of crime]] and offenders."&lt;ref name="NYCourts" /&gt; For war-torn countries, participatory justice can promote coexistence and reconciliation, through an emphasis on universal participation.&lt;ref name="stephens19862" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stahn20152" /&gt;

An online and self-financed form of participatory justice, called the crowdjury system, has been promoted as an improved way of managing trials in the future.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Witnesses to a crime can upload evidence online into a secure vault.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Data can then be organized into useful knowledge by groups of 9 to 12 self-selected volunteers with expertise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If a defendant pleads guilty, they can propose a form of restoration, as a way to avoid harsher punishment; if they do not plead, an online trial will be held with a massive randomly-selected jury.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Participants in the evidence review process will receive monetary compensation through Bitcoin or alt coin.  According to crowdjury's proponents, this will help the government cut costs and create a more transparent judicial process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Criticisms===

Critics of the participatory justice model cite its purpose to often humiliate a particular party.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Inkiko-Gacaca, a system of community courts established in 2002 to respond to the large number of suspected perpetrators imprisoned after the 1994 Rwandan genocide, is a famous example.&lt;ref name="Waldorf2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldorf|first=LT|date=2006|title=Rwanda's Failing Experiment in Restorative Justice|url=|journal=Handbook of Restorative Justice: A Global Perspective|volume=|pages=422-434|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002a&gt;“The legacies of collective violence: the Rwandan genocide and the limits of the law,” Boston Review, 27(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Meant to achieve lasting peace through the promotion of restorative justice, Gacaca, according to several authors, has only become more retributive and coercive.&lt;ref name="Waldorf2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002a/&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002b&gt;“Helena Cobban Replies”, Boston Review, 27(3-4), online&lt;/ref&gt; Through the process, Tutsi genocide survivors allegedly impose guilt on the Hutu, asking them to confess their deeds, express apologies to all victims and kin, and repay them tangibly, through public shaming.&lt;ref name=cobban2002a/&gt;&lt;ref name=cobban2002b/&gt; The participatory justice model has also been critiqued for its lack of checks and balances and lack of participation of professional experts.&lt;ref name= Williams1987&gt;C Williams, Victim-Offender Mediation in New Law Journal, London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Because the negotiators are usually not trained in the collection of evidence and are not privy to the criminal background of the alleged offender, the resolution may be made without full facts and knowledge. Furthermore, the offender's motivation is difficult to assess if the alternative is more formal punishment.

==Legislative system==
===Overview===

Participatory justice can also refer to the rights of individuals and groups to actively participate in policy-making and engage in debates about social justice.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tikly|first=Leon|last2=Barrett|first2=Angeline M.|date=2011|title=Social Justice, Capabilities and the Quality of Education in Low Income Countries|url=|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=31 |issue=1|pages=3–14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a participatory justice model, rule makers rely on the participation of affected interests rather than on administrators, politicians, and the general population. This often leads to the redistribution of resources and recognition of those whose voices have historically been excluded, due in part to a lack of financial and educational resources to contribute.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

The Negotiated Rulemaking Act made it a priority to ensure that people most affected by a particular issue, particularly poor people, would be able to take part in the negotiation process; the government provides agency funding to defray costs of participation in rulemaking.&lt;ref name="farrell19912"&gt;"Doing Unto Others: A Proposal for Participatory Justice in Social Security's Representative Payment Program. U. Pitt. L. Rev, 1991, 53, 883.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving marginalized groups the chance to participate in the decision making process can help ensure they participate in the community more generally as well. For example, during the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), disabled peoples organizations (DPOs) were engaged in and consulted during the drafting of a comprehensive program that would enable the disabled to participate in the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural life of the community.&lt;ref name="stein20072"&gt;Stein, M.A., &amp; Lord, J.E. "Jacobus TenBroek, Participatory Justice, and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities." Tex. J. on CL &amp; CR, 2007, 13, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, within the CRPD, states were encouraged to involve DPOs when preparing reports for the body meant to monitor the implementation of the program.&lt;ref name="stein20072" /&gt;

Arguments supporting various participatory justice models in the U.S. have also cited the equal protection clause 14th amendment, protection of individual legal rights, upholding of autonomy, integrationism, and democratic principles in their support.&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt; Participatory justice models are seen as a way to fight against the paternalistic approach of the government in which legislators choose for citizens, without their input.&lt;ref name="stein20072" /&gt;&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt; When affected individuals can participate in the policymaking process, they become viewed as subjects rather than objects.&lt;ref name="stein20072" /&gt;

Consensus rule is more administratively efficient in the long run because it avoids lengthy post-enactment litigation. The legislature or administrative body using the participatory justice model also gains legitimacy, since it implies accountability. Participatory justice models have long been used by environmental justice movements. Often times, participation was originally denied not because of institutional or political failure, but because those in question aren’t recognized as in the domain of justice.&lt;ref name="jamieson20072"&gt;Jaieson, D."The heart of environmentalism." Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Young argues that participatory justice rather than distributive justice was the primary demand of communities like Afton, North Carolina. People objected that they were being subjected to risks and exposure without their consent and without mechanisms to articulate their opposition. The unfortunate reality is that those people who live in countries that will be destroyed first due to rising sea levels will not be included in decisions about when decisions are made.

===Criticisms===

One of the common criticisms of participatory justice models is that they might reduce efficiency, like in the environmental justice model discussed.&lt;ref name="Kaswan20092"&gt;Kaswan, A. "Justice in a Warming World." Environmental Forum, 26(4), 2009, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating the voices of all affected interests is a difficult and long process, especially when the issue being decided upon is significantly controversial.&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaswan20092" /&gt; Another disadvantage is that, even when you have a negotiating body and it does include affected interests, it might be difficult for all interests to be equally represented.&lt;ref name="farrell19912" /&gt; This problem, however, can be fixed by providing those negotiating with negotiation skills, as well as development of relevant information and payment of expenses involved in participation, like in the PJ model employed SSA's representative payment program.  Another disadvantage of using a participatory justice model is the inexperience of those participating. The participants may not have as much respect for the wide number of legal and ethical considerations that need to be made when writing policy proposals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For this reason, some critics argue that policy experts should be able to mediate the conversations on various policies, especially when modern laws are much more complex than those in places like ancient Athens, where laws were inscribed on panels all over the city and set up in the agora.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Qualities ==
[[File:Rammed earth wall surface.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the surface of a rammed-earth wall: apart from the patches of damage, the surface shows regular horizontal lines caused by the wooden [[formwork]] and subtler horizontal strata from successive courses.]]

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

Johnson}}
An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The '''Reichstag''' ("[[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of the Realm"),&lt;ref&gt;Moonis Raza. ''Geographical Dictionary Of The World In The Early 20th Century With Pronouncing Gazetteer (in 2 Vos.)''. New Delhi, India: Concept Publishing Company, 1990. Pp. 712.&lt;/ref&gt; officially the '''Großdeutscher Reichstag''' ("Greater-German Reichstag") after 1938, was the pseudo-[[Parliament]] of the [[Third Reich]] from 1933 to 1945. Following the [[Nazi seizure of power]] and the passing of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], it met only as a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for the actions of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s dictatorship—always by unanimous consent—and to listen to Hitler's speeches. In this purely ceremonial role, the Reichstag convened only 20 times, the last on 26 April 1942. The President of the Reichstag ({{lang-de|Reichstagspräsident}}) throughout this period was [[Hermann Göring]].

During this period, the Reichstag was sometimes derisively referred to by the German public as the "''teuerste Gesangsverein Deutschlands''" (the most expensive singing club in Germany) due to frequent singing of the national anthem during sessions. To avoid holding scheduled elections during [[World War II]], in 1943 Hitler extended the term of office of the current Reichstag (elected in late 1938 to serve in 1939–1943) to serve a special eight-year term ending on 30 January 1947.

==Background==
In 1920–1923 and from 1930 on, the [[Weimar Republic]]'s democratically elected ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' could be circumvented by two legal instruments not provided (as such) by the constitution:
* The use of special powers granted to the [[President of Germany]] under an Emergency Decree in Article 48 of the constitution
* The use of [[Enabling act]]s, especially during 1919–1923 and then finally in [[Enabling Act of 1933|1933]]

The former practice became more and more common after 1930. Due to the Reichstag's complex system of proportional representation, it was extremely difficult for a government to have a stable majority. Frequently, when a Chancellor was voted out of office, his successor could not be assured of a majority.  As a result, Chancellors were forced to use Article 48 simply to conduct the ordinary business of government.

Following the [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February 1933, Hitler used the President's [[Reichstag Fire Decree|Decree for the Protection of People and State]] to suspend human and civic rights and . When [[German federal election, March 1933|elections in March]] did not yield a Nazi majority, Hitler pressured the Reichstag to pass the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which allowed the government — in practice the Chancellor — to enact laws on its own authority for a four-year period.  With certain exceptions (which were in practice disregarded), those laws could deviate from articles in the constitution. Though formally only the Government as a whole could enact laws, Hitler in effect exercised that right by himself.

The Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all deputies from the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party of Germany (KPD)]] and detain several deputies from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (SPD)]]. Several other SPD deputies saw the writing on the wall and fled into exile.  Ultimately, the Enabling Act passed by a margin of 444–94, with only the SPD voting against it. However, the Nazis had intimidated the other parties to the point that even if all 81 KPD deputies and 120 SPD deputies had been present, the Enabling Act would have still passed by more than the two-thirds majority required.

Before the summer was out, all other parties had either been banned or intimidated into closing down, and the Nazi Party was the only legally permitted party in Germany. In the [[German election, November 1933|parliamentary elections of 12 November 1933]], voters were presented with a single list from the Nazi Party under far-from-secret conditions (see below). The list carried with 92.1 percent of the vote. As a measure of the great care Hitler took to give his dictatorship the appearance of legal sanction, the Enabling Act was subsequently renewed by the Reichstag in 1937 and 1941.

The Reichstag only met 12 times between 1933 and 1939, and enacted only four laws—the Law for the Reconstruction of the Reich of 1934 (which turned Germany into a highly centralized state) and the three [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935. All passed unanimously. It would only meet eight more times after the start of the war.

==Building==
{{Main|Reichstag (building)}}
{{Main|Reichstag fire}}
{{Main|Kroll Opera House}}
The actual Reichstag building ({{lang-de|Reichstagsgebäude}}) was unusable after the [[Reichstag fire]], so the [[Kroll Opera House]] was modified into a legislative chamber and served as the location of all parliamentary sessions during the [[Third Reich]]. It was chosen both for its convenient location facing the Reichstag building and for its [[seating capacity]]. The Kroll Opera House was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied bombing]] on November 12, 1943 (coincidentally, the tenth anniversary of the first Nazi Reichstag's election). It was then essentially destroyed in the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945.

==Elections and plebiscites in Nazi Germany ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-15183, Wahlplakat der NSDAP zur Reichstagswahl.jpg|thumb|Election poster for Hindenburg and Hitler in November 1933. It reads: "The Marshall and the Corporal fight with us for peace and equality"]]

It reads: "Do you agree with the reunification of Austria with the German ''Reich'' that was enacted on 13 March 1938, and do you vote for the party of our leader Adolf Hitler?" The large circle is labelled "Yes", the smaller "No".]]
The federal election in March 1933 was the last all-German election prior to World War II that was at least partly free. From then on, while elections were still held, voters were presented with a single list comprising Nazis and "guests" of the party.  These "guests," however, fully supported Hitler.  Elections during this time were not secret; voters were often threatened with severe reprisals if they failed to vote or dared to vote no.  Under the circumstances, the Nazi list carried with well over 90 percent of the vote each time.

Until enactment of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, Jews, Poles and other ethnic minorities still held nominal citizenship rights. Not only were they allowed to vote, but in districts known to have large populations of minorities the Nazis often abstained from engaging in tactics used elsewhere to compel the electorate to vote in favour of the regime. In essence, the Nazis tacitly encouraged minorities to vote against them so that their propaganda could cite the relatively unfavourable results in districts known to have large minority populations as proof of disloyalty to the Reich. Following the enactment of the Nuremberg Laws, Jews and other ethnic minorities were excluded from the electoral process altogether and the number of negative and invalid votes recorded fell dramatically – from more than five million in the referendum held in 1934 to barely half a million in the vote held in 1936.

Special referendums were held, under similar conditions.  The most famous of these was the plebiscite on the [[Anschluss]] with Austria in 1938. That vote officially recorded a 99.7% "yes".&lt;ref name="Austrian Resistance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doew.at/thema/thema_alt/wuv/maerz38_2/propaganda.html|title=Die propagandistische Vorbereitung der Volksabstimmung|publisher=Austrian Resistance Archive|year=1988|accessdate=2007-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404180146/http://www.doew.at/thema/thema_alt/wuv/maerz38_2/propaganda.html|archivedate=2007-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Anschluss, the Reichstag became the ''Großdeutsche Reichstag'' (roughly translated the Greater German Imperial Diet).

In accordance with the provisions of the Weimar Republic electoral law of 1933, one seat was granted for each block of 60,000 votes. Because voter turnout was very high, and also because of new territories added to the Reich, and finally because the voting age was lowered (a compensatory measure adopted prior to the 1936 election to prevent the electorate from shrinking in size as a consequence of the Nuremberg Laws), the Reichstag grew to significantly greater and greater proportions. Finally, there were 855 deputies; Adolf Hitler was No. 433, elected to the Reichstag constituency 24 [[Upper Bavaria]] – [[Swabia]].

*1933, 5 March: [[German federal election, March 1933|General parliamentary elections]] immediately following the Seizure of Power. Six days before the scheduled election date, the German parliament building burned in the [[Reichstag fire]]. Opposition parties were thwarted in their campaigns. The Nazi Party won 33 of the 35 direct seats from parliamentary districts and 43.9% of the overall vote, giving the Nazis together with the [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] (8.0% of the votes) a slight majority of seats.
*1933, 12 November: [[German election, November 1933|Parliamentary elections]] and [[German referendum, 1933|referendum]] on the withdrawal of Germany from the [[League of Nations]]. All Reichstag delegates are now Nazi Party members or sympathizers. According to formal results, 92% of the voters approved the referendum proposal.
*1934, 19 August: [[German referendum, 1934|Special Plebiscite]] to retrospectively approve Adolf Hitler's succession to the office of President, following the death of [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. 88.1% of the voters voted yes.
*1936, 29 March: [[German election and referendum, 1936|General parliamentary elections]] and referendum retrospectively approving the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]]. The election and the Rhineland occupation were combined in a single question.
*1938, 10 April: [[German election and referendum, 1938|General parliamentary elections]] and referendum retrospectively approving the annexation of Austria [[Anschluss]]. Elected to serve for a four-year term beginning in 1939, it convened for the last time in early 1942.
*1938, 4 December: Parliamentary by-election for newly acquired territory of [[Sudetenland]]. Like the previous occasions, the Nazis won all seats in this last election under their rule.

==Last session==
The Großdeutsche Reichstag convened for the last time in the Kroll Opera House on 26 April 1942. It unanimously passed a decree proclaiming Hitler "Supreme Judge of the German People," officially allowing him to override the judiciary and administration in all matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | title=Chancellor Adolf Hitler Receives Additional Power from the Reichstag |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1942/1942-04-26a.htm |work= New York Times | publisher= | publication-place = New York | date = April 27, 1942| access-date= June 1, 2018}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any last remnants of the privileges of the Reichstag's members were removed and the Führer became ''de jure'' the final decision-maker, with the power of life and death over every German citizen. In practice, this merely legitimized a situation that had been in place since 1933. For all intents and purposes, this extended the provisions of the Enabling Act indefinitely.

On 25 January 1943, five days before the expiration of the current Reichstag's term of office, the inauguration of a new body was postponed for another electoral term until 30 January 1947. This was to avoid holding elections while the war was still underway. With the Nazis' defeat in the war, the 1938 elections were the last for the German Reichstag ever, and would be the last all-German elections until the first elections for a reunified Germany in [[German federal election, 1990|1990]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5524">'''Research and Development Capital Allowances''', also known as RDAs, are a tax relief for businesses in the United Kingdom.  They provide a 100 per cent first year [[capital allowance]] for [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) capital expenditure. RDAs are the capital expenditure equivalent to the R&amp;D tax relief scheme.

==History==
RDAs were the new name given to Scientific Research Allowances (which already existed) when the [[R&amp;D]] Tax Credit scheme was launched in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/camanual/ca60100.htm " ca60100"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
R&amp;D Tax Relief only applies to revenue expenditure - generally, costs incurred on day-to-day operations, as opposed to expenditure on capital assets.
However, RDAs allow relief for R&amp;D capital expenditure as a capital allowance. RDAs make it possible to claim 100 per cent of the capital cost against taxable profits in the year the cost is incurred. This can deliver a helpful cash flow boost and a shortened payback period.
A company should consider applying for RDAs if it has:
*constructed or purchased a laboratory, test bed, or pilot plant
*capitalised large amounts of R&amp;D expenditure

If any R&amp;D revenue expenditure is capitalised in a company's accounts, it may still qualify for R&amp;D Tax Relief or it may only qualify under RDAs. The accounts treatment when the asset is recognised on the balance sheet, as opposed to being written-off immediately in the profit and loss account, is not conclusive of whether the expenditure is revenue or capital for tax purposes.
The distinction between revenue and capital expenditure in the context of its R&amp;D tax treatment is critical. HMRC give details on how to distinguish between the two categories on their website&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim35000.htm "revenue V capital expenditure"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in their CIRD manual.&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]],[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD81700.htm "CIRD81700"]&lt;/ref&gt; Further detail can also be found in section 1308 of [[Corporation Tax Act 2009]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Corporation Tax Act 2009|Corporation Tax Act]],[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/4/contents "Section 1308"]&lt;/ref&gt; (which in turn updated section 53 of [[Finance Act]] 2004)&lt;ref&gt;[[Finance Act]],[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/12/contents "Section 53"]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to the revenue treatment of capitalised costs which relate to intangible assets.

==How it works==
RDAs are available for expenditure of a capital nature on R&amp;D related to a company’s trade, e.g.:
*laboratories,
*other research facilities,
*research equipment,
*company cars used by people undertaking the R&amp;D, and
*a new IT system for internal use in the R&amp;D facility etc. etc.

So, unlike for R&amp;D Tax Relief where only certain categories of expenditure can be claimed, RDAs are available on most expenditure incurred for the carrying out of, or provision of facilities for, R&amp;D (except land and the cost of acquiring intellectual property). This includes building or premises assets which would not otherwise qualify for alternative forms of capital allowances (such as the Annual Investment Allowance).

This means that where a company acquires or builds property with the intention of using the property for the purposes of carrying on qualifying research and development, then most, if not all, of the expenditure involved will qualify for a 100 per cent capital allowance in the accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred.

==Other technology tax reliefs==

*[[Research and Development Expenditure Credit|Research &amp; Development Expenditure Credit]]
*[[Patent Box]]
*[[Creative Sector Tax Relief]]s including Video Games Tax Relief, Animation Tax Relief, High-End TV Production Tax Relief, and Film Tax Relief
The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

==Government working group==
There is no formal government working group for RDAs. There is however a formal working group for R&amp;D Tax Relief to assist and develop government thinking on R&amp;D tax initiatives. Members of this Working Group include representatives from: [[HMRC]] and [[HM Treasury]]; industry; the financial services community including large accounting firms ([[PWC]]; [[Deloitte]]; [[KPMG]]; [[Ernst and Young]]) and independent consultants (MMP Tax); and representatives from professional bodies.

:''For the similarly named television station that formerly aired in Canada, see [[The Score Television Network]].''

'''SCORE''' was the weekend sports service of the [[Financial News Network]] which aired sports-themed programming starting in 1985. It was renamed FNN Sports in 1990 when FNN decided to go with a 24-hour feed on weekdays. SCORE was forced to dissolve after [[CNBC]] bought out FNN in 1991.

SCORE used a sports ticker or crawl to update scores at the bottom of the screen. As it was a co-venture with FNN, a stock ticker was often shown across the bottom of the screen. SCORE provided scores and highlight updates every half-hour.

==Programming==
SCORE had several shows that were televised versions of what [[sports talk]] radio is today.  SCORE featured some professional sporting events, live call-in shows, and sports news shows.  Live sporting events included [[professional wrestling]], [[Major Soccer League|MISL]] [[soccer]], [[college basketball]], the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] and [[boxing]].  It also broadcast a couple [[NASCAR]] races in [[1988 in NASCAR|1988]] that were originally slated for [[Special Events Television Network|SETN]] before it folded.

It also showed at least two games of the 1986 [[National Invitation Tournament]].

===Call-in shows, including Time Out for Trivia===
Its most popular show was ''Time Out for Trivia'', hosted by [[Todd Donoho]] and produced by Eric Corwin. ''Time Out For Trivia'' was the first national live interactive game show in which viewers phoned in and if they correctly answered a question, they'd win a prize. One of the most popular prizes on the show was the [[Dirt Devil]] [[vacuum cleaner]] which often included a funny sound effect like an "ooooh" or an "oooooh.... aaaaaah." Humor was almost always an ingredient, particularly in the multiple-choice questions, which often included an obvious nonsports figure as one of the possible answers. 

''Time Out For Trivia'' became a cult hit on cable TV, receiving many glowing reviews in newspapers and magazines. Gary Nuhn, a columnist for the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'', has called TOFT "cable TV at its best," and Wendell Barnhouse, radio/TV columnist for the ''[[Star-Telegram|Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', says it is "one of life's joys." ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' did a feature about ''TOFT'' in its famous swimsuit issue.[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067034/index.htm] Donoho and Corwin did over 1,000 shows together, including a 1,000th show "special edition", a one-hour program which featured highlights from the first 999 shows. Donoho and Corwin worked together on ''TOFT'' and other shows at FNN/SCORE from 1985 through 1989 before joining the sports department at [[KABC-TV|KABC]].  Much of this show was incorporated into a show on KABC called ''Monday Night Live'', which aired after ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from {{nfly|1990}} to {{nfly|1999}}, when Donoho's contract was not renewed by KABC.  The show was then renamed ''Sports Zone'' with host Rob Fukuzaki and it remained an ''MNF'' postgame show until the package left ABC after the 2005 season.  ''Sports Zone'' remains on KABC, following many events televised by the network.

Other call-in shows included ''The Fan Speaks Out'', ''The Final Score'', and ''The Sports Collector''.

===News programs===
News shows featured included ''Tennis Talk'', a baseball program called ''The Hot Stove League'', and a sports wagering program with [[Wayne Root]]. Other hosts included [[Bill Brown (broadcaster)|Bill Brown]], [[Byron Day]], John Loesing, Hugh Malay and Fred Wallin. Many of the shows were directed by Brad Toberman. Show producers included Jim Battey, Michael Pierce, Steven Herbert, Gary Kubik, Hugh Malay, Eric Corwin and Steven Friedman.

===Professional wrestling===
The professional wrestling programming exposed fans throughout the country to regional territory wrestling promotions. These territories included the [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic]] with [[Ric Flair]] and Chief [[Wahoo McDaniel]], [[Continental Wrestling Federation|Memphis]] with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry 'the King' Lawler]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling|Texas]] with the Von Erichs and the Maivia family's [[Hawaii]] promotion with [[Rocky Johnson]], [[King Curtis]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Lawrence Heinemi|Lars Anderson]], [[Superfly Snuka]], [[Bruiser Brody]] and many [[Japan]]ese wrestlers.  It also prominently featured wrestling from the [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Continental Wrestling Federation]] including matches featuring [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]], [[Tom Prichard]], and [[Tony Anthony (wrestler) | The Dirty White Boy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13154">'''Sections 4 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998''' are provisions that enable the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] to take effect in the United Kingdom. Section 4 allows courts to issue a [[declaration of incompatibility]] where it is impossible to use [[Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998|section 3]] to interpret [[primary legislation|primary]] or [[subordinate legislation|subordinate]] legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], which are also part of the Human Rights Act. In these cases, interpretation to comply may conflict with [[legislative supremacy|legislative intent]]. It is considered a measure of last resort. A range of [[superior court]]s can issue a declaration of incompatibility.

A declaration of incompatibility is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made, nor can a declaration invalidate  legislation. Section 4 therefore achieves its aim through political rather than legal means, including through Section 10 which allows the government to amend legislation without full legislative approval. A remedial order can only be made after a declaration of incompatibility or a similar finding of a European court with all appeals must have been complete or expressly renounced. Parliament has used Section 10 to make small adjustments where possible to bring legislation into line with Convention rights although entirely new pieces of legislation are sometimes necessary.

== Context ==
[[Human rights]] are rights taken to be universal, of considerable importance, and relate to the individual and not collectively;&lt;ref name="hoffman10"/&gt; among other things, they can grant freedoms, claims, immunities and powers.&lt;ref name="hoffman10"/&gt; The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was drawn up in the wake of the [[Second World War]] to uphold such rights.&lt;ref name="lester59"/&gt; The United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1951, and accepted the right of individual petition to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], [[Strasbourg]], in 1966.&lt;ref name="lester59"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] made most Convention rights directly enforceable in a British court for the first time.&lt;ref name="bradley432"/&gt; Excluded are Articles 1 and 13, which the government argued were fulfilled by the Act itself, and therefore were not relevant to rights enforced under it.&lt;ref name="bradley433434"/&gt; The Human Rights Act has had a considerable effect on British law, and remains an Act of "fundamental constitutional importance".&lt;ref name="lester59"/&gt;

== Provisions ==

Section 4 allows a court to make a "declaration of incompatibility" if it is "satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right".&lt;ref name="section4"/&gt; [[Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998|Section 3]] requires that courts interpret legislation as compatible with Convention rights wherever possible.&lt;ref name="section3"/&gt; [[Lord Steyn]] has described a declaration of incompatibility was a "measure of last resort".&lt;ref name="ghaidan"/&gt; However, ''In re S'' {{clarify|date=November 2016}} established that there may be cases where interpretation can go too far; that the court can assume an administrative power it would not ordinarily have, with practical consequences that it is not best placed to consider: "a meaning which departs substantially from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament is likely to have crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment."&lt;ref name="inres"/&gt; The "thrust" of a statute is important; going against the "thrust" requires legislative power that the courts do not have.&lt;ref name="hoffman60"/&gt; As in ''R (Anderson) v Home Secretary'', a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Act may be the only appropriate [[remedy (law)|remedy]].&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;

The United Kingdom recognises [[parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="hoffman42"/&gt; The legislature is above the courts, and the courts cannot therefore declare legislation invalid. Section 4 reflects this, and states that courts must continue to apply legislation, even if incompatible with Convention rights.&lt;ref name="hoffman64"/&gt; Section 4(6)(a) notes that a declaration of incompatibility "does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it is given",&lt;ref name="section4"/&gt; which is similar to Section 3(2)(b).&lt;ref name="section3"/&gt; ''R v Lyons'' confirmed that evidence could be used, even where incompatible with Convention rights, if it was expressly allowed under statute.&lt;ref name="lyons"/&gt; A declaration of incompatibility is merely a flag that alerts Parliament that people's human rights are being infringed.&lt;ref name="hoffman64"/&gt; Accordingly, it has no more legal effect than the fact of incompatible.&lt;ref name="hoffman65"/&gt;

Section 4(4) allows the court to issue a declaration of incompatibility if altering secondary legislation is impossible because it would necessarily conflict with a statute. Following amendment by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], the [[Armed Forces Act 2006]] and the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]], courts which are entitled to issue a declaration of incompatibility are the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], the [[Courts Martial Appeal Court]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and [[Court of Appeal]] ([[Judiciary of England and Wales|England and Wales]] and [[Judiciary of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]),  and the [[High Court of Justiciary]] ([[Scottish law|Scotland)]]) and [[Court of Protection]] in particular roles.&lt;ref name="section4"/&gt;

== Application and section 10 ==

In ''A v Home Secretary'', the detention of [[foreign national]]s under the [[Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was ruled to be in contravention of Article 14 of the Convention. They could be detained in circumstances British nationals could not, discriminating on the grounds of nationality. This discrimination was explicit and could not be interpreted to follow the Convention using Section 3. Accordingly, a declaration of incompatibility was made.&lt;ref name="hoffman64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avhomesecretary"/&gt; In ''Bellinger v Bellinger'', the court followed a European case, ''Goodwin v United Kingdom'', in deciding that the failure to allow persons who had undergone [[gender reassignment]] to marry under the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] was incompatible with [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] of the Convention. Altering this would involve a "fundamental change in the traditional concept of marriage", which was the domain of the legislature and not the courts; accordingly, a declaration of incompatibility was issued.&lt;ref name="hoffman65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bellinger"/&gt;  In  ''R (Anderson) v Home Secretary'', the court found that assigning the decision over the tariff of a mandatory life sentence to the [[Home Secretary]] was in breach of [[Article 6 of the ECHR|Article 6]] of the Convention &amp;ndash; however, he was explicitly given it under the statute, and it could not be removed merely by interpretation.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoffman65"/&gt;

Under Section 4(6)(b), a declaration of incompatibility is not even "binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made".&lt;ref name="section4"/&gt; Since a declaration cannot invalidate or disapply legislation, it achieves its aim through political rather than legal means&amp;ndash; it is for Parliament to correct the law, or continue to be in contravention of the Convention.&lt;ref name="hoffman65"/&gt; Section 10 provides one route for correction:  "If a Minister of the Crown considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section, he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility" (section 10(2)).&lt;ref name="section10"/&gt; It is designed to be a quick method; although it must be put before parliament, a remedial order does not require full legislative approval. This summary process was controversial, as it ignored the possibility for debate. However, the time required for this could not be provided in reality.&lt;ref name="hoffman65"/&gt; In any case, approval is still required before the order comes into force, or, in the case of urgent legislation, within 120 days of it coming into force.&lt;ref name="schedule2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hoffman6566"/&gt; A remedial order can only be made after a declaration of incompatibility or a similar finding of a European court, which will have been justified and discussed before being made. Under Section 10(1), all appeals must have been complete or expressly renounced.&lt;ref name="hoffman66"/&gt;

Parliament has used Section 10 to make small adjustments where possible to bring legislation into line with Convention rights. In the ''Anderson'' and ''Bellinger'' cases, entirely new pieces of legislation were drafted and passed in the normal process, since they changed the law more considerably than the Section 10 process would allow.&lt;ref name="hoffman66"/&gt;

''Simpson v Attorney General'' [''Baigent's case''] [1994] 3 NZLR 667 is a leading case in New Zealand regarding the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]], that upheld damages against the police for an unreasonable search.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |isbn=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case involved police who had been legally issued a search warrant relating to a drug bust but executed the warrant at the wrong address. Despite knowing the address was incorrect, the police continued to search the property. The family of the person who had been wrongfully searched sued the Crown arguing breaches of section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure. Previously, no case had awarded damages for breaches of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and there was no mention of damages in the legislation itself. The Crown argued that they had immunity from prosecution or alternatively that if they did not have immunity, the plaintiffs were not entitled to any remedy other than a declaration of non-compliance with the Bill of Rights. The Court of Appeal felt that a mere declaration would be "toothless" and subsequently awarded damages. 

The decision is significant for multiple reasons. It allows plaintiffs to initiate a cause of action for breaches of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, a previously unavailable remedy. Where a plaintiff has an existing cause of action but feels the remedy is insufficient, they are also able to sue under this ground additionally. 

The case was criticised as representing an example of judicial activism, and that Parliament did not intend to offer financial compensation for breaches of the act. This was particularly true because in New Zealand, the act is not entrenched nor does it achieve the status of "Supreme Law" like similar nations have in their constitutions. However, following the decision, the Law Commission advised Parliament not to overrule the decision, and Parliament has since followed this advice.

==Background==
Detective Murray Robert Drummond was advised by an informant that a Troy O'Brien was involved in the use and sale of cannabis at his residence of 16 Main Road, [[Korokoro, New Zealand|Korokoro]], [[Lower Hutt]]. While he was preparing his application for a search warrant, he discovered that there was no "Main street" in Korokoro. Further inquiries suggested the address was either 16 London Street, or 16 Korokoro Road. The detective then asked the local power company about whether Troy O'Brien was the account holder for either, and the power company erroneously informed the police that Troy O'Brien was the account holder for both addresses.

For unknown reasons, the detective then filed for a search warrant for only 16 London Street, which later turned out to be the address of Elisabeth Simpson, and not Troy O'Brien as intended.

On 18 October 1991, the police arrived at the London Street address to execute the search warrant. Upon arrival in the street, the police told any suspicious neighbours to "mind their own business", but then later relented and asked the neighbours whether Baigent lived at this address, and were not only told that Troy O'Brien did not reside at this address, but that the address they were looking for was 16 Korokoro Road.

The search warrant continued, and they talked to Baigent's son, who informed them they had the wrong address, and even showed them his passport to prove his identity. When this had no effect, he got his sister on the telephone, who was a solicitor. She spoke to the police there, told them she was an officer of the High Court, and advised them that they had the wrong address.

The police replied "We often get the wrong (address), but while we are here we will have a look around anyway", and the police proceeded with the search, despite clearly having doubts of the address being incorrect.

Baigent claimed this was an unreasonable search, which is illegal under section 21 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act (1990)]], and sued the Attorney General (on behalf of the police). The police argued that the search was backed by a court issued search warrant, and that even if the search was a breach of the Bill of Rights Act, the Act made no reference to the entitlement of damages, adding that the police had immunity for damages under section 6(5) of the Crown Proceedings Act [1956] anyway.

At first instance, the AG managed to have Baigent's claim struck out.

==Decision==

In Attorney General v Chapman, in a 3 to 2 decision, the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] restricted the application of damages to only acts done by the executive or legislative branches, thereby excluding damages for breaches by the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzhumanrightsblog.com/newzealand/case-note-on-simpson-v-attorney-general-baigents-case/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224215142/http://nzhumanrightsblog.com/newzealand/case-note-on-simpson-v-attorney-general-baigents-case/|archivedate=24 February 2015|title=Case note on Simpson v Attorney-General (Baigent’s Case)|first=Sam|last=Yoon|date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}

'''Sociedad anónima deportiva''' ("Public limited sports company") is a special type of [[public limited company]] in [[Spain]]. The new legal status was introduced in 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/asociaciones/6SAD/ (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; to improve financial management and transparency in sports clubs. Many Spanish [[Association football|football]] and [[basketball]] clubs add the suffix '''S.A.D.''' to the end of their official name, e.g. [[Atlético Madrid|Club Atlético de Madrid, S.A.D.]].

Every club which plays in [[Segunda División]] or [[Liga ACB]] and remains in the league is obliged to convert to S.A.D. status.

For historical reasons, [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] were allowed to retain their status as non-commercial sports associations.

The '''Stock-Raising Homestead Act''' of 1916 provided settlers {{convert|640|acre}} of [[public land]]&amp;mdash;a full [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] or its equivalent&amp;mdash;for [[ranch]]ing purposes.  Unlike the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862 or the [[Homestead Acts|Enlarged Homestead Act]] of 1909, land homesteaded under the 1916 act separated surface rights from subsurface rights, resulting in what later became known as [[split estate]]s.&lt;ref name="blm06"&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/MINERALS__REALTY__AND_RESOURCE_PROTECTION_/bmps.Par.41235.File.dat/Split%20Estate%20Presentation%202006.pdf Split EstatePrivate Surface / Public Minerals: What Does it Mean to You?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030133121/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/MINERALS__REALTY__AND_RESOURCE_PROTECTION_/bmps.Par.41235.File.dat/Split%20Estate%20Presentation%202006.pdf |date=2012-10-30 }}, a 2006 [[Bureau of Land Management]] presentation&lt;/ref&gt;  The subsurface rights, also known as [[mineral rights]], are the foundation of recent [[oil and gas law in the United States]].&lt;ref name="blm06"/&gt;

Under the act no cultivation of lands was required, but some [[Rangeland|range]] improvements were mandated as necessary.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

By 2006, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and subsequent legislation and other legal changes resulted in the federal government administering the subsurface rights to about {{convert|700000000|acre}} of land, {{convert|58000000|acre}} of which have surface rights owned privately or by a [[U.S. state]].&lt;ref name="blm06"/&gt;

==Text of the Stock-Raising Act==
{{Copy section to Wikisource}}

CHAP. 9. --An Act To provide for stock-raising homesteads, and for other purposes.

''Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,'' That from and after the passage of this Act it shall be lawful for any person qualified to make entry under the homestead laws of the United States to make a stock-raising homestead entry for not exceeding six hundred and forty acres of unappropriated unreserved public land in reasonably compact form: ''Provided, however,'' That the land so entered shall theretofore have been designated by the Secretary of the Interior as "stock-raising lands."

SEC. 2. That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, on application or otherwise, to designate as stock-raising lands subject to entry under this Act lands the surface of which is, in his opinion, chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops, do not contain merchantable timber, are not susceptible of irrigation from any known source of water supply, and are of such character that six hundred and forty acres are reasonably required for the support of a family: ''Provided,'' That where any person qualified to make original or additional entry under the provisions of this Act shall make application to enter any unappropriated public land which has not been designated as subject to entry (provided said application is accompanied and supported by properly corroborated affidavit of the applicant, in duplicate, showing prima facie that the land applied for is of the character contemplated by this Act), such application, together with the regular fees and commissions shall be received by the register and receiver of the land district in which said land is located and suspended until it shall have been determined by the Secretary of the Interior whether said land is actually of that character. That during such suspension the land described in the application shall not be disposed of; and if the said land shall be designated under this Act, then such application shall be allowed; otherwise it shall be rejected, subject to appeal; but no right to occupy such lands shall be acquired by reason of said application until said lands have been designated as stock-raising lands.

SEC. 3.

==Repeal of Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916==
Sections 291, 300, and 302 were repealed by the enactment of the [[Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976]].

==Amendment to Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916==
Section 299 was amended by the enactment of Public Law 103-23 pertaining to the reservation of coal and mineral rights on April 16, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-107/pdf/STATUTE-107-Pg60.pdf |title=Stock-Raising Homestead Act Amendment ~ P.L. 103-23 |date=April 16, 1993 |series=107 Stat. 60 ~ House Bill 239 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/239 |title=H.R. 239 ~ Stock-Raising Homestead Act Amendment |date=January 5, 1993 |series=P.L. 103-23 ~ 107 Stat. 60 |publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal document referred to as the [[broad form deed]] previously severed property into surface and mineral rights. The amendment signed in 1993 required coal and mining companies to do four different things: notify the land owners with a written letter of intent before beginning mining, make a plan that included minimal damages to the land, obtain a letter of consent from the surface owner, and give the land owners a letter promising complete reclamation and compensation.

[[File:Demis-kurils-russian names.png|thumb|Border changes in the [[Kurils]]]]

The '''{{nihongo|Treaty of Saint Petersburg|樺太・千島交換条約|Karafuto-Chishima Kōkan Jōyaku}}''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]:Петербургский договор) between the [[Empire of Japan]] and [[Russian Empire|Empire of Russia]]  was signed on 7 May 1875, and its ratifications exchanged at Tokyo on 22 August 1875.

Its terms stipulated that Japan cedes to Russia the part of [[Sakhalin]] island it then owned in exchange for the group of the [[Kuril Islands]] owned by Russia (between Iturup island and the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific |author= G.

ISSN 1164-5857.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Sakhalin island as a whole became Russian territory, and the entire Kuril archipelago Japanese territory.

The authentic text of the Treaty is written in French. Differences with its Japanese translation contributed to the controversy on what constitutes the Kuril islands, to which Japan renounced in 1951 by the Treaty of San Francisco.

The [[Treaty of Shimoda]] of 1855 had defined the border between Japan and Russia to be the strait between [[Iturup|Iturup (Etorofu)]] and [[Urup|Urup (Uruppu)]] islands in the Kurile chain, but had left the status of [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin (Karafuto)]] open. Without well-defined borders, incidents between Russian and Japanese settlers began to occur. In order to remedy this situation the Japanese government sent an ambassador, [[Enomoto Takeaki]], to [[Saint Petersburg]] to clearly define the border in this area. After a year of negotiations, Japan agreed to renounce its claims to Sakhalin, with compensation for Japanese residents, access by the fishing fleet to the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], ten-years free use of Russian ports in the area and ownership of all of the Kuril Islands.

In [[macroeconomics]], the '''twin deficits hypothesis''' or the '''twin deficits phenomenon''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Stephen M.|last2=Russek|first2=Frank S.|title=Are the Twin Deficits Really Related?|journal=Contemporary Economic Policy|date=1 October 1989|volume=7|issue=4|pages=91–115|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.1989.tb00577.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7287.1989.tb00577.x/full|accessdate=17 February 2018|language=en|issn=1465-7287}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the proposition that there is a strong causal link between a nation's [[government budget balance]] and its [[current account balance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2005/july/understanding-the-twin-deficits-new-approaches-new-results/ FRBSF Economic Letter ''Understanding the Twin Deficits: New Approaches, New Results''], Michele Cavallo, July 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Standard macroeconomic theory points to how a budget deficit can be a contributing factor to a current account deficit. This link can be seen from considering the [[national accounting]] model of the economy:

:&lt;math&gt;Y=C+I+G+(X-M),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Y'' represents national income or GDP, ''C'' is consumption, ''I'' is investment, ''G'' is government spending and ''X–M'' stands for net exports.  This represents GDP because all the production in an economy (the left hand side of the equation) is used as consumption (''C''), investment (''I''), government spending (''G''), and goods that are exported in excess of imports (''NX'').  Another equation defining GDP using alternative terms (which in theory results in the same value{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}) is

:&lt;math&gt;Y=C+S+T,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Y'' is again GDP, ''C'' is consumption, ''S'' is saving, and ''T'' is taxes. This is because national income is also equal to output, and all individual income either goes to pay for consumption (''C''), to pay taxes (''T''), or is saved (''S'').

==Proof==

Since
&lt;math&gt;Y=C+I+G+NX&lt;/math&gt;, and
 
&lt;math&gt;Y-C-T=S&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;S=G-T+NX+I&lt;/math&gt;, which simplifies to the [[sectoral balances]] [[accounting identity|identity]]

&lt;math&gt;(S-I)+(T-G)=(NX)&lt;/math&gt;

If (T-G) is negative, we have a [[budget deficit]].

Now, assume an economy already at potential output, meaning Y is fixed. In this case, if the deficit increases, and saving remains the same, then this last equation implies that either investment (I) must fall (see [[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]), or net exports (NX) must fall, causing a trade deficit.  Hence, a budget deficit can also lead to a trade deficit, causing a twin deficit.

Though the economics behind which of the two is used to finance the government deficit can get more complicated than what is shown above, the essence of it is that if foreigners' savings pay for the budget deficit, the current account deficit grows.&lt;ref&gt;http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/24149/1/MPRA_paper_24149.pdf "Twin deficits and the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle: a comparison of the EU member states and candidate countries"&lt;/ref&gt; If the country's own citizens' savings finance the borrowing, it may cause a crowding out effect (in an economy at or near potential output, or full employment).

==Example==
In the US, the budget deficit is financed about half from foreigners, half domestically.  Therefore, with an additional $400 billion deficit, the trade deficit would, according to the theory, be increased by some $200 billion.

[[Image:TwinE.PNG|thumb|"Double deficit" in the USA. Fiscal balance (black) and current account balance (red). Source: ameco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu.int/comm/economy_finance/indicators/annual_macro_economic_database/ameco_contents.htm Ameco-data base November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An [[Economic system|economy]] is deemed to have a double deficit if it has a [[current account]] deficit ''and'' a [[Government budget deficit|fiscal deficit]]. In effect, the economy is borrowing from foreigners in exchange for foreign-made goods.  Traditional [[macroeconomics]] predicts that persistent double deficits will lead to currency [[devaluation]]/[[depreciation]] that can be severe and sudden.

In the case of the United States, the twin deficit graph as a percentage of GDP shows that the budget and current account deficits did move broadly in sync from 1981 until the early 1990s, but since then, they have moved apart. Data thus confirm that as a government budget deficit widens, the current account falls, but the relationship is complicated by what happens to investment and private saving.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;CA(NX) = (private)S - I + (T-G)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Current Account = (Private Savings - Investment) + (Tax - Government Expenditure)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Above the equation, it's verifiable that CA will deteriorate as government expenditure exceeds the amount of tax is collected.

One way to understand this process intuitively is by thinking through two different markets.  First consider the Foreign Exchange market.  At equilibrium the quantity supplied=the quantity demanded.  Thus, Imports + Capital outflow=Exports + Capital Inflow.  Rearranging this equation we find that Imports-Exports=Capital Inflow-Capital Outflow.  Because Imports-Exports=Trade Deficit and Capital Inflow-Capital Outflow=Net Capital Inflow, we get the equation Trade Deficit=Net Capital Inflow (or Current Account deficit = Capital Account Surplus).

Next we must consider the market for loanable funds.  The equilibrium here is Savings+Net Capital Inflow=Investment+Budget Deficit.  However, taking the Forex market into consideration we know that the Trade Deficit is equal to Net Capital Inflow. We can thus substitute for:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Savings + Trade Deficit = Investment + Budget Deficit.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Rearranging algebraically we find that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Budget Deficit = Savings + Trade Deficit - Investment.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

What we can gather from this is the understanding of why an increased budget deficit goes up and down in tandem with the Trade Deficit.  This is where we derive the appellation the Twin Deficits: if the US budget deficit goes up then either household savings must go up, the trade deficit must go up, or private investment will decrease.

The '''Tzelepides''' were officials of the [[Ottoman state]] who collected the tzelepiko tax (resm-iagnam-Icelebkeşan) on large scale livestock breeders.

The Ottoman government created this tax to help cover its needs in certain [[livestock]] products.  Its  payment in kind and its collection exclusively by the state led to the establishment of a special mechanism for its administration. The [[tax collectors]] were called "tzelepides" (celep). The need for a flexible state agency, that will oversee the supply and prompt delivery of the required animals for consumption, gradually involves the livestock breeding populations in the mechanism for the collection of the tax. Through this process they are turned into one of the empire’s productive forces, while the capacity of a tzelepis is slowly identified with livestock owners who have undertaken the task to supply the state with livestock products. This upgraded relationship with the state provides them with the privilege to access or intervene in the state mechanisms, which in turn maintains or even instigates their pursuitof a stronger economic presence. This is realized when livestock breeding develops into a broader commercial activity. This way these “state sheepherders” sell part of their production on the [[free market]], thus achieving greater profits and greater economic power.

An '''ukase''', or  '''ukaz''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|k|eɪ|s}};{{sfn|OED staff|1989}} ''{{lang-ru|указ}}'' {{IPA-ru|ʊˈkas|}}, formally "imposition"), in [[Imperial Russia]], was a proclamation of the [[tsar]], government,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} or a religious leader ([[patriarch]]) that had the force of law. "[[Edict]]" and "[[decree]]" are adequate translations using the terminology and concepts of [[Roman law]].

From the Russian term, the word ''ukase'' has entered the English language with the meaning of "any proclamation or decree; an order or regulation of a final or arbitrary nature".{{sfn|OED staff|1989}}

==History==
Prior to the 1917 [[Russian Revolution of 1917|October Revolution]], the term applied in Russia to an edict or ordinance, legislative or administrative, having the force of law. A ukase proceeded either from the emperor or from the senate, which had the power of issuing such ordinances for the purpose of carrying out existing decrees. All such decrees were promulgated by the senate. A difference was drawn between the ukase signed by the emperor’s hand and his verbal ukase, or order, made upon a report submitted to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ukaz|volume=27|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Revolution, a government proclamation of wide meaning was called a "[[Soviet Decree|decree]]" (Russian: декрет, dekret); more specific proclamations were called ''ukaz''. Both terms are usually translated as "decree".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Executive Order of the President of Russia ==
{{main|Decree of the President of Russia}}
According to the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Federation's 1993 constitution]], an ''ukaz'' is a [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential decree]]. The English term "Executive Order" is also used by the official website as an equivalent of the Russian ''ukaz''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://kremlin.ru/acts/17275 in Russian], [http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/4833 in English]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[normative legal act]]s, such ''ukazes'' have a status of [[by-law]] in the hierarchy of legal acts (along with a [[Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation]], instructions and directions of other officials). Presidential decrees may not alter the regulations of existing legal sources - [[:Category:Treaties of Russia|Russia's international agreements]], the [[Constitution of Russia]], [[Federal Constitutional Law (Russia)|Federal Constitutional Law]]s, [[Federal Law]]s and [[laws of Russian regions]] - and may be superseded by any of these laws. For example, thanks to Article 15 of the Constitution of Russia, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], as an international document, has higher status than any Russian law or presidential executive order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.constitution.kremlin.ru/#article-15-4 "Universally recognized principles and norms of international law as well as international agreements of the Russian Federation should be an integral part of its legal system. If an international agreement of the Russian Federation establishes rules, which differ from those stipulated by law, ''then the rules of the international agreement shall be applied''."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruhuna University [[Library]] System is centred in the main library at the Wellamadama main campus and comprises nearly four other libraries holding over 200,000 [[Volume (bibliography)|volumes]].

==History==
The idea of a University of Ruhuna was proposed by the Cabinet Minister of Education &amp; Higher Education at the time Dr. [[Nissanka Wijeyeratne]].&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;[http://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2006/12/10/imp06.asp Saga of Nilame and Kumarihamy by Lakmal Welabada]. ''Sunday Observer'' (Sri Lanka), Retrieved on 10 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=42710   A Diverse, Colourful Life]. Island (Sri Lanka), Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=2016/01/07/features/illustrious-statesman AN ILLUSTRIOUS STATESMAN]. Daily News, Retrieved on 7 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruhuna University was opened on 1 September 1978, fulfilling a desire of the people of the south to have a university in the region. It was housed in the Technical College buildings at Meddawatte, Matara with about 40 academics, 50 non-academics, and 275 students.
 
===Inauguration of University college===
The enactment of the Universities Act No. 46 of 1978 enabled the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] to establish the Ruhuna University College. As a result, on 27 August 1978, the [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister]] [[J. R. Jayawardene]] declared open the Ruhuna University College at Meddawatta, Matara, with Prof. Mervyn W. Thenabadu as its Director.

=== Campus to University status ===
The Ruhuna University College was shifted to the new premises in 1984 following which it was elevated to full university status.The new location was selected for the main campus at Wellamadama, two kilometers from Matara facing Matara-Kataragama main road. Professor [[G. P. Samarawickrama]] was the first [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the University. Hon. [[Ronnie De Mel]], inaugurating the University after being elevated from [[campus]] to [[University]] status in 1984.
During the past 25 years, it has witnessed considerable progress and development in the academic, research and outreach spheres with substantial improvement in intellectual and infrastructure resources and has emerged as a leader of higher education in Sri Lanka.
To date, it has produced about 50,000 graduates and over 75 postgraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ugc.ac.lk/downloads/statistics/stat_2015/Chapter%202.pdf |title=University Admission|publisher=University Grants Commission|format=PDF |access-date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 100 postgraduate students are pursuing master and doctoral programs in disciplines that are of relevance to the development of the region in particular and the country in general.

==Governance and administration==

The University of Ruhuna is a [[public university|state university]] and depends on the government for much of its annual grant, which is provided by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC). Due to this, its administration is heavily influenced by the UGC. Undergraduate education is completely free. The Governance of the university is under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985 along with its own by-laws.

The university's administration is based upon that of the former [[University of Ceylon]] consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the Council (formally known as the [[University Court]] which is the governing body) and the [[Academic Senate]] (academic affairs).

Much of the appointments to officers and faculty are carried out by these bodies, however on the recommendations of the UGC.

===Officers of the university===
;[[Chancellor]]
The [[Chancellor]] is the head of the university and awards all [[academic degree|degrees]], although most duties are carried out by the Vice-Chancellor. The appointment is made by the [[President of Sri Lanka]], to a distinguished person in academics, clergy or in the civil society. The chancellor is Rajakeeya Panditha Pallaththara Sri Sumanajothi Nahimi [[Thero]].

;[[Vice-Chancellor]]
Day-to-day management of the University is undertaken by the [[Chancellor (education)#Vice Chancellor|Vice-Chancellor]], appointed by the [[President of Sri Lanka]]. The current Vice-Chancellor is Gamini Senanayake.

Edward Reed &amp; Beg Company designed the buildings and the [[Ballast Nedam]] Company of the Netherlands completed the construction at all three sites: Wellamadama, Mapalana, and Karapitiya with a unique architectural landscape.

The 30-hectare site straddled three steep hills, the westernmost overlooking the sea and separated from the other two by a low-lying valley that carried the main road from Matara to Hambantota.Architects placed the vice-chancellor's lodge and a guest house on the western hill and flooded the intervening valley to create a buffer between the road and the main campus. He then wrapped the buildings of the science faculty around the northern hill and those of the arts faculty around the southern hill, using the depression between them for the library and other central facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, David. 2002.

{{wide image|Ruhuna3.jpg|500px|align-cap=center|University Complex, Wellamadama}}

===University Complex===
After Peradeniya, which was selected for the beauty of its surrounding, Ruhuna university was the only other campus built with similar ambition.Located in the south of the island, this was the second university complex since the [[University of Ceylon]], to be designed on the same lavish scale and style.

===Geoffery Bawa's architecture for Ruhuna===
In Geoffery Bawa's architecture, the central role of geography must be a highlight.The buildings as they are conceived are influenced by the "character of the natural terrain, the vegetation, the potential for developing vistas out into the landscape and hence light and shade and of course the related and ever-present aspect of climate".In the Ruhuna campus construction are intimately tied to the topography and the territory they occupy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickaramasinghe |first=N.|title=University Space and Values Three Essays|publisher=International Center for Ethnic Studies Colombo Sri Lanka|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Venezuelan [[labour law]], the ''Ley del Trabajo'', was enacted on 23 July 1928, and the second on 16 July 1936. This second ''Ley del Trabajo'' was amended repeatedly (1945, 1947, 1966, 1974, 1975 and 1983) before being replaced in 1991 by the ''Ley Orgánica del Trabajo'' of 1 May 1991. This was reformed on 19 June 1997.&lt;ref name=lottt&gt;{{es}} lottt.gob.ve, [http://www.lottt.gob.ve/ley-del-trabajo/exposicion-motivos/ EXPOSICION DE MOTIVOS: Ley Orgánica del Trabajo, los Trabajadores y las Trabajadoras], accessed 3 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the new [[Constitution of Venezuela]] covered labour rights (e.g. Article 92). In May 2012 a long-discussed reform was enacted, as the ''Ley Orgánica del Trabajo, los Trabajadores y las Trabajadoras'';&lt;ref name=lottt/&gt; this came into effect on 7 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 1 May 2013, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/8973 Large May Day Marches in Venezuela as Workers’ Law Comes into Effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations''' of 1961 is an international [[treaty]] that defines a framework for diplomatic relations between independent countries. It specifies the privileges of a [[diplomatic mission]] that enable diplomats to perform their function without fear of coercion or harassment by the host country. This forms the legal basis for [[diplomatic immunity]]. Its articles are considered a cornerstone of modern international relations. As of October 2018, it has been ratified by 192 states.&lt;ref name = ratifications&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=III-3&amp;chapter=3&amp;clang=_en|work=United Nations Treaty Collection|title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2016}}
Throughout the history of sovereign states, diplomats have enjoyed a special status. Their function to negotiate agreements between states demands certain special privileges. An envoy from another nation is traditionally treated as a guest, their communications with their home nation treated as confidential, and their freedom from coercion and subjugation by the host nation treated as essential.

The first attempt to codify [[diplomatic immunity]] into [[diplomatic law]] occurred with the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. This was followed much later by the Convention regarding Diplomatic Officers (Havana, 1928).

The present treaty on the treatment of diplomats was the outcome of a draft by the [[International Law Commission]]. The treaty was adopted on 18 April 1961, by the United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and first implemented on 24 April 1964. The same Conference also adopted the Optional Protocol concerning Acquisition of Nationality, the Optional Protocol concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, the Final Act and four resolutions annexed to that Act.

Two years later, the [[United Nations]] adopted a closely related treaty, the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]].

==Summary of provisions==

The treaty is an extensive document, containing 53 articles. The following is a basic overview of its key provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/vcdr/vcdr.html|work=Audiovisual Library of International Law|title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 9. The host nation at any time and for any reason can declare a particular member of the diplomatic staff to be ''[[persona non grata]]''. The sending state must recall this person within a reasonable period of time, or otherwise this person may lose their diplomatic immunity.
* Article 22. The premises of a diplomatic mission, such as an embassy, are inviolable and must not be entered by the host country except by permission of the head of the mission. Furthermore, the host country must protect the mission from intrusion or damage. The host country must never search the premises, nor seize its documents or property. Article 30 extends this provision to the private residence of the diplomats.
* Article 24 establishes that the archives and documents of a diplomatic mission are inviolable. The receiving country shall not seize or open such documents. 
* Article 27. The host country must permit and protect free communication between the diplomats of the mission and their home country. A [[diplomatic bag]] must never be opened even on suspicion of abuse. A [[diplomatic courier]] must never be arrested or detained.
* Article 29. Diplomats must not be liable to any form of arrest or detention. They are immune from civil or criminal prosecution, though the sending country may waive this right under Article 32.
* Article 31.1c Actions not covered by diplomatic immunity: professional activity outside diplomat's official functions.
* Article 34 speaks about tax exemption of diplomatic agents while Article 36 establishes that diplomatic agents are exempted from custom duties. 
* Article 37. The family members of diplomats that are living in the host country enjoy most of the same protections as the diplomats themselves.

==Optional protocols==

In the same year that the treaty was adopted, two amendment [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocols]] were added. Countries may ratify the main treaty without necessarily ratifying these optional agreements.

* ''Concerning acquisition of nationality.'' The head of the mission, the staff of the mission, and their families, shall not acquire the nationality of the receiving country.
* ''Concerning compulsory settlement of disputes.'' Disputes arising from the interpretation of this treaty may be brought before the [[International Court of Justice]].

==State parties to the convention==
[[File:Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.svg|thumb|right|334px|{{legend|#00aa00|States which have ratified the convention}} {{legend|#ff1111|UN member states which are not parties}}]]

As of October 2018, there are 192 state parties to the convention&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt; including all [[UN member states]] except [[Palau]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[South Sudan]]. Included as state parties are the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine]], two [[UN observer]] states. The [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] signed and ratified the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations on 18 April 1961 and 19 December 1969 respectively prior to the [[China and the United Nations|UN granting China's seat]] to The [[China|People's Republic of China]]. There are no states that have signed the treaty but have not ratified it.

'''''Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York''''', 397 U.S. 664 (1970),&lt;ref name="Walz"&gt;{{ussc|name=Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York|volume=397|page=664|pin=|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]].  The Court held that grants of tax exemption to religious organizations do not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

==Background==
===Legislation===

New York law granted property tax exemptions to religious organizations for religious properties used solely for religious worship.
*This exemption is authorized by N.Y. Const. art. XVI, § 1.
::*Under this provision, exemptions from taxation may be granted only by general laws. Exemptions may be altered or repealed except those exempting real or personal property used exclusively for religious, educational or charitable purposes as defined by law and owned by any corporation or association organized or conducted exclusively for one or more of such purposes and not operating for profit.
*This exemption is implemented by N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law § 420(1).
::*This provision states in part: Real property owned by a corporation or association organized exclusively for the moral or mental improvement of men and women, or for religious, bible, tract, charitable, benevolent, missionary, hospital, infirmary, educational, public playground, scientific, literary, bar association, medical society, library, patriotic, historical or cemetery purposes and used exclusively for carrying out thereupon one or more of such purposes shall be exempt from taxation as provided in this section.

===Dispute===
The plaintiff, Frederick Walz, an owner of real estate in [[Staten Island]], New York, brought suit in the [[New York Supreme Court]], Special Term, seeking to enjoin the [[New York City Tax Commission]] from granting these exemptions.  The plaintiff contended that the exemptions indirectly required him to make a contribution to religious bodies and thereby violated the religion clauses of the First Amendment.

===Procedural history===
Rejecting this contention, the New York Supreme Court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court&lt;ref&gt;30 App. Div. 2d 778, 292 N.Y.S.2d 353.&lt;/ref&gt; and the New York Court of Appeals&lt;ref&gt;24 N.Y.2d 30, 298 N.Y.S.2d 711, 246 N.E.2d 517.&lt;/ref&gt; affirmed.

==Opinion of the court==
The United States Supreme Court affirmed, in an opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]], expressing the views of five members of the court.&lt;ref name="Walz"/&gt;

===Reasoning===
The Court held that there was no nexus between these tax exemptions and the establishment of religion, and that federal or state grants of tax exemption to churches did not violate the First Amendment:
:(1) exemptions were granted to all houses of religious worship within a broad class of property owned by nonprofit, quasi-public corporations which included hospitals, libraries, playgrounds, and scientific, professional, historical, and patriotic groups, and the legislative purpose was thus not aimed at establishing, sponsoring, or supporting religion, and
:(2) the exemptions for religious organizations created only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less of an involvement than would be created by taxation of churches, and the effect of the exemptions was thus not an excessive government entanglement with religion.  The grant of a tax exemption was not sponsorship of the organizations because the government did not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstained from demanding that the churches support the state. The exemption created a more minimal and remote involvement between church and state than did taxation because it restricted the fiscal relationship between church and state and reinforced the desired separation insulating one from the other.&lt;ref name="Walz"/&gt;

==Concurrences==
Justices [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Brennan]] and [[John M. Harlan II|Harlan]], each in a separate opinion, while concurring in the court's conclusion that the tax exemptions did not violate the First Amendment, would reach this conclusion by applying different criteria from those applied by the court.&lt;ref name="Walz"/&gt;

==Dissent==
[[William O. Douglas|Justice Douglas]] would have held that the tax exemptions for religious organizations violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.&lt;ref name="Walz"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Zivildienst''' ([[German language|German]], translated verbatim to "Civilian Service", although "compulsory community service" is more contextually equivalent). However the official translation in German is "[[alternative civilian service]]" as the civilian branch of the national service systems in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. In [[Germany]] ''Zivildienst'' was the alternative service to military service until suspension of [[conscription]] in 2011 as well. It is a means for conscripted persons who are [[conscientious objector]]s to fulfill their [[national service]], typically in the fields of social work (e.g. [[hospital]]s, [[retirement home]]s, [[emergency medical services]]) and, although rarely, [[environmental protection]], [[agriculture]], and [[public administration]]. As such, it is exempt from the general ban of [[forced labor]] by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

==''Zivildienst'' in Austria==
{{Main|Zivildienst in Austria}}
[[File:Zivildienst 2005.png|thumb|100px|Badge of Zivildienst (Austria, 1982)]]
The ''Zivildienst'' in Austria is provided as an alternative for conscientious objectors to the draft for military service. It is served for nine months, three months longer than the military service. Participants can choose one of several organisations (mainly NGOs) at which to serve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zivildienst.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=82 "Geschichte des Zivildienstes", ''zivildienst.at'']&lt;/ref&gt; Most popular choices for compulsory service personnel are working for the ambulance services (usually transporting non-emergency patients to and from hospital) and nursing homes. Other options include serving at hospitals, charity organizations or in several ministries.

Until 1975, there was no alternative to the compulsory military service in Austria. In order to discourage people from substituting compulsory  community service for military service, the [[Austrian People's Party]] introduced a committee which met with every man who wanted to do compulsory community service. The only accepted reason for avoiding military service was [[pacifism]], and one had to thoroughly and rationally explain their pacifism. Immaturity or naïveté could be reasons for declining the application and potential candidates' criminal records had to be impeccable. Candidates completing the civilian service were then barred entry to the [[police]] force, as this would contradict one's claims of being a pacifist. The committee was disbanded in 1991. From 1991, ''Zivildienst'' personnel were prohibited from owning any weapon for 20 years after completing their service &amp;ndash; though this ban does not extend to individuals barred from military service on medical or psychological reasons, though in the latter case, other laws may apply and a ban may be imposed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==''Zivildienst'' in Switzerland==
{{Main|Swiss Civilian Service}}

==Former ''Zivildienst'' in Germany (1973–2011)==
''Zivildienst'' was the most common alternative to [[Conscription in Germany|conscription]] in the German armed forces, the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' before conscription was suspended for peacetime in 2011. Drafted persons had to file a petition along with an essay describing the reasons, in order to become recognized as an objector. The "recognized objector" (''anerkannter Kriegsdienstverweigerer'') could then either negotiate for an accredited service institution himself, or be assigned an institution.

Since its creation on October 10, 1973 the ''Federal Office for Alternative Civilian Service'' (in German: Bundesamt für den Zivildienst / BAZ) was responsible for the petitions, the recognized objectors, and the accreditation of the institutions (and more) by law (mainly ''Zivildienstgesetz'' (ZDG)). In 2011 it was renamed in ''Federal Office for Family and Civil Society Duties'' (in German: Bundesamt für Familie und zivilgesellschaftliche Aufgaben / BAFzA) and is now responsible for the [[Federal volunteers service|Federal Volunteer Service]] (in German: ''Bundesfreiwilligendienst'' / BFD), a [[Volunteering|voluntary social service]] established after the suspension of conscription in 2011.

Currently, the German ''Zivildienst'' is suspended, same as the ''Wehrdienst'' (military service).
