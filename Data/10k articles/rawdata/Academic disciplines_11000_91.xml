{{Renewable energy sources}}
{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''biofuel''' is a [[fuel]] that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and [[anaerobic digestion]], rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter.

Biofuels can be derived directly from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of [[biomass]]  (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.

Biofuels are in theory [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because the carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants is equal to the carbon dioxide that is released when the fuel is burned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/print.php?page=biomass_environment Biomass and the Environment – Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, whether or not a biofuel is carbon-neutral also depends greatly on whether the land which is used to grow the biofuel (with 1st and 2nd generation biofuel) [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|needed to be cleared of carbon-holding vegetation]] or not.

[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009,&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport. Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for about 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; {{as of|2011}}, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905003859/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |access-date=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/biofuels_roadmap.pdf |year= 2011 |title=Technology Roadmap, Biofuels for Transport }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry, where by 2010, 79% of all cars produced in Brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of bioethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Jeremy | last2 = Matos | first2 = Stelvia | last3 = Silvestre | first3 = Bruno | last4 = Martin | first4 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = Managing Technological and Social Uncertainties of Innovation: The Evolution of Brazilian Energy and Agriculture | url = | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1147–1157 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various social, economic, environmental and technical [[issues relating to biofuels]] production and use, which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals.

==Generations==
===First-generation biofuels===
"First-generation" or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land. With this biofuel production generation, food crops are thus [[Food vs fuel|explicitly grown for fuel production]], and not anything else. The sugar, starch, or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol, using [[transesterification]], or yeast fermentation.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100521143237/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/05/18/3g-4g-a-taxonomy-for-far-out-%E2%80%94-but-not-far-away-%E2%80%94-biofuels/ First, second, third and fourth generation biofuels explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Second-generation biofuels}}
Second generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of [[biomass]].  Biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the [[carbon cycle]]. Biomass is derived from plant materials, but can also include animal materials.

Whereas first generation biofuels are made from the [[sugar]]s and [[vegetable oil]]s found in arable crops, second generation biofuels are made from [[lignocellulosic biomass]] or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste plant material (from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose).&lt;ref&gt;An example here is [[rapeseed]], of which the oil is used as waste fuel, and of which the actual produce (for which the crop is grown) is [[fodder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coconut oil]] is another example, if it is extracted in such a way that the meat and milk can still be used for human and/or animal consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/12/24/barley-grain-can-be-used-to-produce-ethanol-says-scientists-with-usda/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.315.5818.1488 |pmid=17363642 |title=CELLULOSIC ETHANOL: Biofuel Researchers Prepare to Reap a New Harvest |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5818 |pages=1488–1491 |year=2007 |last1=Service |first1=R. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jksus.2017.07.005 |title=Bioconversion of corn straw to ethanol by cellulolytic yeasts immobilized in Mucuna urens matrix |journal=Journal of King Saud University - Science |year=2017 |last1=Adelabu |first1=Blessing Adebola |last2=Kareem |first2=Sarafadeen Olateju |last3=Oluwafemi |first3=Flora |last4=Abideen Adeogun |first4=Idowu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feedstock used to generate second-generation biofuels thus either grows on [[arable land]]s, but are just byproducts of the actual harvest (main crop) or they are grown on lands which cannot be used to effectively grow food crops&lt;ref&gt;i.e. arid lands in case of jatropha, or hilly terrain not accessible by tractor, ... in case of grasses, woody crops ...&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases neither extra water or fertilizer is applied to them. Non-human food second generation feedstock sources include grasses, jatropha and other seed crops, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/second-generation-biofuels.html|title=Biofuels - Second Generation Biofuels|website=biofuel.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that, unlike with regular food crops, no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops, it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance, a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/en8076765 |title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels |journal=Energies |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=6765–6794 |year=2015 |last1=Ramirez |first1=Jerome |last2=Brown |first2=Richard |last3=Rainey |first3=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The potential and challenges of drop-in fuels (members only) {{!}} IEA Bioenergy Task 39 – Commercializing Liquid Biofuels|url = http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/?p=932|website = task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Algaculture|Algae fuel}}
From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|US NREL]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]".&lt;ref name = "NREL biofuels algae"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan|first=John|title=A Look Back at the U. S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biofuels from Algae|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=July 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all [[motor vehicle|vehicular]] fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants.&lt;ref name="Briggs2004"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html| title = Widescale Biodiesel Production from Algae| first = Michael |last=Briggs|date=August 2004| accessdate = 2007-01-02

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture&amp;nbsp;– unlike [[agriculture|crop-based]] biofuels&amp;nbsp;– does not entail a decrease in [[food production]], since it requires neither [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] nor [[fresh water]]. Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc.

Teixeira]] from the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] demonstrated the extraction of biofuels lipids from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in [[ionic liquids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Energy-efficient extraction of fuel and chemical feedstocks from algae |journal = [[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]] | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 419–427 | author = R. E. Teixeira | doi = 10.1039/C2GC16225C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth-generation biofuels===
Similarly to third-generation biofuels, fourth-generation biofuels are made using non-arable land. However, unlike third-generation biofuels, they do not require the destruction of biomass. This class of biofuels includes [[electrofuel]]s&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and [[Solar fuel|photobiological solar fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4678123 | pmid=26667057 | doi=10.1007/s13280-015-0730-0 | volume=45 Suppl 1 | title=From first generation biofuels to advanced solar biofuels | journal=Ambio | pages=S24–31 | last1 = Aro | first1 = EM| year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fuels are [[Carbon-neutral fuel#Production|carbon-neutral]].

==Types==
The following fuels can be produced using first, second, third or fourth-generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol for instance can be produced using 1G, 2G and 3G procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas===

[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pipes carrying biogas]]
{{Main|Biogas}}
Biogas is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, G., The Andersons Centre. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081004232058/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7198%3Bisa%3DDBRow%3Bop%3Dshow%3Bdbview_id%3D2457 "Assessment of on-farm AD in the UK"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved on 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced either from [[biodegradable waste]] materials or by the use of [[energy crop]]s fed into [[anaerobic digester]]s to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, [[digestate]], can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.

Biogas can be recovered from [[mechanical biological treatment]] waste processing systems. [[Landfill gas]], a less clean form of biogas, is produced in [[landfill]]s through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential [[greenhouse gas]].

Farmers can produce biogas from [[manure]] from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.&lt;ref&gt;"BIOGAS: No bull, manure can power your farm." Farmers Guardian (25 September 2009): 12. General OneFile. Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of [[oxygen]] that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes [[pyrolysis|pyrolysed]]. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&amp;nbsp;°C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].

===Ethanol===

{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&amp;nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]]]
Biologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.

[[File:Bushlulacana09032007.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] looks at sugar cane, a source of biofuel, with Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during a tour on biofuel technology at [[Petrobras]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, 9 March 2007.]]
[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | Lär dig mer om energi - E.ON&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.

Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.

Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires&lt;ref&gt;Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.
The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;see "Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol"&lt;/ref&gt; the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, N. et al., "Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1–26% more energy efficient than petrol cars, but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required).

With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Other bioalcohols===

[[Methanol]] is currently produced from [[natural gas]], a [[non-renewable]] fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as [[biomethanol]]. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns of [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] that the economic viability is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;Börjesson.P. et al. 2013, REPORT f3 2013:13, p 170&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methanol economy]] is an alternative to the [[hydrogen economy]], compared to today's [[hydrogen]] production from natural gas.

[[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] ({{chem|C|4|H|9|OH}}) is formed by [[Clostridium acetobutylicum|ABE fermentation]] (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high [[net energy gain]]s with butanol as the only liquid product. Butanol will produce more energy and allegedly can be burned "straight" in existing gasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butanol.com/ |title=ButylFuel, LLC Main Page |publisher=Butanol.com |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol, and could be distributed via existing infrastructures. [[DuPont]] and [[BP]] are working together to help develop butanol. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their [[protein metabolism|amino acid metabolism]].&lt;ref name="butanol"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biofpr.com/details/feature/102347/Biofuels_aim_higher.html|title=Biofuels aim higher|last=Evans|first=Jon|date=14 January 2008 |work=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining (BioFPR)|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback to butanol production in E. coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media, however, recent work has demonstrated E. coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2018.08.004 |pmid=30107263 |title=Directed strain evolution restructures metabolism for 1-butanol production in minimal media |journal=Metabolic Engineering |volume=49 |pages=153–163 |year=2018 |last1=Pontrelli |first1=Sammy |last2=Fricke |first2=Riley C.B. |last3=Sakurai |first3=Sana Subhan Memon |last4=Putri |first4=Sastia Prama |last5=Fitz-Gibbon |first5=Sorel |last6=Chung |first6=Matthew |last7=Wu |first7=Hsin-Yi |last8=Chen |first8=Yu-Ju |last9=Pellegrini |first9=Matteo |last10=Fukusaki |first10=Eiichiro |last11=Liao |first11=James C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiesel ===

{{Main|Biodiesel}}
{{Further|Biodiesel around the world}}
[[Biodiesel]] is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as "neat" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura – second generation B100 – The advanced green one]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any [[diesel engine]] when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100&lt;!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) --&gt;. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.

Electronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.
Since biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the [[combustion]] of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2012/T46.pdf Nylund.N-O &amp; Koponen.K. 2013. Fuel and Technology Alternatives for Buses. Overall Energy Efficiency and Emission Performance. IEA Bioenergy Task 46]. Possibly the new emission standards Euro VI/EPA 10 will lead to reduced NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-levels also when using B100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and [[biodegradable]], and has a high [[flash point]] of about 300&amp;nbsp;°F (148&amp;nbsp;°C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125&amp;nbsp;°F (52&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |title=Biofuels Facts |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520231032/http://hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005. "By the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold [from 2004] to more than" {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070606084122/http://www.wfs.org/futcontja07.htm THE FUTURIST], [http://www.prleap.com/pr/80099/ Will Thurmond]. July–August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles.&lt;ref name=RA29&gt;{{Harvsp|Avril Group : Activity Report|2014|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avril Group]] produces under the brand [[Diester]], a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="EurObserv’ER"&gt;{{Harvsp|EurObserv’ER|2014|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the leading European producer of biodiesel.&lt;ref name=RA29/&gt;

===Straight vegetable oil===

{{Main|Vegetable oil fuel}}
Straight unmodified [[Eating|edible]] vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.

As with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.

Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.

Oils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, G.

When it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives: [[dimethyl ether]] (DME), [[diethyl ether]] (DEE), methyl teritiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl ''ter''-butyl ether (ETBE), t''er''-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ''ter''-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sukla |first=Mirtunjay Kumar |title=Bio-Ethers as Transportation Fuel: A Review |url=http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/DMEoverview.pdf |publisher=Indian Institute of Petroleum Dehradun |accessdate=15 February 2014 |author2=Thallada Bhaskar |author3=A.K.

===Solid biomass fuels ===

Examples include [[wood]], [[sawdust]], [[grass]] trimmings, [[domestic waste|domestic refuse]], [[charcoal]], [[agricultural waste]], nonfood [[energy crop]]s, and [[Dry animal dung fuel|dried manure]].

When solid biomass is already in a suitable form (such as [[firewood]]), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from {{convert|1|to|3|cm|1|abbr=on}}, which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce [[wood pellet]]s, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.

Sawdust, bark and chips are already used for decades for fuel in industrial processes; examples include the pulp and paper industry and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. McGowan, Michael L. Brown, William S. Bulpitt, James L. Walsh, Jr. (Editors) 2009. Biomass and Alternate Fuel Systems: An Engineering and Economic Guide. {{ISBN|978-0-470-41028-8}} Wiley, 280 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of solid biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

A problem with the combustion of solid biomass fuels is that it emits considerable amounts of [[pollutant]]s, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]. Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers. Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[chlorophenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briens | first1 = Cedric | last2 = Piskorz | first2 = Jan | last3 = Berruti | first3 = Franco | year = 2008 | title = Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review | url = | journal = International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering | volume = 6 | issue = | page = R2 | doi=10.2202/1542-6580.1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derived fuel is [[biochar]], which is produced by biomass [[pyrolysis]]. Biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal. As wood stock becomes scarce, this alternative is gaining ground. In eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for example, [[biomass briquettes]] are being marketed as an alternative to charcoal to protect [[Virunga National Park]] from [[deforestation]] associated with [[charcoal]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |title=Threat to Great Apes Highlighted at Virunga Meeting |publisher=America.gov |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828133830/http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |archivedate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution==
{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage|Ethanol_fuel#Air_pollution}}

Biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces [[carbon dioxide]], airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas [[chromatograph]] studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240399720_Atmospheric_alcohols_and_aldehydes_concentrations_measured_in_Osaka_Japan_and_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil Atmospheric alcohols and aldehydes concentrations measured in Osaka, Japan and in São Paulo, Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged in April 2007 that the increased use of bio-ethanol will lead to worse air quality. The total emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bio-ethanol. There is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil, which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming, as it is also an ozone destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haerens|first1=Margaret|title=Biofuels|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7377-5553-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates regarding the production and use of biofuel==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}
There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[food prices]], [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[energy ratio]], [[energy requirements]],  [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], loss of [[biodiversity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher Jr.|first=Robert J.|author2=Bruce A Robertson |author3=Jason Evans |author4=Patrick J Doran |author5=Janaki RR Alavalapati |author6=Douglas W Schemske |title=Biodiversity conservation in the era of biofuels: risks and opportunities|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|year=2011|volume=9|issue=3|pages=161–168|url=http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/24366|accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1890/090091|hdl=10919/24366}}&lt;/ref&gt; impact on [[water resources]], the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cotton |first=Charles A.

It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.

Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) set by congress for 2010 was pushed back to at best 2012 to produce 100 million gallons of pure ethanol (not blended with a fossil fuel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bracmort|first=Kelsi|title=Meeting the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Mandate for Cellulosic Biofuels:Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41106.pdf|publisher=Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of first-generation biofuels===
In the EU, the revised renewable energy directive calls for a complete ban on first-generation biofuels by 2030. Particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/04/palm-oil-biofuels-meps-eu-transport-deforestation-zsl-greenpeace-golden-agri-resources-oxfam MEPs vote to ban the use of palm oil in biofuels ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-heading-for-zero-palm-oil-in-transport-by-2021/ EU heading for ‘zero palm oil’ in transport by 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-climatechange-palmoil/eu-to-phase-out-palm-oil-from-transport-fuel-by-2030-idUSKBN1JA21F EU to phase out palm oil from transport fuel by 2030]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable biofuels===
{{main|Sustainable biofuels}}
Many of the biofuels that were being supplied in 2008 (using the first-generation biofuel production procedure) have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; In 2008, the Nobel-prize winning chemist [[Paul J. Crutzen]] published findings that the release of [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2008, the challenge was to support biofuel development, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represented an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008).

Now, biofuels in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials are entering the market, driven by the perception that they reduce climate gas emissions, and also by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]].

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
Some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1238 |title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change |last = Searchinger |first = Timothy |author2=Ralph Heimlich |author3=R.A.

However, no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title =Biofuels, Land Use Change, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Some Unexplored Variables|last = Kim |first = Hyungtae|author2=Seungdo Kim|author3=Bruce E.

A study conducted in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 53-105 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 48-90 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be sequestered from forest depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alves Finco | first1 = Marcus V. | last2 = Doppler | first2 = Werner | year = 2010 | title = Bioenergy and Sustainable Development: The Dilemma of Food Security and Climate Change in the Brazilian Savannah | url = | journal = Energy for Sustainable Development | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 194–199 | doi = 10.1016/j.esd.2010.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Runge | first1 = Ford | last2 = Senauer | first2 = Benjamin | year = 2007 | title = How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 41–53 | jstor=20032348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.&lt;ref name="Science2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1235.short |title =Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt|last = fargione| first = Joseph|author2=Jason Hill |author3=David Tilman |author4=Stephen Polasky |author5=Peter Hawthorne |doi = 10.1126/science.1152747 |pmid =18258862|year=2008|accessdate = 12 November 2011 |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Use===
In addition to crop growth requiring water, biofuel facilities require significant process water.&lt;ref name="WaterI"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 18 June 2015 |journal=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests and Carbon Sequestration===
Scientific research (20th century) shows that carbon dioxide emissions from all forms of surface transport are converted in a few weeks by forests, farms and oceans into biomass. This implies that a greater emphasis on sustainable forestry is very relevant for climate protection and sustainable, energy-efficient transport.

==Current research==
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet current US heating and transportation needs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

[[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], are building refineries that can process [[biomass]] and turn it into [[bioethanol]]. Companies, such as [[Diversa]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International|Dyadic]], are producing enzymes that could enable a [[cellulosic ethanol]] future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the first commercial-scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used. In the next few years, the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale, and their relative performance, will become available. Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |year=2013 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail, [[sweet sorghum]] is being investigated as a potential source of food, feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions, as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In [[India]], and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |title=Sweet Sorghum : A New "Smart Biofuel Crop" |date=30 June 2008 |publisher=Agriculture Business Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004827/http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |archivedate=27 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers at the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] New Agriculturalist, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jatropha===
{{Main|Jatropha biofuel}}
Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'', a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biology and genetic improvement of Jatropha curcas L.: A review| journal = [[Applied Energy]] | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | year = 2010| pages = 732–742 |author1=B.N.

[[SG Biofuels]], a San Diego-based jatropha developer, has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds that show significant yield improvements over first-generation varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biofuels Digest |url=http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2011/05/16/jatropha-blooms-again-sg-biofuels-secures-250k-acres-for-hybrids|title=Jatropha blooms again: SG Biofuels secures 250K acres for hybrids |publisher=Biofuels Digest |date=2011-05-16 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; SG Biofuels also claims additional benefits have arisen from such strains, including improved flowering synchronicity, higher resistance to pests and diseases, and increased cold-weather tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SG Biofuels|url=http://www.sgfuel.com/pages/hybrid-seeds-and-services/jMax-hybrid-seeds.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226073111/http://www.sgfuel.com/pages/hybrid-seeds-and-services/jMax-hybrid-seeds.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 February 2011|title=Jmax Hybrid Seeds|publisher=SG Biofuels|date=2012-03-08|accessdate=2012-03-08|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant Research International, a department of the [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] in the Netherlands, maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project that examines the feasibility of large-scale jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plant Research International |url=http://www.pri.wur.nl/UK/research/plant-based_raw_materials/jatropha/JATROPT |title=JATROPT (Jatropha curcas): Applied and technical research into plant properties |publisher=Plant Research International |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming (CfSEF) is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science, agronomy, and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300% in the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biofuels Magazine |url=http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727140520/http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-07-27|title=Energy Farming Methods Mature, Improve |publisher=Biofuels Magazine |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
A group at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]], in a 2008 paper, stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species, ''[[Cunninghamella]]'' ''[[Cunninghamella japonica|japonica]]'', and others, is likely to appear in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Sergeeva | first1 = Y.

The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus ''[[Gliocladium roseum]]'' (later renamed Ascocoryne sarcoides) points toward the production of so-called [[myco-diesel]] from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern [[Patagonia]], and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Strobel | first1 = G.| last2 = Knighton | first2 = B.| last3 = Kluck | first3 = K.| last4 = Ren | first4 = Y.| last5 = Livinghouse | first5 = T.| last6 = Griffin | first6 = M.| last7 = Spakowicz | first7 = D.| last8 = Sears | first8 = J.| title = The production of myco-diesel hydrocarbons and their derivatives by the endophytic fungus Gliocladium roseum (NRRL 50072)| journal = Microbiology| volume = 154| issue = Pt 11| pages = 3319–3328| year = 2008| pmid = 18957585| doi = 10.1099/mic.0.2008/022186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms, suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio-production of fuels in the future (reviewed in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 99| issue = 12| pages = 4943–4951| last1 = Spakowicz| first1 = Daniel J.| last2 = Strobel| first2 = Scott A.| title = Biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds by fungi: bioengineering potential| journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology| date = 2015| doi=10.1007/s00253-015-6641-y| pmid = 25957494| pmc = 4677055}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Animal gut bacteria===
Microbial [[Gut flora|gastrointestinal flora]] in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels. Recent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria found in Zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_082511.cfm |title=Cars Could Run on Recycled Newspaper, Tulane Scientists Say |author=Kathryn Hobgood Ray |date=August 25, 2011 |work=Tulane University news webpage |publisher=Tulane University |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating [[biofuels]] from bamboo and other plant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/09/130910-panda-poop-might-help-turn-plants-into-fuel |title=Panda Poop Might Help Turn Plants Into Fuel |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood-feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun|first1=Jian-Zhong|last2=Scharf|first2=Michael E.|title=Exploring and integrating cellulolytic systems of insects to advance biofuel technology|journal=Insect Science|date=2010|volume=17|issue=3|pages=163–165|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=August 2016}}
In [[physical fitness]], '''body composition''' is used to describe the percentages of [[fat]], [[bone]], [[water]] and [[muscle]] in [[human bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = composition of the body – FREE composition of the body information {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: Find composition of the body research|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O128-compositionofthebody.html|website = www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because muscular tissue takes up less space in our body than fat tissue, our body composition, as well as our weight, determines leanness. Two people of the same sex and body weight may look completely different because they have a different body composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Body Composition Tests|url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/Body-Composition-Tests_UCM_305883_Article.jsp|website = www.heart.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body density==
The most accurate estimation of body composition is derived from body density by means of the equation of fractional densities which states that the overall density of a mixture containing more than one substance (each with a different density) can be calculated if the proportion and density  of each component substance is known.  For determination of body composition the body is often assumed to be composed of four basic substances ("four compartment model") with the general form of the equation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;1/Db = w/Dw + f/Df + p/Dp + m/Dm&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Siri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Siri William E |title=The gross composition of the body |journal=Advances in Biological and Medical Physics |volume=4|pages=239–280|year=1956|pmid=13354513}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262}}
 
Where: &lt;math&gt;Db&lt;/math&gt; = overall body density, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of water, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of fat, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of protein, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = proportion of mineral, &lt;math&gt;Dw&lt;/math&gt; = density of water, &lt;math&gt;Df&lt;/math&gt; = density of fat, &lt;math&gt;Dp&lt;/math&gt; = density of protein, &lt;math&gt;Dm&lt;/math&gt; = density of mineral

In a research laboratory setting, the overall density of the body (Db) is calculated from its mass and volume (Db = mass/volume). The mass of the body is found by simply weighing a person on a scale.  The volume of the body is most easily and accurately determined by completely immersing a person in water and calculating the volume of water from the weight of water that is displaced (via "underwater weighing").  The proportions of water, protein and mineral in the body are found by various chemical and radiometric tests.&lt;ref name=Siri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Siri William E |title=The gross composition of the body |journal=Advances in Biological and Medical Physics |volume=4|pages=239–280|year=1956|pmid=13354513}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|239–278}}  The densities of water, fat, protein and mineral are either measured or estimated.  The equation is then rearranged to solve for the proportion of fat (f) from the other quantities.

A reasonably accurate [[Body fat percentage|estimation of body fat]] can be obtained by means of a "two compartment model" of the human body which is based upon two simplifying assumptions:  1. Human fat has a density of 0.9 grams/ml, and 2. The lean (non-fat) components of the human body have an overall density of 1.1 grams/ml.

The two compartment model allows for an estimation of the proportions of fat and lean components of the body to be made from the overall body density.  And, as explained above, the overall body density (Db) is easily calculated from body mass and body volume. Rearranging the equation of fractional densities to solve for the proportion of fat (f) will yield the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 495/Db - 450&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Siri William E |title=Body composition from fluid spaces and density: analysis of methods |journal=Donner laboratory of biophysics and medical physics |volume=UCRL 3349 |page=14 |year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The density of human fat is remarkably constant across all sub-groups studied but variations have been reported in the density of the fat free mass (i.e. lean or non-fat components).  To address these differences, unique equations for the two compartment model have been proposed for specific populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wagner DR, Heyward VH |title=Measures of body composition in blacks and whites: a comparative review |journal=J Clin Nutr |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1392–1402 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DEXA==
Body composition measurement with [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA) is used increasingly for a variety of clinical and research applications. A DEXA scan requires medical supervision by a radiologist and some consider it to be the new "Gold Standard" in body composition testing. Total body scans using DEXA give accurate and precise measurements of body composition, including bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), lean tissue mass, fat tissue mass, and fractional contribution of fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kiebzak GM, Leamy LJ, Pierson LM, Nord RH, Zhang ZY |title=Measurement precision of body composition variables using the lunar DPX-L densitometer |journal=J Clin Densitom |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=35–41 |year=2000 |pmid=10745300 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/JCD:3:1:035 |doi=10.1385/jcd:3:1:035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimation of body fatness from body density (by means of underwater weighing) was accepted as the "gold standard" for many decades.  Some researchers now claim that whole body scanning techniques (e.g. "DEXA") are the new "gold standard".  But these claims are somewhat dubious since the scanning algorithms are validated against body composition assessments based on fractional density from underwater weighing.

DEXA measurements are highly reproducible if the same type of machine is used (citation needed), making them excellent for monitoring pharmaceutical therapy, nutritional or exercise intervention, sports training and or other body composition altering programs. They are also fast, simple, non-invasive, and expose the subject to a level of x-rays less than that of a cross-country flight. DEXA exams provide both total body and up to 14 regional (trunk, individual arms &amp; legs, android, gynoid, etc.) results.  However, the role of DEXA in clinical evaluations and research studies has been questioned by Wang et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang ZM, Deurenberg P, Guo SS, Pietrobelli A, Wang J, ((Pierson RN Jr)), Heymsfield SB |title=Six-compartment body composition model: inter-method comparisons of total body fat measurement |journal=Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord |volume=22 |pages=329–337 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stated that "the errors of the DXA [DEXA] method are still of concern if it were to be used as the criterion."

==Air displacement plethysmography==
[[File:Adult body composition through air displacement plethysmography.jpg|thumb|Body composition measurement with [[air displacement plethysmography]] or whole-body air displacement plethysmography (ADP) technology]]

Another technique for measuring body composition has been developed for measuring body volume using a different method than underwater weighing.  The technique uses air as opposed to water and is known as [[air displacement plethysmography]] (ADP).  Subjects enter a sealed chamber that measures their body volume through the displacement of air in the chamber.  Body volume is combined with [[body weight]] (mass) in order to determine body density.  The technique then estimates the percentage of body fat and [[lean body mass]] (LBM) through empirically derived equations similar to those used with underwater weighing (for the density of fat and fat free mass).

== From conductivity==
Another method is [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]]  (BIA), which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat.  Unfortunately, BIA is highly sensitive to hydration status and water intake.  Drinking water dilutes the electrolytes in the body making it less conductive as does increasing body fat.

== Body Volume Indicator ==

The Body Volume Indicator (BVI) is a technique used for measuring body shape. Initially, BVI technology employed white light scanning machines to measure an individuals body shape&lt;ref&gt;Jose Medina-Inojosa et al. (2016) "Reliability of a 3D Body Scanner for Anthropometric Measurements of Central Obesity". Obes Open Access. 2(3): 10.16966/2380-5528.122.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, recent technological advances in 3D measurement have enabled BVI to be calculated using images taken on a smartphone.  Two images are required to create an individual 3D silhouette. By comparing this 3D silhouette with MRI data, body volume and fat distribution can be calculated [http://www.bodyvolume.com/about-bvi/ (BVI website)].

==Skin folds==
Body composition can also be measured using the skin fold test, which is performed using a tool called a caliper. It can be done in nine steps: 
# Take measurements on the right side of the body.
# Mark client up.
# Pinch skin (KM) above mark
# Pull fat away from muscles
# Place caliper halfway between top and bottom of mark
# Allow caliper to settle (1–2 seconds)
# Take reading – repeat 15 seconds
# Add up total (4) – average
# Calculate body fat %

A common skin fold method is by using gun style [[caliper]]s to measure the thickness of [[subcutaneous fat]] in multiple places on the body. This includes the abdominal area, the [[subscapularis muscle|subscapular]] region, arms, buttocks and thighs. These measurements are then used to estimate total body fat.

==Ultrasound==
Ultrasound has also been used to measure subcutaneous fat thickness, and by using multiple points an estimation of body composition can be made.  Ultrasound has the advantage of being able to also directly measure muscle thickness and quantify intramuscular fat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=documentation needed here}}

==Circumferences and other measurements==
Assessment of somatic (skeletal) protein is typically determined by simple measurements and calculations including mid arm circumference (MAC), mid arm muscle circumference (MAMC), and creatinine height ratio (CHI). [[Creatinine]] height ratio is calculated as 24-hour urine creatinine multiplied by 100 over the expected 24-hour urine creatinine for height. This calculation results in a percentage which can indicate protein depletion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Validity==
The methods above are each valid and notable in providing a reasonably accurate range of the "true body composition" of the tested individual. However, each method does possess its own individual limitations, indeed precluding to the existence of so many variable methods available for an individual to use. Therefore, the actual method of testing body composition is not as important as the '''consistency of measurement''' in between each test. (See [[internal consistency]] for merits on testing in this manner.) If an individual is to be tested from one period to the next, all factors should ideally remain as similar as possible to reflect the best indicator of true change in composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2082845|year=2006|author1=Wells|first1=J. C.|title=Measuring body composition|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=91|issue=7|pages=612–617|last2=Fewtrell|first2=M. S.|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.085522|pmid=16790722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of exercises ==
The exercises needed to maintain optimal body composition differ from man to woman to child, but the ideal types of fitness remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Normal ranges of body weight and body fat|url = http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/normal-ranges-of-body-weight-and-body-fat|website = human-kinetics|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary exercises needed to improve body composition involve fat burning and cardiovascular exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Body Composition Exercises|url = http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/examples-body-composition-exercises-12586.html|website = Healthy Living - azcentral.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Botanical illustration''' is the art of depicting the form, color, and details of plant species, frequently in [[watercolor]] paintings.  They must be scientifically accurate but often also have an artistic component and may be printed with a botanical description in books, magazines, and other media or sold as a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sydney Living Museums|title=The art in the illustration|date=2016-07-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGxHTUgcYv0|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of [[plant morphology]] and access to specimens and references.

==History==
Early [[herbals]] and [[pharmacopoeia]] of many cultures have included the depiction of plants. This was intended to assist identification of a species, usually with some medicinal purpose. The earliest surviving illustrated botanical work is the Codex vindobonensis. It is a copy of [[Dioscorides]]'s ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', and was made in the year 512 for Juliana Anicia, daughter of the former Western Roman Emperor Olybrius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/shirley-sherwood-gallery.htm# |title=Kew Gardens website |access-date=2011-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102005902/http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/shirley-sherwood-gallery.htm# |archive-date=2011-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of accurately describing plants between regions and languages, before the introduction of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], were potentially hazardous to medicinal preparations. The low quality of printing of early works sometimes presents difficulties in identifying the species depicted.   

When systems of [[botanical nomenclature]] began to be published, the need for a drawing or painting became optional.  However, it was at this time that the  profession of [[botanical illustrator]] began to emerge. The eighteenth century saw many advances in the printing processes, and the [[illustration]]s became more accurate in colour and detail. The increasing interest of amateur botanists, gardeners, and natural historians provided a market for botanical publications; the illustrations increased the appeal and accessibility of these to the general reader.
The field guides, [[Flora]]s, catalogues and magazines produced since this time have continued to include illustrations.  The development of photographic plates has not made illustration obsolete, despite the improvements in reproducing photographs in printed materials.  A botanical illustrator is able to create a compromise of accuracy, an idealized image from several specimens, and the inclusion of the face and reverse of the features such as leaves. Additionally, details of sections can be given at a magnified scale and included around the margins around the image.

[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]]. ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'', early sixth century]]

Botanical illustration is a feature of many notable books on plants, a list of these would include: 
*[[Vienna Dioscurides]]
*''[[Flora Graeca]]''
*''[[The Banksias]]''
*''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''
*''[[The Cactaceae]]''

Recently a renaissance has been occurring in botanical art and illustration. Organizations devoted to furthering the art form are found in the US ([[American Society of Botanical Artists]]), UK (Society of Botanical Artists), Australia (Botanical Art Society of Australia), and South Africa (Botanical Artists Association of South Africa), among others. The reasons for this resurgence are many. In addition to the need for clear scientific illustration, botanical depictions continue to be one of the most popular forms of "wall art". There is an increasing interest in the changes occurring in the natural world, and in the central role plants play in maintaining healthy ecosystems. A sense of urgency has developed in recording today's changing plant life for future generations. Working in media long understood provides confidence in the long-term conservation of the drawings, paintings, and etchings. 
Many artists are drawn to more traditional figurative work, and find plant depiction a perfect fit. Working with scientists, conservationists, horticulturists, and galleries locally and around the world, today's illustrators and artists are pushing the boundaries of what has traditionally been considered part of the genre.

'''Clothed female, naked male''' ('''CFNM'''), or '''clothed male, naked female''', is a genre of [[erotica]] based on the real or imagined interaction of one or more [[nudity|nude]] men and one or more clothed women.  It is sometimes a [[sexual fantasy]] of women or men, depicting an  [[exhibitionist]] or physique worship scenario. CFNM situations can arise in situations where a male disrobes as part of a male [[striptease]], a medical examination, as a figure model for art students, or is forced to remove clothing as  a punitive measure. In pornography or erotic writing, CFNM depicts a power exchange where the more traditionally dominant male is objectified, debased, or humiliated by a more traditionally submissive female. As a result, CFNM fiction frequently includes the clothed female taking on the role of a [[dominatrix]] over the nude male.

The opposite of CFNM is [[clothed male, naked female]] (CMNF).

==Portrayal of male nudity==
[[File:Torii Kiyonobu I -By the Light of a Hexagonal Lantern early 1700s.jpg|thumb|''By the Light of a Hexagonal Lantern'', woodblock print by [[Torii Kiyonobu I]], early 1700s.]]

[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs, 1846.jpg|thumb|''Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1846).]]
In [[classical antiquity]], the portrayal of nude male form in art (including the exposure of genitals) was considered to be more acceptable than that of the naked female form. By the renaissance, this view had reversed.&lt;ref name="Goldhill"&gt;{{cite book |title=Love, sex &amp; tragedy how the ancient world shapes our lives |author=Simon Goldhill |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-30119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Titian]]'s ''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)|treatment of Perseus and Andromeda]]'' in the mid-1550s, it is Andromeda who is nude—save for the barest wisp of fabric—while Perseus is clothed in armour.

Depictions of nudity were acceptable to the 19th-century French [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] culture if the setting was clearly "classical", depicting characters in a culture where nudity was commonplace, as in ''Combat de coqs'' (1847) by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]].

== Sexual objectification of men by women ==
[[Feminist]] authors [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] have written that women's sexual liberation has led many women to a [[role reversal]], whereby they view men as [[sex object]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Christina Hoff. 1994. ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]''. New York. Simon and Schuster (pp.264-265), {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hc), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. 1994. ''Fire With Fire: The New Female Power and How to Use It''. New York: Fawcett Columbine (pp.225-228), {{ISBN|0-449-90951-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Tad. ''Yes (feminist women who like sex)'' Esquire. February 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner similar to what they criticize in men's treatment of women.

'''Cog's ladder''' of group development is based on the work, "Cog's Ladder: A Model of Group Growth", by [[George O. Charrier]], an employee of [[Procter and Gamble]], published in a company newsletter in 1972.  The original document was written to help group managers at Procter and Gamble better understand the dynamics of group work, thus improving efficiency.  It is now also used by the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and other businesses – to help in understanding group development.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, T. R., &amp; Mandal, B. N. (2008). The Principle of population: An essay on principle of population, as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers. New Delhi, India: Global Vision Pub. House. p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
The basic idea of Cog's ladder is that there are five steps necessary for a small group of people to be able to work efficiently together.  These stages are the ''polite stage'', the ''why we're here stage'', the ''power stage'', the ''cooperation stage'' and the ''esprit stage''.  Groups can only move forward after completing the current stage as in [[Jean Piaget]]'s stage model.

===Polite stage===
An introductory phase where members strive to get acquainted or reacquainted with one another. During this phase, the basis for the group structure is established and is characterized by polite social interaction. All ideas are simple, controversy is avoided and all members limit self-disclosure.  Judgements of other members are formed, and this sets the tone for the rest of the group's time.

===Why we're here stage===
Group members will want to know why they have been called together. The specific agenda for each planning session will be communicated by the moderator or leader. In this phase, individual need for approval begins to diminish as the members examine their group's purpose and begin to set goals.  Often, social cliques will begin to form as members begin to feel as though they "fit in."

===Power stage===
Bids for power begin between group members in an effort to convince each other that their position on an issue is correct.  Often, the field of candidates vying for leadership narrows, as fewer members strive to establish power.  Some of those who contributed freely to the group discussion in earlier stages now remain silent, wishing not to engage in a power struggle.  It is noted that interactions arising out of this phase do not usually result in optimum solutions.  Hence, there is a great need for structure and patience in this stage.*

===Cooperation stage===
Members not only begin to accept that others have an opinion worth expressing, but a team spirit replaces vested interests.  Often, new levels of creativity are achieved, and the group's productivity soars.  If new individuals are introduced into the membership at this point, they will be viewed as outsiders or intruders, and the group will have to evolve again, much as it did initially.

===Esprit stage===
Esprit de corps:  a golden rule by [[Henri Fayol]] is closely associated with this stage of Cog's, which says that nothing has higher pinnacles to reach than spirit of corps.

Mutual acceptance with high cohesiveness and a general feeling of esprit.  Charrier states that the planning team can do its finest work and be most productive in this final stage in the model.  It is also noted that this stage will not always be achieved; however, for this level of cooperation, as well as productivity, the other four stages must be met.

==Comparisons==
Cog's ladder is very similar to [[Forming-storming-norming-performing|Tuckman's stages]], another stage model of groups, which lacks the "Why We're Here" stage, and calls the remaining four stages "Forming", "Storming", "Norming", and "Performing". There are also other similar models, some of which are cyclic rather than reaching an end state.

The '''Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)''' is a collaborative research project among national election studies around the world.  Participating countries and polities include a common module of survey questions in their national post-election studies. The resulting data are collated together along with voting, demographic, district and macro variables into one dataset allowing comparative analysis of voting behavior from a multilevel perspective.

The CSES is published as a free, public dataset. The project is administered by the CSES Secretariat, a joint effort between the Institute for Social Research at the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany.

== Aims and content of the study ==

The CSES project was founded in 1994 with two major aims. The first was to promote international collaboration between national election studies. The second was to allow researchers to study variations in political institutions, especially electoral systems, and their effects on individual attitudes and behaviors, especially turnout and vote choice.

CSES datasets contain variables at three levels.  The first is micro-level variables which are answered by respondents during post-election surveys in each included country.  The second is district-level variables which contain election results from the electoral districts that survey respondents are situated in.  The third is macro-level variables containing information about the country context and electoral system, as well as aggregate data such as economic indicators and democracy indices. This nested data structure, as depicted in Figure 1, allows for multilevel analysis.

[[File:Multi-levelDataStructure.png|thumb|Figure 1: Visualization of CSES multilevel data structure]]

A new thematic module is devised by the CSES Planning Committee every five years. Between the final releases of the complete modules, CSES also disseminates advance releases of datasets periodically, which include partial data for modules that have not been fully released yet.

Survey data collection for '''module 1''' was conducted between 1996 and 2001 and focuses on system performance. The module allows investigation of the impact of electoral institutions on citizens’ political cognition and behavior as well as of the nature of political and social cleavages and alignment. Furthermore, it enables research about citizens’ evaluation of democratic institutions and processes. Module 1 includes 39 election studies conducted in 33 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 2''' was conducted between 2001 and 2006 and focuses on accountability and representation. It addresses the contrast between the view that elections are a mechanism to hold government accountable and the view that they are a means to ensure that citizens’ views and interests are properly represented in the democratic process. Module 2 includes 41 election studies conducted in 38 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 3''' was conducted between 2006 and 2011. The module allows investigating the meaningfulness of electoral choices and, accordingly, focuses on a major aspect of electoral research: the contingency in choice of available options. Module 3 includes 50 election studies conducted in 41 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 4''' was conducted between 2011 and 2016 and focuses on distributional politics and social protection. The main topics investigated are voters’ preferences for public policy and the mediating factors of political institutions and voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segments about module 1 to module 4: [http://www.gesis.org/en/services/data-analysis/survey-data/rdc-international-survey-programs/cses], accessed June 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Module 4 includes 45 election studies conducted in 39 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 5''' is conducted between 2016 and 2021 and focuses on the electorate's attitudes towards political elites, on the one hand, and towards "out groups", on the other hand. It thus enables research on attitudes and voting behavior in the context of a rise of parties campaigning on anti-establishment messages and in opposition to "out groups".&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segment about module 5: [http://www.csesblog.org/2016/09/announcing-cses-module-5/], accessed June 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete table of all variables available across modules can be found on the CSES website.

A frequently updated election study table across all modules can be found on the CSES website.

== Data access ==

CSES data are available publicly and are free of charge. Data releases are non-proprietary – in other words the data are made available to the public without preferential or advance access to anyone. Data is available in multiple formats including for common statistical packages like STATA, SPSS, SAS and R. The data can be downloaded from the CSES website as well as via the GESIS data catalogue. The GESIS online analysis tool ZACAT can furthermore be used to browse and explore the dataset.

==Organizational structure and funding==

===The CSES Secretariat===

In conjunction with national election study collaborators, the CSES Secretariat administers the CSES project. It consists of staff from the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany and the University of Michigan, Ann-Arbor in the United States. The Secretariat is responsible for compiling the final CSES dataset by harmonizing the single country studies into a cross-national dataset. It is also responsible for collecting the district and macro data, for data documentation, and for ensuring data quality. The Secretariat, furthermore, maintains the CSES website, promotes the project, provides support to the user community, and organizes conferences and project meetings.

===The Planning Committee, collaborators and the CSES Plenary===

The CSES research agenda, study design, and questionnaires are developed by an international committee of leading scholars in political science, sociology, and survey methodology. This committee is known as the CSES Planning Committee. At the beginning of each new module a new Planning Committee is established. Nominations for the Planning Committee come from the user community, with membership of the Committee then being approved by the CSES Plenary Meeting. The Plenary Meeting is made up of national collaborators from each national election study involved in the CSES. Ideas for new modules can be submitted by anyone. More information on the current planning committee, its members, and subcommittee reports, as well as on past Planning Committees can be found on the CSES website. A list of country collaborators which participate in CSES can also be found on the CSES website.

===Funding and support===

The work of the CSES Secretariat is funded by the American [[National Science Foundation]], the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and the [[University of Michigan]]’s Center for Political Studies along with in-kind support from participating election studies, additional organizations that sponsor planning meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that fund election studies by CSES collaborators.

==Klingemann Prize==

Each year, the CSES awards the GESIS Klingemann Prize for the best CSES scholarship (paper, book, dissertation, or other scholarly work, broadly defined). The award is sponsored by the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and is named in honor of Professor Dr. Hans-Dieter Klingemann, co-founder of the CSES, an internationally renowned political scientist who made significant contributions to cross-national electoral research. Nominated works must make extensive use of CSES and have a publication date in the calendar year prior to the award, either in print or online.

'''Concordance''', as used in [[genetics]], usually means the presence of the same [[Trait (biological)|trait]] in both members of a pair of [[twins]].  However, the strict definition is ''the probability that a pair of individuals will both have a certain characteristic, given that one of the pair has the characteristic.'' For example, twins are concordant when both have or both lack a given trait.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lewontin, ''Human Diversity''. (Scientific American Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal example of concordance is that of [[identical twins]].

==Twin studies==
A [[twin study]] compares the concordance rate of identical twins to that of fraternal twins. This can help suggest whether a disease or a certain trait has a genetic cause. Controversial uses of twin data have looked at concordance rates for [[homosexuality]] and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

Because identical twins are genetically virtually identical, it follows that a genetic pattern carried by one would very likely also be carried by the other. If a characteristic identified in one twin is caused by a certain gene, then it would also very likely be present in the other twin. Thus, the concordance rate of a given characteristic helps suggest whether or to what extent a characteristic  is related to genetics.

There are several problems with this assumption:
#A given genetic pattern may not have 100% [[penetrance]], in which case it may have different [[phenotype|phenotypic]] consequences in genetically identical individuals;
#Developmental and environmental conditions may be different for genetically identical individuals. If developmental and environmental conditions contribute to the development of the disease or other characteristic, there can be differences in the outcome of genetically identical individuals;
#The logic is further complicated if the characteristic is [[polygenic]], i.e., caused by differences in more than one gene.
#[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic]] effects can alter the genetic expressions in twins through varied factors. The expression of the epigenetic effect is typically weakest when the twins are young and increases as the identical twins grow older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Inherent-similarities-in-identical-twins-may-not-be-so-strong-3891-1/|title=Inherent similarities in identical twins may not be so strong ( Identical twins may be more different f...)|website=www.bio-medicine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Where in the absence of one or more environmental factors a condition will not develop in an individual, even with high concordance rates, the proximate cause is environmental, with strong genetic influence: thus "a substantial role of genetic factors does not preclude the possibility that the development of the disease can be modified by environmental intervention." So "genetic factors are assumed to contribute to the development of that disease", but cannot be assumed alone to be causal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/3/493|title=Increased Concordance of Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Identical Twins|first1=Simon Francis|last1=Thomsen|first2=Lone Graff|last2=Stensballe|first3=Axel|last3=Skytthe|first4=Kirsten Ohm|last4=Kyvik|first5=Vibeke|last5=Backer|first6=Hans|last6=Bisgaard|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=121|issue=3|pages=493–496|via=pediatrics.aappublications.org|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-1889|pmid=18310197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genotyping studies ==
In [[genotyping]] studies where DNA is directly assayed for positions of variance (see [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]), concordance is a measure of the percentage of [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] that are measured as identical.  Samples from the same individual or identical twins theoretically have a concordance of 100%, but due to assaying errors and [[somatic mutation]]s, they are usually found in the range of 99% to 99.95%.  Concordance can therefore be used as a method of assessing the accuracy of a [[genotyping]] [[assay]] platform.

Because a child inherits half of his or her [[DNA]] from each parent, parents and children, siblings, and [[fraternal twins|fraternal]] (dizygotic) twins have a concordance that averages 50% using this measure.

A '''''condaghe''''' (&lt;small&gt;also spelled as&lt;/small&gt; ''condache'' &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; ''condake'', {{IPA-srd|konˈdaɣe}}; &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; ''fundaghe''), from the medieval [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] term ''kondake'' (from {{lang-grc-x-byzant|κοντάκιον|[[kontákion]]|the pole around which a scroll is wound}}), was a kind of administrative document used in the [[Sardinia]]n [[Giudicati|judicates]] between the 11th and 13th centuries. They are one of the earliest witnesses for the development of the Sardinian language and are an important source for historians of medieval Sardinia.

The original ''condaghes'' ({{lang-it|condaghi}}) were collections of acts of donations to churches or monasteries. Later ''condaghes'' were kept by noble families for recording inheritances, purchases, donations (''datura''), transactions (''tramutu'') and litigation (''kertu''), principally when relating to the church. The chief object of such records was to provide precise dates in case of legal dispute.

Physically, the first ''condaghes'' were scrolls: overlapping parchment manuscripts wound tightly around a ''kontákion''. Over time they took on the familiar form of a [[codex]] (like modern books). They were produced in the [[scriptoria]] of monasteries and cathedrals, but the great majority have been lost. Only some ''condaghes'' have been preserved, with most of them being of ecclesiastical kind like the ''condaghes'' of the monasteries of [[Santa Maria di Bonarcado]] (''Sancte Marie de Monarcanto'' or ''Bonorcadu''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/pubblicazioni/pdf/cfsvirdis/bonarcado_edizione.pdf Condaghe of Saint Mary of Bonarcado]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[San Michele di Salvennor]] (''San Miguel de Salvennor'', the document of which we have only a translation into Spanish from an original Sardinian copy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/pubblicazioni/pdf/cfssalvennor/salvennor_condaghe.pdf Condaghe of Saint Miguel de Salvennor]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[San Nicola di Trullas]] (''Sanctu Nichola de Trullas''), [[San Pietro in Silki]] (''Sanctu Petru de Silki''), and of the [[Basilica of San Gavino]] (''Sanctu Gavinu''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/files/documenti/pubblicazioni_pdf/cfssangavino/02condaghe.pdf Condaghe of Saint Gavin]&lt;/ref&gt;). There is only a single condaghe of laical kind left, the one of Judge [[Barisone II of Logudoro]].

An '''EPPO code''', formerly known as a '''Bayer code''', is an [[encoding|encoded]] identifier that is used by the [[European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization]] (EPPO), in a system designed to uniquely identify [[organism]]s – namely [[plant]]s, [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[pathogen]]s – that are important to [[agriculture]] and [[crop protection]].  EPPO codes are a core component of a [[database]] of names, both scientific and [[vernacular name|vernacular]].  Although originally started by the [[Bayer Corporation]], the official list of codes is now maintained by EPPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPPO Codes: view a presentation|url=http://www.eppo.int/DATABASES/GD&amp;Codes/EPPO_Codesweb2015.pdf|publisher=[[European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization]]|accessdate=10 June 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EPPO code database==
All codes and their associated names are included in a database (EPPO Global Database). In total, there are over 68,500 [[species]] listed in the EPPO database, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPPO Codes: a brief description|url=http://www.eppo.int/DATABASES/GD&amp;Codes/A4_EPPO_Codes_2015.pdf|publisher=[[European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization]]|accessdate=8 June 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 36,000 species of plants (e.g. [[cultivar|cultivated]], wild plants and [[weed]]s)
* 24,000 species of animals (e.g. [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[rodent]]s), biocontrol agents
* 8,500 microorganism species (e.g. [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[virus]]es, viroids and virus-like)

Plants are identified by a five-letter code, other organisms by a six-letter one. In many cases the codes are [[mnemonic]] abbreviations of the [[scientific name]] of the organism, derived from the first three or four letters of the [[genus]] and the first two letters of the [[species]].&lt;ref name=eppo&gt;{{cite web |title=EPPO Codes |url=https://www.eppo.int/RESOURCES/eppo_databases/eppo_codes |website=www.eppo.int |publisher=EPPO |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, corn, or maize (''[[Zea mays]]''), was assigned the code "ZEAMA"; the code for potato late blight (''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'') is "PHYTIN". The unique and constant code for each organism provides a shorthand method of recording specie. The EPPO code avoids many of the problems caused by revisions to scientific names and taxonomy which often result in different synonyms being in use for the same species. When the taxonomy changes, the EPPO code stays the same.&lt;ref name=eppo/&gt; The EPPO system is used by governmental organizations, conservation agencies, and researchers.&lt;ref name="francis2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Francis |first1=A |last2=Warwick |first2=S I |title=The Biology of Canadian Weeds. 142.

The '''Eden Project''' ({{lang-kw|Edenva}}) is a popular visitor attraction in [[Cornwall]], England, UK. Inside the two biomes are plants that are collected from many diverse climates and environments. The project is located in a reclaimed [[china clay]] [[clay pit|pit]], located {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from the town of [[St Blazey]] and {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the larger town of [[St Austell]].&lt;ref name="osexp1"&gt;Ordnance Survey (2005). ''OS Explorer Map 107 – Fowey, Looe &amp; Lostwithiel''. {{ISBN|0-319-23708-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is dominated by two huge enclosures consisting of adjoining domes that house thousands of plant [[species]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/come-and-visit/whats-here/rainforest-biome/index.php | title = Rainforest Biome | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and each enclosure emulates a natural [[biome]]. The biomes consist of hundreds of [[hexagon]]al and [[pentagon]]al, inflated, plastic cells supported by steel frames. The largest of the two biomes simulates a [[rainforest]] environment and the second, a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean environment]]. The attraction also has an outside [[botanical garden]] which is home to many plants and wildlife native to Cornwall and the UK in general; it also has many plants that provide an important and interesting backstory, for example, those with a prehistoric heritage.

== Design and construction ==
The project was conceived by [[Tim Smit]] and designed by architect [[Nicholas Grimshaw]] and engineering firm Anthony Hunt and Associates (now part of [[Sinclair Knight Merz]]). [[Davis Langdon]] carried out the project management, [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] and [[Alfred McAlpine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/our-history/index.php | title = Our history | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 27 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; did the construction, [[Mero-Schmidlin|MERO]] designed and built the biomes, and [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] was the services engineer, economic consultant, environmental engineer and transportation engineer. [[Land use]] consultants led the masterplan and landscape design. The project took 2½ years to construct and opened to the public on 17 March 2001.

Once into the attraction, there is a meandering path with views of the two biomes, planted landscapes, including vegetable gardens, and sculptures that include a giant [[bee]] and previously The [[WEEE]] Man (removed in 2016), a towering figure made from old electrical appliances and was meant to represent the average electrical waste used by one person in a lifetime.

=== Biomes ===
At the bottom of the pit are two covered [[biome]]s:

The Tropical Biome, covers {{convert|1.56|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It is used for tropical plants, such as fruiting banana plants, [[Coffea|coffee]], rubber and giant [[bamboo]], and is kept at a tropical temperature and moisture level.
[[File:The Tropical Biome.jpg|thumb|The Tropical Biome]]

The [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] Biome covers {{convert|0.654|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|65|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|135|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It houses familiar warm [[temperate]] and [[arid]] plants such as [[olive]]s and grape [[vine]]s and various sculptures.

The Outdoor Gardens represent the temperate regions of the world with plants such as tea, [[lavender]], [[hops]], [[hemp]] and [[sunflower]]s, as well as local plant species.

The covered biomes are constructed from a tubular steel (hex-tri-hex) with mostly hexagonal external cladding panels made from the thermoplastic [[ETFE]]. Glass was avoided due to its weight and potential dangers. The cladding panels themselves are created from several layers of thin [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-transparent ETFE [[Tensile structure|film]], which are sealed around their [[perimeter]] and inflated to create a large cushion. The resulting cushion acts as a thermal blanket to the structure. The ETFE material is resistant to most stains, which simply wash off in the rain. If required, cleaning can be performed by [[abseil]]ers. Although the ETFE is susceptible to punctures, these can be easily fixed with ETFE tape. The structure is completely self-supporting, with no internal supports, and takes the form of a [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] structure. The panels vary in size up to {{convert|9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} across, with the largest at the top of the structure.

The ETFE technology was supplied and installed by the firm [[Vector Foiltec]], which is also responsible for ongoing maintenance of the cladding. The steel spaceframe and cladding package (with Vector Foiltec as ETFE subcontractor) was designed, supplied and installed by MERO (UK) PLC, who also jointly developed the overall scheme geometry with the architect, Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners.

The entire build project was managed by McAlpine Joint Venture.

=== The Core ===
[[File:The Core, Eden Project.JPG|thumb|The Core]]
The Core is the latest addition to the site and opened in September 2005. It provides the Eden Project with an education facility, incorporating classrooms and exhibition spaces designed to help communicate Eden's central message about the relationship between people and plants. Accordingly, the building has taken its inspiration from plants, most noticeable in the form of the soaring timber roof, which gives the building its distinctive shape.

Grimshaw developed the geometry of the copper-clad roof in collaboration with a sculptor, Peter Randall-Page, and Mike Purvis of structural engineers [[Sinclair Knight Merz|SKM Anthony Hunts]]. It is derived from [[phyllotaxis]], which is the mathematical basis for nearly all plant growth; the "opposing spirals" found in many plants such as the seeds in a sunflower's head, [[pine cone]]s and [[pineapple]]s. The copper was obtained from traceable sources, and the Eden Project is working with [[Rio Tinto Group]] to explore the possibility of encouraging further traceable supply routes for metals, which would enable users to avoid metals mined unethically. The services and [[Acoustics|acoustic]], mechanical and electrical engineering design was carried out by [[Buro Happold]].

==== Art at The Core ====
[[File:The Seed at Eden Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=0.6|''Seed'' by Peter Randall-Page]]
The Core is also home to art exhibitions throughout the year. A permanent installation entitled ''Seed'', by [[Peter Randall-Page]], occupies the anteroom. ''Seed'' is a large, 70 tonne egg-shaped stone installation standing some {{convert|13|ft}} tall and displaying a complex pattern of protrusions that are based upon the [[Fibonacci number#In nature|geometric and mathematical principles that underlie plant growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Granite seed is 'planted' at Eden | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2007-06-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6738783.stm | access-date = 2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/visit/whats-here/seed-sculpture | title = Seed sculpture by Peter Randall-Page | publisher = Eden Project | access-date = 2018-02-25 | quote = Made out of a single piece of granite, its surface has been carved with 1,800 nodes in the pattern of a Fibonacci spiral – the growth pattern found across the natural world in things like sunflowers, pine cones and ammonites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental aspects ==
[[File:Cornwall, eden project tropical.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the tropical Biome]]
The domes provide diverse growing conditions, and many plants are on display.

The Eden Project includes [[environmental education]] focusing on the interdependence of plants and people; plants are labelled with their medicinal uses. The massive amounts of water required to create the humid conditions of the Tropical Biome, and to serve the toilet facilities, are all sanitised rain water that would otherwise collect at the bottom of the quarry. The only [[Public utility|mains]] water used is for hand washing and for cooking. The complex also uses Green Tariff Electricity – the energy comes from one of the many [[wind turbine]]s in Cornwall, which were among the first in Europe.

Controversially, one of the companies the Eden Project currently partners with is the British mining company Rio Tinto Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/media/mining-book-pr.php|title=New Eden Project book shows what can be done with disused mines|publisher=Eden project}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}

In December 2010 the Eden Project received permission to build a [[geothermal electricity]] plant which will generate approx 4MWe, enough to supply Eden and about 5000 households.&lt;ref name="BBC Geotherm"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-12026753|title=BBC News – Eden Project geothermal plant plans to go ahead |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 December 2010|date=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Equus eden.jpg|thumb|Driftwood sculpture of a horse by Heather Jansch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heatherjansch.com/index.php|title=Heather Jansch Sculptor Bronze &amp; Driftwood Horse|publisher=Heather Jansch}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the main entrance]]

[[File:Grasswoman eden.jpg|thumb|''Eve'', by Sue and Pete Hill, shaped from the soil]]

The clay pit in which the project is sited was in use for over 160 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/about-us/our-story |title=Our Story |publisher=Eden Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712023922/http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/about-us/our-story |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the pit was used by the BBC as the planet surface of Magrathea in the 1981 TV series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/hitchhikers-guide-galaxy-douglas-adams | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jenny | last=Turner | title=Does the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy still answer the ultimate question? | date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s the pit was all but exhausted.&lt;ref name="edenproject.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/10th-birthday/10th-birthday-timeline|title=Eden story, educational charity – Eden Project, Cornwall|publisher=Eden Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial idea for the project dates back to 1996, with construction beginning in 1998. The work was hampered by torrential rain in the first few months of the project, and parts of the pit flooded as it sits {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the water table.&lt;ref name="edenproject.com" /&gt;

The first part of the Eden Project, the visitor centre, opened to the public in May 2000. The first plants began arriving in September of that year,&lt;ref name="edenproject.com" /&gt; and the full site opened on 17 March 2001.

The Eden Project was used as a filming location for the 2002 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Die Another Day]]''. On 2 July 2005 The Eden Project hosted the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|"Africa Calling" concert]] of the [[Live 8]] concert series.  It has also provided some plants for the [[British Museum]]'s Africa garden.

In 2005, the Project launched "A Time of Gifts" for the winter months, November to February. This features an ice rink covering the lake, with a small café/bar attached, as well as a Christmas market. Cornish choirs regularly perform in the biomes.

On 6 December 2007, the Eden Project invited people all over Cornwall to try to break the [[world record]] for the biggest ever [[pub quiz]] as part of its campaign to bring £50 million of [[lottery]] funds to Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edenproject.com/about/3200.html |title=About |publisher=Eden Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226181304/http://www.edenproject.com/about/3200.html |archivedate=26 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the project failed in its bid for £50 million of funding, after the [[Big Lottery Fund]] popular vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7140621.stm | publisher= BBC News | date= 12 December 2007 | title= Routes scheme tops lottery vote | accessdate= 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
when it received just 12.07% of the votes, the lowest for the four projects being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/prog_the_peoples_50_million.htm | publisher= The Big Lottery Fund | title= The People's 50 Million – Sustrans' Connect2 wins £50 million prize | accessdate= 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eden wanted the money for Edge, a proposed [[desert]] biome that was going to look at people and plants living on the edge today and the solutions that they have come up with to the challenge of living within limits.&lt;ref name=BigLottery&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/global-content/press-releases/england/south-west/eden-edges-closer-to-winning-lottery-millions | title=Eden edges closer to winning Lottery millions: Big Lottery Fund |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, much of the project, including both greenhouses, became available to navigate through [[Google Street View]].

The Eden Trust revealed a trading loss of £1.3 million for 2012-13, on a turnover of £25.4 million. The Eden Project had posted a surplus of £136,000 for the previous year. In 2014 Eden accounts showed a surplus of £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/St-Austell-8217-s-Eden-Project-black/story-21239280-detail/story.html#ixzz3df3N6sV2|title=St Austell’s Eden Project|date=15 June 2014|publisher=[[Cornish Guardian]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210710/http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/St-Austell-8217-s-Eden-Project-black/story-21239280-detail/story.html#ixzz3df3N6sV2|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pasty Championships]] have been held at the Eden Project since 2012, an international competition to find the best [[Cornish pasties]] and other pasty-type savoury snacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|World Pasty Championships winners chosen}}

The Eden Project is said to have contributed over £1 billion to the Cornish economy.&lt;ref name=personally&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/tim-smit-kbe-sir/ | title=Tim Smit KBE, Sir – Personally Speaking Bureau |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eden Project received 1,024,156 visitors in 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALVA - Association of Leading Visitor Attractions|url=http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423|website=www.alva.org.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estonian Theatre and Music Museum''' is a national museum located in the old town of [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].  The museum was established in 1924.&lt;ref name=Muuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.muuseum.ee/en/muuseumid/eesti_muuseumid/keskmuuseumid?action=details&amp;museum_id=24|publisher=Muuseum|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Visit Estonia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.visitestonia.com/en/estonian-theatre-and-music-museum|publisher=Visit Estonia|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=all-about-estonia.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Information about national and thematic museums in Estonia|url=http://www.all-about-estonia.com/museums-in-estonia.html|publisher=all-about-estonia.com|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Estonian Theatre and Music Museum was established in 1924. Estonian music composer [[Peeter Süda]] made a huge collection of musical instruments, notes, books and other things. The purpose behind establishing this was preserving his collections.&lt;ref name=Culture.ee&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.culture.ee/location/estonian-theatre-and-music-museum|publisher=Culture.ee|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IYP&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre &amp; Music Museum|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/estonia/tallinn/sightseeing/museums/Estonian-Theatre-and-Music-Museum_7009v|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The museum has a large collection of musical and theatrical instruments and props made by local craftsmen and made outside Estonia.&lt;ref name="Visit Estonia" /&gt; The museum has two main departments— music department and theatre department. The music department has musical instruments and hand-written songs and notes of notable music composers. The theatre department provides an overview of the Estonian theatre. There are collections of old theatre photos, costumes and documents. The museum has a separate library.&lt;ref name=Culture.ee /&gt;

'''Fault tolerance''' is the property that enables a [[system]] to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some (one or more faults within) of its components. If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a native designed system in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in [[high-availability]] or [[life-critical system]]s.  The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as '''graceful degradation'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&amp;context=cs_faculty_pubs Adaptive Fault Tolerance and Graceful Degradation], Oscar González et al., 1997, University of Massachusetts - Amherst&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fault-tolerant design''' enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system [[failure|fails]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. W. (1984). "Fault-Tolerant Microprocessor-Based Systems", IEEE Micro, vol. 4, no. 6, pp. 6–21&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly used to describe [[computer system]]s designed to continue more or less fully operational with, perhaps, a reduction in [[throughput]] or an increase in [[response time (technology)|response time]] in the event of some partial failure. That is, the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the [[computer hardware|hardware]] or the [[software]]. An example in another field is a motor vehicle designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured, or a structure that is able to retain its integrity in the presence of damage due to causes such as [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[corrosion]], manufacturing flaws, or impact.

Within the scope of an ''individual'' system, fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them, and, in general, aiming for [[self-stabilization]] so that the system converges towards an error-free state. However, if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic, or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high, a better solution may be to use some form of duplication. In any case, if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic, the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode. This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop.

==Terminology==

[[Image:Graceful Degradation of Transparency.png|thumb|256px|right|An example of graceful degradation by design in an image with transparency. The top two images are each the result of viewing the composite image in a viewer that recognises transparency. The bottom two images are the result in a viewer with no support for transparency. Because the transparency mask (center bottom) is discarded, only the overlay (center top) remains; the image on the left has been designed to degrade gracefully, hence is still meaningful without its transparency information.]]
A highly fault-tolerant system might continue at the same level of performance even though one or more components have failed.  For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid power fails.

A system that is designed to [[fail safe]], or fail-secure, or '''fail gracefully''', whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely, does so in a way that protects people, property, or data from injury, damage, intrusion, or disclosure.  In computers, a program might fail-safe by executing a [[graceful exit]] (as opposed to an uncontrolled crash) in order to prevent data corruption after experiencing an error.  A similar distinction is made between "failing well" and "[[failing badly]]".

[[Fail-deadly]] is the opposite strategy, which can be used in weapon systems that are designed to kill or injure targets even if part of the system is damaged or destroyed.

A system that is designed to experience '''graceful degradation''', or to '''fail soft''' (used in computing, similar to "fail safe"&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, W (2009): Operating Systems. Internals and Design Principles'', sixth edition&lt;/ref&gt;) operates at a reduced level of performance after some component failures.  For example, a building may operate lighting at reduced levels and elevators at reduced speeds if grid power fails, rather than either trapping people in the dark completely or continuing to operate at full power.  In computing an example of graceful degradation is that if insufficient network bandwidth is available to stream an online video, a lower-resolution version might be streamed in place of the high-resolution version.  [[Progressive enhancement]] is an example in computing, where web pages are available in a basic functional format for older, small-screen, or limited-capability web browsers, but in an enhanced version for browsers capable of handling additional technologies or that have a larger display available.

In [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s, programs that are considered [[Robustness (computer science)|robust]] are designed to continue operation despite an error, exception, or invalid input, instead of crashing completely.  [[Software brittleness]] is the opposite of robustness.  [[Resilience (network)|Resilient networks]] continue to transmit data despite the failure of some links or nodes; [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilient buildings and infrastructure]] are likewise expected to prevent complete failure in situations like earthquakes, floods, or collisions.

A system with high [[failure transparency]] will alert users that a component failure has occurred, even if it continues to operate with full performance, so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated.  Likewise, a [[fail-fast]] component is designed to report at the first point of failure, rather than allow downstream components to fail and generate reports then.  This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem, and may prevent improper operation in a broken state.

==Redundancy==
{{main article|Redundancy (engineering)}}
Redundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment.&lt;ref&gt;Laprie, J. C. (1985). "Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance: Concepts and Terminology", Proceedings of 15th International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing (FTSC-15), pp. 2–11&lt;/ref&gt;
This can consist of backup components that automatically "kick in" if one component fails. For example, large cargo trucks can lose a tire without any major consequences. They have many tires, and no one tire is critical (with the exception of the front tires, which are used to steer, but generally carry less load, each and in total, than the other four to 16, so are less likely to fail).
The idea of incorporating redundancy in order to improve the reliability of a system was pioneered by [[John von Neumann]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J. (1956). "Probabilistic Logics and Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Components", in Automata Studies, eds. C. Shannon and J. McCarthy,  Princeton University Press, pp. 43–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Two kinds of redundancy are possible:&lt;ref&gt;Avizienis, A. (1976). "Fault-Tolerant Systems", IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol. 25, no. 12, pp. 1304–1312&lt;/ref&gt; space redundancy and time redundancy. Space redundancy provides additional components, functions, or data items that are unnecessary for fault-free operation.  Space redundancy is further classified into hardware, software and information redundancy, depending on the type of redundant resources added to the system.  In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short.

==Criteria==
Providing fault-tolerant design for every component is normally not an option. Associated redundancy brings a number of penalties: increase in weight, size, power consumption, cost, as well as time to design, verify, and test. Therefore, a number of choices have to be examined to determine which components should be fault tolerant:&lt;ref&gt;Dubrova, E. (2013). "Fault-Tolerant Design", Springer, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4614-2112-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''How critical is the component?''' In a car, the radio is not critical, so this component has less need for fault tolerance.
* '''How likely is the component to fail?''' Some components, like the drive shaft in a car, are not likely to fail, so no fault tolerance is needed.
* '''How expensive is it to make the component fault tolerant?''' Requiring a redundant car engine, for example, would likely be too expensive both economically and in terms of weight and space, to be considered.

An example of a component that passes all the tests is a car's occupant restraint system. While we do not normally think of the ''primary'' occupant restraint system, it is [[gravity]]. If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before [[seat belt]]s, so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically and in terms of weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other "supplemental restraint systems", such as [[airbag]]s, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.

Another excellent and long-term example of this principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe in the form of the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The culmulatively unlikely combination of total footbrake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case.

In comparison with the footpedal activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is being used as a one-time backup for the footbrake, will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as there is no need for them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt.

On motorcycles, a similar level of fail-safety is provided by simpler methods; firstly the front and rear brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and grippier, and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance.

==Requirements==

The basic characteristics of fault tolerance require:

# No [[single point of failure]] – If a system experiences a failure, it must continue to operate without interruption during the repair process.
# [[Fault isolation]] to the failing component – When a failure occurs, the system must be able to isolate the failure to the offending component. This requires the addition of dedicated failure detection mechanisms that exist only for the purpose of fault isolation. Recovery from a fault condition requires classifying the fault or failing component. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) categorizes faults based on locality, cause, duration, and effect.{{Where|date=June 2017}}{{clarify|date=June 2017}}
# Fault containment to prevent propagation of the failure – Some failure mechanisms can cause a system to fail by propagating the failure to the rest of the system. An example of this kind of failure is the "rogue transmitter" that can swamp legitimate communication in a system and cause overall system failure. [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]]s or other mechanisms that isolate a rogue transmitter or failing component to protect the system are required.
# Availability of [[Reversion (software development)|reversion modes]]{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

In addition, fault-tolerant systems are characterized in terms of both planned service outages and unplanned service outages. These are usually measured at the application level and not just at a hardware level. The figure of merit is called [[availability]] and is expressed as a percentage. For example, a [[5 nines|five nines]] system would statistically provide 99.999% availability.

Fault-tolerant systems are typically based on the concept of redundancy.

==Replication==

Spare components address the first fundamental characteristic of fault tolerance in three ways:
* [[Replication (computer science)|Replication]]: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem, directing tasks or requests to all of them in [[parallel computing|parallel]], and choosing the correct result on the basis of a [[quorum]];
* [[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundancy]]: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one of the remaining instances in case of a failure ([[failover]]);
* Diversity: Providing multiple ''different'' implementations of the same specification, and using them like replicated systems to cope with errors in a specific implementation.

All implementations of [[RAID]], [[RAID|redundant array of independent disks]], except RAID 0, are examples of a fault-tolerant [[data storage device|storage device]] that uses [[data redundancy]].

A [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each [[replication (computing)|replication]], and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed [[dual modular redundancy|dual modular redundant]] (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods. A machine with three replications of each element is termed [[triple modular redundancy|triple modular redundant]] (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.

[[Lockstep (computing)|Lockstep]] fault-tolerant machines are most easily made fully [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]], with each gate of each replication making the same state transition on the same edge of the clock, and the clocks to the replications being exactly in phase. However, it is possible to build lockstep systems without this requirement.

Bringing the replications into synchrony requires making their internal stored states the same. They can be started from a fixed initial state, such as the reset state. Alternatively, the internal state of one replica can be copied to another replica.

One variant of DMR is '''pair-and-spare'''. Two replicated elements operate in lockstep as a pair, with a voting circuit that detects any mismatch between their operations and outputs a signal indicating that there is an error. Another pair operates exactly the same way. A final circuit selects the output of the pair that does not proclaim that it is in error. Pair-and-spare requires four replicas rather than the three of TMR, but has been used commercially.

==Disadvantages==
Fault-tolerant design's advantages are obvious, while many of its disadvantages are not:

* '''Interference with fault detection in the same component.''' To continue the above passenger vehicle example, with either of the fault-tolerant systems it may not be obvious to the driver when a tire has been punctured. This is usually handled with a separate "automated fault-detection system". In the case of the tire, an air pressure monitor detects the loss of pressure and notifies the driver. The alternative is a "manual fault-detection system", such as manually inspecting all tires at each stop.
* '''Interference with fault detection in another component.''' Another variation of this problem is when fault tolerance in one component prevents fault detection in a different component. For example, if component B performs some operation based on the output from component A, then fault tolerance in B can hide a problem with A. If component B is later changed (to a less fault-tolerant design) the system may fail suddenly, making it appear that the new component B is the problem. Only after the system has been carefully scrutinized will it become clear that the root problem is actually with component A.
* '''Reduction of priority of fault correction.''' Even if the operator is aware of the fault, having a fault-tolerant system is likely to reduce the importance of repairing the fault. If the faults are not corrected, this will eventually lead to system failure, when the fault-tolerant component fails completely or when all redundant components have also failed.
* '''Test difficulty.''' For certain critical fault-tolerant systems, such as a [[nuclear reactor]], there is no easy way to verify that the backup components are functional. The most infamous example of this is [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], where operators tested the emergency backup cooling by disabling primary and secondary cooling. The backup failed, resulting in a core meltdown and massive release of radiation.
* '''Cost.''' Both fault-tolerant components and redundant components tend to increase cost. This can be a purely economic cost or can include other measures, such as weight. [[Human spaceflight|Manned spaceships]], for example, have so many redundant and fault-tolerant components that their weight is increased dramatically over unmanned systems, which don't require the same level of safety.
* '''Inferior components.''' A fault-tolerant design may allow for the use of inferior components, which would have otherwise made the system inoperable.  While this practice has the potential to mitigate the cost increase, use of multiple inferior components may lower the reliability of the system to a level equal to, or even worse than, a comparable non-fault-tolerant system.

==Examples==
Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires that broken parts be taken out and replaced with new parts while the system is still operational (in computing known as ''[[hot swapping]]''). Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as '''single point tolerant''', and represents the vast majority of fault-tolerant systems. In such systems the [[mean time between failure]]s should be long enough for the operators to have time to fix the broken devices ([[mean time to repair]]) before the backup also fails. It helps if the time between failures is as long as possible, but this is not specifically required in a fault-tolerant system.

Fault tolerance is notably successful in computer applications. [[Tandem Computers]] built their entire business on such machines, which used single-point tolerance to create their [[NonStop]] systems with [[uptime]]s measured in years.

Fail-safe architectures may encompass also the computer software, for example by process [[replication (computer science)|replication]].

Data formats may also be designed to degrade gracefully. [[HTML]] for example, is designed to be [[forward compatibility|forward compatible]], allowing new HTML entities to be ignored by [[Web browser]]s that do not understand them without causing the document to be unusable.

==Related terms==
There is a difference between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the [[Western Electric]] [[Crossbar switch|crossbar]] systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and therefore were highly ''fault resistant''. But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and therefore were not ''fault tolerant''.

[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|thumb|right|The full Moon as viewed through a {{convert|9.25|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope]]. The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]
[[File:Lunar eclipse January 31 2018 California Alfredo Garcia Jr mideclipse.jpg|thumb|The full Moon during the total [[January 2018 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse of 31 January 2018]]]]

The '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (planets)|differ by 180°]]). This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth – the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] – is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk, while the [[far side of the Moon|far side]] is dark. The full moon occurs once roughly every [[month]].

When the Moon moves into [[Earth's shadow]], a [[lunar eclipse]] occurs, during which all or part of the Moon's face may appear reddish due to the [[Rayleigh scattering]] of blue wavelengths and the [[atmospheric refraction|refraction]] of [[sunlight]] through [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. Kenneth |last=Seidelmann |date=2005 |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |isbn=0-935702-68-7 |chapter=Phases of the Moon |publisher=University Science Books |page=478 |quote=They are the times when the excess of the Moon's apparent geocentric ecliptic longitude λ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; over the Sun's apparent geocentric ecliptic longitude is 0, 90, 180, or 270 ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celestial Alignment without Lunar Eclipse; from google (full moon earth block sunlight) result 2 |url=http://people.bu.edu/sscruggs/earthandmoon3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=tilted from the ecliptic by about 5 degrees; from google (full moon earth block sunlight) result 3 |url=http://www2.astro.psu.edu/users/rbc/a1/lec3n.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lunar eclipses happen only during full moon and around points on [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]] where the [[natural satellite|satellite]] may pass through the planet's shadow. A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14° with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs approximately every 6 months and often 2 weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during [[new moon]] around the opposite node.

The interval period between a new or full moon and the next same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a lunar month may be either 29 or 30 days long.

==Characteristics==
A full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). Its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing has stopped. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.

Many [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when used in a different [[time zone]].

Full moon is generally a suboptimal time to conduct [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon then [[skyglow|outshines]] the [[apparent magnitude|apparently dimmer]] stars.

On 12 December 2008, the full moon occurred [[apogee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time for the previous 15 years, called a [[supermoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work= Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2011, another full supermoon occurred, closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2016, a full supermoon occurred closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 68 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formula ===
The date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349–354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \times N + 102.026 \times 10^{-12} \times N^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':
: &lt;math&gt;-0.000739 - (235 \times 10^{-12})\times N^2&lt;/math&gt; days
where ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000. The true time of a full moon may differ from this approximation by up to about 14.5 hours as a result of the non-circularity of the moon's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Meeus | first = Jean | chapter = The Duration of the Lunation |title= More Mathematical Astronomy Morsels | publisher = Willmann-Bell |location=Richmond, Virginia| date = 2002 | pages = 19–31 | isbn = 0-943396-74-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[New moon]] for an explanation of the formula and its parameters.

The age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 [[synodic month]]s, which has been referred to as a [[full moon cycle]].

==In folklore and tradition==
{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|Full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]
Full moons are traditionally associated with temporal [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various "magical phenomena" such as [[lycanthropy]]. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full Moon Effect On Behavior Minimal, Studies Say|date=6 February 2004|work=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.   All this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior.

===Full moon names===
Historically, [[month]] names are names of moons (lunations, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendars]]. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as "moon" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] ca. AD 700).

Some full moons have developed new names in modern times, e.g., the [[blue moon]], and the names "harvest moon" and "hunter's moon" for the full moons of autumn.

====Harvest and hunter's moons====
{{anchor|Harvest moon}}{{anchor|Hunter's moon}}
{{Redirect-multi|2|Harvest moon|Hunter's moon}}
[[File:harvest moon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A harvest moon. Its orange color is due to its closeness to the horizon, rather than being unique to harvest moons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.utoronto.ca/harvest-moon/ |title=Why is the harvest moon so big and orange? |date=27 September 2010 |publisher=University of Toronto |last=Percy |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The "harvest moon" and "hunter's moon" are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the [[autumn]], in the northern hemisphere usually in September and October respectively.
The "harvest moon" is the full moon closest to the [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] (22 or 23 September), coming anywhere from two weeks before to two weeks after that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almanac.com/content/what-harvest-moon|title=What is a Harvest Moon?|publisher=[[Old Farmer's Almanac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "hunter's moon" is the full moon following it. The names are recorded from the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See James Ferguson, ''Astronomy explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's principles,: and made easy to those who have not studied mathematics'', 1756, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji1cAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 128]. "harvest moon" is also the cognate of ''herbist-mānod'', the [[Old High German]] name of November
recorded in ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', ch. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entry for "harvest moon" cites a 1706 reference, and for "hunter's moon" a 1710 edition of ''The British Apollo'', where the term is attributed to "the country people" (''The Country People call this the Hunters-Moon.''). The names became traditional in [[American folklore]], where they are now often popularly attributed to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|the Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nightskyinfo.com/sky_highlights/hunters_moon/|title=The Hunter's Moon |last=Neata |first=Emil |work=Night Sky Info |access-date=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Feast of the Hunters' Moon]] is a yearly festival in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], held in late September or early October each year since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.tcha.mus.in.us/feast.htm | title = Feast of the Hunters' Moon | publisher = Tippecanoe County Historical Association | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620084610/http://www.tcha.mus.in.us/feast.htm | archivedate = 2009-06-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Harvest moon occurred on the night of equinox itself (some 5{{fraction|1|2}} hours after the point of equinox) for the first time since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony |last=Phillips |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/22sep_harvestmoon/ |title=Watch out for the Super Harvest Moon |work=NASA Science|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jack|last=Maddox|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-09-22/living/harvest.moon_1_autumn-full-moon-optical-illusion?_s=PM:LIVING|title=Super Harvest Moon: Autumn phenomenon is a rare treat|work=[[CNN]]|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All full moons rise around the time of sunset. Because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed, causing it to rise later each day – on average by about 50.47 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;(1440/(29.531)=50.47 minutes)&lt;/ref&gt; The harvest moon and hunter's moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average. The moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next, as seen from about 40 degrees N or S latitude. (This is because a full moon in September appears to move not straight east but north-east in the sky.) Thus, there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days after the full moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Larry McNish|title=RASC Calgary Centre - Sunset and Moonrise |url=http://calgary.rasc.ca/sunset_moonrise.htm|date=2007}} This gives a graph showing the effect as seen from Calgary, for the whole of the year 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; thus lengthening the time in the evening when there is enough light for men to see to work to get the harvest in.

====Farmers' Almanacs====
The ''[[Maine Farmers' Almanac]]'' from c. the 1930s began to publish Native American "Indian" full moon names. The ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' (since 1955 published in Maine, but not the same publication as the ''Maine Farmers' Almanac'') continues to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An early list of "Indian month names" was published in 1918 by [[Daniel Carter Beard]] in his ''The American Boy's Book of Signs, Signals and Symbols'' for use by the [[Boy Scouts of America|boy scouts]]. Beard's "Indian" month names were:&lt;ref&gt;Beard 1918, pp. 78&amp;ndash;80. "The Indians' Moons naturally vary in the different parts of the country, but by comparing them all and striking an average as near as may be, the moons are reduced to the following"&lt;/ref&gt;
*January: Difficulty, Black Smoke
*February: Raccoon, Bare Spots on the Ground
*March: Wind, Little Grass, Sore-Eye
*April: Ducks, Goose-Eggs
*May: Green Grass, Root-Food
*June: Corn-Planting, Strawberry
*July: Buffalo (Bull), Hot Sun
*August: Harvest, Cow Buffalo
*September: Wild Rice, Red Plum
*October: Leaf-Falling, Nuts
*November: Deer-Mating, Fur-Pelts
*December: Wolves, Big Moon

Such names have gained currency in [[American folklore]]. They appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the Moon.
''Mysteries of the Moon'' by Patricia Haddock ("Great Mysteries Series", Greenhaven Press, 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with.&lt;ref&gt;repeated in ''The Moon Book'' by Kim Long (1998:[https://books.google.com/books?id=e6-ddrk3nxsC&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 102ff.]) Also in ''Llewellyn's 1996 Moon Sign Book'' (1995).
&lt;/ref&gt; Haddock supposes that certain "Colonial American" moon names were adopted from [[Algonquian languages]] (which were formerly spoken in the territory of New England), while others are based in European tradition (e.g., the Colonial American names for the May moon, "Milk Moon", "Mother's Moon", "Hare Moon" have no parallels in the supposed native names, while the name of November, "Beaver Moon" is supposedly based in the Algonquin).

The individual names given in ''Farmers' Almanac'' include:{{clarify|date=May 2013}}&lt;!--treating farmersalmanac.com as the primary source for this. But research is needed, the farmersalmanac.com page is undated, and they seem to be fiddling with it all the time, making up new names as they go along. What should be done here is, each name should be attributed to the earliest known publication in print in such an Almanac.--&gt;
*January: "Wolf Moon" (this is the name of December in Beard 1918)&lt;ref&gt;"Wolf Moon" is attributed to the Algonquin by Haddock (1992); the actual Algonquin name for that moon is ''squochee kesos'' or "sun has not strength to thaw". [https://books.google.com/books?id=wQcQAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;ots=1aiqhDjivK&amp;dq=squochee%20kesos&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The New England historical &amp; genealogical register and antiquarian journal: v. 10] The [[Sioux]] do mention wolves in their name for January, which means "when wolves run together". [http://www.wwu.edu/depts/skywise/indianmoons.html American Indian Moons]; they also refer to that moon as the "moon of the strong cold" or "frost in the teepee". Other tribes had different names for the moons. See also [http://americanindian.net/moons.html Indian Moons, Days &amp; Other Calendar Stuff American Indian Moons]&lt;/ref&gt; also "Old Moon"
*February: "Snow Moon", also "Hunger Moon"
*March: "Worm Moon", "Crow Moon", "Sap Moon", "Lenten Moon"
*April: "Seed Moon", "Pink Moon", "Sprouting Grass Moon", "Egg Moon" (c.f. "Goose-Egg" in Beard 1918), "Fish Moon"
*May: "Milk Moon", "Flower Moon", "Corn Planting Moon"
*June: "Mead Moon", "Strawberry Moon" (c.f. Beard 1918), "Rose Moon", "Thunder Moon"
*July: "Hay Moon", "Buck Moon", "Elk Moon", "Thunder Moon"
*August: "Corn Moon", "Sturgeon Moon", "Red Moon", "Green Corn Moon", "Grain Moon"
*September: "Harvest Moon", "Full Corn Moon",
*October: "Hunter's moon", "Blood Moon"/"Sanguine Moon"
*November: "Beaver Moon", "Frosty Moon"
*December: "Oak Moon", "Cold Moon", "Long Night's Moon"
The Long Night's Moon is the last of the year and the closest to the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/weather/weather-blog/bal-wx-long-nights-moon-comes-on-christmas-for-first-time-since-1977-20151222-story.html Dance, Scott. "'Long Night's Moon' comes on Christmas for first time since 1977," ''The Baltimore Sun'', Wednesday, December 23, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ice moon" is also used to refer to the first full moon of January or February.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/wolf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu full moon festivals===
{{see also|Purnima}}

In Hinduism, most festivals are celebrated on auspicious days. Many of the Hindu festivals are celebrated on days with a full moon at night.
Different parts of India celebrate the same day with different names, as listed below:

==Lunar and lunisolar calendars==
[[File:Christmas full moons 1977-2091.gif|thumb|The December 2015 ''full moon'' coincided with [[Christmas day]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/rare-full-moon-on-christmas-day Rare Full Moon on Christmas Day, NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; This last occurred in 1977, with a Christmas Eve full moon between in 1996 and a full moon the day after Christmas in 2004 and before Christmas Eve in 2007 (both not shown here). A small horizontal [[libration]] is visible comparing their appearances. By the 19-year [[metonic cycle]] the full moon will repeat on Christmas day in 2034, 2053, 2072, and 2091.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-1221-asktom-20151220-column.html Ask Tom: How unusual is a full moon on Christmas Day?]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Lunar calendar}}
Most pre-modern calendars the world over were [[lunisolar]], combining the solar year with the lunation by means of [[intercalary month]]s.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g., {{Cite book| first = Bonnie | last = Blackburn |display-authors=etal| date= 1999 | title = The Oxford Companion to the Year | isbn = 0-19-214231-3| publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Edward M. | last = Reingold |display-authors=etal | date= 2001 | title = Calendrical Calculations: The Millennium Edition | isbn = 0-521-77752-6 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century [[Islamic calendar]] opted for a purely lunar one.

A continuing lunisolar calendar is in the [[Hebrew calendar]]. Evidence of this is noted in the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]] in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. Passover falls on the full moon on 15 Nisan of the Hebrew calendar. The date of the Jewish [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Sukkot]] festivals along with all other [[Jewish holidays]] are dependent on the dates of the new moons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leviticus]] 23:4-7, 33-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercalary months===
{{main|Intercalary month}}
In lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the [[Metonic cycle]], or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the [[Hebrew Calendar]] this is noted with a periodic extra month of [[Adar]] in the early spring.

==== Blue moon====
{{further|Blue moon}}
In the modern system of "traditional" full moon names tied to the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term "blue moon" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).&lt;ref&gt;
The saying "once in a blue moon" meaning "very rarely" is recorded since the 1820s.
The term "blue moon" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a "blue moon" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.&lt;ref&gt;Farmers' Almanac, "What is a blue moon?", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon].&lt;/ref&gt; These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun.   To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 AM on 23 March, 9.15 AM on 22 June, 4.42 PM on 21 September and 12.10 AM on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 AM on 21 March, 11.09 PM on 21 June, 2.42 PM on 23 September and 10.30 AM on 22 December (all times GMT).   Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' magazine, "blue moon" has also been used in the sense of "the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as "erroneous" by ''Sky &amp; Telescope'' in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html ''Sky and Telescope'' "What's a blue moon?"]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to either definition, "blue moons" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of "full moon names" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.

==Introduction==
Geography is a systematic study of the Universe and its features. Traditionally, geography has been associated with [[cartography]] and place names. Although many geographers are trained in [[toponymy]] and [[Cartography|cartology]], this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the [[space]] and the [[temporal database]] distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the [[interaction]] of humans and their [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhayesboh/environmentalgeography.htm|title=What is Environmental Geography, Anyway?|last=Hayes-Bohanan|first=James|date=29 September 2009|website=webhost.bridgew.edu|publisher=[[Bridgewater State University]]|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as [[economics]], [[health]], [[climate]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Settlement_Geography.html?id=DLpzQgAACAAJ|title=An introduction to Settlement Geography|last=Hornby|first=William F.|last2=Jones|first2=Melvyn|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521282635|publication-date=29 June 1991|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|date=1991-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text= Names of places...are not geography...know by heart a whole [[gazetteer]] full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a [[geographer]]. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. In a word Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, William. (1863).

Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main subsidiary fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former largely focuses on the [[built environment]] and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space. The latter examines the natural environment, and how [[organism]]s, climate, [[soil]], [[water]], and [[landform]]s produce and interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=American Association of Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these approaches led to a third field, [[environmental geography]], which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt;

==Branches==

===Physical geography===
{{Main|Physical geography}}

Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an [[Earth science]]. It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[pedosphere]], and global [[flora]] and [[fauna]] patterns ([[biosphere]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Human geography===
{{Main|Human geography}}

Human geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape the human society. It encompasses the [[human]], [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[social]], and [[economics|economic]] aspects.

&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Human geography can be divided into many broad categories, such as:"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Various approaches to the study of human geography have also arisen through time and include:
* [[Behavioral geography]]
* [[Feminist geography]]
* [[Culture theory]]
* [[Geosophy]]

===Environmental geography===
{{Main|Integrated geography}}

Environmental [[Integrated geography|geography]] is concerned with the description of the spatial interactions between humans and the [[Natural environment|natural world]]. It requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of physical and human geography, as well as the ways that human societies conceptualize the environment. Environmental geography has emerged as a bridge between the human and the physical geography, as a result of the increasing specialisation of the two sub-fields. Furthermore, as human relationship with the environment has changed as a result of [[globalization]] and [[technological change]], a new approach was needed to understand the changing and dynamic relationship. Examples of areas of research in the environmental geography include: [[emergency management]], [[environmental management]], [[sustainability]], and [[political ecology]].

===Geomatics===
{{Main|Geomatics}}

[[File:Geabios3d.jpg|thumb|right|Digital Elevation Model (DEM)]]
[[Geomatics]] is concerned with the application of computers to the traditional spatial techniques used in [[cartography]] and [[topography]]. Geomatics emerged from the [[quantitative revolution]] in geography in the mid-1950s. Today, geomatics methods include [[spatial analysis]], [[geographic information system|geographic information systems (GIS)]], [[remote sensing]], and [[global positioning system|global positioning systems (GPS)]]. Geomatics has led to a revitalization of some geography departments, especially in Northern America where the subject had a declining status during the 1950s.

===Regional geography===
{{Main|Regional geography}}

Regional geography is concerned with the description of the unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural or human elements. The main aim is to understand, or define the uniqueness, or character of a particular region that consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to [[regionalisation|regionalization]], which covers the proper techniques of space [[delimitation]] into regions.

===Related fields===
* [[Urban planning]], [[regional planning]], and [[spatial planning]]: Use the science of geography to assist in determining how to develop (or not develop) the land to meet particular criteria, such as safety, beauty, economic opportunities, the preservation of the built or natural heritage, and so on. The planning of towns, cities, and rural areas may be seen as [[applied geography]].
* [[Regional science]]: In the 1950s, the regional science movement led by [[Walter Isard]] arose to provide a more quantitative and analytical base to geographical questions, in contrast to the descriptive tendencies of traditional geography programs. Regional science comprises the body of knowledge in which the spatial dimension plays a fundamental role, such as [[regional science|regional economics]], [[resource management]], [[location theory]], [[urban planning|urban]] and [[regional planning]], [[transport]] and [[communication]], [[human geography]], population distribution, [[landscape ecology]], and environmental quality.
* [[Planetary science|Interplanetary Sciences]]: While the discipline of geography is normally concerned with the [[Earth]], the term can also be informally used to describe the study of other worlds, such as the [[planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] and even beyond. The study of systems larger than the Earth itself usually forms part of [[Astronomy]] or [[Cosmology]]. The study of other planets is usually called [[planetary science]]. Alternative terms such as [[Geology of Mars|areology]] (the study of Mars) have been proposed but are not widely used.

==Techniques==
As spatial interrelationships are key to this synoptic science, [[map]]s are a key tool. Classical [[cartography]] has been joined by a more modern approach to geographical analysis, computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

In their study, geographers use four interrelated approaches:
* Systematic&amp;nbsp;– Groups geographical knowledge into categories that can be explored globally.
* Regional&amp;nbsp;– Examines systematic relationships between categories for a specific region or location on the planet.
* Descriptive&amp;nbsp;– Simply specifies the locations of features and populations.
* Analytical&amp;nbsp;– Asks ''why'' we find features and populations in a specific geographic area.

===Cartography===
[[File:Cook chart of New Zealand.jpg|thumb|[[James Cook]]'s 1770 chart of [[New Zealand]]]]
{{Main|Cartography}}

Cartography studies the representation of the Earth's surface with abstract symbols (map making). Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately. Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.

Cartographers must learn [[cognitive psychology]] and [[ergonomics]] to understand which symbols convey information about the Earth most effectively, and [[behaviorism|behavioural psychology]] to induce the readers of their maps to act on the information. They must learn [[geodesy]] and fairly advanced [[mathematics]] to understand how the [[Figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]] affects the distortion of map symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing. It can be said, without much controversy, that cartography is the seed from which the larger field of geography grew. Most geographers will cite a childhood fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field.

===Geographic information systems===
{{Main|Geographic information system}}
&lt;!-- the section's use of a singular verb for a seemingly plural noun is intentional. The name of the academic subject is "Geographic information systems". If you didn't care about parallel construction, you could precede the following with THE SUBJECT OF ---&gt;
Geographic information systems (GIS) deal with the storage of information about the Earth for automatic retrieval by a computer, in an accurate manner appropriate to the information's purpose. In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography, GIS specialists must understand [[computer science]] and [[database]] systems. GIS has revolutionized the field of cartography: nearly all mapmaking is now done with the assistance of some form of [[List of GIS software|GIS software]]. GIS also refers to the science of using GIS software and GIS techniques to represent, analyse, and predict the spatial relationships. In this context, GIS stands for ''geographic information science''.

===Remote sensing===
{{Main|Remote sensing}}
Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about Earth features from measurements made at a distance. Remotely sensed data comes in many forms, such as [[satellite imagery]], [[aerial photography]], and data obtained from hand-held sensors. Geographers increasingly use remotely sensed data to obtain information about the Earth's [[land surface]], ocean, and atmosphere, because it: (a) supplies objective information at a variety of spatial scales (local to global), (b) provides a synoptic view of the area of interest, (c) allows access to distant and inaccessible sites, (d) provides spectral information outside the visible portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and (e) facilitates studies of how features/areas change over time. Remotely sensed data may be analysed either independently of, or in conjunction with other digital data layers (e.g., in a geographic information system).

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main|Geostatistics}}

[[Geostatistics]] deal with [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] analysis, specifically the application of statistical methodology to the exploration of geographic phenomena. Geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields, including [[hydrology]], [[geology]], [[petroleum]] exploration, weather analysis, [[urban planning]], [[logistics]], and [[epidemiology]]. The mathematical basis for geostatistics derives from [[cluster analysis]], [[linear discriminant analysis]] and [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric statistical tests]], and a variety of other subjects. Applications of geostatistics rely heavily on [[geographic information system]]s, particularly for the [[interpolation]] (estimate) of unmeasured points. Geographers are making notable contributions to the method of quantitative techniques.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main|Ethnography}}
Geographic qualitative methods, or ethnographical research techniques, are used by human geographers. In [[cultural geography]] there is a tradition of employing [[qualitative research]] techniques, also used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. [[Participant observation]] and in-depth interviews provide human geographers with qualitative data.

==History==
{{Main|History of geography}}

The oldest known [[world map]]s date back to [[ancient Babylon]] from the 9th century BC.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J.A. Talbert 2009 147"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Geography and Ethnography: Perceptions of the World in Pre-Modern Societies |author=Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J.A.

The accompanying text mentions seven outer regions beyond the encircling ocean. The descriptions of five of them have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A join to the map of the world: A notable discovery|last=Finkel|first=Irving|publisher=[[British Museum Magazine]]|isbn=978-0714120737|date=Winter 1995|pages=26–27|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the ''Imago Mundi'', an earlier Babylonian [[world map]] dating back to the 9th century BC depicted Babylon as being further north from the center of the world, though it is not certain what that center was supposed to represent.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J.A. Talbert 2009 147"/&gt;

The ideas of [[Anaximander]] (c. 610–545 BC): considered by later Greek writers to be the true founder of geography, come to us through fragments quoted by his successors. Anaximander is credited with the invention of the [[gnomon]], the simple, yet efficient Greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of [[latitude]]. [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] is also credited with the prediction of eclipses. The foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures, such as the ancient, medieval, and early modern [[History of China|Chinese]]. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], who were the first to explore geography as both [[art]] and [[science]], achieved this through [[History of cartography|Cartography]], [[Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|Literature]], or through [[History of mathematics|Mathematics]]. There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth is spherical]] in shape, with the credit going either to [[Parmenides]] or [[Pythagoras]]. [[Anaxagoras]] was able to demonstrate that the profile of the Earth was circular by explaining [[eclipse]]s. However, he still believed that the Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries. One of the first estimates of the radius of the Earth was made by [[Eratosthenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Concise_History_of_Solar_and_Stellar_P.html?id=nRtUait0qTgC|title=A Concise History of Solar and Stellar Physics|first=Jean-Louis|last2=Tassoul|first2=Monique|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0691117119|location=London|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|author=Tassoul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rigorous system of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] lines is credited to [[Hipparchus]]. He employed a [[sexagesimal]] system that was derived from [[Babylonian mathematics]]. The meridians were sub-divided into 360°, with each degree further subdivided into 60 ([[minute of arc|minutes]]).

From the 3rd century onwards, [[History of China|Chinese]] methods of geographical study and writing of geographical literature became much more comprehensive than what was found in Europe at the time (until the 13th century).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"/&gt; Chinese geographers such as [[Liu An]], [[Pei Xiu]], [[Jia Dan]], [[Shen Kuo]], [[Fan Chengda]], [[Zhou Daguan]], and [[Xu Xiake]] wrote important treatises, yet by the 17th century advanced ideas and methods of Western-style geography were adopted in China.

The European [[Age of Discovery]] during the 16th and the 17th centuries, where many new lands were discovered and accounts by European explorers such as [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Marco Polo]], and [[James Cook]] revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations in Europe. The problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location. The problem of latitude was solved long ago but that of longitude remained; agreeing on what zero meridian should be was only part of the problem. It was left to [[John Harrison]] to solve it by inventing the chronometer [[Harrison Number Four|H-4]] in 1760, and later in 1884 for the [[International Meridian Conference]] to adopt by convention the [[Greenwich meridian]] as zero meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bz4GyOioMF4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA164#v=onepage|title=Voyages that changed the world|last=Aughton|first=Peter|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1847240040|location=|page=164|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th and the 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]], and became part of a typical [[university]] curriculum in [[Europe]] (especially [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]). The development of many geographic societies also occurred during the 19th century, with the foundations of the [[Société de Géographie]] in 1821,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socgeo.org/la-societe/qui-sommes-nous|title=Société de Géographie, Paris, France|last=|first=|date=|website=socgeo.org|publisher=Société de Géographie|language=French|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/about+us.htm |title=About Us |last= |first= |date= |website=rgs.org |publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]] |accessdate=10 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192946/http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/About%2Bus.htm |archivedate=18 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Geographical Society]] in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |title=Русское Географическое Общество (основано в 1845 г.) |last= |first= |date= |website=rgo.org.ru |publisher=[[Russian Geological Society]] |language=Russian |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524183911/http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |archive-date=2012-05-24 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=10 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Geographical Society]] in 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americangeo.org/history/|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=Amergeog.org|publisher=The American Geographical Society|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017130118/http://americangeo.org/history/|archive-date=2016-10-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Geographic Society]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/io/unesco/members/48805.htm|title=National Geographic Society|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Carl Ritter]], and [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] can be seen as a major turning point in geography from a philosophy to an academic subject.

Over the past two centuries, the advancements in technology with computers have led to the development of [[geomatics]] and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography's portfolio of tools. In the West during the 20th century, the discipline of geography went through four major phases: [[environmental determinism]], [[regional geography]], the [[quantitative revolution]], and [[critical geography]]. The strong interdisciplinary links between geography and the sciences of [[geology]] and [[botany]], as well as [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[demographics]] have also grown greatly, especially as a result of [[earth system science]] that seeks to understand the world in a holistic view.

{{Wiktionary}} 
'''Gracility''' is slenderness, the condition of being '''gracile''', which means slender.

It derives from the Latin adjective ''gracilis'' ([[Masculine (grammar)|masculine]] or [[Feminine (grammar)|feminine]]), or ''gracile'' ([[Grammatical gender|neuter]])&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Mason D., Jenkins, Thornton; “Latin for Today, Book 2”; Pub: Ginn and Co., Ltd. (1934) &lt;/ref&gt; which in either form means slender, and when transferred for example to discourse, takes the sense of "without ornament", "simple", or various similar [[connotation]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-02-522580-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, D. G. |title=Cassell's Latin dictionary: Latin-English, English-Latin |publisher=Cassell |location=London |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-02-522580-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his famous "Glossary of Botanic Terms", B. D. Jackson speaks dismissively&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Benjamin Daydon; "A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent" 4th Ed. 1928; Pub: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, W.C.2&lt;/ref&gt; of an entry in earlier dictionary of A. A. Crozier&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, Arthur Alger; “A Dictionary of Botanical Terms”, Pub.: Henry Holt &amp; Co  1893. &lt;/ref&gt; as follows: ''Gracilis (Lat.), slender. Crozier has the needless word "gracile"''. However, his objection would be hard to sustain in current usage; apart from the fact that "gracile" is a natural and convenient term, it is hardly a [[neologism]]; the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Little, William; Fowler H.W.; Coulson J.; Onions, C.T. (Ed.):  "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principals". Pub.: Oxford at the Clarendon Press (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; gives the source date for that usage as 1623. 

In the same entry for ''Gracile'', the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary remarks: ''Recently misused (through association with '''grace''') for Gracefully slender.'' This misuse is unfortunate at least, because the terms ''gracile'' and ''grace'' are completely unrelated: the etymological root of ''grace'' is the Latin word ''gratia'' from ''gratus'', meaning pleasing&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; and nothing to do with slenderness or thinness.    

== In biology ==
In biology, the term is in common use, whether as English or Latin:
* The term ''gracile''&amp;mdash;and its opposite, [[Robustness (morphology)|''robust'']]&amp;mdash;occur in discussion of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of various [[hominids]] for example.
* The ''[[gracile fasciculus]]'' is a particular bundle of axon fibres in the spinal cord 
* The [[gracile nucleus]] is a particular structure of [[neuron]]s in the [[medulla oblongata]] 
* "[[GRACILE syndrome]]", is associated with a [[BCS1L]] [[mutation]] 

In [[Biological classification|biological taxonomy]], '''''gracile''''' is the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] or [[Specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] for various species. Where the gender is appropriate, the form is '''''gracilis'''''. Examples include:
* ''[[Campylobacter]] gracilis, a species of bacterium implicated in foodborne disease
* ''[[Ctenochasma]] gracile'', a late [[Jurassic]] [[pterosaur]]
* ''[[Eriophorum gracile]]'', a species of [[sedge]], [[Cyperaceae]]
* ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'', a unicellular flagellate protist
* ''[[Hydrophis]] gracilis'', a species of sea snakes
* ''[[Melampodium]] gracile'', a flowering plant species
* ''[[Moeritherium]] gracile'', an [[Eocene]] [[mammal]] species 

The same root appears in the names of some genera and higher [[Taxon|taxa]]:
* ''[[Gracilaria]]''  is a genus of red algae in the order ''Gracilariales''
* ''[[Gracillaria]]'' is a genus of [[leaf miner]] moths in the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] ''[[Gracillarioidea]]''

&lt;!-- Do not remove this line! --&gt;
&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

The '''Groupes Bibliques Universitaires''' ('''GBU''') are student groups that meet at universities or nearby for in-depth [[Bible]] study. They were founded in the beginning of the 20th century and currently operate in an officially recognized way in more than 154 countries, with a presence in 168 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where we work|url=http://www.ifesworld.org/en/our-work|website=Ifesworld.org|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the GBU is to discuss  Biblical texts and to make the [[Bible]] known in the academic world. Though they have a clear [[evangelical Christian]] orientation, those groups are non-denominational and are open to all students.&lt;ref name="Fath Ghetto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fath|first1=Sebastien|title=Du ghetto au réseau : le protestantisme évangélique en France (1800-2005)|date=2005|publisher=Labor et Fides|location=Geneve|isbn=9782830911398|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=16}}&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;"Article 10 : Caractère non ecclésial de l'association", Statuts de l'Association des Groupes Bibliques universitaires de France, 2006 (in French)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[France|French]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] GBU are [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students#History|founding members]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InterVarsity's History|url=https://intervarsity.org/about/our/history|website=intervarsity.org|accessdate=6 October 2016|quote=In 1947 InterVarsity USA became a founding member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, a federation of national Christian student movements.

== Origins of the GBU ==
=== Forerunners ===
In   17th century   [[Scotland]], groups of students began to meet on their own initiative in order to study the [[Bible]] and pray together.&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Keith|last2=Hunt|first2=Gladys|title=For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the U.S.A./ 1940-1990|date=1991|publisher=InterVarsity Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=28}}&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Lindsay|title=Une Nuée de témoins|date=2013|publisher=PBU|location=Paris|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=31}} Similar groups were reported in England and then in the United States of America in the 18th century under a variety of names. The goal of those “societies” was mainly to grow in faith through prayer, exhortation and the discussion of theological subjects. They were often kept secret&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF" /&gt;{{rp|page=33}} to avoid   the suspicion of excessive spiritualism.

At the same time in continental Europe, German [[pietism]]And its extensions had a huge impact among students with an emphasis on witnessing and evangelism. This concern grew in several groups in America in the beginning of the 19th century. It resulted in remarkable missionary commitments within the large missionary societies which had been created over the previous century.   A need  was felt to establish relationships between universities.  It was also the time of the great awakenings which occurred in many European countries, paving the way for more interdenominational cooperation and alliances.

During the second half of the 19th century, several evangelical youth organisations developed worldwide with significant ramifications among students (e.g. [[Young Men's Christian Associations|Young Men’s]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Y : History - Founding|url=http://www.ymca.net/history/founding.html|website=ymca.net|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Young Women's Christian Association|Young women’s]] Christian Associations). Following its predecessors, the emphasis on global mission increased considerably&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"/&gt;{{rp|page=33}} (e.g. [[Student Volunteer Movement|Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions]]&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"/&gt;{{rp|pages=38–40}}).

=== The first GBU ===
The foundation of the organization  has been traced back to 1877&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF"/&gt;{{rp|page=32}}&lt;ref name="Brown Nuée"/&gt;{{rp|page=33}} with the creation in [[Cambridge University]]  of the  [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]] (Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InterVarsity's History|url=https://intervarsity.org/about/our/history|website=intervarsity.org|accessdate=6 October 2016|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors had prepared the ground: a strong evangelical presence in the University for a century, a Missionary Union that had been encouraged by [[David Livingstone]]&lt;ref name="Hunt IVCF" /&gt;{{rp|page=31}} and prayer meetings that had been held on a daily basis for several years. In 1873,  groups in London hospitals founded the Medical Prayer Union. With the [[Christian Union (students)|Christian Union]] in Oxford, which had been founded in 1881, all those groups created the [[Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|SCM]] (Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|Student Christian Movement).

Similar movements developed in other countries, especially in the English-speaking world. They joined together into a world evangelical and missionary federation : the [[World Student Christian Federation|WSCF]] (World Student Christian Federation).

An heir of 19th century rationalism, [[Liberal Christianity|theological liberalism]] or modernism exerted growing influence over many churches and thus over Christian organisations. Little by little, the line of the founders was set aside, with its emphasis on the primacy of the Gospel and on the authority of the Scriptures.

The [[Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|SCM]]’s responsiveness to the new ideas resulted in serious differences of views. In 1910, the [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]] was therefore sidelined because it wanted to remain faithful to the biblical foundations. From then on, the two movements developed independently.

After the shock of the First World War, the activities of [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]] and similar groups resumed. The movement expanded progressively to a great number of universities in Great Britain. In places, some common ground could be found with the [[World Student Christian Federation|WSCF]], but the split was complete a few years later due to serious ideological drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Keith|last2=Hunt|first2=Gladys|title=For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the U.S.A./ 1940-1990|date=1991|publisher=InterVarsity Press|location=USA|pages=39–55|chapter=The rise and fall of the Student Christian Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the international level, some GBU are involved in [[Christian humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Legaré|first1=Isabelle|title=Études salées et légumes en conserve|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/actualites/chroniques/isabelle-legare/201602/09/01-4948894-etudes-salees-et-legumes-en-conserve.php|website=La Presse|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=fr-CA|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The GBU in France ==
=== Organization ===
In [[France]], the GBU are also called AGBUF (Association des Groupes Bibliques Universitaires de France),  constituted in accordance with the French law of 1901 concerning  [[Nonprofit organization#France|non-profit organisations]]. They bring together students who are eager to study the [[Bible]]. They provide them with the opportunity to meet at or around universities and to deepen their knowledge together with other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website of the French GBU|url=http://gbu.fr|website=gbu.fr|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local groups are run autonomously. The GBU is a student organisation. All its student activities are under the responsibility of the Student Executive Committee which reports to a supervisory board, the National Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbu.fr/presentation/l-organisation|title=Organisation|website=gbu.fr|language=FR|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main activity is reading the Bible together. Meetings are open to all and everyone is free to share his beliefs concerning the Scriptures. At the international level, the French GBU are a [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students#History|founding member]] of [[International Fellowship of Evangelical Students|IFES]] (International Fellowship of Evangelical Students).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our history|url=http://www.ifesworld.org/en/our-history|website=Ifesworld.org|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History === 
&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historique du GBU|url=http://gbu.fr/presentation/son-historique/228-historique-du-gbu|website=gbu.fr|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]], some students began to meet in [[Aix-en-Provence]] in order to pray and study the [[Bible]] together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
They were encouraged&lt;ref name="Fath Ghetto"/&gt;{{rp|pages=172, 343}} by M. René Pache, the founder of the Swiss GBU in 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Une brève histoire des GBEU...|url=http://www.gbeu.ch/les-gbeu/qui-sommes-nous/historique.html|website=gbeu.ch|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vice-president of IFES in 1947, who was the speaker at the first GBU camp in [[Anduze]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="Fath Ghetto"/&gt;{{rp|page=370}}  Immediately afterwards, groups of university and high school students were formed in [[Marseilles]], [[Montpellier]], [[Nimes]] and [[Alès]], and a year or two later in [[Grenoble]], [[Lyon]], [[Paris]] and [[Bordeaux]]. The “Union des GBU de France” was officially established in 1950.

The [[May 1968 events in France|events of 1968]] sent shock waves that tremendously affected university life and reverberated within the GBU. The following decade was one of unprecedented development. Groups multiplied, more students were committed and became members of the GBU, large Easter congresses were organised, more people were contacted  In 1976, the PBU ([http://pbu.gbu.fr Presses Bibliques Universitaires]) were established jointly with the Swiss and Belgian GBUs. Books were published on  issues such as culture, ideologies, nuclear power, poetry, etc.

Around 1,000 students currently gather weekly in over 90 groups in [[France]]. In [[Romandy|Swiss Romande]], around 600 students meet every week in about 50 groups.

=== Supporters ===
When they have finished their studies, students are invited to remain members of AGBUF in order to ensure the continuity of the movement and its development.

The Friends of the GBU used to be organised in a separate organisation. The AGBUF is now made both of students who take an active role in local groups and of post-graduates. The latter are willing to help maintain and develop the movement they entered during their studies. These post-graduates and friends are invited to create local support groups in order to help to develop local GBU groups.

An '''hydrological transport model''' is a [[mathematical model]] used to simulate river or [[stream flow]] and calculate [[water quality]] parameters. These models generally came into use in the 1960s and 1970s when demand for numerical forecasting of water quality was driven by [[environmental legislation]], and at a similar time widespread access to significant computer power became available. Much of the original model development took place in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], but today these models are refined and used worldwide.

There are dozens of different transport models that can be generally grouped by [[water pollution|pollutants]] addressed, complexity of pollutant sources, whether the model is steady state or dynamic, and time period modeled. Another important designation is whether the model is distributed (i.e. capable of predicting multiple points within a river) or lumped. In a basic model, for example, only one pollutant might be addressed from a simple point discharge into the [[receiving water]]s. In the most complex of models, various [[line source]] inputs from [[surface runoff]] might be added to multiple [[Point source (pollution)|point source]]s, treating a variety of [[chemical]]s plus [[sediment]] in a dynamic environment including vertical river stratification and interactions of pollutants with in-stream [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. In addition [[Drainage basin|watershed]] [[groundwater]] may also be included. The model is termed "physically based" if its parameters can be measured in the field.

Often models have separate modules to address individual steps in the simulation process. The most common module is a [[subroutine]] for calculation of surface runoff, allowing variation in [[land use]] type, [[topography]], [[soil]] type, [[vegetation|vegetative cover]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and land management practice (such as the application rate of a [[fertilizer]]). The concept of hydrological modeling can be extended to other environments such as the [[ocean]]s, but most commonly (and in this article) the subject of a river watershed is generally implied.

==History==

In 1850, T. J. Mulvany was probably the first investigator to use mathematical modeling in a [[stream hydrology]] context, although there was no chemistry involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulvany | first1 = T.J. | year = 1850 | title = On the use of self registering rain and flow gauges | url = | journal = [[Proc. Institute Civ. Eng.]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1892 M.E. Imbeau had conceived an [[event model]] to relate runoff to peak rainfall, again still with no chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Imbeau, (1892) ''La Durance: Regime. Crues et inundations'', ''Ann. Ponts Chausses Mem. Doc. Ser.'' 3(I) 5-18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Horton]]’s seminal work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = R.E. | year = 1933 | title = The role of infiltration on the hydrologic cycle | url = | journal = Trans. Am. Geophys. Union | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 446–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[surface runoff]] along with his coupling of quantitative treatment of erosion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = R.E. | year = 1945 | title = Erosional development of streams and their drainage basins: Hydrological approach to quantitative geomorphology | url = | journal = [[Bull. Geol. Soc. Am.]] | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 275–330 | doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1945)56[275:edosat]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the groundwork for modern chemical transport hydrology.

==Types==

===Physically based models===

Physically based models (sometimes known as deterministic, comprehensive or process-based models) try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of surface runoff, subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, and channel flow, but they can be far more complicated. "Large scale simulation experiments were begun by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1953 for reservoir management on the main stem of the Missouri River". This,&lt;ref&gt;''Report on use of electronic computers for integrating reservoir operations'', vol.1 DATAmatic Corporation technical reports, prepared in cooperation with Raytheon Manufacturing Company for the Missouri River Division, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, January, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; and other early work that dealt with the River Nile&lt;ref&gt;M.P.Barnett, ''Comment on the Nile Valley Calculations'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, vol. 19, 223, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.A.W. Morrice and W.N. Allan, ''Planning for the ultimate hydraulic development of the Nile Valley'', Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineers, 14, 101, 1959,&lt;/ref&gt; and the Columbia River&lt;ref&gt;F.S. Brown, ''Water Resource Development -- Columbia River Basin'', in ''Report of Meeting of Columbia Basin Inter-Agency Committee, Portland, OR, Dec. 1958&lt;/ref&gt; are discussed, in a wider context, in a book published by the Harvard Water Resources Seminar, that contains the sentence just quoted.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Manzer and M.P. Barnett, ''Analysis by Simulation: Programming techniques for a High-Speed Digital Computer'', in Arthur Maas ''et al'', ''Design of Water Resource Systems'', pp. 324--390, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early model that integrated many submodels for basin chemical hydrology was the Stanford Watershed Model (SWM).&lt;ref&gt;N.H. Crawford and R.K. Linsley. ''Digital simulation in hydrology: Stanford Watershed Model IV'', Technical Report No.39 [[Stanford University]], Palo Alto, Ca. (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; The SWMM ([[Storm Water Management Model]]), the HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN) and other modern [[United States|American]] derivatives are successors to this early work.

In Europe a favoured comprehensive model is the Système Hydrologique Européen (SHE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = P.E.O'Connell | last2 = Bathurst | first2 = J.C. | last3 = Cunge | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Rasmussen | first4 = J. | year = 1986 | title = An Introduction to the European System: Systeme Hydrologique Europeen (SHE) | url = | journal = [[Journal of Hydrology]] | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 61–77 | doi=10.1016/0022-1694(86)90115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vijay P. Singh,, ''Computer Models of Watershed Hydrology, Water Resource Publications'', pgs. 563-594 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; which has been succeeded by [[MIKE SHE]] and [[SHETRAN]]. [[MIKE SHE]] is a watershed-scale physically based, spatially distributed model for water flow and [[sediment transport]]. Flow and transport processes are represented by either finite difference representations of partial [[differential equation]]s or by derived empirical equations. The following principal submodels are involved:

:* [[Evapotranspiration]]: [[Penman-Monteith]] formalism
:* Erosion: Detachment equations for raindrop and overland flow
:* Overland and [[Channel (geography)|Channel]] Flow: Saint-Venant equations of continuity and [[momentum]]
:* Overland Flow [[Sediment]] Transport: 2D total sediment load conservation equation
:* Unsaturated Flow: [[Richards equation]]
:* Saturated Flow: [[Darcy's law]] and the [[conservation of mass|mass conservation]] of 2D laminar flow
:* Channel Sediment Transport 1D mass conservation equation.

This model can analyze effects of [[land use]] and [[climate change]]s upon in-stream water quality, with consideration of [[groundwater]] interactions.

Worldwide a number of basin models have been developed, among them RORB ([[Australia]]), Xinanjiang ([[China]]), Tank model ([[Japan]]), ARNO ([[Italy]]), TOPMODEL ([[Europe]]), UBC ([[Canada]]) and [[HBV hydrology model|HBV]] ([[Scandinavia]]), MOHID Land ([[Portugal]]). However, not all of these models have a chemistry component. Generally speaking, SWM, SHE and TOPMODEL have the most comprehensive stream chemistry treatment and have evolved to accommodate the latest data sources including [[remote sensing]] and [[geographic information system]] data.

In the United States, the Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center in conjunction with a researchers at a number of universities have developed the Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis [[GSSHA]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Downer, C.W., and F.L. Ogden, 2006, Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) User's Manual, Version 1.43 for Watershed Modeling System 6.1, System Wide Water Resources Program, Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, ERDC/CHL SR-06-1, 207 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Downer | first1 = C.W. | last2 = Ogden | first2 = F.L. | year = 2004 | title = GSSHA: A model for simulating diverse streamflow generating processes | url = | journal = J. Hydrol. Engrg | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 161–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downer, C.W., F.L. Ogden, J. M. Niedzialek, and S. Liu, 2006, Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) Model: A Model for Simulating Diverse Streamflow Producing Processes, pp.&amp;nbsp;131–159, in Watershed Models, V.P. Singh, and D. Frevert, eds., Taylor and Francis Group, CRC Press, 637 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[GSSHA]] is widely used in the U.S. for research and analysis by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts and larger consulting companies to compute flow, water levels, distributed erosion, and sediment delivery in complex [[engineering]] designs. A distributed nutrient and contaminant fate and transport component is undergoing testing. [[GSSHA]] input/output processing and interface with [[GIS]] is facilitated by the Watershed Modeling System (WMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaveo.com/wms|publisher=[[Aquaveo]]|title=Watershed Modeling System|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model used in the United States and worldwide is [[Vflo|V''flo'']], a physics-based distributed hydrologic model developed by Vieux &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vieuxinc.com Vieuxinc.com]&lt;/ref&gt; V''flo'' employs radar rainfall and GIS data to compute spatially distributed overland flow and channel flow. Evapotranspiration, inundation, infiltration, and snowmelt modeling capabilities are included. Applications include civil infrastructure operations and maintenance, stormwater prediction and emergency management, soil moisture monitoring, land use planning, water quality monitoring, and others.

===Stochastic models===

These models based on data are [[Black box (systems)|black box]] systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance [[rainfall]]) to the model output (for instance [[Surface runoff|runoff]]). Commonly used techniques are [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[transfer function]]s, [[neural networks]] and [[system identification]]. These models are known as stochastic hydrology models. Data based models have been used within hydrology to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship, represent the impacts of [[antecedent moisture]] and perform real-time control on systems.

==Model components==

===Surface runoff modelling===

[[Image:ColumbiarivergorgeJRH.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Columbia River]], which has [[surface runoff]] from [[agriculture]] and [[logging]]]]

A key component of a hydrological transport model is the [[surface runoff]] element, which allows assessment of sediment, [[fertilizer]], [[pesticide]] and other chemical contaminants. Building on the work of Horton, the unit hydrograph theory was developed by Dooge in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;J.C.I. Dooge, ''Parameterization of hydrologic processes'', JSC Study Conference on Land Surface Processes in Atmospheric General Circulation Models, 243-284 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; It required the presence of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and kindred other national legislation to provide the impetus to integrate water chemistry to hydrology model protocols. In the early 1970s the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began sponsoring a series of water quality models in response to the [[Clean Water Act]]. An example of these efforts was developed at the Southeast Water Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. ''Computer modeling of pesticide transport in soil for five instrumented watersheds'', U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Southeast Water Laboratory, Athens, Ga. by [[ESL Inc.]], Sunnyvale, California (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first attempts to calibrate a surface runoff model with field data for a variety of chemical contaminants.

The attention given to surface runoff contaminant models has not matched the emphasis on pure hydrology models, in spite of their role in the generation of stream loading contaminant data. In the United States the EPA has had difficulty interpreting&lt;ref&gt;Steven Grant, I K Iskandar , ''Contaminant Hydrology'', CRC Press (2000) {{ISBN|1-56670-476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; diverse proprietary contaminant models and has to develop its own models more often than conventional resource agencies, who, focused on [[flood]] forecasting, have had more of a centroid of common basin models.

==Example applications==

Liden applied the [[HBV hydrology model|HBV model]] to estimate the riverine transport of three different substances, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[suspended sediment]]&lt;ref&gt;Rikard Liden, ''Conceptual Runoff Models for Material Transport Estimations'', PhD dissertation, [[Lund University]], Lund, Sweden (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; in four different countries: [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. The relation between internal hydrological model variables and [[nutrient]] transport was assessed. A model for [[nitrogen]] sources was developed and analysed in comparison with a statistical method. A model for suspended sediment transport in [[tropical]] and [[semi-arid]] regions was developed and tested. It was shown that riverine total nitrogen could be well simulated in the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] climate and riverine suspended sediment load could be estimated fairly well in tropical and semi-arid climates. The HBV model for material transport generally estimated material transport loads well. The main conclusion of the study was that the HBV model can be used to predict material transport on the scale of the [[drainage basin]] during stationary conditions, but cannot be easily generalised to areas not specifically calibrated. In a different work, Castanedo et al. applied an evolutionary algorithm to automated watershed model calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castanedo | first1 = F. | last2 = Patricio | first2 = M.A. | last3 = Molina | first3 = J.M. | year = | title = Evolutionary Computation Technique Applied to HSPF Model Calibration of a Spanish Watershed | doi = 10.1007/11875581_26 | journal = IDEAL | volume = 2006 | issue = | pages = 216–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:lake-tahoe.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Lake Tahoe]], [[headwater]] sub-basin of the [[Truckee River]] watershed]]

The United States EPA developed the [[DSSAM Model]] to analyze [[water pollution|water quality]] impacts from [[land use]] and [[wastewater]] management decisions in the [[Truckee River]] basin, an area which include the cities of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Sparks, Nevada]] as well as the [[Lake Tahoe]] basin. The model&lt;ref&gt;''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; satisfactorily predicted nutrient, sediment and dissolved oxygen parameters in the river. It is based on a pollutant loading [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] called "Total Daily Maximum Load" (TDML). The success of this model contributed to the EPA’s commitment to the use of the underlying TDML protocol in EPA’s national policy for management of many river systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;USEPA. 1991. ''Guidance for water quality-based decisions: The TMDL process'', EPA 440/4-91-001. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSSAM Model is constructed to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total nitrogen and phosphorus are allowed to be consumed by [[Benthic zone|benthic]] [[alga]]e in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g. based upon river temperature). Regarding stormwater runoff in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], the specific elements within a new [[xeriscape]] ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model. For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in-river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two [[endangered species]] found in the [[Truckee River]] and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]]  (endangered 1967) and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (threatened 1970).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4775">In [[information technology]], benchmarking of [[computer security]] requires measurements for comparing both different IT systems and single IT systems in dedicated situations. The technical approach is a pre-defined catalog of security events (security incident and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]]) together with corresponding formula for the calculation of security indicators that are accepted and comprehensive.

'''Information security indicators''' have been standardized by the [[ETSI]] Industrial Specification Group (ISG) ISI. These indicators provide the basis to switch from a qualitative to a quantitative culture in IT Security Scope of measurements: External and internal threats (attempt and success), user's deviant behaviours, nonconformities and/or vulnerabilities (software, configuration, behavioural, general security framework).

The list of Information Security Indicators belongs to the ISI framework that consists of the following eight closely linked Work Items:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">'''Interpretive planning''' is an initial step in the planning and design process for [[informal learning]]-based institutions like [[museum]]s, [[zoo]]s, [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]]s, nature centers, [[botanical garden]]s, heritage sites, parks and other cultural facilities where interpretation is used to communicate messages, stories, information and experiences. It is a decision-making process that blends management needs and resource considerations with visitor needs and desires to determine the most effective way to communicate a message to a targeted audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.definitionsproject.com/definitions/def_full_term.cfm National Association for Interpretation]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation at [[informal learning]] institutions builds on [[Freeman Tilden]]’s principles of [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]], focusing especially on ''relating'' content in a meaningful way to a visitor’s own experience, ''provoking'' emotion, thought or further inquiry into a subject. 
The communication goals of interpretation at [[Mission statement|mission-based]] institutions are based on achieving previously specified outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagedestination.com/interpretive-planning.aspx Heritage Destination Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most interpretive plans are based on a [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach to interpretation]], and therefore, place emphasis on which themes are important to communicate to various audiences.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive Planning: The 5-M Model for Successful Planning Projects|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretive planning may also guide how audiences will react to and interact with a particular site or exhibit. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/interpretive-planner-insights/[[History Associates]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An interpretive plan establishes these specific goals for an institution’s market(s) and builds a structured vision of how to achieve them by communicating to an audience through appropriate and meaningful experiences. It combines developing, organizing and analyzing content into relevant and engaging messages, with creating exciting ways for visitors to experience this content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldrichpears.com [[AldrichPears Associates]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  An interpretive plan establishes the communication process, through which meanings and relationships of the cultural and natural world, past and present, are revealed to a visitor through experiences with objects, artifacts, landscapes, sites, exhibits and people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpcan.ca/new/ Interpretation Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

To effectively engage a visitor and achieve these objectives, as well as any other institutional objectives and requirements (financial, operational, environmental, etc.), an interpretive plan is built through addressing the following issues:  
# Why do you want to interpret something?
# Who should be involved in the interpretive process?
# What are you interpreting?
# Who you are interpreting for?
# What messages do you want to communicate?
# What are your specific objectives?
# What media will you use?
# How will your interpretation be implemented?
# How will it be evaluated?
# How will it be maintained? &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/heritage-interpretation/interpretive-planning/ Scottish Natural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting product provides a vision for the future of [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]], [[education]], and visitor experience opportunities. It identifies and analyzes interpretation, education, and visitor experience goals and issues and recommends the most effective, efficient, and practical ways to address those goals and issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/hfc/products/ip-lrip.htm [[National Park Service]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The plan guides the further design and development of the project, becoming a resource for [[architecture]], [[Exhibit design|exhibit development]] and [[fundraising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woed.com/services/master.html West Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jožef Stefan Institute''' ('''IJS''') ({{lang-sl|Institut "Jožef Stefan"}}) is the largest research [[institute]] in [[Slovenia]]. The main research areas are [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technologies]], [[physics|reactor physics]], [[energy]] and [[Natural environment|environment]]. At the beginning of the 2013 the institute had 962 employees, 404 of them were [[Ph.D]] [[scientists]].

The mission of the Jožef Stefan Institute is the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge at the frontiers of natural science and technology to the benefit of society at large through the pursuit of education, learning, research, and development of high technology at the highest international levels of excellence.

==History==
The institute was founded by Yugoslav State Security in 1949 for atomic weapons research. Initially, the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]] in Belgrade was established in 1948, followed by Rudjer Boskovic in Zagreb in 1949 and the Jožef Stefan Institute as an Institute for Physics in the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. It is named after the distinguished 19th-century physicist [[Josef Stefan|Jožef Stefan]], best known for his work on the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] of [[Black body|black-body]] radiation.

IJS is today involved in a wide variety of fields of scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the institute has become part of the image of [[Slovenia]].

Over the last 60 years it has created a number of important institutions, such as the [[University of Nova Gorica]], the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mps.si/splet/index.asp?lang=eng|title=The 2013/2014 CALL FOR ENROLMENT to postgraduate study programmes|publisher=Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ljubljana Technology park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tp-lj.si/|title=Tehnološki Park Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">In 1997 a core set of six principles was established by ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] for the sustainability governance of the oceans. These six principles became known as the "'''Lisbon Principles'''": together they provide basic guidelines for administering the use of common natural and social resources.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. 2007. ''Lisbon principles of sustainable governance''. In: Encyclopaedia of Earth. Ed. C. J. Cleveland. Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington D.C. Published in Encyclopaedia of the Earth August 9, 2007; retrieved February 6, 2009.[http://eoearth.org/article/Lisbon_principles_of_sustainable_governance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129134940/http://eoearth.org/article/Lisbon_principles_of_sustainable_governance |date=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R.  et al. 1998. Principles for sustainable governance of the oceans. ''Science'' '''281''': 198-199. (also ''Nature'' '''387''':  253-260 (1997) see above.)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Principle 1: '''Responsibility'''. ''Access to environmental resources carries attendant responsibilities to use them in an ecologically sustainable, economically efficient, and socially fair manner. Individual and corporate responsibilities and incentives should be aligned with each other and with broad social and ecological goals.''
*Principle 2: '''Scale-matching'''. ''Ecological problems are rarely confined to a single scale. Decision-making on environmental resources should (i) be assigned to institutional levels that maximize ecological input, (ii) ensure the flow of ecological information between institutional levels, (iii) take ownership and actors into account, and (iv) internalize costs and benefits. Appropriate scales of governance will be those that have the most relevant information, can respond quickly and efficiently, and are able to integrate across scale boundaries.''
*Principle 3: '''Precaution'''. ''In the face of uncertainty about potentially irreversible environmental impacts, decisions concerning their use should err on the side of caution. The burden of proof should shift to those whose activities potentially damage the environment.''
*Principle 4: '''[[Adaptive management]]'''. ''Given that some level of uncertainty always exists in environmental resource management, decision-makers should continuously gather and integrate appropriate ecological, social, and economic information with the goal of adaptive improvement.''
*Principle 5: '''[[Environmental full-cost accounting|Full cost]] allocation'''. ''All of the internal and external costs and benefits, including social and ecological, of alternative decisions concerning the use of environmental resources should be identified and allocated. When appropriate, markets should be adjusted to reflect full costs.''
*Principle 6: '''Participation'''. ''All stakeholders should be engaged in the formulation and implementation of decisions concerning environmental resources. Full stakeholder awareness and participation contributes to credible, accepted rules that identify and assign the corresponding responsibilities appropriately.''

{{Commons|Category:Mail chutes|Mail chutes}}
A '''mail chute''' is a largely defunct letter collection device used in early multi-storey office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings and other high rise structures. Letters were dropped from the upper storeys and collected (usually at the ground level) at a central depository by the postal service. This innovation was before the time of the modern "mail room" normally associated nowadays with high rise buildings. It was for the convenience of the users of the building so they would not have to take their mail to an outside [[letter box|mail box]] or to the post office.&lt;ref name ="postal4"&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2b1c1_cutler.html|title= National Postal Museum, a Smithsonian Institution museum - Cutler Mail Box &amp; Chute|accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original design and usage==
[[James Goold Cutler]] received {{US patent|284951}} on September 11, 1883 for the mail chute.&lt;ref name ="postal2"&gt; {{cite news|url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/04/01/341022/index.htm|title= CNNMoney article - Gone but Not (Quite) Forgotten|accessdate= 2008-09-19 | first=Maggie | last=Overfelt | date=2003-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one was installed in 1884 in the [[Elwood Building]] in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt; Cutler ultimately received thirty patents for variations of his invention. The original approved patent No. 284,951 design stated that it must "be of metal, distinctly marked '''U.S. Letter Box,'''" and that the "door must open on hinges on one side, with the bottom of the door not less than 2'6" above the floor." If the building were more than two [[storey|stories]] tall, the collection box was to be outfitted with a cushion to prevent injury to the mail. The mail chutes had to be accessible along its entire length so lodged mail could be removed.&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt;

The first experimental "Cutler mail chute" device was successful at the Elwood Building so later it was installed in two New York City office buildings. Additional ones were then installed in railroad stations and some public buildings as a test. Eventually Cutler Mail Box produced over 1,600 such devices in buildings over the next twenty years.&lt;ref name ="postal2"/&gt; Then the postal service allowed "Cutler mail chutes" to be placed in hotels taller than five storeys. They were also installed in public apartment buildings of more than fifty apartments.&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt;

It was announced on Sunday, May 9, 1909, by ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Cutler and Other Companies Join in a $2,000,000 Corporation".&lt;ref name ="postal1"&gt; {{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1909/05/09/archives/mail-chute-men-in-merger-cutler-and-other-companies-join-in-a.html|title= MAIL CHUTE MEN IN MERGER.; Cutler and Other Companies Join in a $2,000,000 Corporation.|accessdate= 2009-02-20 | work=The New York Times | date=1909-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for clogs to form in a mail chute. &lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt; For two weeks in 1986, more than 40,000 letters accumulated in the mail chute of the [[1221 Avenue of the Americas|McGraw-Hill Building]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=Clog&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Daneil B.|title=F.Y.I.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/nyregion/fyi-583979.html|accessdate=7 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, a spokesperson for the New York district of the Postal Service claimed that the service responded to two or three calls to clear stuck mail chutes every week.&lt;ref name=Clog /&gt;

==Current use==
In more recent decades, buildings such as Chicago's [[John Hancock Center]], the [[Chrysler Building]], and the old [[General Electric Building|RCA Building]] in New York City have shut down their chutes.&lt;ref name ="postal2"/&gt; The reason is the increase of modern mail rooms in the building lobby with associated mail boxes available for the building tenants.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} There remain, however, about 360 buildings in Chicago with mail chutes, and more than 900 active chutes exist in [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]] of New York City alone, as well as elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Luke|title=New York City's Mail Chutes are Lovely, Ingenious and Almost Entirely Ignored|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/new-york-citys-mail-chutes-are-lovely-ingenious-and-almost-entirely-ignored|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, however, the [[National Fire Protection Association]] has banned mail chutes in all new building construction. Buildings currently using mail chutes in New York include the Chanin Building, Trinity Building, Empire State Building, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and in Boston the historic [[The Lenox Hotel | Lenox Hotel]] in the Back Bay.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}   [[Image:IdahoBldgMailChute02026.JPG|thumb|widthpx|A Cutler mail chute, still in service as of 2010, in the lobby of the Idaho Building in downtown [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].]]

==Other installations==
The London Transport HQ at [[55 Broadway]] had a system installed. The chute slot for 'London &amp; Abroad' mail plate says 'Cutler Mailing-System Cutler-Mail-Chute-Co Rochester,NY,USA'.(As shown BBC 'Art Deco Icons: London Transport' TV programme aired Nov 09.)
The 14-story Richmond Trust Company Building (629 E. Main St., Richmond, VA)[a.k.a. Southern States Building or Virginia Department of Environmental Health Building], completed in 1922, has an inactive Cutler mail chute system. Hotel Saskatchewan in Regina, Manitoba, Canada still has an operational mail cutler system. [[Stelco Tower]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada, completed in 1973, also has an operational mail chute; a rare example of a mail chute in a modern skyscraper.

In [[anatomy]], a '''meatus''' {{IPAc-en|m|iː|ˈ|eɪ|t|ə|s}},&lt;ref
&gt;''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989, as {{IPA|/miːˈeɪtəs/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; plural "meatus" or "meatuses",&lt;ref
&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meatus Entry "meatus" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; is a natural body opening or canal.

'''Meatus''' may refer to:
* the [[external acoustic meatus]], the opening of the ear canal
* The [[internal auditory meatus]], a canal in the temporal bone of the skull
* the [[urinary meatus]], which is the opening of the [[urethra]], situated on the [[glans penis]] in males, and in the [[vulva]] in females
* the [[superior meatus]], [[middle meatus]] and [[inferior meatus]] of the nose

(The plural forms of "meatus" are: ''meatus'', as a Latin form (of the [[Latin declension#d4|fourth declension noun class]], which the word belongs to); or ''meatuses'', as a normally derived English plural; or often, and incorrectly, ''meati'', by false analogy with the very common Latin ''-us/-i'' forms (such as ''alumnus/alumni''), i.e., the [[Latin declension#d1|second declension noun class]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">'''Membrane computing''' (or '''MC''') is an area within [[computer science]] that seeks to discover new [[computational model]]s from the study of biological [[Cell (biology)|cells]], particularly of the [[cellular membrane]]s. It is a sub-task of creating a [[cellular model]].

Membrane computing deals with distributed and parallel computing models, processing multisets of symbol objects in a localized manner. Thus, evolution rules allow for evolving objects to be encapsulated into compartments defined by membranes. The communications between compartments and with the environment play an essential role in the processes. The various types of membrane systems are known as [[P systems]] after [[Gheorghe Păun]] who first conceived the model in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Păun|first=Gheorghe|title=Introduction to Membrane Computing|url=http://psystems.disco.unimib.it/download/MembIntro2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An essential ingredient of a [[P system]] is its membrane structure, which can be a hierarchical arrangement of membranes, as in a cell, or a net of membranes (placed in the nodes of a graph), as in a tissue or a neural net. [[P systems]] are often depicted graphically with drawings.

[[File:P-System Membrane Format.pdf|Nine Region Membrane Computer|thumb]]

The intuition behind the notion of a membrane is a three-dimensional vesicle from biology.  However the concept itself is more general, and a membrane is seen as a separator of two regions.  The membrane provides for  selective communication between the two regions. As per Gheorghe Păun, the separation is of the [[Euclidean space]] into a finite “inside” and an infinite “outside”.  The selective communication is where the computing comes in. 

Graphical representations may have numerous elements, according to the variation of the model that is being studied. For example, a rule may produce the special symbol δ, in which case the membrane that contains it is dissolved and all its contents move up in the region hierarchy.

The variety of suggestions from biology and the range of possibilities to define the architecture and the functioning of a membrane-based multiset processing device are practically endless.  Indeed the membrane computing literature contains a very large number of models. Thus, MC is not merely a theory related to a specific model, it is a framework for devising compartmentalized models.

Chemicals are modeled by symbols, or alternatively by strings of symbols. The region, which is defined by a membrane, can contain other symbols or strings (collectively referred to as objects) or other membranes, so that a [[P system]] has exactly one outer membrane, called the skin membrane, and a hierarchical relationship governing all its membranes under the skin membrane. 

If objects are symbols, then their multiplicity within a region matters; however multi-sets are also used in some string models. Regions have associated rules that define how objects are produced, consumed, passed to other regions and otherwise interact with one another. The nondeterministic maximally parallel application of rules throughout the system is a transition between system states, and a sequence of transitions is called a computation. Particular goals can be defined to signify a halting state, at which point the result of the computation would be the objects contained in a particular region.  Alternatively the result may be made up of objects sent out of the skin membrane to the environment.

Many variant models have been studied, and interest has focused on proving computational universality for systems with a small number of membranes, for the purpose of solving NP-complete problems such as [[Boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems]] and the [[Travelling salesman problem|traveling salesman problem (TSP)]]. The [[P systems]] may trade space and time complexities and less often use models to explain natural processes in living cells.  The studies devise models that may at least theoretically be implemented on hardware. To date, the [[P systems]] are nearly all theoretical models that have never been reduced to practice, although a practical system is given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|20090124506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mold health issues''' are potentially harmful effects of [[mold]]s.

Molds (US usage; British English "moulds") are ubiquitous in the biosphere, and mold [[spores]] are a common component of household and workplace dust. The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported in its June 2006 report, 'Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods,' that "excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=A spreading concern: inhalational health effects of mold |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=A300–5 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17589582 |pmc=1892134 |doi=10.1289/ehp.115-a300}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mold spores are present in abnormally high quantities, they can present especially hazardous health risks to humans after prolonged exposure, including allergic reactions or poisoning by [[mycotoxin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality: Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or causing fungal infection ([[mycosis]]).

==Health effects==

Studies have shown that people who are [[atopic]] (sensitive), already suffer from [[allergies]], [[asthma]], or compromised [[immune system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stöppler|first=Melissa Conrad|title=Mold Exposure|website=medicinenet.com|date=July 16, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mold_exposure/page2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occupy damp or moldy buildings are at an increased risk of health problems such as inflammatory and toxic responses to mold spores, metabolites and other components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Elisabeth |last1=Heseltine |first2=Jerome |last2=Rosen, ed.|title=WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: dampness and mould|year= 2009 |page=93| ISBN= 978 92 890 4168 3 |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common health problem is an allergic reaction. Other problems are respiratory and/or immune system responses including respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, exacerbation of asthma, and rarely [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], allergic alveolitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis. Severe reactions are rare but possible. A person's reaction to mold depends on their sensitivity and other health conditions, the amount of mold present, length of exposure and the type of mold or mold products.

Some molds also produce [[mycotoxins]] that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. The term "toxic mold" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'', not to all molds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 19854819| year = 2009| author1 = Empting| first1 = L. D.| title = Neurologic and neuropsychiatric syndrome features of mold and mycotoxin exposure| journal = Toxicology and Industrial Health| volume = 25| issue = 9–10| pages = 577–81| doi = 10.1177/0748233709348393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged exposure, e.g., daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.

The five most common genera of indoor molds are ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Alternaria]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma]]''.

Damp environments which allow mold to grow can also produce bacteria and help release [[volatile organic compounds]].

===Symptoms of mold exposure===
Symptoms of mold exposure can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnesota Department of Health|title=Mold and Moisture in Homes|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mold/|publisher=Minnesota North Star|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Nasal and sinus congestion, runny nose
*Respiratory problems, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing, chest tightness
*Cough
*Throat irritation
*Sneezing / Sneezing fits

==== Health effects linking to asthma ====
Infants may develop respiratory symptoms as a result of exposure to a specific type of fungal mold, called Penicillium. Signs that an infant may have mold-related respiratory problems include (but are not limited to) a persistent cough and/or wheeze. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during their first year of life.  Studies have shown that a correlation exists between the probability of developing asthma and increased exposure to ''Penicillium''. The levels are deemed ‘no mold’  to ‘low level’, from ‘low’  to ‘intermediate’, and from ‘intermediate’  to ‘high’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gent|first=Janneane|title=Levels of Household Mold Associated with Respiratory Symptoms in the First Year of Life in a Cohort at Risk for Asthma|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241132/pdf/ehp0110-a00781.pdf|journal= Environ Health Perspect|accessdate=November 18, 2011|pmc=1241132|pmid=12460818|volume=110|pages=A781-6|doi=10.1289/ehp.021100781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mold exposures have a variety of health effects depending on the person. Some people are more sensitive to mold than others. Exposure to mold can cause a number of health issues such as; throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing, as well as skin irritation in some cases.  Exposure to mold may also cause heightened sensitivity depending on the time and nature of exposure.  People at higher risk for mold allergies are people with chronic lung illnesses, which will result in more severe reactions when exposed to mold.

There has been sufficient evidence that damp indoor environments are correlated with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing, and wheezing in people with asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Aaron|title=WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood specific mold health effects===
Among children and adolescents, the most common health effect post-flooding was lower respiratory tract symptoms though there was a lack of association with measurements of total fungi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabito|first=Felicia A.|last2=Iqbal|first2=Shahed|last3=Kiernan|first3=Michael P.|last4=Holt|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Chew|first5=Ginger L.|title=Children's respiratory health and mold levels in New Orleans after Katrina: A preliminary look|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091674907022609|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=121|issue=3|pages=622–625|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that these respiratory symptoms were positively associated with exposure to water damaged homes, exposure included being inside without participating in clean up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Despite lower respiratory effects among all children, there was a significant difference in health outcomes between children with pre-existing conditions and children without.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Children with pre-existing conditions were at greater risk that can likely be attributed to the greater disruption of care in the face of flooding and natural disaster.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Health effects in children and adolescents with chronic risk were also found to be at an increased risk of adverse outcomes following a natural disaster including diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, allergies, HIV/AIDS, other immune disease, heart defects, cystic fibrosis, depression, seizure disorders, Sickle Cell disease, kidney failure, and liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=Barbara|last2=Donato|first2=Jessica|last3=Duggan|first3=Alyson|last4=Perrin|first4=Keith|last5=Bronfin|first5=Daniel R.|last6=Ratard|first6=Raoult|last7=VanDyke|first7=Russell|last8=Magnus|first8=Manya|date=2007-05-01|title=Adverse Health Outcomes after Hurricane Katrina among Children and Adolescents with Chronic Conditions|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/214414|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=2|pages=405–417|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0043|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mold is the primary focus post flooding for residents, the effects of dampness alone must also be considered. According to the Institute of Medicine, there is a significant association between dampness in the home and wheeze, cough, and upper respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendell|first=Mark J.|last2=Mirer|first2=Anna G.|last3=Cheung|first3=Kerry|last4=Tong|first4=My|last5=Douwes|first5=Jeroen|title=Respiratory and Allergic Health Effects of Dampness, Mold, and Dampness-Related Agents: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1002410|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en-US|volume=119|issue=6|pages=748–756|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002410}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later analysis determined that 30% to 50% of asthma-related health outcomes are associated with not only mold, but also dampness in buildings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another health effect associated with dampness and mold is Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), which is defined by manifestations of symptomatic illness as a result of poor indoor air quality and pollutant exposures .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Signs of potentially illness-causing buildings include condensation on the windows, high humidity in the bathrooms, a moldy odor, or water leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anyanwu|first=Ebere C.|last2=Campbell|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Vojdani|first3=Aristo|title=Neurophysiological Effects of Chronic Indoor Environmental Toxic Mold Exposure on Children|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2003.22|journal=The Scientific World Journal|language=en|volume=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1100/tsw.2003.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is a proven correlation between mold exposure and the development of upper and lower respiratory syndromes, there are still fewer incidences of negative health effect than one might expect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbeau|first=Deborah N.|last2=Grimsley|first2=L. Faye|last3=White|first3=LuAnn E.|last4=El-Dahr|first4=Jane M.|last5=Lichtveld|first5=Maureen|date=2010-03-01|title=Mold Exposure and Health Effects Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=31|issue=1|pages=165–178|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643|issn=0163-7525}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barbeau and colleagues suggested that studies do not show a greater impact from mold exposure for a number of reasons: 1) the types of health effects are not severe and are therefore not caught; 2) people whose homes have flooded find alternative housing to prevent exposure; 3) self-selection, the healthier people participated in mold clean-up and were less likely to get sick; 4) exposures were time-limited as result of remediation efforts and; 5) the lack of access to health care post-flooding may result in fewer illnesses being discovered and reported for their association with mold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are also certain notable scientific limitations in studying the exposure effects of molds on individuals because there are currently no known biomarkers that can prove that a person has been exposed to molds.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molds, Toxic Molds, and Indoor Air Quality|last=Davis|first=Pamela|publisher=California State Library|year=2001|isbn=1-58703-133-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is currently impossible to prove correlation between mold exposure and symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Mold-associated conditions ==
Health problems associated with high levels of airborne [[mold spore]]s include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date =November 8, 2005  |title = Mold: A Health Hazard (Release #1605-096) | url= http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=20379  | publisher= FEMA | accessdate= September 25, 2007 }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}} [[allergic reaction]]s, [[asthma]] episodes, irritations of the eye, nose and throat, [[Sinus cavity|sinus]] congestion, and other respiratory problems, although it should be noted that mold spores won't actually cause asthma, just irritate existing conditions.  For example, residents of homes with mold are at an elevated risk for both respiratory infections and bronchitis.&lt;ref name="Fisk 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisk WJ, Eliseeva EA, Mendell MJ |title=Association of residential dampness and mold with respiratory tract infections and bronchitis: a meta-analysis |journal=Environ Health |volume=9 |pages=72 |year=2010 |pmid=21078183 |pmc=3000394 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-9-72 |url=http://www.ehjournal.net/content/9//72}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mold spores are inhaled by an [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromise]]d individual, some mold spores may begin to grow on living tissue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Müller FM, Seidler M |title=Characteristics of pathogenic fungi and antifungal therapy in cystic fibrosis |journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=957–64 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20695750 |doi=10.1586/eri.10.72 |url=http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/eri.10.72?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; attaching to cells along the [[respiratory tract]] and causing further problems.&lt;ref&gt;Simicic S, Matos T, “Microbiological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.” Zdravnisji vestnik-slovanian medical journal. 2010, Vol. 79, Issue 10, p. 716-725.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Erol S |title=Nosocomial aspergillosis: epidemiology and control |language=Turkish |journal=Mikrobiyol Bul |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=323–38 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20549969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, when this occurs, the illness is an [[epiphenomenon]] and not the primary pathology. Also, mold may produce mycotoxins, either before or after exposure to humans, potentially causing toxicity.

===Fungal infection===
{{Further|Mycosis}}
A serious health threat from mold exposure for immunocompromised individuals is systemic fungal infection (systemic [[mycosis]]). Immunocompromised individuals exposed to high levels of mold, or individuals with chronic exposure may become infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nucci M, Anaissie E |title=Fusarium infections in immunocompromised patients |journal=Clin.

Mycotoxins may or may not be produced by the invading mold.

[[Dermatophyte]]s are the parasitic fungi that cause skin infections such as [[athlete's foot]] and [[tinea cruris]]. Most dermataphyte fungi take the form of a mold, as opposed to a yeast, with appearance (when cultured) that is similar to other molds.

===Mold-induced hypersensitivity===
The most common form of [[hypersensitivity]] is caused by the direct exposure to inhaled mold spores that can be dead or alive or [[hypha]]l fragments which can lead to [[allergic asthma]] or [[allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref name="Indian"&gt;Indian Health Service: Bemidji Area Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Environmental Health Services Section “Guideline on the Assessment and Remediation of Fungi in Indoor Environments”&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common effects are [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), watery eyes, coughing and [[asthma|asthma attacks]].  Another form of hypersensitivity is [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]].  Exposure can occur at home, at work or in other settings.&lt;ref name="Indian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hp/hp_summary.html |title=What Is Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis? |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is predicted that about 5% of people have some airway symptoms due to allergic reactions to molds in their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 12762072| year = 2003| last1 = Hardin | first1 = B.

===Mycotoxin toxicity===
{{Main|Mycotoxin}}
Molds excrete toxic compounds called [[mycotoxin]]s, secondary metabolites produced by fungi under certain environmental conditions. These environmental conditions affect the production of mycotoxins at the transcription level. Temperature, water activity and pH, strongly influence mycotoxin biosynthesis by increasing the level of transcription within the fungal spore. It has also been found that low levels of fungicides can boost mycotoxin synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reverberi M, Ricelli A, Zjalic S, Fabbri AA, Fanelli C |title=Natural functions of mycotoxins and control of their biosynthesis in fungi |journal=Appl.

Extreme exposure to very high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death; fortunately, such exposures rarely to never occur in normal exposure scenarios, even in residences with serious mold problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Prolonged exposure, such as daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The health hazards produced by mold have been associated with [[sick building syndrome]], but no validated studies have been able to demonstrate that normal indoor exposures to these common organisms pose a significant threat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

It is thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} that all molds may produce [[mycotoxins]] and thus all molds may be potentially toxic if large enough quantities are ingested, or the human becomes exposed to extreme quantities of mold. Mycotoxins are not produced all the time, but only under specific growing conditions. Mycotoxins are harmful or lethal to humans and animals only when exposure is high enough, [[The dose makes the poison|as with absolutely all other substances]].

Mycotoxins can be found on the mold spore and mold fragments, and therefore they can also be found on the substrate upon which the mold grows.  Routes of entry for these insults can include ingestion, dermal exposure and inhalation.

Some mycotoxins cause immune system responses that vary considerably, depending on the individual. The duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure and the concentration of the insult (exposure) are elements in triggering immune system response.

[[Aflatoxin]] is an example of a mycotoxin. It is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on foods and feeds, especially in field corn and peanuts.&lt;ref name=fsis&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/molds-on-food-are-they-dangerous_/ United States Food Safety and Inspection Service &gt; Molds On Food: Are They Dangerous?] Last Modified: August 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] from mold were thought to be the result of exposure to the [[mycotoxin]]s of some mold species, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]''.  However, studies are suggesting that the so-called toxic effects are actually the result of chronic activation of the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Studies indicate that up to 25% of the population have the genetic capability of experiencing chronic inflammation to mold exposure, but it is unknown how many actually experience such symptoms due to frequent misdiagnosis.  A 1993–94 [[case study]] based on cases of [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] in infants in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] originally concluded there was [[Causality|causal relationship]] between the exposure and the disease.  The investigators revisited the cases and established that there was no link to the exposure to ''S. chartrum'' and the infants in their homes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The common house mold, ''[[Trichoderma longibrachiatum]]'', produces small toxic peptides containing amino acids not found in common proteins, like alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, called trilongins (up to 10% w/w). Their toxicity is due to absorption into cells and production of nano-channels that obstruct vital [[ion channels]] that ferry potassium and sodium ions across the [[cell membrane]]. This affects in the cells [[action potential]] profile, as seen in [[cardiomyocytes]], [[pneumocytes]] and [[neurons]] leading to conduction defects. Trilongins are highly resistant to heat and [[antimicrobials]] making [[primary prevention]] the only management option.&lt;ref&gt;Reason Discovered for the Toxicity of Indoor Mould – ScienceDaily (Oct. 12, 2012) : https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121012074655.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;20-Residue and 11-residue peptaibols from the fungus Trichoderma longibrachiatum are synergistic in forming Na+/K+-permeable channels and adverse action towards mammalian cells      Raimo Mikkola1,†,     Maria A.

== Exposure sources and prevention ==
The main sources of mold exposure are from the indoor air in buildings with substantial mold growth, and from ingestion of food with mold growths.

===Air===
{{Main|Indoor air quality}}
Prevention of mold exposure and its ensuing health issues begins with prevention of mold growth in the first place by avoiding a mold-supporting environment such as humid air. Extensive flooding and water damage can support extensive mold growth. Following hurricanes, homes with greater flood damage, especially those with more than {{convert|3|ft|m}} of indoor flooding, demonstrated higher levels of mold growth compared with homes with little or no flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbeau DN, Grimsley LF, White LE, [[Jane El-Dahr|El-Dahr JM]], Lichtveld M |title=Mold exposure and health effects following hurricanes Katrina and Rita |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=31 |pages=165–78 |year=2010 |pmid=20070193 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoemaker RC, House DE |title=Sick building syndrome (SBS) and exposure to water-damaged buildings: time series study, clinical trial and mechanisms |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=573–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17010568 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2006.07.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-0362(06)00085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of a hurricane is the worst-case scenario, but the concept of water damage supporting widespread mold growth is more generally applicable.

It is useful to perform an assessment of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels.&lt;ref name="control"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kumar, Manisha |author2=Verma, Rajesh K |title=Fungi diversity, their effects on building materials, occupants and control– a brief review |journal=Journal of Scientific and industrial Research |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=657–661 |date=September 2010 |url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/10103 |issn=0975-1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wilson SC, Holder WH, Easterwood KV, etal |title=Identification, remediation, and monitoring processes used in a mold-contaminated high school |journal=Adv.

A common issue with mold hazards in the household is the placement of furniture, and the lack of ventilation which this causes to certain parts of the wall. The simplest method of avoiding mold in a home so affected is to move the furniture in question.

Adverse respiratory health effects are associated with occupancy in buildings with moisture and mold damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krieger J, Jacobs DE, Ashley PJ, etal |title=Housing interventions and control of asthma-related indoor biologic agents: a review of the evidence |journal=J Public Health Manag Pract |volume=16 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S11–20 |year=2010 |pmid=20689369 |doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e3181ddcbd9 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1078-4659&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=S11|pmc=3934496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molds may excrete liquids or low-volatility gases, but the concentrations are so low that frequently they cannot be detected even with sensitive analytical sampling techniques.  Sometimes these by-products are detectable by odor, in which case they are referred to as "ergonomic odors" meaning the odors are detectable, but do not indicate toxicologically significant exposures.

===Food===
[[File:Moldy nectarines.jpg|thumb|Moldy [[nectarine]]s that were in a refrigerator. The nectarine with black mold is also affecting the nectarine underneath.]]
Molds that are often found on meat and poultry include members of the genera ''[[Alternaria]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', [[Botryotinia|''Botrytis'']], ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Geotrichum]]'', ''[[Mortierella]]'', ''[[Mucor]]'', ''[[Neurospora]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', and ''[[Rhizopus]]''.&lt;ref name=foodborne_fungi/&gt;  Grain crops in particular incur considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens, post-harvest spoilage, and insect damage. A number of common microfungi are important agents of post-harvest spoilage, notably members of the genera ''Aspergillus'', ''Fusarium'', and ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref name=foodborne_fungi/&gt; A number of these produce mycotoxins (soluble, non-volatile toxins produced by a range of microfungi that demonstrate specific and potent toxic properties on human and animal cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kankolongo M, Hell K, Nawa I |title=Assessment for fungal, mycotoxin and insect spoilage in maize stored for human consumption in Zambia |journal=J.

Dietary exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, commonly produced by growth of the fungus ''Aspergillus flavus'' on improperly stored ground nuts in many areas of the developing world, is known to independently (and synergistically with Hepatitis B virus) induce liver cancer.&lt;ref name=liu2010/&gt; Mycotoxin-contaminated grain and other food products have a significant impact on human and animal health globally. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 25% of the world's food may be contaminated by mycotoxins.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;

Prevention of mold exposure from food is generally to consume food that has no mold growths on it.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt; Also, mold growth in the first place can be prevented by the same concept of [[mold growth, assessment, and remediation]] that prevents air exposure. In addition, it is especially useful to clean the inside of the refrigerator, and to ensure dishcloths, towels, sponges and mops are clean.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt;

Ruminants are considered to have increased resistance to some mycotoxins, presumably due to the superior mycotoxin-degrading capabilities of their gut microbiota.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;  The passage of mycotoxins through the food chain may also have important consequences on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tanuma H, Hiramatsu M, Mukai H, etal |title=Case report.

=== Flooding ===
Flooding in houses causes a unique opportunity for mold growth which may be attributed to adverse health effects in people exposed to the mold, especially children and adolescents. In a study on the health effects of mold exposure after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the predominant types of mold were ''[[Aspergillus]], [[Penicillium|Penicillum]]'', and ''[[Cladosporium]]'' with indoor spore counts ranging from 6,142 – 735,123 spores&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Molds isolated following flooding were different from mold previously reported for non-water damaged homes in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further research found that homes with greater than three feet of indoor flooding demonstrated significantly higher levels of mold than those with little or no flooding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Mitigation ====

Recommended strategies to prevent mold include: avoiding mold-contamination; utilization of environmental controls; the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including skin and eye protection and respiratory protection; and environmental controls such as ventilation and suppression of dust.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Mary|last2=Brown|first2=Clive|last3=Burkhart|first3=Joe|last4=Burton|first4=Nancy|last5=Cox-Ganser|first5=Jean|last6=Damon|first6=Scott|last7=Falk|first7=Henry|last8=Fridkin|first8=Scott|last9=Garbe|first9=Paul|date=2006|title=Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods|jstor=24842334|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Recommendations and Reports|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1–CE–4|doi=10.2307/24842334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When mold cannot be prevented, the CDC recommends clean-up protocol including first taking emergency action to stop water intrusion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Second, they recommend determining the extent of water damage and mold contamination. And third, they recommend planning remediation activities such as establishing containment and protection for workers and occupants; eliminating water or moisture sources if possible; decontaminating or removing damaged materials and drying any wet materials; evaluating whether the space has been successfully remediated; and reassembling the space to control sources of moisture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== History ==
In the 1930s, mold was identified as the cause behind the mysterious deaths of farm animals in Russia and other countries. ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' was found growing on wet grain used for animal feed.  Illness and death also occurred in humans when starving peasants ate large quantities of rotten food grains and cereals that were heavily overgrown with the ''Stachybotrys'' mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=JD|last2=Rand|first2=TG|last3=Jarvis|first3=BB|title=Stachybotrys chartarum: cause of human disease or media darling?|journal=Medical mycology|date=August 2003|volume=41|issue=4|pages=271–91|doi=10.1080/1369378031000137350|pmid=12964721|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369378031000137350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, building [[construction]] techniques changed in response to changing economic realities including the [[energy crisis]]. As a result, homes and buildings became more airtight.  Also, cheaper materials such as [[drywall]] came into common use. The newer building materials reduced the drying potential of the structures making moisture problems more prevalent.  This combination of increased moisture and suitable substrates contributed to increased mold growth inside buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Today, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] and the agriculture industry closely monitor mold and mycotoxin levels in grains and foodstuffs in order to keep the contamination of animal feed and human food supplies below specific levels. In 2005 [[Diamond Pet Foods]], a US pet food manufacturer, experienced a significant rise in the number of corn shipments containing elevated levels of [[aflatoxin]]. This mold toxin eventually made it into the pet food supply, and dozens of dogs and cats died before the company was forced to recall affected products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Pet Food Recalled Due to Aflatoxin|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ArchiveRecalls/2005/ucm111929.htm|work=FDA.gov|accessdate=May 9, 2014|author=Mark Brinkman|date=December 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Investigation of Diamond Pet Food Finds Some Product Exported|url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/newsevents/cvmupdates/ucm048391.htm|work=FDA.gov|accessdate=May 9, 2014|author=FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine Communications Staff|date=December 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a jury awarded $1.2 million in damages in a lawsuit against a landlord for neglecting to repair a mold-infested house in [[Laguna Beach, California]].&lt;ref name=wins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.coastlinepilot.com/2010-04-29/news/cpt-mold04302010_1_mold-tom-ely-water-intrusion|title=Family wins mold lawsuit|work=Coastline Pilot|author=Jonathan Oyama|date=April 29, 2010|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit asserted that a child in the home suffered from severe respiratory problems for several years as a result of the mold.&lt;ref name=wins/&gt;

In 2011, in [[Pocono Mountains|North Pocono]], Pennsylvania, a jury awarded two homeowners $4.3 million in a toxic mold verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.thetimes-tribune.com/4-3m-mold-verdict-buried-in-litigation-1.1109787|title=$4.3M mold verdict buried in litigation|author=Steve McConnell |publisher=The Times-Tribune|date= February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==
While there is a national policy regarding mold, each state is responsible for independently creating and administering their own policy. For example, following Hurricane Harvey, the governor of Texas sought to expand the emergency response to allow mold remediation companies to come from out of state.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bouldercounty.org/disasters/flood/health/mold-remediation/|title=Mold Remediation After a Flood|work=Boulder County|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4790">In [[population ecology]], '''Moran's theorem''' (or the Moran effect) states that the time [[correlation]] of two separate populations of the same species is equal to the correlation between the environmental variabilities where they live. 

The theorem is named after [[Pat Moran (statistician)|Pat Moran]], who stated it in a paper on the dynamics of the [[Canadian lynx]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = P. A. P. | year = 1953 | title = The statistical analysis of the Canadian lynx cycle. II. Synchronization and meteorology | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Zoology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 291–298 | doi=10.1071/zo9530291}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to explain the synchronization of widely dispersed populations. It has the important consequence for [[conservation biology|conservation ecology]] that [[Minimum viable population|viability]] of spatially structured populations is lower than one would expect from the local populations: it increases the probability that several local populations go extinct simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Jörgen Ripa, Theoretical Population Ecology and Evolution Group, [http://equation-of-the-month.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/moran-effect.html   Equation of the month: the Moran effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form it stated: If the two populations have population dynamics given by
:&lt;math&gt;N_1(t+1)=f(N_1(t))+\epsilon_1(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N_2(t+1)=f(N_2(t))+\epsilon_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the population size of population &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a linear renewal function updating the populations in the same way, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; the environmental variabilities. Then &lt;math&gt;\rho_{N_1,N_2}=\rho_{\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The original form assumed a strictly linear structure, but this assumption can be weakened to allow for non-linear functions. It has been suggested that the term "Moran effect" should be used for systems that do not strictly follow the original description.&lt;ref&gt;Esa Ranta, Veijo Kaitala, Per Lundberg, Ecology of Populations, Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In the general case the correlations will be lower, and the accuracy of the Moran description depends on whether the populations tend to converge to an equilibrium state (good accuracy for low variance variability) or tend to oscillate (eventual breakdown of the correlation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Royama | first1 = T. | year = 2005 | title = Moran effect on nonlinear population processes | doi = 10.1890/04-0770 | journal = Ecological Monographs | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 277–293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been tested experimentally in a number of cases, such as variation of fruit production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenstock | first1 = T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5219">'''Network tomography''' is the study of a [[computer network|network]]'s internal characteristics using information derived from end point data. The word [[tomography]] is used to link the field, in concept, to other processes that infer the internal characteristics of an object from external observation, as is done in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] or [[positron emission tomography]] (even though the term [[tomography]] strictly refers to imaging by slicing). The field is a recent development in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]], founded in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Vardi | first =Y. | title =Network Tomography: estimating source-destination traffic intensities from link data | journal =Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume =91  | pages =365–377 | year =1996 | doi =10.2307/2291416 | issue =433 | publisher = American Statistical Association | jstor =2291416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Network tomography advocates that it is possible to map the path data takes through the [[Internet]] by examining information from "edge nodes," the computers in which the data are originated and from which they are requested.

The field is useful for engineers attempting to develop more efficient computer networks. Data derived from network tomography studies can be used to increase [[quality of service]] by limiting link [[packet loss]] and increasing [[routing]] optimization.

==Recent developments==
There have been many published papers and tools in the area of network tomography, which aim to monitor the health of various links in a network in real-time. These can be classified into loss and delay tomography. A summary can be found in  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Castro | first =R. | title =Network Tomography: Recent Developments | journal = Statistical Science | volume =19 | pages =499–517 | year =2004 | doi =10.1214/088342304000000422 | last2 =Coates | first2 =Mark | last3 =Liang | first3 =Gang | last4 =Nowak | first4 =Robert | last5 =Yu | first5 =Bin | author5-link = Bin Yu | issue =3| citeseerx =10.1.1.64.8631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Coates | first =M. | title =Internet tomography | journal =IEEE Signal Processing Magazine | volume =19 | pages =47–65 | year =2002 | doi =10.1109/79.998081 | last2 =Hero Iii | first2 =A.O. | last3 =Nowak | first3 =R. | first4 =Bin | last4 = Yu | author4-link = Bin Yu | issue =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss tomography===
Loss tomography aims to find "lossy" links in a network by sending active "probes" from various vantage points in the network or the Internet. Published work in this area (not exhaustive) includes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Coates | first =M. | title =Network loss inference using unicast end-to-end measurement | journal =Proc. ITC Seminar on IP Traffic, Measurement, and Modeling | volume =28 | year =2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Duffield | first =N. | title =Inferring link loss using striped unicast probes | journal =IEEE Infocom | volume =2 | pages =915–923 | year =2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delay tomography===
The area of delay tomography has also attracted attention in the recent past. It aims to find link delays using end-to-end probes sent from vantage points. This can potentially help isolate links with large queueing delays caused by congestion. Related papers include one by Tsang et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Tsang | first =Y. | title =Network Delay Tomography | journal =IEEE Trans. Signal Process. | volume =51 | pages =2125–2136 | year =2003 | doi =10.1109/TSP.2003.814520 | last2 =Coates | first2 =M. | last3 =Nowak | first3 =R.D. | issue =8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More applications==
The area of network tomography also includes that of inferring network topology using end-to-end probes. Topology discovery is a tradeoff between accuracy vs overhead. In network tomography, the emphasis is to achieve as accurate a picture of the network with minimal overhead. In comparison, other network topology discovery techniques using [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] or [[Route analytics]] aim for greater accuracy with less emphasis on overhead reduction.

Other example applications of network tomography include finding links which are shared by multiple paths (and can thus become potential bottlenecks in the future).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Rubenstein | first =D. | title =Detecting shared congestion of flows via end-to-end measurement | journal =IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking | volume =10 | pages =381–395 | year =2002 | doi =10.1109/TNET.2002.1012369 | last2 =Kurose | first2 =J. | last3 =Towsley | first3 =D. | issue =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that Network Tomography can improve the control of the [[smart grid]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Keshav | first = S. | title =How Internet Concepts and Technologies Can Help Green and Smarten the Electrical Grid | journal =Green Networking '10 Proceedings of the first ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Green networking | pages =35-40 | year =2010 | doi = 10.1145/1851290.1851298 | last2 =Rosenberg | first2 =C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="618">In [[rhetoric]], '''paromoiosis''' is parallelism of sound between the words of two clauses approximately equal in size.  The similarity of sound can occur at the beginning of the clauses, at the end (where it is equivalent to [[homoioteleuton]]), in the middle or throughout the clauses.

For example: "Open to gifts and open to words."

'''Psychographics''' is a qualitative methodology used to describe consumers on psychological attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=William D.|date=May 1975|title=Psychographics: A critical review|jstor=3150443|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=12|pages=196–213|doi=10.2307/3150443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychographics have been applied to the study of [[personality]], values, [[opinions]], [[Attitudes (psychology)|attitudes]], [[self-interest|interests]], and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Jairo Senise | title = Who Is Your Next Customer?
  | journal = Booz Allen Hamilton Inc, Strategy+Business
  | date = 28 September 2007
  | url =http://www.strategy-business.com/press/enewsarticle/enews092807}}&lt;/ref&gt; While psychographics are often equated with lifestyle research, it has been argued{{who|date=October 2017}} that psychographics should apply to the study of cognitive attributes such as attitudes, interests, opinions, and beliefs while lifestyle should apply to the study of overt behavior (e.g., activities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson Jr|first=Thomas W.|last2=Golden|first2=Linda L.|date=1984|title=Lifestyle and psychographics: A critical review and recommendation.|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=00989258&amp;AN=6434172&amp;h=CIsX9Zir8%2b8NXi2BVIt1%2ffswaNv5juoKSAJqetpjmxf4Khxm%2fZCptEMhYQr3%2bMVxLq9TwmulOd3X3PhafMUluA%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d00989258%26AN%3d6434172|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=11|pages=405–411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this area of research focuses on activities, interests, and opinions, psychographic factors are sometimes abbreviated to 'AIO variables'.

==Use==
Psychographic studies of individuals or communities can be valuable in the fields of [[marketing]], [[Demographic profile|demographics]], opinion research, prediction, and [[social studies|social research]] in general. Psychographic attributes can be contrasted with demographic variables (such as age and gender), behavioral variables (such as purchase data or usage rate), and organizational descriptors (sometimes called [[firmographics|firmographic]] variables), such as industry, number of employees, and functional area.

Psychographic methods gained prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]] due to its use in [[microtargeting]] advertisements to narrow constituencies by [[Cambridge Analytica]].&lt;!-- Is the horse's mouth a valid cite? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Dd5aVXLCc --&gt;

==Comparison to demographics==
Psychographics is often confused with [[demographic profile|demographics]], where historical generations may be defined both by demographics, such as the years in which a particular generation is born or even the fertility rates of that generation's parents, but also by psychographic variables like attitudes, personality formation, and cultural touchstones. For example, the traditional approaches to defining the [[Baby Boom Generation]] or [[Generation X]] or [[Millennials]] have relied on both demographic variables (classifying individuals based on birth years) and psychographic variables (such as beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors).

[[Infusionsoft]] published an article arguing than customer psychographic segmentation is more useful than demographic information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Psychographic profiling==
When a relatively complete profile of a person or group's psychographic make-up is constructed, this is called a "psychographic profile". Psychographic profiles are used in [[market segmentation]] as well as in [[advertising]]. Some categories of psychographic factors used in market segmentation include:
* activity, interest, opinion (AIOs)
* attitudes

'''rCOS'''  stands for refinement of  [[Object (philosophy)|object]] and [[Software component|component]] systems. It is a [[formal method]] providing [[component-based]] [[model-driven software]] development.

==Overview==
rCOS was originally developed by [[He Jifeng]], [[Zhiming Liu (computer scientist)|Zhiming Liu]] and Xiaoshan Li at [[UNU-IIST]] in [[Macau]], and consists of a unified multi-view modeling notation with a theory of relational semantic and graph-based [[operational semantics]], a [[refinement calculus]] and tool support for model construction, model analysis and verification, and [[model transformation]]s. Model transformations automate refinement rules and design patterns and generate conditions as proof obligations.  rCOS support multiple dimensional modeling: models at different levels of abstraction related by refinement relations, hierarchy of compositions of components, and models of different views of the system ([[interaction protocol]]s of components, reactive behaviors of components, data functionality, and class structures and data types). Components are composed and integrated based on their models of interfaces to support third party composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |title=rCOS |work=[[UNU-IIST]] |publisher=[[Archive.org]] |date=2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113133741/http://rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reliability''' in [[statistics]] and [[psychometrics]] is the overall consistency of a measure.&lt;ref&gt;William M.K. Trochim, [http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/reliable.php Reliability]&lt;/ref&gt; A measure is said to have a high reliability if it produces similar results under consistent conditions. "It is the characteristic of a set of test scores that relates to the amount of random error from the measurement process that might be embedded in the scores. Scores that are highly reliable are accurate, reproducible, and consistent from one testing occasion to another. That is, if the testing process were repeated with a group of test takers, essentially the same results would be obtained. Various kinds of reliability coefficients, with values ranging between 0.00 (much error) and 1.00 (no error), are usually used to indicate the amount of error in the scores." &lt;ref&gt; National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorR &lt;/ref&gt; For example, measurements of people's height and weight are often extremely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Neil R. Carlson ... [et|title=Psychology : the science of behaviour|year=2009|publisher=Pearson|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|edition=4th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="themasb.org"&gt;The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board]] (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212100753/http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ |date=12 February 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are several general classes of reliability estimates:
*'''[[Inter-rater reliability]]''' assesses the degree of agreement between two or more raters in their appraisals.
*'''[[Test-retest reliability]]''' assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent from one test administration to the next. Measurements are gathered from a single rater who uses the same methods or instruments and the same testing conditions.&lt;ref name="themasb.org"/&gt; This includes [[intra-rater reliability]].
*'''Inter-method reliability''' assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent when there is a variation in the methods or instruments used. This allows inter-rater reliability to be ruled out. When dealing with [[Form (document)|forms]], it may be termed '''parallel-forms reliability'''.&lt;ref name=socialresearchmethods&gt;[http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/reltypes.php Types of Reliability] The Research Methods Knowledge Base. Last Revised: 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Internal consistency]] reliability''', assesses the consistency of results across items within a test.&lt;ref name=socialresearchmethods/&gt;

==Difference from validity{{anchor|Validity}}==
{{see also|Validity (statistics)#Reliability}}

Reliability does not imply [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. That is, a reliable measure that is measuring something consistently is not necessarily measuring what you want to be measured. For example, while there are many reliable tests of specific abilities, not all of them would be valid for predicting, say, job performance.

While reliability does not imply [[validity (statistics)|validity]], reliability does place a limit on the overall validity of a test. A test that is not perfectly reliable cannot be perfectly valid, either as a means of measuring attributes of a person or as a means of predicting scores on a criterion. While a reliable test may provide useful valid information, a test that is not reliable cannot possibly be valid.&lt;ref name=David&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidshofer|first=Kevin R. Murphy, Charles O.|title=Psychological testing : principles and applications|year=2005|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-13-189172-3|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a set of [[weighing scales]] consistently measured the weight of an object as 500 grams over the true weight, then the scale would be very reliable, but it would not be valid (as the returned weight is not the true weight). For the scale to be valid, it should return the true weight of an object. This example demonstrates that a perfectly reliable measure is not necessarily valid, but that a valid measure necessarily must be reliable.

==General model==

In practice, testing measures are never perfectly consistent. Theories of test reliability have been developed to estimate the effects of inconsistency on the accuracy of measurement. The basic starting point for almost all theories of test reliability is the idea that test scores reflect the influence of two sorts of factors:&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

1. '''Factors that contribute to consistency:''' stable characteristics of the individual or the attribute that one is trying to measure

2. '''Factors that contribute to inconsistency:''' features of the individual or the situation that can affect test scores but have nothing to do with the attribute being measured.

These factors include:&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

* Temporary but general characteristics of the individual: health, fatigue, motivation, emotional strain
* Temporary and specific characteristics of individual: comprehension of the specific test task, specific tricks or techniques of dealing with the particular test materials, fluctuations of memory, attention or accuracy
* Aspects of the testing situation: freedom from distractions, clarity of instructions, interaction of personality, sex, or race of examiner 
* Chance factors: luck in selection of answers by sheer guessing, momentary distractions

The goal of estimating reliability is to determine how much of the variability in test scores is due to '''errors in measurement''' and how much is due to variability in '''true scores'''.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

A '''true score''' is the replicable feature of the concept being measured. It is the part of the observed score that would recur across different measurement occasions in the absence of error.

'''Errors of measurement''' are composed of both [[random error]]  and [[systematic error]]. It represents the discrepancies between scores obtained on tests and the corresponding true scores.

This conceptual breakdown is typically represented by the simple equation:

: &lt;big&gt;'''''Observed test score = true score + errors of measurement'''''&lt;/big&gt;

==Classical test theory==
{{main|Classical test theory}}

The goal of reliability theory is to estimate errors in measurement and to suggest ways of improving tests so that errors are minimized.

The central assumption of reliability theory is that measurement errors are essentially random. This does not mean that errors arise from random processes. For any individual, an error in measurement is not a completely random event. However, across a large number of individuals, the causes of measurement error are assumed to be so varied that measure errors act as random variables.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

If errors have the essential characteristics of random variables, then it is reasonable to assume that errors are equally likely to be positive or negative, and that they are not correlated with true scores or with errors on other tests.

It is assumed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulliksen|first=Harold|title=Theory of mental tests|year=1987|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8058-0024-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Mean error of measurement = 0

2. True scores and errors are uncorrelated

3. Errors on different measures are uncorrelated

Reliability theory shows that the variance of obtained scores is simply the sum of the variance of '''true scores''' plus the variance of '''errors of measurement'''.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_X = \sigma^2_T + \sigma^2_E &lt;/math&gt;

This equation suggests that test scores vary as the result of two factors:

1. Variability in true scores

2. Variability due to errors of measurement.

The reliability coefficient &lt;math&gt;\rho_{xx'} &lt;/math&gt; provides an index of the relative influence of true and error scores on attained test scores. In its general form, the reliability coefficient is defined as the ratio of ''true score'' variance to the total variance of test scores. Or, equivalently, one minus the ratio of the variation of the ''error score'' and the variation of the ''observed score'':

: &lt;math&gt; \rho_{xx'} = \frac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_X} = 1 - \frac{ \sigma^2_E }{ \sigma^2_X } &lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, there is no way to directly observe or calculate the '''true score''', so a variety of methods are used to estimate the reliability of a test.

Some examples of the methods to estimate reliability include [[test-retest reliability]], [[internal consistency]] reliability, and ''parallel-test reliability''. Each method comes at the problem of figuring out the source of error in the test somewhat differently.

==Item response theory==
It was well-known to classical test theorists that measurement precision is not uniform across the scale of measurement.  Tests tend to distinguish better for test-takers with moderate trait levels and worse among high- and low-scoring test-takers.  [[Item response theory]] extends the concept of reliability from a single index to a function called the ''information function''.  The IRT information function is the inverse of the conditional observed score standard error at any given test score.

==Estimation==

The goal of estimating reliability is to determine how much of the variability in test scores is due to errors in measurement and how much is due to variability in true scores.

Four practical strategies have been developed that provide workable methods of estimating test reliability.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

1. '''[[Test-retest reliability]] method''': directly assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent from one test administration to the next.

It involves:

* Administering a test to a group of individuals
* Re-administering the same test to the same group at some later time
* Correlating the first set of scores with the second

The correlation between scores on the first test and the scores on the retest is used to estimate the reliability of the test using the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]]: see also [[item-total correlation]].

2. '''Parallel-forms method''':

The key to this method is the development of alternate test forms that are equivalent in terms of content, response processes and statistical characteristics. For example, alternate forms exist for several tests of general intelligence, and these tests are generally seen equivalent.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

With the parallel test model it is possible to develop two forms of a test that are equivalent in the sense that a person’s true score on form A would be identical to their true score on form B. If both forms of the test were administered to a number of people, differences between scores on form A and form B may be due to errors in measurement only.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

It involves:

* Administering one form of the test to a group of individuals
* At some later time, administering an alternate form of the same test to the same group of people
* Correlating scores on form A with scores on form B

The correlation between scores on the two alternate forms is used to estimate the reliability of the test.

This method provides a partial solution to many of the problems inherent in the '''[[test-retest reliability]] method'''. For example, since the two forms of the test are different, [[carryover effect]] is less of a problem. Reactivity effects are also partially controlled; although taking the first test may change responses to the second test. However, it is reasonable to assume that the effect will not be as strong with alternate forms of the test as with two administrations of the same test.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

However, this technique has its disadvantages:

* It may be very difficult to create several alternate forms of a test
* It may also be difficult if not impossible to guarantee that two alternate forms of a test are parallel measures

3. '''Split-half method''':

This method treats the two halves of a measure as alternate forms. It provides a simple solution to the problem that the '''parallel-forms method''' faces: the difficulty in developing alternate forms.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

It involves:

* Administering a test to a group of individuals
* Splitting the test in half
* Correlating scores on one half of the test with scores on the other half of the test

The correlation between these two split halves is used in estimating the reliability of the test. This halves reliability estimate is then stepped up to the full test length using the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]].

There are several ways of splitting a test to estimate reliability. For example, a 40-item vocabulary test could be split into two subtests, the first one made up of items 1 through 20 and the second made up of items 21 through 40. However, the responses from the first half may be systematically different from responses in the second half due to an increase in item difficulty and fatigue.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

In splitting a test, the two halves would need to be as similar as possible, both in terms of their content and in terms of the probable state of the respondent. The simplest method is to adopt an odd-even split, in which the odd-numbered items form one half of the test and the even-numbered items form the other. This arrangement guarantees that each half will contain an equal number of items from the beginning, middle, and end of the original test.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

4. '''[[Internal consistency]]''': assesses the consistency of results across items within a test. The most common internal consistency measure is [[Cronbach's alpha]], which is usually interpreted as the mean of all possible split-half coefficients.&lt;ref name="Cortina"&gt;Cortina, J.M., (1993). What Is Coefficient Alpha? An Examination of Theory and Applications. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 78''(1), 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cronbach's alpha is a generalization of an earlier form of estimating internal consistency, [[Kuder–Richardson Formula 20]].&lt;ref name="Cortina" /&gt; Although the most commonly used, there are some misconceptions regarding Cronbach's alpha.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, N. (2010). Understanding a widely misunderstood statistic: Cronbach's alpha. Paper presented at Southwestern Educational Research Association (SERA) Conference 2010, New Orleans, LA (ED526237).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Eisinga|first2=M.|last2=Te Grotenhuis|first3=B.|last3=Pelzer|title=The reliability of a two-item scale: Pearson, Cronbach or Spearman-Brown? |journal= International Journal of Public Health|year=2012|volume=58|issue=4|pages=637–642|doi= 10.1007/s00038-012-0416-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These measures of reliability differ in their sensitivity to different sources of error and so need not be equal.  Also, reliability is a property of the ''scores of a measure'' rather than the measure itself and are thus said to be ''sample dependent''.  Reliability estimates from one sample might differ from those of a second sample (beyond what might be expected due to sampling variations) if the second sample is drawn from a different population because the true variability is different in this second population.  (This is true of measures of all types—yardsticks might measure houses well yet have poor reliability when used to measure the lengths of insects.)

Reliability may be improved by clarity of expression (for written assessments), lengthening the measure,&lt;ref name="Cortina" /&gt; and other informal means. However, formal psychometric analysis, called item analysis, is considered the most effective way to increase reliability. This analysis consists of computation of '''item difficulties''' and '''item discrimination''' indices, the latter index involving computation of correlations between the items and sum of the item scores of the entire test. If items that are too difficult, too easy, and/or have near-zero or negative discrimination are replaced with better items, the reliability of the measure will increase.

* &lt;math&gt;R(t) = 1 - F(t).&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R(t) = \exp(-\lambda t).&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the failure rate)

'''Sales process engineering''' is the [[engineering]] of better [[sales process]]es. It is intended to design better ways of [[selling]], making [[sales|salespeople's]] efforts more productive. It has been described as "the systematic application of scientific and mathematical principles to achieve the practical goals of a particular sales process".&lt;ref name="Selden1997p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Selden|1997|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Selden pointed out&lt;ref name="Selden1997p23" /&gt; that in this context, sales referred to the output of a process involving a variety of functions across an organization, and not that of a "sales department" alone.&lt;ref name="Selden1997p23" /&gt; Primary areas of application span functions including [[sales]], [[marketing]], and [[customer service]].&lt;ref name="Selden1997p23" /&gt;

Also known as "sales funnel engineering" and "sales pipeline engineering".

==History==
As early as 1900–1915, advocates of [[scientific management]], such as [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and Harlow Stafford Person, recognized that their ideas could be applied not only to [[manual labour]] and [[tradesman|skilled trades]] but also to management, professions, and sales. Person promoted an early form of sales process engineering. At the time, postwar senses of the terms ''sales process engineering'' and ''sales engineering'' did not yet exist; Person called his efforts "sales engineering".&lt;ref name="Dawson2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of modern corporate life in the 1920s through 1960s, sought to apply analysis and synthesis to improve the methods of all functions within a business. After the famous NBC Whitepaper in 1980 titled "[[If Japan Can... Why Can't We?]]" the 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of a variety of approaches, such as [[business process reengineering]], [[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]], [[Six Sigma]], and [[Lean manufacturing|Lean Manufacturing]]. Inevitably some of the people involved in these initiatives tried to begin applying what they learned to sales and marketing.

For instance, Cas Welch was instrumental in designing and installing Westinghouse Electric's Total Quality program. As one of the first such programs in American industry, it was emulated by other firms and government agencies. His audits of Westinghouse sales offices caused him to realize companies were mistaken in their assumption that quality applied primarily to products. "Their focus has been to remove the flies from the soup after the customer complains; not to cook the soup without flies in the first place ... when it would be less expensive and time-consuming for the sales person to do it right the first time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bringing Total Quality to Sales|last=Welch|first=Cas|publisher=ASQC Quality Press|year=1992|isbn=0-87389-130-9|location=|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Cortada was one of IBM's management consultants on market driven quality. His book ''TQM for Sales and Marketing Management''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TQM for Sales and Marketing Management|last=Cortada|first=James|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1993|isbn=0-07-023752-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first attempt to explain the theory of [[Total quality management|TQM]] in a sales and marketing context. George Antoin Smith, Jr. in Naperville, IL, an Electrical Engineering graduate of Purdue University, had been a successful Field Sales Engineer and District Sales Manager of Hewlett Packard electronic components to OEMs. In 1989 George Smith received the HP President's Club Award for career excellence in HP''s sales organization. In 1992, he started a consulting company to demonstrate to sales managers how they could tactically measure and improve sales productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sales Productivity Measurement|last=Smith|first=George|publisher=ASQC Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87389-333-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote the ''Sales Quality Audit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sales Quality Audit|last=Smith|first=George|publisher=ASQC Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87389-337-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd Youngblood, another ex-IBMer, in his book ''The Dolphin and the Cow'' (2004)&lt;ref name="Youngblood2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Youngblood|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized "three core principles": [[continual improvement process|continuous improvement]] of the sales process, [[performance metric|metrics]] to quantitatively judge the rate and degree of improvement, and a well-defined sales process.&lt;ref name="Youngblood2004" /&gt;

Meanwhile, another executive from IBM, Daniel Stowell, had participated in IBM's expansion from selling hardware in the 1960s and '70s "the only way it knew how, through face-to-face sales" to the company's first use of a market channel in a project known as the "Alternate Channels Marketing Test." The idea was to incorporate direct response marketing techniques to accomplish the job of direct salespeople, and the initiative was quite successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sales, Marketing, and Continuous Improvement|last=Stowell|first=Daniel|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1997|isbn=0-7879-0857-6|location=|pages=X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably his story illustrated the need for "consensus management" of the sales team. Traditional ways of managing sales people did not work when team members who had to develop a new way of selling were embedded in 14 different sales offices around the US.

The culture of sales was based on intuition and gut feel, not on data and mathematical logic like the culture of operational excellence. However, many people inside the quality movement could see that the scientific mindset ought to apply to sales and marketing. Paul Selden's "''Sales Process Engineering, A Personal Workshop''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sales Process Engineering, A Personal Workshop|last=Selden|first=Paul|publisher=ASQC Press|year=1997|isbn=0-87389-418-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a further attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the theory and tools of quality management to the sales function. The book applied [[Deming circle|Deming]]'s 14 Points and the tools of quality measurement (such as check sheets, run charts, histograms, etc.), in a sales context. While the book did a great job of explaining the management theory, like most of the other books up until this time, it suffered from a lack of real examples demonstrating how such measures had actually helped salespeople sell things.

Then In 2006, Michael Webb wrote ''Sales and Marketing the Six Sigma Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sales and Marketing the Six Sigma Way|last=Webb|first=Michael|publisher=Kaplan|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4195-2150-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more than 20 years of field sales, management and B2B sales training experience, Webb was the first to explain how the scientific, measurement orientation of process excellence could help salespeople sell.

He pointed out that the purpose of sales is to get customers to take actions, and this is fundamentally different than the purpose of manufacturing. Salespeople have always known they must earn the customer's attention, their time, and their trust if they ever are to get a chance to earn any of their money. Webb pointed out the customer's actions determined whether value or waste had been created. He included case examples of B2B companies whose management used data to make changes that improved conversions by 100% or more. It proved (both to the quality community and to the sales community) that the data-oriented tools of science could help customers buy and salespeople sell. It demonstrated a valuable alternative to management's usual approach of just repeating the "Usual Fixes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sales and Marketing the Six Sigma Way|last=Webb|first=Michael|publisher=Kaplan|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4195-2150-8|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as sales training or CRM, which typically have little measurable or sustainable effect on productivity. The book earned 4.5 stars on Amazon and sold more than 21k copies.

Brent Wahba, an engineer with a background in Lean at GM and Delphi Automotive, also saw that root cause thinking had not yet penetrated the culture of sales and marketing management. His book "The Fluff Cycle,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fluff Cycle (And How to End It By Solving Real Sales and Marketing Problems)|last=Wahba|first=Brent|publisher=Strategy Science, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=1470020742|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized business writers in sales and marketing. He observed that traditional "best practices" approach as well as the insights of sales consultants usually do not work for very long. His point was that this is ''precisely because'' they are transplanted from outside the company, rather than being the result of people inside the company improving their thinking about the problems they face.

Wahba's point was not a new one, however. In his book ''High-Impact Consulting'', Robert Shaffer made a resounding statement about all kinds of consulting - not just sales and marketing: "No matter how wise and creative the consultant's analysis and recommendations, they pay off only to the extent that the client does what is necessary to benefit from them. The result is that many consulting projects fail to contribute nearly as much as they might because of the implementation gap, and a great many produce virtually no lasting benefit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Impact Consulting - How Clients and Consultants Can Work Together to Achieve Extraordinary Results|last=Schaffer|first=Robert|publisher=Jossey- Bass|year=2002|isbn=0-7879-6049-7|location=|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Edwards Deming said "[http://thinkexist.com/quotation/it_does_not_happen_all_at_once-there_is_no/332241.html It does not happen all at once. There is no instant pudding]."

Scientific methods enable individuals to solve problems. When an engineer succeeds with a difficult problem, he or she can become a hero to his company. It may not really matter if no one else understands how they did it. However, companies require many different people to collaborate if sales and marketing problems are to be solved. And people cannot collaborate without learning and sharing an explicit approach for identifying evidence, generating theories, and experimenting.

Most executives are not taught to pay attention to how their employees think and solve problems. Instead, as described by Brian Joiner in his book ''Fourth Generation Management'', they tend to either dictate the activities they want their people to follow (called "2nd generation" management), or (when that fails) hand down objectives without regard for how they will be achieved (called "3rd generation" management).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fourth Generation Management - The New Business Consciousness|last=Joiner|first=Brian|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1994|isbn=0-07-032715-7|location=|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales productivity has been declining due to changes in their customer's behaviors. For example, [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwkE1NAwJGQBQXhSZ1NrNU40UjQ/edit Google and the CEB] recently reported that B2B companies are avoiding salespeople until as much as 60 to 70% of their company's decision-making process is complete. Companies who study sales and marketing, such as Forrester, commonly admit that chief sales officers are expecting difficulty securing revenue targets. [https://www.calliduscloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2014-Sales-Compensation-and-Performance-Management-KeyTrends-Analysis-CallidusCloud.pdf CSO Insights reported] that the average sales forecast has a lower probability of winning than a pass bet at the craps tables in Las Vegas. Perhaps it is no wonder the turnover rates of salespeople are often 40% or more.

In this environment, some companies are looking for alternatives. Robert Pryor points out in his book, ''Lean Selling,'' that  "Lean is a methodology that revolutionizes the processes for producing products and for delivering services, and the Lean Thinking that captures its principles are the most disruptive and transformational management ideas since the Industrial Revolution that began over 100 years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lean Selling, Slash Your Sales Cycle and Drive Profitable, Predictable Revenue Growth by Giving Buyers What They Really Want|last=Pryor|first=Robert|publisher=Author-House|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4969-5554-8|location=|pages=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such advanced management thinking is demonstrating that the principles underlying operational excellence are crucially important to CEOs. That's because the vocabulary and the concepts of operational excellence provides CEOs with the framework to engage their people to improve their thinking. For example, recognizing that results in business are caused by people's behaviors, [[The Shingo Prize for excellence in manufacturing]] focuses on the beliefs which cause people's behaviors. The Shingo Model does not begin by teaching people the tools used in process excellence, as has been the norm for 50 years in all forms of process improvement. Instead, it starts by helping people to understand the underlying principles that explain WHY those tools work. For example, "Seek Perfection" is a principle that capitalizes on the natural human desire to want their life to be better. "Embrace Scientific Thinking" is a principle that demonstrates how we all naturally learn. With principles as the foundation, when people find themselves in an area where the tools that were invented for manufacturing don't easily apply (like sales and marketing), they can use those principles to develop tools that are appropriate to solving the problems at hand.

Such an approach does not assume (as most sales training and CRM companies assume) that a process is something handed down to a sales team from outside the company or from someone higher in the organization. Instead, it recognizes that the process must be originated by the people responsible for doing the work. It is ''their best understanding'' of how to achieve the objectives the company desires. 

This presents unique challenges to managers, and opportunities for businesses. The Internet has revolutionized how companies buy and sell. It is time for sales and marketing management to revolutionize itself through application of rational principles. This is what sales process engineering is about.

Examples of this are found in Michael Webb's 2014 book on the topic, [http://www.salesprocessexcellence.com ''Sales Process Excellence''].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sales Process Excellence - Increase Customer Value, Accelerate Your Sales Funnel, Grow Your Business|last=Webb|first=Michael|publisher=SPC, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-9771072-2-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This privately published work presents more than 40 industry examples from Webb's client case files illustrating in detail why sales and marketing needs operational excellence, and how operational excellence changes and improves sales and marketing management.

==Future directions==
"[http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/competing-through-data-three-experts-offer-their-game-plans Most breakthroughs in performance� are preceded by revolutions in measurement.]" Such revolutions will be enabled by two fundamentally different trends.

The first trend is for businesses to be more deliberately rational in their use of language to define the evidence their marketers and sellers are seeing. No longer can business leaders afford to allow their people to throw around terms such as "customer" or "qualified prospect" without operationally defining them.

Then, as the clarity and consistency of what these terms refer to in reality, the second trend will become incredibly powerful. That trend is the ability to "instrument" the interactions between salespeople and their customers in order to provide visibility to where the problems in the sales and buying processes are located.

For example, today's software products are enabling sales teams to track their activities and the customer's responses at a much higher level of granularity than has ever been possible before. This kind of feedback, if used effectively by sales managers, has a powerful ability to elevate and sustain a sales team's performance. Examples of this can be found at www.amacus.com and www.hubspot.com.

==Sales process==
Generally speaking, a process is set of activities, through which work flows, aimed at a common result. Processes define the best known way of doing the work or of accomplishing a goal. Processes are used to create products or to deliver services to customers.

Sales processes are simply a special kind of service. They differ from other service processes in one primary respect. The value created by a sales process is determined by whether or not the recipient of the service takes the action you want them to take. For example, a landing page on a website could be considered a kind of sales process. The headline, body copy, testimonials, and call to action create value to the extent they get visitors to the page to provide the requested information (usually their name and email address, etc.). Likewise a proposal presentation from a sales person creates value to the extent the recipients accept the proposal and buy what is offered.

==Rationale==
{{Original research section|date=April 2016}}

Reasons for having a well-thought-out sales process include seller and buyer risk management, standardized customer interaction during sales, and scalable revenue generation.  Approaching the subject from a "process" point of view offers an opportunity to use design and improvement tools from other disciplines and process-oriented industries.&lt;ref name="McNeese"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical Methods For The Process Industries |author = William H. McNeese and Robert A. Klein|publisher=ASQC Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1991|isbn=0-8247-8524-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Juran]] observed that "there should be no reason our familiar principles of quality and process engineering would not work in the sales process".&lt;ref name="Selden 1997b"&gt;{{cite book|author = Selden|year=1997|page =xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, while this is true, he failed to also recognize the unique challenge presented by the selling environment{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}, which has made it much less receptive to process thinking{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. For example, In ''Management of a Sales Force'' (12th Ed. p.&amp;nbsp;66) by Rich, Spiro and Stanton a "sales process" is presented as consisting of eight steps. These are:
* Prospecting / initial contact
* Preapproach - planning the sale
* Identifying and cross questioning
* Need assessment
* Presentation
* Meeting objections
* Gaining commitment
* Follow-up

Such a depiction of the sales process is from the seller's point of view only. This is a huge problem{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}, because customers will not follow a process that does not create value for them{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This lack of customer value presents a special dilemma for salespeople{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. That's because when managers assume processes are to be followed without regard to the value they create for customers, the processes become increasingly difficult to follow{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Due to human nature, this arrangement generally guarantees a decay in performance over time{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}.

The more productive arrangement{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} is to provide workers with an objective, along with a process for achieving it, and then to ask them if they can improve the process so as to exceed the objective, or achieve it more easily. This engages the minds of the participants{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} in a self-interested manner that serves workers, managers, and customers alike.

Once salespeople are challenged, as a team, to find better ways to sell, process language is the indispensable means of enabling them to measure cause and effect, identify steps that are problematic, and develop creative ways of improving. They allow the prediction of numbers of sales based on customer actions{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}.

'''Slow science''' is part of the broader [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]]. It is based on the belief that [[science]] should be a slow, steady, methodical process, and that scientists should not be expected to provide "quick fixes" to society's problems. Slow science supports [[curiosity]]-driven [[Scholarly method|scientific research]] and opposes [[Performance measurement|performance targets]].

'''Stellar evolution''' is the process by which a [[star]] changes over the course of time.

The table shows the lifetimes of stars as a function of their masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Carlos A. | last=Bertulani |authorlink=Carlos Bertulani | title=Nuclei in the Cosmos | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4417-66-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; All stars are born from [[Gravitational collapse|collapsing]] clouds of gas and dust, often called [[nebula]]e or [[molecular cloud]]s. Over the course of millions of years, these [[protostar]]s settle down into a state of equilibrium, becoming what is known as a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star.

[[Nuclear fusion]] powers a star for most of its life. Initially the energy is generated by the fusion of [[hydrogen atoms]] at the core of the main-sequence star. Later, as the preponderance of atoms at the core becomes [[helium]], stars like the [[Sun]] begin to fuse hydrogen along a spherical shell surrounding the core. This process causes the star to gradually grow in size, passing through the [[subgiant]] stage until it reaches the [[red giant]] phase. Stars with at least half the mass of the Sun can also begin to generate energy through the fusion of helium at their core, whereas more-massive stars can fuse heavier elements along a series of concentric shells. Once a star like the Sun has exhausted its nuclear fuel, its core collapses into a dense [[white dwarf]] and the outer layers are expelled as a [[planetary nebula]]. Stars with around ten or more times the mass of the Sun can explode in a [[supernova]] as their inert iron cores collapse into an extremely dense [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]]. Although the [[universe]] is not old enough for any of the smallest [[red dwarf]]s to have reached the end of their lives, [[stellar model]]s suggest they will slowly become brighter and hotter before running out of hydrogen fuel and becoming low-mass white dwarfs.&lt;ref name=endms&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laughlin | first1 = Gregory | last2 = Bodenheimer | first2 = Peter | last3 = Adams | first3 = Fred C. | date = 1997 | title = The End of the Main Sequence | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 482 | pages = 420–432 | doi = 10.1086/304125 | bibcode=1997ApJ...482..420L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stellar evolution is not studied by observing the life of a single star, as most stellar changes occur too slowly to be detected, even over many centuries. Instead, [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]] come to understand how stars evolve by observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, and by simulating [[stellar structure]] using [[computer model]]s.

{{Main|Star formation}}

===Protostar===
{{Main|Protostar}}
Stellar evolution starts with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a [[giant molecular cloud]]. Typical giant molecular clouds are roughly {{convert|100|ly|km}} across and contain up to {{convert|6000000|solar mass|kg|lk=on}}. As it collapses, a giant molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas releases [[Gravitational_potential|gravitational potential energy]] as heat. As its temperature and pressure increase, a fragment condenses into a rotating sphere of superhot gas known as a [[protostar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Prialnik|2000|loc=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protostar continues to grow by [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of gas and dust from the molecular cloud, becoming a [[pre-main-sequence star]] as it reaches its final mass. Further development is determined by its mass. Mass is typically compared to the mass of the [[Sun]]: {{convert|1.0|solar mass|kg|abbr=on}} means 1 solar mass.

[[Protostar]]s are encompassed in dust, and are thus more readily visible at [[infrared]] wavelengths.
Observations from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) have been especially important for unveiling numerous Galactic [[protostar]]s and their parent [[star cluster]]s.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/ |title=Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Mission |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ma2013&gt;Majaess, D.

===Brown dwarfs and sub-stellar objects===
{{main|Brown dwarf}}
Protostars with masses less than roughly {{convert|0.08|solar mass|kg|abbr=on}} never reach temperatures high enough for [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen to begin. These are known as [[brown dwarf]]s. The [[International Astronomical Union]] defines brown dwarfs as stars massive enough to [[deuterium burning|fuse deuterium]] at some point in their lives (13 [[Jupiter mass]]es ({{Jupiter mass|link=y}}), 2.5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, or {{Solar mass|0.0125}}). Objects smaller than {{Jupiter mass|13}} are classified as sub-brown dwarfs (but if they orbit around another stellar object they are classified as planets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets: Definition of a "Planet" |work=IAU position statement |date=2003-02-28 |url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |accessdate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204173630/http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |archivedate=February 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types, deuterium-burning and not, shine dimly and die away slowly, cooling gradually over hundreds of millions of years.

===Main sequence===
{{main|Main sequence}}
For a more-massive protostar, the core temperature will eventually reach 10 million [[kelvin]], initiating the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] and allowing [[hydrogen]] to fuse, first to [[deuterium]] and then to [[helium]]. In stars of slightly over {{convert|1|solar mass|kg|abbr=on}}, the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen fusion reaction ([[CNO cycle]]) contributes a large portion of the energy generation. The onset of nuclear fusion leads relatively quickly to a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] in which energy released by the core maintains a high gas pressure, balancing the weight of the star's matter and preventing further gravitational collapse. The star thus evolves rapidly to a stable state, beginning the [[main sequence|main-sequence]] phase of its evolution.

A new star will sit at a specific point on the main sequence of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], with the main-sequence [[spectral type]] depending upon the mass of the star. Small, relatively cold, low-mass [[red dwarf]]s fuse hydrogen slowly and will remain on the main sequence for hundreds of billions of years or longer, whereas massive, hot [[O-type main-sequence star|O-type stars]] will leave the main sequence after just a few million years. A mid-sized [[G-type main-sequence star|yellow dwarf]] star, like the Sun, will remain on the main sequence for about 10 billion years. The Sun is thought to be in the middle of its main sequence lifespan.

==Mature stars==
Eventually the core exhausts its supply of hydrogen and the star begins to evolve off of the [[main sequence]],  without the outward [[pressure]] generated by the fusion of hydrogen to counteract the force of [[gravity]] the core contracts until either [[electron degeneracy pressure]] becomes sufficient to oppose gravity or the core becomes hot enough (around 100 MK) for [[helium fusion]] to begin. Which of these happens first depends upon the star's mass.

===Low-mass stars===
What happens after a low-mass star ceases to produce energy through fusion has not been directly observed; the [[universe]] is around 13.8 billion years old, which is less time (by several orders of magnitude, in some cases) than it takes for fusion to cease in such stars.

Recent astrophysical models suggest that [[red dwarf]]s of {{Solar mass|0.1}} may stay on the main sequence for some six to twelve trillion years, gradually increasing in both [[temperature]] and [[luminosity]], and take several hundred billion more to collapse, slowly, into a [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;T 22"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Smallest Stars Stay Small| journal=Sky &amp; Telescope|date=November 1997| issue=22| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Astronomische Nachrichten| volume= 326| issue=10| pages= 913–919| date= 2005| title=M dwarfs: planet formation and long term evolution| first=F.

Instead, hydrogen fusion will proceed until almost the whole star is helium.

Slightly more [[massive star]]s do expand into [[red giant]]s, but their helium cores are not massive enough to reach the temperatures required for helium fusion so they never reach the tip of the red giant branch.  When hydrogen shell burning finishes, these stars move directly off the red giant branch like a post-[[Asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] (AGB) star, but at lower luminosity, to become a white dwarf.&lt;ref name="endms" /&gt;  A star with an initial mass above about {{Solar mass|0.8}} will be able to reach temperatures high enough to fuse helium, and these "mid-sized" stars go on to further stages of evolution beyond the red giant branch.&lt;ref name="lejeune"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lejeune|first1=T|last2=Schaerer|first2=D|year=2001|title=Database of Geneva stellar evolution tracks and isochrones for &lt;math&gt;(UBV)_\mathsf{J}(RI)_\mathsf{C} JHKLL'M&lt;/math&gt;, HST-WFPC2, Geneva and Washington photometric systems|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=366|issue=2|pages=538|bibcode=2001A&amp;A...366..538L|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20000214|arxiv=astro-ph/0011497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-sized stars===
[[File:Evolutionary track 1m.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|The evolutionary track of a solar mass, solar metallicity, star from main sequence to post-AGB]]
Stars of roughly {{Solar mass|0.8–10}} become [[red giant]]s, which are large non-[[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars of [[stellar classification]] K or M. Red giants lie along the right edge of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram due to their red color and large luminosity. Examples include [[Aldebaran]] in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Arcturus]] in the constellation of [[Boötes]].

Mid-sized stars are red giants during two different phases of their post-main-sequence evolution: red-giant-branch stars, with inert cores made of helium and hydrogen-burning shells, and asymptotic-giant-branch stars, with inert cores made of carbon and helium-burning shells inside the hydrogen-burning shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between these two phases, stars spend a period on the [[horizontal branch]] with a helium-fusing core.  Many of these helium-fusing stars cluster towards the cool end of the horizontal branch as K-type giants and are referred to as [[red clump]] giants.

====Subgiant phase====
{{main|Subgiant}}
When a star exhausts the hydrogen in its core, it leaves the main sequence and begins to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the core.  The core increases in mass as the shell produces more helium.  Depending on the mass of the helium core, this continues for several million to one or two billion years, with the star expanding and cooling at a similar or slightly lower luminosity to its main sequence state.  Eventually either the core becomes degenerate, in stars around the mass of the sun, or the outer layers cool sufficiently to become opaque, in more massive stars.  Either of these changes cause the hydrogen shell to increase in temperature and the luminosity of the star to increase, at which point the star expands onto the red giant branch.&lt;ref name="RyanNorton115"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryan|Norton|2010|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red-giant-branch phase====
{{main|Red giant branch}}
[[File:Stellar Evolution (0.8-8 M☉).jpg|thumb|400px|right|Typical stellar evolution for 0.8-8 M☉]]
The expanding outer layers of the star are [[convection|convective]], with the material being mixed by turbulence from near the fusing regions up to the surface of the star.  For all but the lowest-mass stars, the fused material has remained deep in the stellar interior prior to this point, so the convecting envelope makes fusion products visible at the star's surface for the first time. At this stage of evolution, the results are subtle, with the largest effects, alterations to the [[isotopes]] of hydrogen and helium, being unobservable. The effects of the [[CNO cycle]] appear at the surface during the first [[dredge-up]], with lower &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C ratios and altered proportions of carbon and nitrogen. These are detectable with [[spectroscopy]] and have been measured for many evolved stars.

The helium core continues to grow on the red giant branch.  It is no longer in thermal equilibrium, either degenerate or above the [[Schoenberg-Chandrasekhar limit]], so it increases in temperature which causes the rate of fusion in the hydrogen shell to increase.  The star increases in luminosity towards the [[tip of the red-giant branch]].  Red giant branch stars with a degenerate helium core all reach the tip with very similar core masses and very similar luminosities, although the more massive of the red giants become hot enough to ignite helium fusion before that point.

====Horizontal branch====
{{main|Horizontal branch|Red clump}}
In the helium cores of stars in the 0.8 to 2.0 solar mass range, which are largely supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]], helium fusion will ignite on a timescale of days in a [[helium flash]]. In the nondegenerate cores of more massive stars, the ignition of helium fusion occurs relatively slowly with no flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryan|Norton|2010|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuclear power released during the helium flash is very large, on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; times the luminosity of the Sun for a few days&lt;ref name="RyanNorton115" /&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; times the luminosity of the Sun (roughly the luminosity of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]) for a few seconds.&lt;ref name="Prialnik151"&gt;{{harvtxt|Prialnik|2000|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the energy is consumed by the thermal expansion of the initially degenerate core and thus cannot be seen from outside the star.&lt;ref name="RyanNorton115" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prialnik151" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deupree1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Deupree|first1=R. G.|title= A Reexamination of the Core Helium Flash|journal= The Astrophysical Journal|volume=471|issue= 1|date= 1996-11-01|pages= 377–384|doi= 10.1086/177976|bibcode= 1996ApJ...471..377D|citeseerx= 10.1.1.31.44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expansion of the core, the hydrogen fusion in the overlying layers slows and total energy generation decreases. The star contracts, although not all the way to the main sequence, and it migrates to the [[horizontal branch]] on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, gradually shrinking in radius and increasing its surface temperature.

Core helium flash stars evolve to the red end of the horizontal branch but do not migrate to higher temperatures before they gain a degenerate carbon-oxygen core and start helium shell burning.  These stars are often observed as a [[red clump]] of stars in the colour-magnitude diagram of a cluster, hotter and less luminous than the red giants. Higher-mass stars with larger helium cores move along the horizontal branch to higher temperatures, some becoming unstable pulsating stars in the yellow [[instability strip]] ([[RR Lyrae variables]]), whereas some become even hotter and can form a blue tail or blue hook to the horizontal branch. The morphology of the horizontal branch depends on parameters such as metallicity, age, and helium content, but the exact details are still being modelled.&lt;ref name=parameters&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gratton | first1 = R.

====Asymptotic-giant-branch phase====
{{main|Asymptotic giant branch}}
After a star has consumed the helium at the core, hydrogen and helium fusion continues in shells around a hot core of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]]. The star follows the [[asymptotic giant branch]] on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, paralleling the original red giant evolution, but with even faster energy generation (which lasts for a shorter time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sackmann | first1 = I. -J. | last2 = Boothroyd | first2 = A. I. | last3 = Kraemer | first3 = K. E. | title = Our Sun. III.

Helium from these hydrogen burning shells drops towards the center of the star and periodically the energy output from the helium shell increases dramatically.  This is known as a [[thermal pulse]] and they occur towards the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, sometimes even into the post-asymptotic-giant-branch phase. Depending on mass and composition, there may be several to hundreds of thermal pulses.

There is a phase on the ascent of the asymptotic-giant-branch where a deep convective zone forms and can bring carbon from the core to the surface.  This is known as the second dredge up, and in some stars there may even be a third dredge up.  In this way a [[carbon star]] is formed, very cool and strongly reddened stars showing strong carbon lines in their spectra.  A process known as hot bottom burning may convert carbon into oxygen and nitrogen before it can be dredged to the surface, and the interaction between these processes determines the observed luminosities and spectra of carbon stars in particular clusters.&lt;ref name=hbb&gt;{{cite journal|author1=van Loon|author2=Zijlstra|author3=Whitelock|author4=Peter te Lintel Hekkert|author5=Chapman|author6=Cecile Loup|author7=Groenewegen|author8=Waters|author9=Trams|title=Obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch stars in the Magellanic Clouds IV.

Another well known class of asymptotic-giant-branch stars are the [[Mira variables]], which pulsate with well-defined periods of tens to hundreds of days and large amplitudes up to about 10 magnitudes (in the visual, total luminosity changes by a much smaller amount). In more-massive stars the stars become more luminous and the pulsation period is longer, leading to enhanced mass loss, and the stars become heavily obscured at visual wavelengths.  These stars can be observed as [[OH/IR star]]s, pulsating in the infra-red and showing OH [[maser]] activity.  These stars are clearly oxygen rich, in contrast to the carbon stars, but both must be produced by dredge ups.

====Post-AGB====
{{main|Post-AGB}}
[[Image:NGC6543.jpg|thumb|The [[Cat's Eye Nebula]], a [[planetary nebula]] formed by the death of a star with about the same mass as the Sun]]
These mid-range stars ultimately reach the tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning. They are not sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion, so they contract again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star. The central star then cools to a white dwarf. The expelled gas is relatively rich in heavy elements created within the star and may be particularly [[oxygen]] or [[carbon]] enriched, depending on the type of the star. The gas builds up in an expanding shell called a [[circumstellar envelope]] and cools as it moves away from the star, allowing [[Circumstellar dust|dust particles]] and molecules to form. With the high infrared energy input from the central star, ideal conditions are formed in these circumstellar envelopes for [[Astrophysical maser|maser]] excitation.

It is possible for thermal pulses to be produced once post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution has begun, producing a variety of unusual and poorly understood stars known as born-again asymptotic-giant-branch stars.&lt;ref name=bornagain&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1991IAUS..145..363H|title=Atmospheres and Abundances of Blue Horizontal Branch Stars and Related Objects|journal=Evolution of Stars: the Photospheric Abundance Connection: Proceedings of the 145th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union|volume=145|pages=363|author1=Heber|first1=U.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may result in extreme [[horizontal-branch]] stars ([[subdwarf B star]]s), hydrogen deficient post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, variable planetary nebula central stars, and [[R Coronae Borealis variable]]s.

===Massive stars===
{{main|Supergiant}}
[[Image:VLTI reconstructed view of the surface of Antares.jpg|thumb|300px|Reconstructed image of [[Antares]], a red supergiant]]
In massive stars, the core is already large enough at the onset of the hydrogen burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron degeneracy pressure has a chance to become prevalent. Thus, when these stars expand and cool, they do not brighten as much as lower-mass stars; however, they were much brighter than lower-mass stars to begin with, and are thus still brighter than the red giants formed from less-massive stars. These stars are unlikely to survive as red [[supergiant]]s; instead they will destroy themselves as [[type II supernova]]s.

Extremely massive stars (more than approximately {{Solar mass|40}}), which are very luminous and thus have very rapid stellar winds, lose mass so rapidly due to radiation pressure that they tend to strip off their own envelopes before they can expand to become red supergiants, and thus retain extremely high surface temperatures (and blue-white color) from their main-sequence time onwards. The largest stars of the current generation are about {{Solar mass|100-150}} because the outer layers would be expelled by the extreme radiation. Although lower-mass stars normally do not burn off their outer layers so rapidly, they can likewise avoid becoming red giants or red supergiants if they are in binary systems close enough so that the companion star strips off the envelope as it expands, or if they rotate rapidly enough so that convection extends all the way from the core to the surface, resulting in the absence of a separate core and envelope due to thorough mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D. Vanbeveren | title=Massive stars | journal=The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review | date=1998 | volume=9 | issue=1–2 | pages=63–152 | doi=10.1007/s001590050015 | last2=De Loore | first2=C. | last3=Van Rensbergen | first3=W. | bibcode = 1998A&amp;ARv...9...63V | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core grows hotter and denser as it gains material from fusion of hydrogen at the base of the envelope. In all massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to halt collapse by itself, so as each major element is consumed in the center, progressively heavier elements ignite, temporarily halting collapse. If the core of the star is not too massive (less than approximately {{Solar mass|1.4}}, taking into account mass loss that has occurred by this time), it may then form a white dwarf (possibly surrounded by a planetary nebula) as described above for less-massive stars, with the difference that the white dwarf is composed chiefly of oxygen, [[neon]], and [[magnesium]].

[[Image:Evolved star fusion shells.svg|right|320px|thumb|The onion-like layers of a massive, evolved star just before core collapse. (Not to scale.)]]

Above a certain mass (estimated at approximately {{Solar mass|2.5}} and whose star's progenitor was around {{Solar mass|10}}), the core will reach the temperature (approximately 1.1 gigakelvins) at which neon [[Neon-burning process|partially breaks down]] to form oxygen and helium, the latter of which immediately fuses with some of the remaining neon to form magnesium; then [[Oxygen-burning process|oxygen fuses]] to form [[sulfur]], [[silicon]], and smaller amounts of other elements. Finally, the temperature gets high enough that any nucleus can be [[Photodisintegration|partially broken down]], most commonly releasing an alpha particle (helium nucleus) which [[Alpha process|immediately fuses with another nucleus]], so that several nuclei are effectively rearranged into a smaller number of heavier nuclei, with net release of energy because the addition of fragments to nuclei exceeds the energy required to break them off the parent nuclei.

A star with a core mass too great to form a white dwarf but insufficient to achieve sustained conversion of neon to oxygen and magnesium, will undergo core collapse (due to [[electron capture]]) before achieving fusion of the heavier elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ken'ichi Nomoto | title=Evolution of 8–10 {{Solar mass}} stars toward electron capture supernovae.

====Supernova====

Once the [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] process arrives at [[iron-56]], the continuation of this process consumes energy (the addition of fragments to nuclei releases less energy than required to break them off the parent nuclei). If the mass of the core exceeds the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], [[electron degeneracy pressure]] will be unable to support its weight against the force of gravity, and the core will undergo sudden, catastrophic collapse to form a [[neutron star]] or (in the case of cores that exceed the [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]]), a [[black hole]]. Through a process that is not completely understood, some of the [[gravitational potential energy]] released by this core collapse is converted into a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II [[supernova]]. It is known that the core collapse produces a massive surge of [[neutrino]]s, as observed with supernova [[SN 1987A]]. The extremely energetic [[neutrinos]] fragment some nuclei; some of their energy is consumed in releasing [[nucleons]], including [[neutrons]], and some of their energy is transformed into heat and [[kinetic energy]], thus augmenting the [[shock wave]] started by rebound of some of the infalling material from the collapse of the core. Electron capture in very dense parts of the infalling matter may produce additional neutrons. Because some of the rebounding matter is bombarded by the neutrons, some of its nuclei capture them, creating a spectrum of heavier-than-iron material including the radioactive elements up to (and likely beyond) [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2001/highlight0102_e.html How do Massive Stars Explode?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030627124651/http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2001/highlight0102_e.html |date=2003-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although non-exploding red giants can produce significant quantities of elements heavier than iron using neutrons released in side reactions of earlier [[nuclear reactions]], the abundance of elements heavier than [[iron]] (and in particular, of certain isotopes of elements that have multiple stable or long-lived isotopes) produced in such reactions is quite different from that produced in a supernova. Neither abundance alone matches that found in the [[Solar System]], so both supernovae and ejection of elements from red giants are required to explain the observed abundance of heavy elements and [[isotopes]] thereof.

The energy transferred from collapse of the core to rebounding material not only generates heavy elements, but provides for their acceleration well beyond [[escape velocity]], thus causing a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II supernova. Note that current understanding of this energy transfer is still not satisfactory; although current computer models of Type Ib, Type Ic, and Type II supernovae account for part of the energy transfer, they are not able to account for enough energy transfer to produce the observed ejection of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2003/highlight0306_e.html|title=Supernova Simulations Still Defy Explosions|date=June 2003|author=Robert Buras|display-authors=etal|publisher=Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik|work=Research Highlights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803015427/http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/HIGHLIGHT/2003/highlight0306_e.html|archivedate=2003-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neutrino oscillations may play an important role in the energy transfer problem as they not only affect the energy available in a particular flavour of neutrinos but also through other general-relativistic effects on neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/B:GERG.0000038633.96716.04|title=Addendum to: Gen.

Some evidence gained from analysis of the mass and orbital parameters of binary neutron stars (which require two such supernovae) hints that the collapse of an oxygen-neon-magnesium core may produce a supernova that differs observably (in ways other than size) from a supernova produced by the collapse of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=E.

The most massive stars that exist today may be completely destroyed by a supernova with an energy greatly exceeding its [[gravitational binding energy]]. This rare event, caused by [[pair-instability supernova|pair-instability]], leaves behind no black hole remnant.&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;[http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~hammer/lager/pair.pdf Pair Instability Supernovae and Hypernovae.], Nicolay J. Hammer, (2003), accessed May 7, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608135141/http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~hammer/lager/pair.pdf |date=June 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past history of the universe, some stars were even larger than the largest that exists today, and they would immediately collapse into a black hole at the end of their lives, due to [[photodisintegration]].

==Stellar remnants==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Planet]] --&gt;
After a star has burned out its fuel supply, its remnants can take one of three forms, depending on the mass during its lifetime.

===White and black dwarfs===
{{Main|White dwarf|Black dwarf}}
For a star of {{Solar mass|1}}, the resulting white dwarf is of about {{Solar mass|0.6}}, compressed into approximately the volume of the Earth. White dwarfs are stable because the inward pull of gravity is balanced by the [[degeneracy pressure]] of the star's electrons, a consequence of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Electron degeneracy pressure provides a rather soft limit against further compression; therefore, for a given chemical composition, white dwarfs of higher mass have a smaller volume. With no fuel left to burn, the star radiates its remaining heat into space for billions of years.

A white dwarf is very hot when it first forms, more than 100,000 K at the surface and even hotter in its interior. It is so hot that a lot of its energy is lost in the form of neutrinos for the first 10 million years of its existence, but will have lost most of its energy after a billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/tastgal_05.html Fossil Stars (1): White Dwarfs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical composition of the white dwarf depends upon its mass. A star of a few solar masses will ignite [[Carbon burning process|carbon fusion]] to form magnesium, neon, and smaller amounts of other elements, resulting in a white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that it can lose enough mass to get below the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] (see below), and provided that the ignition of carbon is not so violent as to blow the star apart in a supernova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ken'ichi Nomoto | title=Evolution of 8–10 {{Solar mass}} stars toward electron capture supernovae. I – Formation of electron-degenerate O + Ne + Mg cores | volume=277 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1984 | series=Part 1 | pages=791–805 | bibcode=1984ApJ...277..791N | doi=10.1086/161749 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A star of mass on the order of magnitude of the Sun will be unable to ignite carbon fusion, and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of carbon and oxygen, and of mass too low to collapse unless matter is added to it later (see below). A star of less than about half the mass of the Sun will be unable to ignite helium fusion (as noted earlier), and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of helium.

In the end, all that remains is a cold dark mass sometimes called a [[black dwarf]]. However, the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to exist yet.

If the white dwarf's mass increases above the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], which is {{Solar mass|1.4}} for a white dwarf composed chiefly of carbon, oxygen, neon, and/or magnesium, then electron degeneracy pressure fails due to [[electron capture]] and the star collapses. Depending upon the chemical composition and pre-collapse temperature in the center, this will lead either to collapse into a [[neutron star]] or runaway ignition of carbon and oxygen. Heavier elements favor continued core collapse, because they require a higher temperature to ignite, because electron capture onto these elements and their fusion products is easier; higher core temperatures favor runaway nuclear reaction, which halts core collapse and leads to a [[Type Ia supernova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ken'ichi Nomoto | author2=Yoji Kondo | last-author-amp=yes | title=Conditions for accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs | series=367 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1991 | volume=Part 2 | pages=L19–L22 | bibcode=1991ApJ...367L..19N | doi=10.1086/185922 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; These supernovae may be many times brighter than the Type II supernova marking the death of a massive star, even though the latter has the greater total energy release. This instability to collapse means that no white dwarf more massive than approximately {{Solar mass|1.4}} can exist (with a possible minor exception for very rapidly spinning white dwarfs, whose [[centrifugal force]] due to rotation partially counteracts the weight of their matter). Mass transfer in a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] may cause an initially stable white dwarf to surpass the Chandrasekhar limit.

If a white dwarf forms a close binary system with another star, hydrogen from the larger companion may accrete around and onto a white dwarf until it gets hot enough to fuse in a runaway reaction at its surface, although the white dwarf remains below the Chandrasekhar limit. Such an explosion is termed a [[nova]].

===Neutron stars===
{{Main|Neutron star}}
[[Image:CygnusLoopSmall.jpg|thumb|right|Bubble-like shock wave still expanding from a supernova explosion 15,000 years ago.]]
Ordinarily, atoms are mostly electron clouds by volume, with very compact nuclei at the center (proportionally, if atoms were the size of a football stadium, their nuclei would be the size of dust mites). When a stellar core collapses, the pressure causes electrons and protons to fuse by [[electron capture]]. Without electrons, which keep nuclei apart, the neutrons collapse into a dense ball (in some ways like a giant atomic nucleus), with a thin overlying layer of [[degenerate matter]] (chiefly iron unless matter of different composition is added later). The neutrons resist further compression by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in a way analogous to electron degeneracy pressure, but stronger.

These stars, known as neutron stars, are extremely small—on the order of radius 10&amp;nbsp;km, no bigger than the size of a large city—and are phenomenally dense. Their period of rotation shortens dramatically as the stars shrink (due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]); observed rotational periods of neutron stars range from about 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per second) to several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D'Amico, N. | author2=Stappers, B. W. | author3=Bailes, M. | author4=Martin, C. E. | author5=Bell, J. F. | author6=Lyne, A. G. | author7=Manchester, R. N. | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | date=1998 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01397.x | volume=297 | pages=28–40|bibcode = 1998MNRAS.297...28D | title=The Parkes Southern Pulsar Survey - III. Timing of long-period pulsars | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation each revolution. Such neutron stars are called [[pulsar]]s, and were the first neutron stars to be discovered. Though electromagnetic radiation detected from pulsars is most often in the form of radio waves, pulsars have also been detected at visible, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Courtland, Rachel |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14968-first-pulsar-identified-by-its-gamma-rays-alone.html |title=Pulsar Detected by Gamma Waves Only |work=New Scientist |date=17 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402053638/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn14968-first-pulsar-identified-by-its-gamma-rays-alone.html |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black holes===
{{Main|Black hole}}
If the mass of the stellar remnant is high enough, the neutron degeneracy pressure will be insufficient to prevent collapse below the [[Schwarzschild radius]]. The stellar remnant thus becomes a black hole. The mass at which this occurs is not known with certainty, but is currently estimated at between 2 and {{Solar mass|3}}.

Black holes are predicted by the theory of [[general relativity]]. According to classical general relativity, no matter or information can flow from the interior of a black hole to an outside observer, although [[quantum mechanics|quantum effect]]s may allow deviations from this strict rule. The existence of black holes in the universe is well supported, both theoretically and by astronomical observation.

Because the core-collapse mechanism of a supernova is, at present, only partially understood, it is still not known whether it is possible for a star to collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova, or whether some supernovae initially form unstable neutron stars which then collapse into black holes; the exact relation between the initial mass of the star and the final remnant is also not completely certain. Resolution of these uncertainties requires the analysis of more supernovae and supernova remnants.

==Models==
&lt;!-- Note: Stellar evolutionary model links here --&gt;
A stellar evolutionary model is a [[mathematical model]] that can be used to compute the evolutionary phases of a star from its formation until it becomes a remnant. The mass and chemical composition of the star are used as the inputs, and the luminosity and surface temperature are the only constraints. The model formulae are based upon the physical understanding of the star, usually under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Extensive computer calculations are then run to determine the changing state of the star over time, yielding a table of data that can be used to determine the [[evolutionary track]] of the star across the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], along with other evolving properties.&lt;ref name=aass316_1_31&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Demarque | first1=P. | last2=Guenther | first2=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">The '''teach-back method''', also called the '''"show-me" method''', is a communication confirmation method used by healthcare providers to confirm whether a patient (or care takers) understands what is being explained to them. If a patient understands, they are able to "teach-back" the information accurately. This is a communication method intended to improve [[health literacy]].

There can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is.&lt;ref name="In Focus"&gt;Teach Back: A tool for improving provider-patient communication. The Ethics Center. 2006. Retrieved from http://www.ethics.va.gov/docs/infocus/InFocus_20060401_Teach_Back.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can be due to various reasons such as a patient not understanding medical terminology, not feeling comfortable asking questions or even cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Not only does the teach-back method help providers understand the patient's needs in understanding their care, it also allows providers to evaluate their communication skills.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Case studies led by the [[National Quality Forum]] on the informed consent processes of various hospitals found that those that effectively used the teach-back method benefited in areas of quality, patient safety, risk management and cost/efficiency.&lt;ref name="NQF"&gt;Implementing a National Voluntary Consensus Standard for Informed Consent: A User's Guide for Healthcare Professionals. National Quality Forum. 2005. Retrieved from http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2005/09/Implementing_a_National_Voluntary_Consensus_Standard_for_Informed_Consent__A_User’s_Guide_for_Healthcare_Professionals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==
The [[National Quality Forum]] describes the practice as follows:&lt;ref name="NQF"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Who''' should use the method→ Any healthcare providers. E.g. physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals&lt;br /&gt;
'''What''' should patients teach-back→Information about their diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, risks and benefit of treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
'''When''' to ask for teach-back→ Early in the care process&lt;br /&gt;
'''Why''' is it important→Many patients have difficulty understanding medical information.&lt;br /&gt;
'''How'''→When asked to teach-back, patients should be able to clearly describe or explain the information provided to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the patient's successful or unsuccessful teach-back, the provider will clarify or modify the information and reassess the teach-back to confirm the patient's comprehension and understanding.&lt;ref name="Heiges"&gt;The Teach Back Method. SurroundHealth. 2012. Retrieved from www.surroundhealth.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge retention ==
The cycle of reassessing and teaching back to confirm comprehension has been found to improve knowledge retention and lower readmission rates in heart failure patients.&lt;ref name="White, Garbez, Carroll, Brinker &amp; Howie-Esquivel"&gt;Is "teach back" associated with knowledge retention and [[Hospital Readmission|hospital readmission]] in hospitalized heart failure patients? The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. 2013 Mar-Apr;28(2):137-46. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0b013e31824987bd&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond healthcare literacy, the teach-back method can be utilized in academic and professional settings as well. Teachers often create [[feedback loops]]  in which the instructor asks the student to share what they heard, and promote peer to peer coaching  where students explain what they just learned to other students. Retention is also most positively impacted in [[participatory learning]] environments, when students participate in group discussions, practice by doing, and teaching others.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Teaching Methods and Retention. 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14173">The '''temporal dynamics of music and language''' describes how the brain coordinates its different regions to process musical and vocal sounds. Both music and language feature rhythmic and melodic structure. Both employ a finite set of basic elements (such as tones or words) that are combined in ordered ways to create complete musical or lingual ideas.

==Neuroanotomy of language and music==

Key areas of the brain are used in both music processing and language processing, such as [[Brocas area]] that is devoted to language production and comprehension. Patients with lesions, or damage, in the Brocas area often exhibit poor grammar, slow speech production and poor sentence comprehension. The [[inferior frontal gyrus]], is a [[gyrus]] of the [[frontal lobe]] that is involved in timing events and reading comprehension, particularly for the comprehension of [[verb]]s. The [[Wernickes area]] is located on the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] and is important for understanding [[vocabulary]] and written language.

The [[primary auditory cortex]] is located on the [[temporal lobe]] of the [[cerebral cortex]]. This region is important in music processing and plays an important role in determining the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and volume of a sound.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ghazanfar | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Nicolelis | first2 = M.

The [[frontal cortex]] has been found to be involved in processing melodies and harmonies of music. For example, when a patient is asked to tap out a beat or try to reproduce a tone, this region is very active on [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Theunissen | first1 = F | last2 = David | first2 = SV | last3 = Singh | first3 = NC | last4 = Hsu | first4 = A | last5 = Vinje | first5 = WE | last6 = Gallant | first6 = JL | year = 2001 | title = Estimating spatio-temporal receptive fields of auditory and visual neurons from their responses to natural stimuli | url = | journal = Network: Computation in Neural Systems | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 289–316 | pmid = 11563531 | doi= 10.1080/net.12.3.289.316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cerebellum]] is the "mini" brain at the rear of the skull. Similar to the frontal cortex, brain imaging studies suggest that the cerebellum is involved in processing melodies and determining [[tempo]]s. The [[medial prefrontal cortex]] along with the primary auditory cortex has also been implicated in tonality, or determining pitch and volume.&lt;ref name="aa" /&gt;

In addition to the specific regions mentioned above many "information switch points" are active in language and music processing. These regions are believed to act as transmission routes that conduct information. These neural impulses allow the above regions to communicate and process information correctly. These structures include the [[thalamus]] and the [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

Some of the above-mentioned areas have been shown to be active in both music and language processing through PET and fMRI studies. These areas include the primary motor cortex, the Brocas area, the cerebellum, and the primary auditory cortices.&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

==Imaging the brain in action==

The imaging techniques best suited for studying temporal dynamics provide information in real time. The methods most utilized in this research are functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, and positron emission tomography known as PET scans.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baird | first1 = A. | last2 = Samson | first2 = S. V. | doi = 10.1007/s11065-009-9085-2 | title = Memory for Music in Alzheimer's Disease: Unforgettable? | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–101 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19214750| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positron emission tomography involves injecting a short-lived [[radioactive tracer]] [[isotope]] into the blood. When the radioisotope decays, it emits positrons which are detected by the machine sensor. The isotope is chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule, such as [[glucose]], which powers metabolic activity. Whenever brain activity occurs in a given area these molecules are recruited to the area. Once the concentration of the biologically active molecule, and its radioactive "dye", rises enough, the scanner can detect it.&lt;ref name="cc" /&gt; About one second elapses from when brain activity begins to when the activity is detected by the PET device. This is because it takes a certain amount of time for the dye to reach the needed concentrations can be detected.&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1852337982 | title = Positron Emission Tomography: Basic Sciences.

 [[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|left|alt=PET. |Example of a PET scan.]]
[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] or fMRI is a form of the traditional [[MRI]] imaging device that allows for brain activity to be observed in real time. An fMRI device works by detecting changes in neural blood flow that is associated with brain activity. fMRI devices use a strong, static magnetic field to align nuclei of atoms within the brain. An additional magnetic field, often called the [[gradient field]], is then applied to elevate the nuclei to a higher energy state.&lt;ref name="ee"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hauk | first1 = O | last2 = Wakeman | first2 = D | last3 = Henson | first3 = R | year = 2011 | title = Comparison of noise-normalized minimum norm estimates for MEG analysis using multiple resolution metrics | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 1966–74 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.053 | pmid = 20884360 | pmc=3018574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the gradient field is removed, the nuclei revert to their original state and emit energy. The emitted energy is detected by the fMRI machine and is used to form an image. When neurons become active blood flow to those regions increases. This oxygen-rich blood displaces oxygen depleted blood in these areas. [[Hemoglobin]] molecules in the oxygen-carrying red blood cells have different magnetic properties depending on whether it is oxygenated.&lt;ref name="ee" /&gt; By focusing the detection on the magnetic disturbances created by hemoglobin, the activity of neurons can be mapped in near real time.&lt;ref name="ee" /&gt; Few other techniques allow for researchers to study temporal dynamics in real time.

[[File:NIMH MEG.jpg|thumb|right|alt=MEG.|Patient gets a "MEG".]]

Another important tool for analyzing temporal dynamics is [[magnetoencephalography]], known as MEG. It is used to map brain activity by detecting and recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents generated by neural activity. The device uses a large array of superconducting quantum interface devices, called [[SQUID]]S, to detect magnetic activity. Because the magnetic fields generated by the human brain are so small the entire device must be placed in a specially designed room that is built to shield the device from external magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="ee" /&gt;

==Other research methods==

Another common method for studying brain activity when processing language and music is [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] or TMS. TMS uses induction to create weak electromagnetic currents within the brain by using a rapidly changing magnetic field. The changes depolarize or hyper-polarize neurons. This can produce or inhibit activity in different regions. The effect of the disruptions on function can be used to assess brain interconnections.&lt;ref name="gg"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Recent research==

Many aspects of language and musical melodies are processed by the same brain areas. In 2006, Brown, Martinez and Parsons found that listening to a melody or a sentence resulted in activation of many of the same areas including the [[primary motor cortex]], the [[supplementary motor area]], the Brocas area, anterior insula, the primary audio cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.&lt;ref name="hh"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = S. | last2 = Martinez | first2 = M.

A 2008 study by Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici found that language impairment may also affect the ability to process music. Children with specific language impairments, or SLIs were not as proficient at matching tones to one another or at keeping tempo with a simple [[metronome]] as children with no language disabilities. This highlights the fact that neurological disorders that effect language may also affect musical processing ability.&lt;ref name="ii"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jentschke | first1 = S. | last2 = Koelsch | first2 = S. | last3 = Sallat | first3 = S. | last4 = Friederici | first4 = A.

Walsh, Stewart, and Frith in 2001 investigated which regions processed melodies and language by asking subjects to create a melody on a simple keyboard or write a poem. They applied TMS to the location where musical and lingual data. The research found that TMS applied to the left frontal lobe had affected the ability to write or produce language material, while TMS applied to the auditory and Brocas area of the brain most inhibited the research subject’s ability to play musical melodies. This suggests that some differences exist between music and language creation.&lt;ref name="jj"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = L. | last2 = Walsh | first2 = V. | last3 = Frith | first3 = U.

==Developmental aspects==

The basic elements of musical and lingual processing appear to be present at birth. For example, a French 2011 study that monitored fetal heartbeats found that past the age of 28 weeks, fetuses respond to changes in musical pitch and tempo. Baseline heart rates were determined by 2 hours of monitoring before any stimulus. Descending and ascending frequencies at different tempos were played near the [[womb]]. The study also investigated fetal response to lingual patterns, such as playing a sound clip of different syllables, but found no response to different lingual stimulus. Heart rates increased in response to high pitch loud sounds compared to low pitched soft sounds. This suggests that the basic elements of sound processing, such as discerning pitch, tempo and loudness are present at birth, while later-developed processes discern speech patterns after birth.&lt;ref name="kk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granier-Deferre | first1 = C | last2 = Ribeiro | first2 = A | last3 = Jacquet | first3 = A | last4 = Bassereau | first4 = S | year = 2011 | title = Near-term fetuses process temporal features of speech | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 336–352 | pmid = 22213904 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00978.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study researched the development of lingual skills in children with speech difficulties. It found that musical stimulation improved the outcome of traditional [[speech therapy]]. Children aged 3.5 to 6 years old were separated into two groups. One group heard lyric-free music at each speech therapy session while the other group was given traditional speech therapy. The study found that both phonological capacity and the children’s ability to understand speech increased faster in the group that was exposed to regular musical stimulation.&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = W | last2 = Linden | first2 = U | last3 = Ostermann | first3 = T | year = 2010 | title = Effects of music therapy in the treatment of children with delayed speech development -results of a pilot study | url = | journal = BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 1| page = 39 | pmid = 20663139 | doi=10.1186/1472-6882-10-39 | pmc=2921108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17245">'''Topology optimization ''' ('''TO''') is a mathematical method that optimizes material layout within a given design space, for a given set of loads, [[boundary conditions]] and constraints with the goal of maximizing the performance of the system. TO is different from [[shape optimization]] and sizing optimization in the sense that the design can attain any shape within the design space, instead of dealing with predefined configurations. 

The conventional TO formulation uses a [[finite element method]] (FEM) to evaluate the design performance. The design is optimized using either gradient-based [[mathematical programming]] techniques such as the optimality criteria algorithm and the [[method of moving asymptotes]] or non gradient-based algorithms such as [[genetic algorithms]].

Topology Optimization has a wide range of applications in aerospace, mechanical, bio-chemical and civil engineering. Currently, engineers mostly use TO at the concept level of a design process. Due to the free forms that naturally occur, the result is often difficult to manufacture. For that reason the result emerging from TO is often fine-tuned for manufacturability. Adding constraints to the formulation in order to [[design for manufacturability|increase the manufacturability]] is an active field of research. In some cases results from TO can be directly manufactured using [[additive manufacturing]]; TO is thus a key part of [[design for additive manufacturing]].

== Problem statement ==

A topology optimization problem can be written in the general form of an [[optimization problem]] as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\underset{x}{\operatorname{minimize}} &amp; &amp;F = F(\mathbf{u(\rho), \rho}) =  \int_{\Omega}  f(\mathbf{u(\rho), \rho}) \mathrm{d}V \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to} 
&amp; &amp;G_0(\rho) = \int_{\Omega} \rho \mathrm{d}V - V_0 \leq 0 \\
&amp;&amp;&amp;G_j(\mathbf{u}(\rho), \rho) \leq 0 \text{ with } j = 1, ..., m
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The problem statement includes the following:

* An [[objective function]] &lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{u(\rho), \rho})&lt;/math&gt;. This function represents the quantity that is being minimized for best performance. The most common objective function is compliance, where minimizing compliance leads to maximizing the stiffness of a structure.
* The material distribution as a problem variable. This is described by the density of the material at each location &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \rho(\mathbf{u}) &lt;/math&gt;. Material is either present, indicated by a 1, or absent, indicated by a 0.
* The design space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;. This indicates the allowable volume within which the design can exist.  Assembly and packaging requirements, human and tool accessibility are some of the factors that need to be considered in identifying this space . With the definition of the design space, regions or components in the model that cannot be modified during the course of the optimization are considered as non-design regions.
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m &lt;/math&gt; [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G_j(\mathbf{u}(\rho), \rho) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; a characteristic that the solution must satisfy. Examples are the maximum amount of material to be distributed (volume constraint) or maximum stress values.

Evaluating &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \mathbf{u(\rho)} &lt;/math&gt; often includes solving a differential equation. This is most commonly done using the [[finite element method]] since these equations do not have a known analytical solution.

== Implementation methodologies  ==
There are various implementation methodologies that have been used to solve TO problems.

=== Discrete ===
Solving TO problems in a discrete sense is done by discretizing the design domain into finite elements. The material densities inside these elements are then treated as the problem variables. In this case material density of one indicates the presence of material, while zero indicates an absence of material. Due to the attainable topological complexity of the design being dependent of the amount of elements, a large amount is preferred. Large amount of finite elements increase the attainable topological complexity, but come at a cost. Firstly, solving the FEM system becomes more expensive. Secondly, algorithms that can handle a large amount (several thousands of elements is not uncommon) of discrete variables with multiple constraints are unavailable. Moreover, they are impractically sensitive to parameter variations.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund, O., Maute, K., ''Topology optimization approaches A comparative review''. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 2013, p. 1031-1055&lt;/ref&gt; In literature problems with up to 30000 variables have been reported &lt;ref&gt;Beckers, M. [http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/reverson/uploads/MoodSwings/beckers.pdf Topology optimization using a dual method with discrete variables]. Structural Optimization, p. 14-24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solving the problem with continuous variables ===
The earlier stated complexities with solving TO problems using binary variables has caused the community to search for other options. One is the modelling of the densities with continuous variables. The material densities can now also attain values between zero and one. Gradient based algorithms that handle large amounts of continuous variables and multiple constraints are available. But the material properties have to be modelled in a continuous setting. This is done through interpolation. One of the most implemented interpolation methodologies is the SIMP method (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation &lt;ref&gt;Bendsøe, MP. ''Optimal shape design as a material distribution problem.''. Structural Optimization, 1989, p. 193-202&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="book"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NGmtmMhVe2sC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], a monograph of the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpolation is essentially a power law &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E \;=\; E_0 \,+\, \rho^p (E_1 - E_0) &lt;/math&gt;. It interpolates the Young's modulus of the material to the scalar selection field. The value of the penalisation parameter &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is generally taken between &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle [1,\, 3]&lt;/math&gt;.  This has been shown to confirm the micro-structure of the materials.&lt;ref name="Paper Inverse Homogenisation"&gt;[http://www.giref.ulaval.ca/~deteix/bois/documents_references/bendsoe1999.pdf], A reference that proved the validity of the interpolation scheme.&lt;/ref&gt; In the SIMP method a lower bound on the Young's modulus is added, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E_0 &lt;/math&gt;, to make sure the derivatives of the objective function are non-zero when the density becomes zero. The higher the penalisation factor, the more SIMP penalises the algorithm in the use of non-binary densities. Unfortunately, the penalisation parameter also introduces non-convexities  &lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, NP. Langelaar, M. van Keulen, F. ''[http://www1.dem.ist.utl.pt/engopt2010/Book_and_CD/Papers_CD_Final_Version/pdf/03/01270-01.pdf Critical study of design parameterization in topology optimization; The influence of design parameterization on local minima].''. 2nd International Conference on Engineering Optimization, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Commercial software ===
There are several commercial topology optimization software on the market. Most of them use topology optimization as a hint how the optimal design should look like, and manual geometry re-construction is required. There are a few solutions which produce optimal designs ready for Additive Manufacturing.

=== Structural compliance ===
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2018}}
A stiff structure is one that has the least possible displacement when given certain set of boundary conditions. A global measure of the displacements is the strain energy (also called compliance) of the structure under the prescribed boundary conditions. The lower the strain energy the higher the stiffness of the structure. So, the problem statement involves the objective functional of the strain energy which has to be minimized.

On a broad level, one can visualize that the more the material, the less the deflection as there will be more material to resist the loads. So, the optimization requires an opposing constraint, the volume constraint . This is in reality a cost factor, as we would not want to spend a lot of money on the material. To obtain the total material utilized, an integration of the selection field over the volume can be done.

Finally the elasticity governing differential equations are plugged in so as to get the final problem statement.
:&lt;math&gt;\min_{\rho}\; \int_{\Omega} \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{\sigma}:\mathbf{\varepsilon} \,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

subject to:
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \rho \,\in\, [0,\, 1] &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \int_{\Omega} \rho\, \mathrm{d}\Omega \;\leq\; V^*&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{\sigma} \,+\, \mathbf{F} \;=\; {\mathbf{0}} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{\sigma} \;=\; \mathsf{C}:\mathbf{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

But, a straightforward implementation in the Finite Element Framework of such a problem is still infeasible owing to issues such as:
# Mesh dependency—Mesh Dependency means that the design obtained on one mesh is not the one that will be obtained on another mesh. The features of the design become more intricate as the mesh gets refined.
# Numerical instabilities—The selection of region in the form of a chess board.

Some techniques such as Filtering based on Image Processing are currently being used to alleviate some of these issues.

==== Fluid-structure-interaction ====
[[Fluid–structure_interaction|Fluid-structure-interaction]] is a strongly coupled phenomenon and concerns the interaction between a stationary or moving fluid and an elastic structure. Many engineering applications and natural phenomena are subject to fluid-structure-interaction and to take such effects into consideration is therefore critical in the design of many engineering applications. Topology optimisation for fluid structure interaction problems has been studied in e.g. references &lt;ref&gt; Yoon GH (2010) Topology optimization for stationary fluid–structure interaction problems using a new monolithic formulation.

'''Trial advocacy''' is the branch of knowledge concerned with making attorneys and other advocates more effective in trial proceedings.  Trial advocacy is taught in primary, secondary, and undergraduate schools (usually associated with a [[mock trial]] elective).&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, John E. ''Law for Business and Personal Use'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught as an essential trade skill for litigators in [[law school]]s and in [[continuing legal education]] programs.

The skills of trial advocacy can be broken into two categories: skills that accomplish individual tasks ([[Tactic (method)|tactical skills]]) such as selecting jurors, delivering opening statements and closing arguments, and examining witnesses, and those skills that integrate the individual actions to achieve greater effects and to drive unfolding events toward the advocate’s desired outcome ([[litigation strategy|strategy]]) .&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S., ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[law school]] trial advocacy courses focus on tactical skills, though some integrate basic methods of strategic planning.  Some academics have expressed disfavor with advanced strategic techniques because of the imbalance they create, especially against attorneys who are unaware of them.  Proponents of advanced strategic techniques argue that these methods are the only effective means to counter the already-existing imbalances in the system, as between [[indigent]] defendants and the state, and between working-class [[plaintiff]]s and well-resourced, [[wealth]]y [[Conglomerate (company)|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacyteaching.blogspot.com/2013/01/trial-advocacy-professors-tell-me-that.html Selby-Dreier Debate on ''Advocacy Teaching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like most legal skills, trial advocacy evolved through the apprenticeship and practice of attorneys.  Even after 1900 (when the education of attorneys shifted to [[law schools]]&lt;ref&gt;Harno, Albert James (2004), ''Legal Education in the United States'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;) most law schools offered little education in advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kutcher, Edward A.; Lee, Robert B. (1962) ''The Deterioration of Trial Advocacy-Are the Laws Schools Responsible?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association (1967) ''The Law School Curriculum and Advocacy Training''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, in response to criticism within the judicial system that law schools were not properly preparing attorneys for trial practice, a group of lawyers and law professors combined to form the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] (NITA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/About#History NITA website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many law schools have added or improved their instruction in trial advocacy, and numerous [[Continuing Legal Education]] organizations have offered classes surveying the subject area, and on specific topics within the field.  Currently nearly one dozen law schools in the United States offer [[Master of Law]] (LL.M.) degrees in trial advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Eric, Princeton Review (2013) ''The Best 168 Law Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;
Trial advocacy originally focused on individual actions within the trial, proposing methods for improved selection of jurors, delivery of argument, and direct and cross examination.  However, in the 1970s, NITA advanced the concepts of theme and theory as methods of integrating the various components into a cohesive whole.&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven (2004) ''Modern Trial Advocacy''&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Litigation Strategy|litigation strategy]] has blossomed with the importation of concepts from economic [[game theory]], [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and the application of [[maneuver warfare]] as a means not only of integrating the various actions within the trial into a comprehensive case, but also as a means of gaining a decisive advantage over opposing counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in trial advocacy==
The topics commonly encompassed within Trial Advocacy are:

===Jury selection or ''voir dire''===
{{Main|Jury selection|Voir dire}}
The selection of jurors that will be receptive to the argument the attorney intends to make.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 529 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening statement===
{{Main|Opening statement}}
Presenting a non-argumentative overview of what the jury will see, often in the context of the attorney’s theme, theory and story.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 8 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct examination===
{{Main|Direct examination}}
Eliciting evidence from one’s own witnesses through non-[[leading question]]s.  Because studies have shown that people best remember the first and the most recent (last) information heard (methods referred to as [[Serial position effect|primacy and recency]]), the preferred method is to start with an engaging and favorable topic, move through more mundane matters, and to finish on a strong, favorable point.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 45 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross examination===
{{Main|Cross examination}}
Working with witnesses offered by the opposing party who may be [[hostile witness|hostile]] or uncooperative.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 83 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing argument===
{{Main|Closing argument}} 
Using [[argument]] to create within the jurors a perception of what they have seen and heard that influences them to find in favor of the attorney’s client.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 467 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The general principles that enable an advocate to make the jurors more receptive to his claims.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lubet, p. 16, 32 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock trial===
{{Main|Mock trial}}
In mock trial, students take responsibility for the [[prosecution]]/[[plaintiff]] or [[defense counsel|defense]] case in a trial presented using fabricated evidence, and role-players as witnesses and faculty or volunteers as judge or jury.  It evaluates the participants’ skills in argument, evidence handling, and examination of witnesses, but omits jury selection and strategic matters.  Mock trial differs from [[moot court]] in that moot court practices appellate argument, and so involves no handling of witnesses or evidence, but rather is an exercise in legal research and oral advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korzen, John (2010) ''Make Your Argument: Succeeding in Moot Court and Mock Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing a case into a clear and complete presentation.
* Case Diagrams: In which the attorney charts the elements he / she intends to prove (or attack) and the evidence that will support each. These ensures the case is comprehensively addressed.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Indiana Law School web site [http://www.law.indiana.edu/instruction/tanford/web/reference/basictactics.html], accessed March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theme and Theory: The theme is a sound bite that captures the emotional appeal of the case, and the theory is an explanation of events.  These serve as strategic focal points, allowing individual actions (opening, examination of each witness, etc.) to be united with a common focus, and in a way that clarifies and reinforces the perception of the case the attorney wants the jury or judge to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 411 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing the case to maximize the combined impact of every element, and to overwhelm or outmaneuver the opposing counsel while presenting a clear, decisive argument to the jury (or judge, in the case of bench trials).&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced strategic skills, based upon [[psychology]] and [[maneuver warfare|military maneuver philosophy]], are generally learned outside the classroom, as few law schools teach them.  In fact, [[academic]]s have criticized advanced strategic techniques for tipping [[verdict]]s through means unrelated to the [[merit (law)|merits of the case]].  For example, these techniques may be used to cause an advocate unfamiliar with them to take actions that unwittingly undermine his client’s interests.  There is particular concern regarding the use of advanced strategic techniques by [[prosecutor]]s, who already wield the substantial power of the State against often poorly resourced defendants.

The counterargument is that strategy can correct already-existing imbalances in the justice system, such as when inexperienced advocates must face highly experienced ones, when [[law firm|small firms]] oppose large ones, and when poor clients must litigate their rights against wealthy ones.  Under the current system, without a well-developed strategy, a small firm with a poor client stands almost no chance of success against a large firm with its greater resources, regardless of the merits of the case.
* [[Litigation strategy|Maneuver strategy]] An alternative to arguing the evidence or the law, maneuver strategies pursue solutions such as redirecting the focus of the trial, reshaping the way events are perceived, or disrupting or surprising the opposing counsel, rendering him ineffective at responding to unfolding events.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  While these methods are practiced widely, even by advocates not educated in strategy, some object to this as improper even when practiced ethically, as it subordinates the importance of the evidence and the law in determining a trial's outcome.  One proponent of maneuver strategy, however, has noted that regardless of whether the attorney intends to leverage the tools of maneuver strategy, the attorney must understand the methods or she will be ill-equipped to identify and counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, pp. 86–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestalt psychology]] This branch of psychology focuses on how things are perceived in whole as opposed to how individual components appear.  It aids in ensuring the jury (or judge, in bench trials) perceives events as the attorney desires, and it offers a means of shaping the way witnesses and opposing counsel will perceive the problems an attorney raises for them during trial.  When coupled with game theory, shaping perception allows an attorney to influence or shape the actions the hostile witness or counsel take.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 37–40, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Game theory]] Game theory offers models of how people make decisions.  In trial practice, game theory is useful in predicting the likely actions witnesses will take when presented with a decision.  Because decisions are framed according to how they perceive a situation, when game theory is coupled with Gestalt psychology, attorneys can present problems to witnesses or opposing counsel in a way that increases the likelihood of them making decisions about their responses that improve the attorney's strategic position.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 62–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Litigation strategy|Lines of effort]] In the way a case diagram matches evidence to elements, the line of effort matches actions to specific effects the attorney intends to the various results that achieve her or his goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 47–65&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vacuum airship''', also known as a '''vacuum balloon''', is a hypothetical [[airship]] that is [[Vacuum|evacuated]] rather than filled with a lighter-than-air gas such as hydrogen or helium. First proposed by Italian [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] in 1670,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Francesco Lana-Terzi, S.J. (1631–1687); The Father of Aeronautics | url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/lana.htm | accessdate = 13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vacuum balloon would be the ultimate expression of lifting power per volume displaced.

==History==
From 1886 to 1900 [[Arthur De Bausset]] attempted in vain to raise funds to construct his "vacuum-tube" airship design, but despite early support in the United States Congress, the general public was skeptical. Illinois historian Howard Scamehorn reported that [[Octave Chanute]] and [[Albert Francis Zahm]] "publicly denounced and mathematically proved the fallacy of the vacuum principle", however the author does not give his source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scamehorn|first=Howard Lee|title=Balloons to Jets: A Century of Aeronautics in Illinois, 1855–1955|year=2000|pages=13–14|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2336-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bausset published a book on his design&lt;ref name="De Bausset 1887"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = De Bausset | first1 = Arthur | title = Aerial Navigation | publisher = Fergus Printing Co. | year = 1887 | location = Chicago | url = https://archive.org/details/aerialnavigatio00chicgoog | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered $150,000 stock in the Transcontinental Aerial Navigation Company of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Aerial Navigation | journal = New York Times | date = February 14, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/02/14/103137015.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = To Navigate the Air | journal = New York Times | date = February 19, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/02/19/103097161.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His patent application was eventually denied on the basis that it was "wholly theoretical, everything being based upon calculation and nothing upon trial or demonstration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mitchell (Commissioner) | title = Decisions of the Commissioner of Patents for the Year 1890 | publisher = US Government Printing Office | year = 1891 | page = 46 | accessdate = | quote = 50 O.

In 1921, Lavanda Armstrong discloses a composite wall structure with a vacuum chamber "surrounded by a second envelop constructed so as to hold air under pressure, the walls of the envelope being spaced from one another and tied together", including a honeycomb-like cellular structure, however leaving some uncertainty how to achieve adequate buoyancy given "walls may be made as thick and strong as desired".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=1390745 |status=patent | inventor= Lavanda M Armstrong | country=US  | title = Aircraft of the lighter-than-air type | pubdate=Sep 13, 1921  |assign1=Lavanda M Armstrong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, David Noel discussed the use of geodesic sphere covered with plastic film and "a double balloon containing pressurized air between the
skins, and a vacuum in the centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pages=262–266 | journal=Correspondence, Speculations in Science and Technology  | volume=6 | issue=3 | date=1983 | title=Lighter than Air Craft Using Vacuum  | author=David Noel | url=http://aoi.com.au/Originals/VacuumBalloon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  1982–1985 Emmanuel  Bliamptis elaborated on energy sources and use of "inflatable strut rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=4534525 |status=patent | inventor= Emmanuel  Bliamptis | country=US  | title = Evacuated balloon for solar energy collection | pubdate=Aug 13, 1985 |assign1=Emmanuel  Bliamptis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004–2007 Akhmeteli and Gavrilin address choice of materials ("beryllium, boron carbide ceramic, and diamond-like carbon" or aluminum) in honeycomb double layer craft to address buckling issues.&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Principle==
An [[airship]] operates on the principle of [[buoyancy]], according to [[Archimedes' principle]]. In an airship, air is the fluid in contrast to a traditional [[ship]] where [[water]] is the fluid.

The [[density of air]] at standard temperature and pressure is 1.28 g/l, so 1 [[liter]] of displaced air has sufficient buoyant force to lift 1.28 g. Airships use a bag to displace a large volume of air; the bag is usually filled with a lightweight gas such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]]. The total lift generated by an airship is equal to the weight of the air it displaces, minus the weight of the materials used in its construction including the gas used to fill the bag.

Vacuum airships would replace the helium gas with a near-[[vacuum]] environment, having no mass, density would be near to 0.00 g/l, which would theoretically be able to provide the full lift potential of displaced air, so every liter of vacuum could lift 1.28 g. Using the [[molar volume]], the mass of 1 liter of helium (at 1 atmospheres of pressure) is found to be 0.178 g. If helium is used instead of vacuum, the lifting power of every liter is reduced by 0.178 g, so the effective lift is reduced by 14%. A 1-liter volume of hydrogen has a [[mass]] of 0.090 g.

The main problem with the concept of vacuum airships is that, with a near-vacuum inside the airbag, the exterior [[atmospheric pressure]] is not balanced by any internal pressure. This enormous imbalance of forces would cause the airbag to collapse unless it were extremely strong (in an ordinary airship, the force is balanced by helium, making this unnecessary). Thus the difficulty is in constructing an airbag with the additional strength to resist this extreme net force, without weighing the structure down so much that the greater lifting power of vacuum is negated.

==Material constraints==
===Compressive strength===
From the analysis by Akhmeteli and Gavrilin:&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"&gt;{{cite patent | number=2007001053 |status=application | inventor=AM Akhmeteli, AV Gavrilin | country=US  | title =US Patent Application 11/517915. Layered shell vacuum balloons| pubdate=Feb 23, 2006 |pridate=2004-05-13 |assign1=Andrey M Akhmeteli and Andrey V Gavrilin | url=http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/vacuum_balloons_cip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total force on a hemi-spherical shell of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; by an external pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi R^2 P&lt;/math&gt;. Since the force on each hemisphere has to balance along the equator the compressive stress will be, assuming &lt;math&gt;h&lt;&lt;R&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi R^2 P / 2 \pi R h = R P / 2 h&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the shell thickness.

Neutral buoyancy occurs when the shell has the same mass as the displaced air, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;h/R = \rho_a/(3 \rho_s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is the air density and &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is the shell density, assumed to be homogeneous. Combining with the stress equation gives 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = (3/2)(\rho_s/\rho_a)P&lt;/math&gt;.
For aluminum and terrestrial conditions Akhmeteli and Gavrilin estimate the stress as &lt;math&gt;3.2\cdot 10^8&lt;/math&gt; Pa, of the same order of magnitude as the compressive strength of aluminum alloys.

===Buckling===
Akhmeteli and Gavrilin note, however, that the compressive strength calculation disregards [[buckling]], and using R. Zoelli's formula for the critical buckling pressure of a sphere
:&lt;math&gt;P_{cr} = \frac{2Eh^2}{\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}\frac{1}{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[modulus of elasticity]] and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Poisson ratio]] of the shell. Substituting the earlier expression gives a necessary condition for a feasible vacuum balloon shell:
:&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 = \frac{9P_{cr}\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}{2\rho_a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
The requirement is about &lt;math&gt;4.5\cdot10^5 kg^{-1} m^5 s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Akhmeteli and Gavrilin assert that this cannot even be achieved using diamond (&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 \approx 1\cdot 10^5&lt;/math&gt;), and 
propose that dropping the assumption that the shell is a homogeneous material may allow lighter and stiffer structures (e.g. a [[honeycomb structure]]).&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Atmospheric constraints==
A vacuum airship should at least float (Archimedes law) and resist external pressure (strength law, depending on design, like the above R. Zoelli's formula for sphere). These two conditions may be rewritten as an inequality where a complex of several physical constants related to the material of the airship is to be lesser than a complex of atmospheric parameters. Thus, for a sphere (hollow sphere and, to a lesser extent, cylinder are practically the only designs for which a strength law is known) it is &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} &lt; \sqrt{1-\frac{P_{\rm int}}{P}}\cdot L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm int}&lt;/math&gt; is pressure within the sphere, while &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana coefficient») and &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana atmospheric  ratio») are:&lt;ref name=shikhovtsev16&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mir.k156.ru/aeroplan/de_bausset_aeroplane-03-1.html#a03-1-2016 |title=Is FLanar Possible? | author=E. Shikhovtsev | date=2016 | accessdate=2016-06-19 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} = 2.79\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}} \cdot (1-\mu^2)^{0.25}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} \approx 2.71\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}}&lt;/math&gt; with an error of order of 3% or less);
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}} \cdot \frac{M_a}{T_a}&lt;/math&gt;),
where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm atm} = 101325&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Pa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\rm atm} = 1.22&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;kg/m^3&lt;/math&gt; are pressure and density of standard Earth atmosphere at sea level, &lt;math&gt;M_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; are molar mass (kg/kmol) and temperature (K) of atmosphere at floating area.
Of all known planets and moons of the Sun system only the Venusian atmosphere has &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; big enough to surpass &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; for such materials as some composites (below altitude of ca. 15&amp;nbsp;km) and graphene (below altitude of ca. 40&amp;nbsp;km). Both materials may survive in the Venusian atmosphere. The equation for &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; shows that exoplanets with dense, cold and high-molecular (&lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; type) atmospheres may be suitable for vacuum airships, but it is a rare type of atmosphere.

==In fiction==
In the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] novel ''[[Tarzan at the Earth's Core]]'' [[Tarzan]] travels to [[Pellucidar]] in a vacuum airship constructed of the fictional material Harbenite.

In ''Passarola Rising'', novelist [[Azhar Abidi]] imagines what might have happened had [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]] built and flown a vacuum airship.

Spherical vacuum body airships using the [[Magnus effect]] and made of [[carbyne]] or similar superhard carbon are glimpsed in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]''.

In ''[[Feersum Endjinn]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]], a vacuum balloon is used by the narrative character Bascule in his quest to rescue Ergates. Vacuum dirigibles (airships) are also mentioned as a notable engineering feature of the space-faring utopian civilisation [[The Culture]] in Banks' novel ''[[Look to Windward]]''&lt;!-- At the end of Chapter 4, Scorched Ground, dialogue between Zleper and 947 Praf. --&gt;, and the vast vacuum dirigible Equatorial 353 is a pivotal location in the final Culture novel, ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.

The '''World Forestry Center''' is a nonprofit educational institution in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].  Located near the [[Oregon Zoo]] in [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]], the organization was established in 1964{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} as the '''Western Forestry Center''', with the actual building opening in 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"&gt;"New forestry center opens" (June 6, 1971). ''The Sunday Oregonian'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wfchist"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:P15exhibw.jpg|thumb|Forestry Building in 1905]]
The  World Forestry Center has its roots in the 1905 [[Lewis &amp; Clark Centennial Exposition|Lewis and Clark Centennial American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair]] for which an enormous [[log cabin]] was built of huge native trees and advertised as the world's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public interest in the '''Forestry Building''', which was turned over to the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]], lasted long after the exposition ended, right up until it was destroyed by fire on August 17, 1964.&lt;ref name="wfchist"&gt;{{cite web

The day after the fire, a group of civic and industry leaders conceived The Western Forestry Center.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} A new, more fire-resistant forestry building designed by Oregon architect [[John Storrs (architect)|John Storrs]] was built in Washington Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} It opened to the public on June 5, 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"/&gt;  The name was changed to "World Forestry Center" in 1986 to reflect the center's revised focus on forestry on a global scale.&lt;ref name="wfchist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new name"&gt;Hill, Alma (January 4, 1986). "Forestry center gets new name". ''The Oregonian'', p. C2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2005, after a $7 million, 6-month renovation, the {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} museum reopened with new interactive exhibits about the sustainability of forests and trees of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Programs==
The World Forestry Center's mission is to "educate and inform people about the world's forests and trees, and their importance to all life, in order to promote a balanced and [[sustainability|sustainable]] future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.worldforestrycenter.org/organization/wfc_aboutus.php
 | title = About Us
 | publisher = World Forestry Center

The center achieves its mission with three programs: the Discovery Museum, two donated working forests—the Magness Memorial Tree Farm and the Johnson-Swanson Tree Farm—and the World Forest Institute which was established in 1989. The primary program is the International Fellowship Program.

In 1989, the World Forestry Center established the World Forest Institute to meet a growing demand for forestry information.  As the forestry sector becomes increasingly complex, there is a greater need for international collaboration and exchange of information on forest trade, regulation, management, and forest resources. The World Forest Institute was created through the vision and support of [[Harry Merlo|Harry A. Merlo]], a pioneer of the forest products industry, and an early visionary of the globalization of the forestry sector.

[[File:World Forestry Center.jpg|thumb|left|The forestry center in 2016]]
The fellowship program brings young forestry and forest products professionals from around the world to work at the World Forest Institute for 6 to 12 months.  Fellows are commonly sponsored by their employer, government institutions, the forest industry, or an NGO, and carry out applied research projects of interest to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/03/world_forestry_program_sends_a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to completing a practical research project, the program works to get Fellows a broad exposure to natural resource management in the U.S. so that when they return to their home countries they have a basic understanding of the owners and managers of land and natural resources throughout the country.

The institute won the 2012 Portland Mayor's International Business Award from the Oregon Consular Corps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFAaHSSvLro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://portland4biz.com/portland-international-business-awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/05/in_downtown_portland_awards_an.html&lt;/ref&gt; This award recognizes businesses that contribute to a global environment in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/?c=51108&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Forestry Center campus also accommodates three other buildings: Julian N. Cheatham Hall, Harold A. Miller Hall and Harry A. Merlo Hall, which houses the administrative offices and the World Forest Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Leadership Hall of Fame===
The Leadership Hall of Fame commemorates people who have made important contributions to [[forestry]].  The photographs and biographies of nearly 200 forestry leaders are displayed in three chests constructed of select [[Black Walnut]] from the [[Eastern United States|eastern U.S.]]

==Public access==
Parking at the World Forestry Center costs $2 per hour, to a maximum of $8 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorewashingtonpark.org/parking# |title=Explore Washington Park|publisher=Washington Park Transportation Management Association |accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Park (MAX station)|Washington Park light rail station]] provides regional [[Public transport|public transit]] access to the World Forestry Center. Additionally, [[TriMet]] bus route 63-Washington Park provides daily service to the World Forestry Center via Washington Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trimet.org/schedules/r063.htm |title=Bus Line 63-Washington Park |publisher= TriMet|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
