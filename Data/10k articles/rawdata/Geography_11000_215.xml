[[File:Azumino 01.jpg|right|thumb|View of Azumino against the [[Hida Mountains]]]]
The {{nihongo|'''Azumi Basin'''|安曇野|Azumino}} is part of the Matsumoto Basin in [[Nagano Prefecture]], Japan. It covers approximately the municipalities of [[Azumino, Nagano|Azumino]], [[Ikeda, Nagano|Ikeda]] and [[Matsukawa, Nagano (Kitaazumi)|Matsukawa]], and some parts of [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]] and [[Ōmachi, Nagano|Ōmachi]] . Formerly called ''Azumidaira'', it stretches from the west banks of the Azusa and Sai rivers to the foot of the [[Hida Mountains]] (also known as the Northern Alps) in the west, and towards the southernmost watershed of the [[Takase River]].&lt;ref name=tampo&gt;Nakajima, Hiroaki (1997). ''Tampō "Azumino"'' (Investigating Azumino), Matsumoto, Kyōdo Shuppan-sha, {{ISBN|4-87663-113-1}}. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–12}} It is known for its natural environment, museums and art galleries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azumino-e-tabi.net/en/ "Explore Azumino"] (Azumino official tourist information website) {{en icon}}. Retrieved January 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Hotaka-jinja02s1920.jpg|right|thumb|Hotaka Shrine]]
At least a thousand years ago, the [[Azumi people]] moved into the area and settled there. Originally, the Azumi, or "the people who live on the sea", lived in northern [[Kyūshū]]. They were famed for their skills in fishing and navigation.&lt;ref name="tampo"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Between the second and the fourth century, they built a shrine on Shikanoshima island in present-day [[Fukuoka |Fukuoka city]] in northern Kyūshū.  The shrine, ''Shikaumi Jinja'' (Shikaumi Shrine), honors the gods of the sea, and has traditionally been administered by members of the Azumi people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikanosima.jp/shrine-shikaumi/ Shikaumi Jinja HP] {{ja icon}}. Retrieved January 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of time the Azumi people spread to other parts of [[Honshū]], such as the Atsumi peninsula in [[Aichi Prefecture]] and [[Atami]] in Shizuoka Prefecture.  Most of their new settlements were built along seashores, with the exception of the landlocked basin in the mountainous region that was later called ''Azumidaira'' and then ''Azumino''.  The reason for their choice of this area is still unclear.&lt;ref name=tampo/&gt;{{rp|13}} ''Hotaka Jinja'' (Hotaka Shrine), located near [[Hotaka Station]], attests to the connection between this area and ''Shikaumi Jinja''. ''Hotaka Jinja'', like ''Shikaumi Jinja'', enshrines the gods of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hometown.infocreate.co.jp/en/chubu/hotaka/maturi-e.html Hotaka Shrine Boat Festival, September 26-27] {{en icon}}. Retrieved January 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2011|talk=Failed verification}}

[[Yoshimi Usui]] from this area wrote a long novel entitled ''Azumino'', which won the prestigious [[Tanizaki Prize]] in 1974. The name ''Azumino'' has since become more common than ''Azumidaira''.&lt;ref&gt;This doesn't mean that Yoshimi Usui coined the word ''Azumino''; literary figures of the Meiji period used it in their writings.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irrigation network (''segi'')==
[[File:Jikkaseki weir.jpg|right|thumb|Jikka-segi weir]]
The Azumi Basin was created by numerous streams and rivers that take their water from melting snow on the Northern Alps.  The Azusa, Kurosawa, Karasu, and Nakabusa rivers, among others, run through this region and have formed a composite fan (compare [[alluvial fan]]){{Clarify|date=May 2011}} characterized by the low water-holding capacity of the soil.&lt;ref name=jikka-segi&gt;Nagano Prefecture Jikka-segi Land Improvement District, et al. (eds.) (2008). ''Jikka-segi in Azumino Guide Book''. Azumino city, Nagano prefecture.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}  Some streams suddenly disappear into the ground and some of these reappear as springs in the middle of green groves known in the local dialect as ''kemi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suido-ishizue.jp/nihon/06/02.html "''Azumino Suidoki''" (History of Azumino), Part 3 of 9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124852/http://suido-ishizue.jp/nihon/06/02.html |date=July 22, 2011 }} {{ja icon}}. Retrieved January 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many such springs are found in the Azumi Basin, but probably the most concentrated area is ''Azumino Wasabi-da Yūsui-gun'' (Azumino horseradish farm springs), designated by the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of the Environment]] as one of the hundred best waters.  The [[Daiō Wasabi Farm]] is located in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hometown.infocreate.co.jp/en/chubu/hotaka/midoko-e.html Places to Visit in Hotaka] {{en icon}} Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the low water-holding capacity of its soil, the Azumi Basin had been a parched wasteland for many centuries, except for limited small areas close to rivers and springs.  The agricultural history of Azumino is almost the same thing as the history of the ''segi'' (irrigation network&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; another local dialect word). Since the [[Heian period]], a number of irrigation networks have been built, for example ''Ryūda-segi'', ''Nuru-segi'', ''Toba-segi'' and ''Iida-segi''.  These networks are still in service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suido-ishizue.jp/nihon/06/03.html "''Azumino Suidoki''" (History of Azumino), Part 4 of 9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125412/http://suido-ishizue.jp/nihon/06/03.html |date=July 22, 2011 }} {{ja icon}}. Retrieved January 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the region had remained unproductive before the innovation of building a segi along a [[contour line]].&lt;ref name=jikka-segi/&gt;{{rp|5}} This type of irrigation network is called ''yoko-segi'' (horizontal irrigation network), as opposed to usual ''tate-segi'' (vertical irrigation network). In the early [[Edo period]], after many failures, the mayor of Yabara village succeeded in building ''Yabara-segi'' along the 545-meter contour line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suido-ishizue.jp/nihon/06/04.html ''Azumino Suidoki'' (History of Azumino), Part 5 of 9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616181233/http://suido-ishizue.jp/nihon/06/04.html |date=June 16, 2008 }} {{ja icon}}. Retrieved January 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This success was followed in 1685 by the building of ''Kan'zaemon-segi'' and in 1849 by the ''Jikka-segi'', designated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan as one of the 100 best agricultural waterways. Both were designed to run along a contour line.  Today, farm land in the Azumi Basin has twice the density of irrigation as the national average, giving rise to its high agricultural productivity. The main agricultural products are rice and fruits.

==Notable people from Azumi Basin==

{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}

===Tada Kasuke===
[[Tada Kasuke]] (1638? -1687) was a former Nakagaya village head who led a failed appeal to the magistrate’s office of the [[Matsumoto Domain]], asking for lower taxes. It was in 1686, the third year of the [[Jōkyō]] era (1686) of the Edo period,
when ''Azumidaira'' was part of the Matsumoto Domain under the rule of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. In the feudal social structure of the time, appealing was strictly forbidden. Tada Kasuke and seven other farmers were caught and executed, along with twenty people from their families, including a sixteen-year-old girl. The incident has been called the [[Jōkyō Uprising]], or the Kasuke Uprising.

===Kyūsaku Matsuzawa===
Kyūsaku Matsuzawa (1855–1887) was a newspaper journalist and a people’s rights activist in the ''Jiyū Minken Undō'' ([[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]) of the 1870s and 1880s.  A talented actor, he had the idea that a play about local hero Tada Kasuke would help educate people about people’s rights.  He wrote and produced ''Minken Kagami Kasuke no Omokage'' (''The Image of Kasuke, a Model of the People’s Rights Movement'').  The play was a great success and was instrumental in relating farmers’ uprisings to people’s rights at the national level.

===Aizō Sōma===
Aizō Sōma (1870–1954) was a Christian philanthropist who founded ''[[Shinjuku Nakamuraya]]''.  Having received his secondary education in Matsumoto, he studied at ''Tokyo Senmon Gakkō'' (now [[Waseda University]]), and then at [[Sapporo Agricultural College]] (now [[Hokkaidō University]]).  He returned to ''Azumidaira'' and established a successful silk worm business.  He was involved in a campaign against drinking and brothels.  He was one of the supporters of Kigenji Iguchi (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Hirabayashi, James A. (2008). [http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2008/5/17/enduring-communities/ Four Hirabayashi Cousins: A Question of Identity-Part 1 of 5] {{en icon}}. Retrieved February 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  He married a girl named Ryō from Sendai, but she could not get used to rural life, and he moved his family to Tokyo where he founded a successful bakery called ''Shinjuku Nakamuraya'' with his wife.

===Kigenji Iguchi===
Kigenji Iguchi (1870–1938) was a Christian educator who founded ''Kensei Gijuku'', a small private school in [[Hotaka, Nagano]].  While he was studying law in Tokyo at Meiji Law School (now [[Meiji University]]), he associated with [[Uchimura Kanzō]] and decided to pursue a career as an educator.  He returned to ''Azumidaira'' and, after overcoming some difficulties typical of rural society, founded the school.

'''Boyd''' is an ancient [[Scottish surname]].&lt;ref name="Anderson1867"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Anderson|title=The Scottish Nation: Or the Surnames, Families, Literature, Honours, and Biographical History of the People of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sZPAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA364|year=1867|publisher=Fullarton|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is attached to Simon, one of several brothers and children of Alan, son of Flathald. Simon's son Robert was called Boyt or Boyd from the Celtic term ''boidhe'' - meaning fair or yellow. While the Celtic origin might be considered improbable, Saxon names from the same period such as ''Boed'' or ''Boyd'' were also present during that time and may well have been married into the Steward family however, [[Robert the Bruce]] granted lands to Sir Robert Boyd as the ancestor of the earls of Kilmarnock.&lt;ref name="Anderson1867" /&gt; The Scottish peerage of the earls of Kilmarnock ends shortly after William Boyd rebelled in the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1745. William was arrested and executed at the [[Tower of London]] in 1746. He left a widow and three sons including James, Lord Boyd who married and succeeded his father as the Earl of Errol, taking his mother's title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland: The peerage of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjQwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA222|year=1790|publisher=W. Owen &amp;#91;and 2 others&amp;#93;|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another theory is of territorial origins which may have been taken from the name; ''Bhoid'', the [[Irish language|Gaelic]] term for the [[Isle of Bute|island of Bute]],&lt;ref name="Dobson2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Dobson|title=The Scottish Surnames of Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlYTbQ_wFz8C&amp;pg=PA13|year=2003|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-5209-1|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Firth of Clyde]].

The '''coastline of Australia''' comprises the coasts of [[mainland Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. It nominally includes a part of all Australian [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]]; the otherwise landlocked [[Australian Capital Territory]] has a coastal enclave at [[Jervis Bay Territory]].

According to ''[[The World Factbook]]'', Australia has the [[List of countries by length of coastline|sixth longest]] coastline in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2060.html |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |work=World Factbook |title=Coastline |date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the historical context of European discovery and exploration, the coastline has been the first point of contact over 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/mapping-australias-coastline |title=Mapping Australia's coastline |work= |publisher=Australian Government |date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[IBRA]] bioregionalisation the coast has 36 coastal bioregions that define the whole coast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite map | author1=Saintilan, Neil | author2=CSIRO | title=Australian saltmarsh ecology | publication-date=2009 | publisher=[[CSIRO]] Publishing | isbn=978-0-643-09684-4 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and there is the more complex [[Integrated Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia]], which includes ecological features that are beyond the shoreline.

'''Crime mapping''' is used by analysts in [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to map, visualize, and analyze crime incident patterns.  It is a key component of [[crime analysis]] and the [[CompStat]] policing strategy.  Mapping crime, using [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), allows crime analysts to identify [[Crime hotspots|crime hot spots]], along with other trends and patterns.

==Overview==
Using GIS, crime analysts can overlay other datasets such as [[census]] [[demographics]], locations of [[pawnbroker|pawn shops]], schools, etc., to better understand the underlying causes of [[crime]] and help [[police|law enforcement]] administrators to devise strategies to deal with the problem.  GIS is also useful for law enforcement operations, such as allocating police officers and dispatching to [[9-1-1|emergencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/library/brochures/pdfs/crime-analysis.pdf|title=Crime Analysis: GIS Solutions for Intelligence-Led Policing|last=esri|first=|date=|website=esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underlying theories that help explain spatial behavior of criminals include [[environmental criminology]], which was devised in the 1980s by Patricia and Paul Brantingham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental Criminology|year=1981|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=0-88133-539-8|editor-last=Brantingham|editor-first=Paul J.|editor2-last=Brantingham|editor2-first=Patricia L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[routine activity theory]], developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson and originally published in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Lawrence E.|last2=Felson|first2=Marcus|title=Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity approach|journal=American Sociological Review|year=1979|volume=44|issue=4|pages=588–607|doi=10.2307/2094589|publisher=American Sociological Association|jstor=2094589}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice theory]], developed by Ronald V. Clarke and Derek Cornish, originally published in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cornish | first=Derek | last2=Clarke | first2=Ronald V. | title=The Reasoning Criminal | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1986 | isbn=3-540-96272-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, crime mapping and analysis has incorporated spatial data analysis techniques that add [[statistics|statistical]] rigor and address inherent limitations of spatial data, including spatial [[autocorrelation]] and spatial heterogeneity.  Spatial data analysis helps one analyze crime data and better understand why and not just where crime is occurring.

Research into computer-based crime mapping started in 1986, when the [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ) funded a project in the [[Chicago Police Department]] to explore crime mapping as an adjunct to [[community policing]]. That project was carried out by the CPD in conjunction with the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety, the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], and [[Northwestern University]], reported on in the book, ''Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maltz|first=Michael D.|last2=Gordon|first2=Andrew C.|last3=Friedman|first3=Warren|title=Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis|year=2000|origyear=1990|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-97381-8|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/forr/pdf/crimjust/mappingcrime.pdf|edition=Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this project prompted NIJ to initiate the Drug Market Analysis Program (with the appropriate acronym D-MAP) in five cities, and the techniques these efforts developed led to the spread of crime mapping throughout the US and elsewhere, including the [[New York City Police Department]]'s [[CompStat]].

==Applications==
Crime analysts use crime mapping and analysis to help law enforcement management (e.g. the police chief) to make better decisions, target resources, and formulate strategies, as well as for tactical analysis (e.g. crime forecasting, [[geographic profiling]]).  [[New York City]] does this through the [[CompStat]] approach, though that way of thinking deals more with the short term.  There are other, related approaches with terms including Information-led policing, [[Intelligence-led policing]], [[Problem-oriented policing]], and [[Community policing]].  In some law enforcement agencies, crime analysts work in civilian positions, while in other agencies, crime analysts are sworn officers.

From a research and [[public policy|policy]] perspective, crime mapping is used to understand patterns of [[prison|incarceration]] and [[recidivism]], help target resources and programs, evaluate [[Crime prevention through environmental design|crime prevention]] or crime reduction programs (e.g. Project Safe Neighborhoods, Weed &amp; Seed and as proposed in ''[[Broken windows theory|Fixing Broken Windows]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelling|first=George|last2=Coles|first2=Catherine|title=Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities|isbn=0-684-83738-2|year=1997|publisher=Simon &amp;amp; Schuster|place=New York|origyear=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and further understanding of causes of crime.

The boom of internet technologies, particularly web-based geographic information system (GIS) technologies, is opening new opportunities for use of crime mapping to support crime prevention. Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leong|first=Kelvin.|last2=Chan|first2=Stephen|title=A content analysis of web-based crime mapping in the world's top 100 highest GDP cities|journal=Crime Prevention and Community Safety|year=2013|volume=15|pages=1–22|doi=10.1057/cpcs.2012.11|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the functions provided in web-based crime mapping are less than in most traditional crime mapping software. In conclusion, existing works of web-based crime mapping focus on supporting community policing rather than analytical functions such as pattern analysis and prediction.

{{See also|Sustainable design|Environmental design}}
'''Ecological design''' is defined by [[Sim Van der Ryn]] and Stuart Cowan as "any form of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with living processes."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Ryn S, Cowan S(1996). “Ecological Design”. Island Press, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological design is an integrative ecologically responsible design discipline. 

It helps connect scattered efforts in [[green architecture]], [[sustainable agriculture]], [[ecological engineering]], [[ecological restoration]] and other fields. The “eco” prefix was used to ninety sciences including [[eco-city]], eco-management, eco-technique, eco-tecture. It was first used by John Button in 1998. The inchoate developing nature of ecological design was referred to the “adding in “of environmental factor to the design process, but later it was focused on the details of eco-design practice such as product system or individual product or industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This reference cannot be found. Replace with something more accessible.  --&gt;Anne-Marie Willis (1991), “An international Eco Design” conference&lt;/ref&gt;
By including life cycle models through energy and materials flow, ecological design was related to the new [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] subject of [[industrial ecology]]. Industrial ecology meant a conceptual tool emulating models derived from natural ecosystem and a frame work for conceptualizing environmental and technical issues.

Living organisms exist in various systems of balanced symbiotic relationships. The ecological movement of the late twentieth-century is based on understanding that disruptions in these relationships has led to serious breakdown of natural [[ecosystems]]. In human history, technological means have resulted in growth of human populations through fire, implements and weapons. This dramatic increase in explosive population contributed the introduction of mechanical energies in machine production and there have been improvements in mechanized agriculture, manufactured chemical fertilizers and general health measures. Although the earlier invention inclined energy adjusting the ecological balance, population growth following the industrial revolution led to abnormal ecological change.&lt;ref&gt;John McHale (1969), “An Ecological Overview”, in The Future of the Future, New York; George Braziller, pp.66-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological design issues and the role of designers==
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], many propositions in the design field were raised with unsustainable design principles. The architect-designer [[Victor Papanek]] suggested that [[industrial design]] has murdered by creating new species of permanent garbage and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Papanek (1972), “Design for the Real World: Human Ecological and social change”, Chicago: Academy Edition, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; For these issues, [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], who was invited as University Professor at [[Southern Illinois University]] in Carbondale in 1960s, demonstrated how design could play a central role in identifying major world problems between 1965 and 1975. That included following contents:&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Margolin]] (1997), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14, 2. pp. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
*Review and analysis of world [[energy resources]]
*Defining more efficient uses of natural resources such as metals
*Integrating machine tools into efficient systems of industrial production
In the 1992 conference, ‘The Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet”, a proposition was put forward that our world is on a path of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption|consumption]] that cannot be sustained. The report drew attention to Individuals and groups around the world who have a set of principles to develop strategies for change that might be effective in world economics and trade policies, and the design professions will play a role in it. Namely, those meant that design profession becomes not what new products to make, but how to reinvent design culture likely to be realized. He noted designers firstly have to realize that design has historically been a dependent, contingent practice rather than one based on necessity. The design theorist, Clive Dilnot noted design becomes once again a means of ordering the world rather than merely of shaping products.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Dilnot (1982), “Design as a Society Significant Activity: An Introduction”, Design studies 3:2. pp.144&lt;/ref&gt; As a broader approach, the conference of ‘Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet’ 1992, emphasized that designers should challenge for facing human problems. These problems were mentioned to six themes: quality of life, efficient use of natural resources, protecting the global commons, managing human settlements, the use of chemicals and the management of human industrial waste, and fostering [[sustainable economic growth]] on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Margolin (1988), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14,2. pp. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
*1971 [[Ian McHarg]], in his book "Design with Nature", popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. McHarg gave every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  This system became the foundation of today's [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), a ubiquitous tool used in the practice of ecological landscape design.
*1978 [[Permaculture]].  Bill Mollison and David Holmgren coin the phrase for a system of designing regenerative human ecosystems.  (Founded in the work of Fukuoka, Yeoman, Smith, etc..
*1994  [[David Orr]], in his book "Earth in Mind: On Education, Environment, and the Human Prospect", compiled a series of essays on "ecolgocial design intelligence" and its power to create healthy, durable, resilient, just, and prosperous communities.
*1994  Canadian biologists [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]] and Nancy Jack Todd, in their book "From Eco-Cities to Living Machines" describe the precepts of ecological design.
*2000 [[Ecosa Institute]] begins offering an [http://ecosa.org/ecological-design-certificate-program/ Ecological Design Certificate], teaching designers to design with nature.
*2004 [[Fritjof Capra]], in his book "The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living", wrote this primer on the science of [[living systems]] and considers the application of new thinking by life scientists to our understanding of social organization.
*2004 K. Ausebel compiled compelling personal stories of the world's most innovative ecological designers in "Nature's Operating Instructions."

==Influence==
There are some clothing companies that are using several ecological design methods to change the future of the textile industry into a more environmentally friendly one. Recycling used clothing to minimize the use of resources, using [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] textile materials to reduce the impact on the environment, and using plant dyes instead of poisonous chemicals to improve the appearance of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Taieb, Amine Hadj et al. (2010). "Sensitising Children to Ecological Issues through Textile Eco-Design". International Journal of Art &amp; Design Education, vol. 29, 3. p313-320&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adrian Ludwig Richter 013.png|250px|thumb|"[[Genevieve of Brabant|Genoveva]] in the Forest Seclusion" by [[Adrian Ludwig Richter]] – a refuge and a magical [[deer]]]]

In [[folklore]] and [[fantasy]], an '''enchanted forest''' is a [[forest]] under, or containing, [[magic (fantasy)|enchantments]]. Such forests are described in the oldest folklore from regions where forests are common, and occur throughout the centuries to modern works of fantasy. They represent places unknown to the characters, and situations of [[liminality]] and transformation. The forest can feature as a place of threatening danger, or one of refuge, or a chance at [[adventure]].

==Folktales==
The forest as a place of magic and danger is found among folklore wherever the natural state of wild land is forest: a forest is a location beyond which people normally travel, where strange things might occur, and strange people might live, the home of [[monster]]s, [[Witchcraft|witches]] and [[fairy|fairies]]. Peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an [[ogre]] could live an hour away.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "On Science Fiction", ''Of Other Worlds'', p68 {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in [[fairy tale]]s, [[Hansel and Gretel]] found a cannibalistic witch in the forest;&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, ''[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/hanselgretel/notes.html#EIGHT The Annotated Hansel and Gretel]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasilissa the Beautiful]] encountered [[Baba Yaga]] herself;&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner,''[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/babayaga/notes.html The Annotated Vasilissa the Beautiful]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molly Whuppie]] and her sisters ran into a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/hanselgretel/stories/molly.html Molly Whuppie]", ''English Fairy Tales''&lt;/ref&gt; It was in a forest that the king of ''[[The Grateful Prince]]'' lost his way, and rashly promised his child for aid,&lt;ref&gt;W. F. Kirby, "[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/hoe/hoe1-29.htm The Grateful Prince]", ''The Hero of Esthonia''&lt;/ref&gt; where the heroines, and their wicked stepsisters, of ''[[The Three Little Men in the Wood]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]], "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/grimms/13threemenforest.html The Three Little Men in the Wood]" ''Household Tales''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Enchanted Wreath]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lang]], "[http://www.rickwalton.com/folktale/orange11.htm The Enchanted Wreath] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310130705/http://www.rickwalton.com/folktale/orange11.htm |date=2007-03-10 }}", ''[[The Yellow Fairy Book]]''&lt;/ref&gt; met magical tests, and where [[Brother and Sister]] found the streams that their evil stepmother had enchanted.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, ''[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/brothersister/notes.html#EIGHT The Annotated Brother and Sister]''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', Belle's father is lost in the forest when he finds the Beast's castle.&lt;ref&gt;Betsy Hearne, ''Beauty and the Beast: Visions and Revisions of an Old Tale'', p 28, {{ISBN|0-226-32239-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evil cat-spirits of ''[[Schippeitaro]]'' live in the forest.&lt;ref name="Schippeitaro"&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Violet Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/080.htm "Schippeitaro"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, in ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', the hero always goes into the forest. It is not itself enchanted, but it contains enchantments and, being outside normal human experience, acts as a place of transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Zipes]], ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p 65-67, {{ISBN|0-312-29380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German fairy tale has an unusual tendency to take place in the forest; even such neighboring countries as France or Italy are less like to have fairy tales situated in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Delarue, ''The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales'', p xvii, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in folklore, forests can also be places of magical refuge.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p73, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snow White]] found refuge with [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s from her stepmother,&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, ''[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sevendwarfs/notes.html#THIRTEEN The Annotated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Girl Without Hands]] found a hut to stay in when she had been slandered to her husband,&lt;ref&gt;Heid Anne Heiner, ''[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/armlessmaiden/index.html The Annotated Girl Without Hands]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Genevieve of Brabant]] found not only a refuge from slander but a doe magically came to her aid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Lüthi]], ''Once Upon A Time: On the Nature of Fairy Tales'', p 76, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., New York, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Brother and Sister]] hid in the forest after their stepmother turned the brother into a deer.

At other times, the marvels they meet are beneficial. In the forest, the hero of a fairy tale can meet and have mercy on [[Talking animal#Animals interacting with men|talking animals]] that aid him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Zipes]], ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p 115, {{ISBN|0-312-29380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king in many variants of the [[ballad]] ''[[The Famous Flower of Serving-Men]]'' finds an enchanted hind that leads him astray uncanny, but it brings him to a talking bird that reveals to him a murder and that a servant of his is actually a woman, whom the king then marries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sniff.numachi.com/~rickheit/dtrad/pages/tiFLRSERV2;ttFLRSERV2;ttFLWSERV2.html The Famous Flower of Serving-Men]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the forest that the dwarf of ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, "[http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~wbarker/fairies/grimm/055.html Rumpelstiltskin]", ''Grimm's Fairy Tales''&lt;/ref&gt; and the fairy of ''[[Whuppity Stoorie]]''&lt;ref&gt;John Rhys, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/rumpelstiltskin/stories/whuppity.html Whuppity Stoorie]", ''Celtic Folklore: Welsh and Manx''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1901. Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt; reveal their [[true name]]s and therefore the heroines of those tales have a way to free themselves. In ''[[Schippeitaro]]'', the cats reveal their fear of the dog Schippeitaro when the hero of the tale spends the night in the forest.&lt;ref name="Schippeitaro"/&gt;

The creatures of the forest need not be magical to have much the same effect; [[Robin Hood]], living in the greenwood, has affinities to the enchanted forest.&lt;ref name="Holt, J. C. p 9"&gt;Holt, J. C. ''Robin Hood'' p 9 (1982) Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-27541-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in fairy tales, robbers may serve the roles of magical beings; in an Italian variant of ''Snow White'', ''[[Bella Venezia]]'', the heroine takes refuge not with dwarfs but with robbers.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 739 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
The danger of the folkloric forest is an opportunity for the heroes of legend. Among the oldest of all recorded tales, the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' recounts how the heroes [[Gilgamesh]] and [[Enkidu]] traveled to the [[Cedar Forest]] to fight the monsters there and be the first to cut down its trees. In Norse myth and legend, [[Myrkviðr]] (or Mirkwood) was dark and dangerous forest that separated various lands; heroes and even gods had to traverse it with difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 227 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans referred to the [[Hercynian Forest]], in Germania, as an enchanted place; though most references in their works are to geography, [[Julius Caesar]] mentioned [[unicorn]]s said to live there, and [[Pliny the Elder]], birds with feathers that glowed.

==Medieval romance==
[[File:Orlando Furioso 60.jpg|right|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]’s illustration to ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'': a knight and his men see a knight and lady approach in the forest]]
[[File:Giacinto Gimignani, La rencontre de Renaud et Armide dans la Forêt enchantée.jpg|thumb|[[Giacinto Gimignani]], Rinaldo and Armida meet in the enchanted forest in ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'']]
The figure of an enchanted forest was taken up into [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romances]]; the [[knight-errant]] would wander in a trackless forest in search of adventure.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Keen, ''The Outlaws of Medieval Legend'' p 1-2 {{ISBN|0-88029-454-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the fairy tales, he could easily find marvels that would be disbelieved closer to home. [[John Milton]] wrote in ''Paradise Regained'' (Bk ii. 359) of "Fairy damsels met in forest wide / By knights of Logres, or of Lyones," and such ladies could be not only magical aid to the knight, but ladies for [[courtly love]].&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p130 {{ISBN|0-521-47735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huon of Bordeaux]] met the fairy king [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]] in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]], ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures,'' "Huon de Bordeaux", p227. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillaume de Palerme]] hid there with the princess he loved, and found a [[werewolf]] who would aid him. In ''[[Valentine and Orson]]'', the Queen is sent into exile and so forced to give birth in the woods; one child, taken by a bear, turns to a [[wild man of the wood]]s, who later aids Valentine, his long-lost brother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Schlauch]], ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens'', New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 91-2&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Dolopathos" variant of the ''[[Chevalere Assigne|Swan Children]]'', a lord finds a mysterious woman – clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]] – in an enchanted forest and marries her.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' pp. 240-1 New York: Burt Franklin, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genevieve of Brabant]], having rebuffed a would-be lover and found herself accused of adultery by him, escaped to the forest.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Schlauch, ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens'', New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 107&lt;/ref&gt; 

This forest could easily bewilder the knights. Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights – particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]] – by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men – or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179–181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests are places where the knights may become worthy and find the object of their [[quest]]; one romance has a maiden urging Sir [[Lancelot]] on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Alighieri]] used this image in the opening of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' story ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', where he depicted his state as [[allegory|allegorically]] being lost in a dark wood.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 287, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance works==
In the Renaissance, both ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' and ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' had knight-errants who traveled in the woods. In ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' by [[Torquato Tasso]] (1581), enchantments placed on the only forest near Jerusalem prevent the Crusaders from constructing [[siege engine]]s for most of the [[epic poem]], until they are broken by [[Renaud de Montauban#Rinaldo of Jerusalem Delivered|Rinaldo]].

While these works were being written, expanding geographical knowledge, and the decrease of [[woodland]] for [[agricultural land|farmland]], meant the decrease of forests that could be presumed magical. In ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] wrote of a forest that was enchanted specifically by the presence of [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]] and [[Titania (Fairy Queen)|Titania]], the fairy king and queen; like many forests in Shakespeare's works, it becomes a place of metamorphosis and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 182, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others of his plays, such as ''[[As You Like It]]'', take place in a forest, which contains no enchantments but acts much as the forest of folklore.&lt;ref name="Holt, J. C. p 9"/&gt;

==Known inhabitants and traits==
Often there will be [[Dragon]]s, [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarfs]], [[Elf|Elves]], [[Fairy|Fairies]], [[Giant]]s, [[Gnome]]s, [[Goblin]]s, [[Imp]]s, [[Ogre]]s, [[Troll]]s, [[Unicorn]]s, and other [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]].

There may be [[Talking tree|trees that talk]] or with branches that will push people off their horses, thorny bushes which will open to let people in but close and leave people stuck inside, and other plants that move, or turn into animals at night, or the like.

Some stories have [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]] and [[Witchcraft|witches]] living somewhere in the depths of the forest.

==Modern fantasy==
The use of enchanted forests shaded into modern fantasy with no distinct breaking point, stemming from the very earliest fantasies.&lt;ref name="ren6"&gt;Marion Lochhead, ''Renaissance of Wonder'' p6 {{ISBN|0-06-250520-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[Phantastes]]'', the hero finds himself in a wood as dark and tangled as Dante's, ''una selva obscura'' that blots out sunlight and is utterly still, without any beasts or birdsong.&lt;ref name="ren6"/&gt;
* The more inviting but no less enchanted forest in ''[[The Golden Key]]'' borders Fairyland and draws the hero to find the title key at the end of the rainbow.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Lochhead, ''Renaissance of Wonder'' p23 {{ISBN|0-06-250520-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', [[L. Frank Baum]] depicted the wild and dangerous parts of the [[Land of Oz]] as being forested, and indeed, inhabited with animated trees with human-like traits, a common feature in children's literature.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 303, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* William T. Cox in his 1910 work [[Fearsome Creatures of the Lumberwoods]] based the entire book off of actual forests across North America; however, the author combines these factual locations with fantastic encounters between lumberjacks and mysterious creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearsomecreaturesofthelumberwoods.com/home.htm |title=Cox, William T. with Latin Classifications by George B. Sudworth. Fearsome Creatures of the Lumberwoods. (Washington, D.C.: Judd &amp; Detweiler Inc., 1910 |publisher=Fearsomecreaturesofthelumberwoods.com |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] made use of forests as representing enchantment and the ancientness of the world: [[Mirkwood]], [[Fangorn forest]], and the [[Old Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Forests" p 362 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made use of folklore about trees, such as the willow, believed to uproot themselves and stalk travelers, in [[Old Man Willow]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]], ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures,'' "Fairy trees", p159. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]] are strongly associated with forests, especially [[Mirkwood]] and [[Lothlórien]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Light, "Tolkien's Green Time: Environmental Themes in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''", p 153, ''The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy'', {{ISBN|0-8126-9545-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still more, [[Tom Bombadil]] is a ''genius loci'' of the [[Old Forest]], the wooded land about the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]],&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippley, ''The Road to Middle-earth'', p 108, {{ISBN|0-618-25760-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ent]]s act as the forest come to life.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Light, "Tolkien's Green Time: Environmental Themes in ''The Lord of the Rings''", p 154, ''The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy'', {{ISBN|0-8126-9545-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following J.R.R. Tolkien's work, the enchanted forest is often a magical place in modern fantasy. It continues to be a place unknown to the characters, where strange dangers lurk.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 115, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Enchanted Forest is particularly close to folklore in [[fairytale fantasy]], featuring in such works as [[James Thurber]]'s ''[[The White Deer]]'' and ''[[The 13 Clocks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', p 148, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[contemporary fantasy]] ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books, the Forbidden Forest near [[Hogwarts]] is forbidden because of its magical nature. The home of [[unicorn]]s, [[centaur]]s, and Acromantulas (a race of giant spiders), it continues the tradition of the forest as a place of wild things and danger.&lt;ref&gt;David Colbert, ''The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter'', p 91-2, {{ISBN|0-9708442-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Suzanna Clarke's ''[[Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell]]'', the Raven King's capital city of Newcastle in Northern England was surrounded by four magical wood, with names like Petty Egypt, and St. Sirlow's Blessing. These forests were supposedly enchanted by the Raven King himself to defend his city. They could move around, and supposedly devoured people approaching the city with the intent of bringing harm to it. Clarke brings the notion of magical places to life by contrasting this historical account within the story itself, to the actual depictions of magical woods within the story, where the trees themselves can be regarded as friend or foe, and have alliances formed with magicians.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanna Clarke, ''Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell'', London; Bloomsbury Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', the forest home of the Totoros is an idyllic place where no harm will come to the heroines of the movies.&lt;ref&gt;Helen McCarthy, ''Hayao Miyazaki: Master of Japanese Animation'', p 123, {{ISBN|1-880656-41-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast in the [[Touhou Project]] series by [[Team Shanghai Alice|ZUN]], the Forest of Magic is an extremely dangerous place crawling with [[Yōkai|Youkai]].
* In ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, the Lost Woods serves as a recurring location. It is a large [[old-growth forest]] inhabited by fairies that misleads travelers into going in circles. In order to find their way through, the player has to pick the correct pathway otherwise they'll become lost and are sent back to the forest's entrance. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' an orphaned Link starts the game off in the Lost Woods in a village of Kokiri [[Sprite (entity)|sprites]].
* In ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', the Enchanted Forest, which is located in Fairy Tale Land, is the main setting during the first six seasons. It is often shown to viewers in flashbacks of those who lived there ever since the Dark Curse enacted by the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]] and her followers brought them to the Land Without Magic. There is a desert that separates the land from Agrabah, while also being separated from Arendelle, DunBroch, and the Oceanic Realm by seas and a few days ride from Camelot and the Empire. The land is also seen in the series' spin-off ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''. During the seventh and final season, the New Enchanted Forest is introduced as its main setting. It is located in New Fairy Tale Land and is separated from Maldonia and New Agrabah and has its version of [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] called New Wonderland. This version has elements from the 18th and 19th century mixed with small elements from the Middle Ages as well as French influences. In addition, there is a hierarchy in the kingdoms like a "federal" kingdom and "federated" kingdoms as the unnamed King seems to rule all over the New Enchanted Forest. It is because of the king and Lady Rapunzel Tremaine that there is a resistance against them. By the end of the series, both Enchanted Forests become part of the United Realms upon combining with Storybrooke, the other Fairy Tale Land locations, the Land of Oz, the Land of Untold Stories, Neverland, and the Wish Realm.
* The Enchanted Forest is featured in ''[[Ever After High]]''. It is a location in the Fairytale World that is located next to Ever After High and the Village of Book End. The students of Ever After High hang out there often....Especially when the students need time alone. For this purpose, there's a [[gazebo]] located deep in the forest.

'''Environmental surveying''' is the title of a profession within the wider field of surveying, the practitioners of which are known as environmental surveyors. Environmental surveyors use [[surveying]] techniques to understand the potential impact of environmental factors on real estate and construction developments, and conversely the impact that [[real estate]] and construction developments will have on the environment.

== Professional activities ==

The exact activities that make up the day-to-day work of an environmental surveyor vary from surveyor to surveyor and from project to project. Two environmental surveyors could have careers that consist of quite different professional activities depending on their and their practices area of specialisation.

In the strictest sense, the field of environmental surveying is distinct from that of environmental consultancy. Environmental consultancies may have some overlap with the work of environmental surveyors, but may be members of different professional bodies and may carry out activities not involving the built environment. They may for example be involved with [[arboriculture]] the specifics of which fall out of the remit of environmental surveyors. The terms are however sometimes used interchangeably, and practices often use the term consultants if the practice is seeking a wider client base than would be attracted to a pure Environmental Surveyor practice.

== Main areas of operation ==

The main areas of operation for environmental surveyors in the UK include:

• [[Flood risk assessmen]]t- This is to assess how likely it is that a building or proposed building will flood. If a building is thought to be at risk it will receive a designation of either Band 1 (200:1 chance of flooding in a year) Band 2 (between 200:1 and 75:1 chance of flooding annually) or Band 3 (greater than  a 75:1 chance of flooding annually, currently thought to account for around 4% of flood risk properties in the UK).

• [[Contaminated land assessmen]]t- Contaminated land surveys are carried out to assess the level of threat posed to existing or proposed buildings. Land can be contaminated if it is on or near a site that is currently or has in the past been used for industrial or waste disposal purposes. Such surveys form part of the due diligence that must be carried out before construction or modification of a real estate asset can begin. Both during and after construction a contaminated land survey could be an important factor in informing risk management strategies.

• [[Environmental screenings]]- Provide a general overview of environmental risks proposed to an existing or proposed real estate development. The screening can help gain a picture of: whether or not the property in question might have been damaged by undermining, whether the property might be susceptible to ground gas, the closeness of government licensed waste disposal facilities and an assessment of a properties water resource vulnerability to contamination.

• [[Fire risk assessment]]- All work premises in the UK must have a fire risk assessment. The assessment is designed to ascertain what could start a fire, how the fire could be dealt with and ensuring that the staff will be sufficiently warned of a fire, have exits from the building and a safe place to congregate afterwards.

• [[Asbestos]] surveys- Because asbestos is extremely dangerous material to the health of humans, its use is strictly controlled. 52 countries globally have now banned the substance. The substance is banned by the [[European Union]], with the exception of its use in a very limited number of specific industrial applications. Because of its widespread use in the building industry before banning, many existing buildings contain asbestos and sites where buildings have been previously may have been contaminated with it. For this reason buildings may need an asbestos survey to ascertain the level of use of the substance and the level of contamination to the site this has resulted in.

== Techniques ==

Environmental Surveyors use a range of techniques to assess the environmental conditions of an area and compile their reports.

• Historical data is drawn from maps and older survey information to establish the exact boundaries of a property, and are also used to see if there has been any historical pollution or waste dumping on the site.

• Water Sampling allows Environmental Surveyors to gain a picture of the quality of and pollution levels in local water sources.

• In a similar way to Water Sampling, Earth Sampling can be used to analyse the level of pollutants in an area’s soil.

• Geometric data may used to establish areas that are likely to flood or monitor the spread of pollutants.

• [[Geographic information system]]s (GISs) can cross reference map data with statistical data. If an Environmental Surveyor was compiling a flood report for a building and wanted to establish the odds of a property flooding in any given year then they could cross reference the geographic location of a property with historically obtained statistical data on flooding in the area.

• Visual Inspection might be used if for example the surveyor wished to establish the level of asbestos contamination to a given property. This might be enhanced by or presented in reference to the collection

== Chartered practitioners ==

In the UK as well as in many other countries globally, recognition by the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) is looked upon as conferring a high professional standard, and guaranteeing a level of quality in the work of its member surveyors. Environmental Surveyors form one professional group within RICS and are listed in their Land Professional Group. To achieve the status of chartered environmental surveyor, the candidate must pass an assessment of professional competencies (APC). This consists of completing structured work experience and providing written documents as evidence of the activities carried out during this work experience. Finally the candidate must pass an hour long oral exam. All surveyors regardless of their field are required to demonstrate mastery of RICS core competencies, and then move on to demonstrate knowledge of competencies in their specific fields. Competencies specific to environmental surveying include:

• sustainability 
• contaminated land 
• environmental assessment 
• environmental audit
• laboratory procedures
• management of the natural environment and landscape

Outside of the UK, other professional bodies may offer equivalent designations to signify the professional level of environmental surveyors.
&lt;!--
== Surveyors practices in the UK ==

General surveyors may perform the duties of an environmental surveyor as one of a range of services they supply. If they are a chartered surveyor, they will have completed an APC however it will not be in the specific area of environmental surveying. An example of a practice of this sort would be the London-based.&lt;ref&gt;Dunsin Surveyors&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively small number out of the total number of surveying companies in the UK specialise in environmental surveying. Some practices such as &lt;ref&gt;Wilbourn Associates&lt;/ref&gt; are explicitly a company of Environmental Surveyors, providing the services outlined above. Other companies such as &lt;ref&gt;Kernon Countryside Consultants&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate environmental services into a wider remit of surveying work, in this case rural surveying.--&gt;

'''[[Europe]]''' is traditionally defined as one of seven [[continent]]s. [[Physical geography|Physiographically]], it is the northwestern [[peninsula]] of the larger landmass known as [[Eurasia]] (or the larger [[Afro-Eurasia]]); [[Asia]] occupies the eastern bulk of this continuous landmass and all share a common [[continental shelf]]. Europe's [[Borders of the continents#Asia and Europe|eastern frontier]] is delineated by the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]]. The southeast boundary with Asia is not universally defined, but the modern definition is generally the [[Ural River]] or, less commonly, the [[Emba River]]. The boundary continues to the [[Caspian Sea]], the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or, less commonly, the river [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]] in the [[Caucasus]]), and on to the [[Black Sea]]. The [[Bosporus]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Dardanelles]] conclude the Asian boundary. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south separates Europe from Africa. The western boundary is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Iceland]], though on the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and nearer to [[Greenland]] ([[North America]]) than [[mainland]] Europe, is generally included in Europe for cultural reasons and because it is over twice as close to mainland Europe than to mainland North America. There is ongoing debate on where the [[geographical centre of Europe]] falls.

== Overview ==
[[Image:Europa-bei-nacht 1-1024x768.jpg|thumb|300px|Satellite image of Europe by night]]
Some geographical texts refer to a Eurasian continent given that Europe is not surrounded by sea and its southeastern border has always been [[Boundaries between continents|variously defined]] for centuries.

In terms of shape, Europe is a collection of connected [[peninsula]]s and nearby islands. The two largest peninsulas are mainland Europe and [[Scandinavia]] to the north, divided from each other by the [[Baltic Sea]]. Three smaller peninsulas—[[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]], [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]] and the [[Balkans]]—emerge from the southern margin of the mainland. The Balkan peninsula is separated from Asia by the Black and Aegean Seas. Italy is separated from the Balkans by the Adriatic Sea, and from Iberia by the Mediterranean Sea, which also separates Europe from [[Africa]]. Eastward, mainland Europe widens much like the mouth of a funnel, until the boundary with Asia is reached at the Ural Mountains and Ural River, the Caspian Sea and Caucasus Mountains.

Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]] and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. An arc of uplands also exists along the northwestern seaboard, beginning in southwestern [[Ireland]], continuing across through western and northern [[Great Britain]], and up along the mountainous, [[fjord]]-cut spine of [[Norway]].

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as Iberia and Italy contain their own complex features, as does mainland Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. [[Iceland]] and the [[British Isles]] are special cases. The former is of North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] volcanic formation, while the latter consist of upland areas once joined to the mainland until cut off by rising sea levels.

===Peninsula of peninsulas===
Europe is sometimes called a "peninsula of peninsulas", to draw attention to the fact that Europe is a relatively small, elongated appendage to Asia, and that a large part of Europe is made up of peninsulas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/europe-physical-geography/?ar_a=1 Europe:Physical Geography] National Geographic - Education&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
{{Main article|Geology of Europe}}
[[File:Vourvourou-Greece.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The coast of Europe is heavily indented with bays and gulfs, as here in [[Greece]].]]
Europe's most significant geological feature is the dichotomy between the highlands and mountains of [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Great Britain in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the [[British Isles]]. The major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex, and the [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents.

The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of [[Hungary]].

== Population ==
Figures for the population of Europe vary according to which definition of European boundaries is used. The population within the standard physical geographical boundaries was 701 million in 2005 according to the United Nations. In 2000 the population was 857 million, using a definition which includes the whole of the transcontinental countries of Russia and Turkey. Population growth is comparatively slow, and median age comparatively high in relation to the world's other continents.

==Temperature and precipitation==
The high mountainous areas of Europe are colder and have higher precipitation than lower areas, as is true of mountainous areas in general. Europe has less precipitation in the east than in central and western Europe. The temperature difference between summer and winter gradually increases from coastal northwest Europe to southeast inland Europe, ranging from Ireland, with a temperature difference of only 10&amp;nbsp;°C from the warmest to the coldest month, to the area north of the Caspian Sea, with a temperature difference of 40&amp;nbsp;°C. January average range from 13&amp;nbsp;°C in southern Spain and southern Greek islands to -20&amp;nbsp;°C in the northeastern part of European [[Russia]]. Desert climates are found in the European portion of Kazakhstan and South Eastern Spain.

Western Europe and parts of Central Europe generally fall into the temperate maritime climate (Cfb), the southern part is mostly a Mediterranean climate (mostly Csa, smaller area with Csb), the north-central part and east into central Russia is mostly a humid continental climate (Dfb) and the northern part of the continent is a subarctic climate (Dfc). In the extreme northern part (northernmost Russia; Svalbard), bordering the Arctic Ocean, is tundra climate (Et). Mountain ranges, such as the Alps and the Carpathian mountains, have a highland climate with large variations according to altitude and latitude.

==Landlocked countries==

The landlocked countries in Europe are: [[Andorra]], [[Armenia]], [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Liechtenstein]] (which is [[Landlocked country#Doubly landlocked country|doubly landlocked]]), [[Luxembourg]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[San Marino]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. In addition, the two partly recognized [[frozen conflict]] zones of [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] and [[Transnistria]] are also landlocked.

[[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] constitute a contiguous landlocked agglomeration of eight countries in Central Europe and the Balkans, stretching from Geneva all the way to Skopje. The other landlocked countries are "standalone" landlocked, not bordering any other such ''European'' one (the emphasis is necessary, since [[Kazakhstan]] borders [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]], thus forming a vast landlocked expanse in [[Central Asia]])

Although normally it is possible to obtain information about the wind direction from the orientation and form of sand dunes, the complexity of shapes of the Hagal dunes makes it difficult to determine the direction of the forming winds. In the case of the Hagal dunes, it is theorised that a local circular crater, probably formed due to meteorite impact and filled with sand, has decreased the quantity of dune-forming sand; this, in turn, impacted the local topography, causing a change in wind patterns.&lt;ref name="Time magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt; 
[[File:ESP 044675 2580 Hagal dune field.webm|thumb|250px|NASA video clip about the Martian Morse Code]]
The linear dunes (dashes) were formed through the action of bidirectional winds, acting perpendicular to the line of the sand dune, causing a [[funnel]]ing effect directing the sand to accumulate along the linear axis of the dune. The round-shaped dunes (dots) were formed when the winds that caused the linearly-shaped accumulations were interrupted. The round dunes are classified as "[[barchan]]oid dunes". However, the exact mechanism of either formation is still unknown and this is the reason the area was chosen for imaging by the HiRISE mission.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

Veronica Bray, HiRISE camera targeting specialist, commented that there are similarly shaped dunes in other locations on Mars, but the Hagal field provides better images of these shapes due to the uncommon characteristics of its [[topography]]. Bray also decoded the "Morse Code" of a formation as "NEE NED ZB 6TNN DEIBEDH SIEFI EBEEE SSIEI ESEE SEEE !!".&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Maddie Stone|title=There's a Secret Message Written Into the Sands of Mars|url=https://gizmodo.com/theres-a-secret-message-written-into-the-sands-of-mars-1783330309|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Doug Criss|title=Message from Mars?

While the term was not an [[ethnonym]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&amp;pg=PA567#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible], p.567, "Hebrew, Hebrews...

However, in some instances it may also be used in a wider sense, referring to the [[Phoenicia]]ns, or to other ancient groups, such as the group known as [[Shasu|Shasu of ''Yhw'']] on the eve of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/epsd/ The Electronic Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary s.v. SA-GAZ. The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago volume H (1956) p. 13 &amp; p. 84; volume Š/1 (1989) p. 70.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Roman Empire]], Greek ''Hebraios'' could refer to the [[Jews]] in general, as Strong's Hebrew Dictionary puts it "any of the Jewish Nation"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G1445&amp;t=NKJV Thayer's Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; and at other times more specifically to the Jews living in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. In Early Christianity, the Greek term {{lang|grc|Ἑβραῖος}} refers to [[Jewish Christian]]s as opposed to the [[gentile Christians]] and [[Judaizers]] (Acts 6:1 among others). {{lang|grc|Ἰουδαία}} is the province where the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] was located.

In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Modern Greek]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and a few other modern languages, there is a pejorative connotation associated with the word corresponding to the word Jew; because of that, in each of these languages, the primary word used is that which corresponds to "Hebrew".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Administrator |url=http://www.museoebraico.it/english/ |title=Jewish Museum of Venice - homepage |publisher=Museoebraico.it |accessdate=2012-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817113532/http://www.museoebraico.it/english/ |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghetto.it/ghetto/en/index.asp |title=Jewish Ghetto of Venice |publisher=Ghetto.it |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yann Picand |author2=Dominique Dutoit |url=http://translation.sensagent.com/evreiesc/ro-en/ |title=translation of evreiesc in English &amp;#124; Romanian-English dictionary |publisher=Translation.sensagent.com |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of "Hebrew" is used also in the [[Kurdish language]] and was once used also in French.

With the revival of the [[Hebrew language]] and the emergence of the Hebrew [[Yishuv]], the term has been applied to the Jewish people of this re-emerging society in Israel or anything associated with it.

==Etymology==
The definitive origin of the term "Hebrew" remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Hebrew"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title = Hebrew | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | place = Chicago  |year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biblical term ''Ivri'' ({{lang|he|עברי}}; {{IPA-he|ʕivˈri}}), meaning "to traverse" or "to pass over", is usually rendered as ''Hebrew'' in English, from the [[ancient Greek]] ''Ἑβραῖος'' and the [[Latin]] ''Hebraeus''. The Biblical word ''Ivri'' has the plural form ''Ivrim'', or ''Ibrim''.

Most archaeologists {{as of|2018|lc=on}} regard the Hebrews as local [[Canaanite people|Canaanite]] refugees and Shasu settling down in the hill-country.]]
{{bibleverse||Genesis|10:21|HE}} refers to [[Shem]], the elder brother of Ham and Japheth and thus the first-born son of [[Noah]], as the father of the sons of [[Eber]] (עבר), which may have a similar meaning.

Some authors{{which|date=June 2018}} argue that ''Ibri'' denotes the descendants of the biblical patriarch [[Eber]] (Hebrew עבר), son of [[Salah (biblical figure)|Shelah]], a great-grandson of Noah and an ancestor of Abraham,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=E&amp;artid=17 Jewish Encyclopedia article on Eber]&lt;/ref&gt; hence the occasional anglicization  ''Eberites''.

Since the 19th-century CE discovery of the second-millennium BCE inscriptions mentioning the [[Habiru]], many theories have linked these to the Hebrews. Some scholars argue that the name "Hebrew" is related to the name of those seminomadic Habiru people recorded in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] inscriptions of the 13th and 12th centuries BCE as having settled in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="entry in britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/259033/Hebrew entry in britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars rebut this, proposing that the Hebrews are mentioned in older texts of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|3rd Intermediate Period of Egypt]] (15th century BCE) as [[Shasu|Shasu of ''Yhw'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rainey | first = Anson | title = Shasu or Habiru. Who Were the Early Israelites? | journal = Biblical Archaeology Review | volume = 34 | issue = 6 (Nov/Dec) | publisher = Biblical Archaeology Society | date = November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the term  "Hebrew" is normally used by Israelites when speaking of themselves to foreigners, or is used by foreigners when speaking about Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;William David. Reyburn - Euan McG. Fry - A handbook on Genesis - New York - United Bible Societies - 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Torah in ''[[Lekh Lekha|parashat Lekh Lekha]]'' ("go!" or "leave!", literally "go for you") calls [[Abraham]] ''Avram Ha-Ivri'' ("Abram the Hebrew"), which translates literally as "Abram the one who stands on the other side."{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|14:13}}

[[Israelites]] are defined as the descendants of [[Jacob]], son of [[Isaac]], grandson of [[Abraham]]. [[Eber]], an ancestor of Jacob (seven generations removed), is a distant ancestor of many people, including the Israelites, [[Ishmaelites]], [[Edomites]], [[Moabites]], [[Ammon]]ites, [[Midianites]] and [[Qahtanites]].

According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] the terms "Hebrews" and "Israelites" usually describe the same people, stating that they were called Hebrews before the conquest of the Land of [[Canaan]] and Israelites afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7445-hebrew Hebrews entry in Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Nadav Na'aman and others say that the use of the word "Hebrew" to refer to Israelites is rare and when used it is used "to Israelites in exceptional and precarious situations, such as migrants or slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender and Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East|year=2009|isbn=978-0567545008|page=152|author=Carolyn Pressler|editor=Bernard M.

== Use as synonym for "Jews" ==
[[File:Dura Europos fresco Jews cross Red Sea.jpg|thumb|Moses (l) and Aaron (r) lead the Jews across the [[Red Sea]] while pursued by [[Pharaoh]]. Fresco from the [[Dura-Europos]] synagogue in Syria, 244–256 CE]]
By the Roman period, "Hebrews" could be used to designate the Jews, who use the [[Hebrew]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hebrews entry in thefreedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] was probably written for [[Jewish Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/HAN_HEG/HEBREWS_EPISTLE_TO_THE.html Encyclopædia Britannica: Hebrews, Epistle to the]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some modern languages, including [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and many [[Slavic languages]], the name ''Hebrews'' survives as the standard [[ethnonym]] for Jews, but in many other languages in which there exist both terms, it is considered derogatory to call modern Jews "Hebrews".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Among certain left-wing or liberal circles of Judaic cultural lineage, the word "Hebrew" is used as an alternatively secular description of the Jewish people (e.g., [[Bernard Avishai]]'s ''The Hebrew Republic'' or left-wing wishes for a [[one-state solution|"Hebrew-Arab" joint cultural republican state]]).

=== Use in Zionism ===

Beginning in the late 19th century, the term "Hebrew" became popular among secular Zionists; in this context the word alluded to the transformation of the Jews into a strong, independent, self-confident secular national group ("the New Jew") sought by classical Zionism.  This use died out after the establishment of the state of Israel, when "Hebrew" was replaced with "Jew" or "Israeli".&lt;ref name="shavitxiv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shavit|first=Yaacov|title=The New Hebrew Nation|publisher=Routledge|year=1987|pages=xiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ziok8FgWCpQC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=merlin%20kook%20hebrew&amp;pg=PR14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22last%20quarter%20of%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7146-3302-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the president of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] for 25 years.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Henry Fairfield Osborn.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Osborn in 1890]]
Son of the prominent railroad tycoon [[William H. Osborn|William Henry Osborn]] and his wife, Virginia Reed Osborn, Henry Fairfield Osborn was born in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]], 1857. He studied at [[Princeton University]] (1873–1877), obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in geology and archaeology, where he was mentored by paleontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. Two years later, Osborn took a special course of study in anatomy in the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Bellevue Medical School of New York under Dr. [[William H. Welch]], and subsequently studied [[embryology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] under [[Thomas Huxley]] as well as [[Francis Maitland Balfour]] at [[Cambridge University]], England.&lt;ref&gt;"After Twenty Years:The Record of the Class of 1877", Princeton University, 1877–1897, p. 72. Trenton, N. J. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857–1935)", Hervey W. Shimer, Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol. 72, No. 10, May, 1938, pp. 377–379.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Osborn obtained a [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]] in [[paleontology]] from Princeton, becoming a lecturer in Biology and Professor of [[Comparative Anatomy]] from the same university (1883–1890). In 1891, Osborn was hired by [[Columbia University]] as a professor of [[zoology]]; simultaneously, he accepted a position at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], New York, where he served as the curator of a newly formed Department of [[Vertebrate Paleontology]]. As a curator, he assembled a remarkable team of fossil hunters and preparators, including [[William King Gregory]]; [[Roy Chapman Andrews]], a possible inspiration for the creation of the fictional archeologist [[Indiana Jones]]; and [[Charles R. Knight]], who made murals of dinosaurs in their habitats and sculptures of the living creatures. On November 23, 1897 he was elected member of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], a wildlife conservation organization founded by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[George Bird Grinnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives of the Boone and Crockett Club|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/49/rec/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thanks to his considerable family wealth and personal connections, he succeeded [[Morris K. Jesup]] as the president of the museum's Board of Trustees in 1908, serving until 1933, during which time he accumulated one of the finest [[fossil]] collections in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/hosborn.pdf Biographical Memoir of Henry Fairfield Osborn, 1857-1935 by William K. Gregory]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Osborn served as President of the [[New York Zoological Society]] from 1909 to 1925.

Long a member of the [[US Geological Survey]], Osborn became its senior vertebrate paleontologist in 1924.  He led many fossil-hunting expeditions into the [[American Southwest]], starting with his first to [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]] in 1877. Osborn conducted research on ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' brains by cutting open fossilized braincases with a diamond saw.&lt;ref name="csaharicus-endo-intro"&gt;"Introduction," in Larsson (2001). Pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; (Modern researchers use computed tomography scans and 3D reconstruction software to visualize the interior of dinosaur endocrania without damaging valuable specimens.)&lt;ref name="csaharicus-endo-abs"&gt;"Abstract," in Larsson (2001). Pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He accumulated a number of prizes for his work in paleontology. In 1901, Osborn was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter O|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterO.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described and named ''[[Ornitholestes]]'' in 1903, ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' in 1905, ''[[Pentaceratops]]'' in 1923, and ''[[Velociraptor]]'' in 1924. In 1929 Osborn was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229194403/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his considerable scientific stature during the 1900s and 1910s, Osborn's scientific achievements have not held up well, for they were undermined by ongoing efforts to bend scientific findings to fit his own racist and eugenist viewpoints.

His legacy at the American Museum has proved more enduring. Biographer Ronald Rainger has described Osborn as "a first-rate science administrator and a third-rate scientist."&lt;ref&gt;See Ronald Rainger, ''An Agenda for Antiquity: Henry Fairfield Osborn and Vertebrate Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, 1890–1935'' (Tuscaloose, AB: University of Alabama, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Osborn's greatest contributions to science ultimately lay in his efforts to popularize it through visual means. At his urging, staff members at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] invested new energy in display, and the museum became one of the pre-eminent sites for exhibition in the early twentieth century as a result. The murals, habitat dioramas, and dinosaur mounts executed during his tenure at the museum attracted millions of visitors, and inspired other museums to imitate his innovations.&lt;ref&gt;On the American Museum's habitat dioramas, see http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/; Karen Wonders. ''Habitat Dioramas'', (Figura Nova Series 25: Acta Universitatis Uppsaliensis, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; But his decision to invest heavily in exhibition also alienated certain members of the scientific community and angered curators hoping to spend more time on their own research.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Cain, "The Art of Authority: Exhibits, Exhibit Makers and the Contest for Scientific Status at the American Museum of Natural History, 1920–1940." ''Science in Context'' 24, no. 2 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, his efforts to imbue the museum's exhibits and educational programs with his own racist and eugenist beliefs disturbed many of his contemporaries and have marred his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Haraway, "Teddy Bear Patriarchy," ''Primate Visions: Gender, Race and Nature in the World of Modern Science''. (New York: Routledge, 1989). Also see Constance Clark, ''God – or Gorilla: Images of Evolution in the Jazz Age''. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008) and Victoria Cain, "The Direct Medium of the Vision": Visual Education, Virtual Witnessing and the Prehistoric Past at the American Museum of Natural History, 1890–1923." ''Journal of Visual Culture'' vol. 10, no. 3 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponyms==
An African dwarf crocodile, ''[[Osteolaemus tetraspis|Osteolaemus osborni]]'', was named in his honor by [[Karl Patterson Schmidt]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Osborn", p. 196).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Dawn Man Theory===
Osborn developed his own evolution theory of man's origins called the "Dawn Man Theory". His theory was founded on the discovery of [[Piltdown Man]] (''Eoanthropus'') which was dated to the Late (Upper) [[Pliocene]]. Writing before Piltdown was exposed as a hoax, the ''Eoanthropus'' or "Dawn Man" Osborn maintained sprang from a common ancestor with the [[ape]] during the [[Oligocene]] period which he believed developed entirely separately during the Miocene (16 million years ago). Therefore, Osborn argued that ''all'' apes ([[Simia]]) following the pre-Darwinian classification of [[Linnaeus]] had evolved entirely parallel to the ancestors of man ([[homo]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Discoveries Relating to the Origin and Antiquity of Man", Henry Fairfield Osborn, Science, New Series, Vol. 65, No. 1690, May 20, 1927, pp. 481–488.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Man was Never an Ape", Popular Science, 1927, Aug 1927, Vol. 111, No. 2, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Hunt for the Dawn Monkey: Unearthing the Origins of Monkeys, Apes, and Humans", Christopher Beard, University of California Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Human evolution: an illustrated introduction", Roger Lewin, Wiley-Blackwell, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Osborn himself wrote:

{{quote|We have all borne with the ape and monkey and ape hypothesis long enough are we are glad to welcome this new idea of the aristocracy of man back to a even remote period than the beginning of the stone age.&lt;ref&gt;Bones of contention, Roger Lewin, University of Chicago Press, 1997, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While believing in common ancestry between man and ape, Osborn denied that this ancestor was ape-like. The common ancestor between man and ape Osborn always maintained was more Human than ape. Writing to Arthur Keith in 1927, he remarked "when our Oligocene ancestor is found it will not be an ape, but it will be surprisingly pro-human".&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, 1997, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; His student [[William K. Gregory]] called Osborn's idiosyncratic view on man's origins as a form of "Parallel Evolution" but many [[creationists]] misinterpreted Osborn, greatly frustrating him, and believed he was asserting man had never evolved from a lower life form.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, 1997, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary views===

Osborn was originally a supporter of [[Edward Drinker Cope]]'s neo-Lamarckism, however, he later abandoned this view. Osborn became a proponent of organic selection, also known as the [[Baldwin effect]].&lt;ref name="Levit 2007"&gt;Levit, Georgy S; Olsson, Lennart. (2007). ''Evolution on Rails Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis''. In Volker Wissemann. ''Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 11/2006''. Universitätsverlag Göttingen. pp. 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborn was a believer in [[orthogenesis]], he coined the term ''aristogenesis'' for his theory. His aristogenesis was based on a "physicochemical approach" to evolution.&lt;ref name="Levit 2007"/&gt; He believed that aristogenes operate as biomechanisms in the geneplasm of the organism. He also held the view that [[mutation]]s and [[natural selection]] play no creative role in evolution and that aristogenesis was the origin of new novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Regal, Brian. (2002).

He studied history, geography and [[German philology]] at the Universities of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], then in 1891 relocated to [[Berlin]], where he served as an assistant geographer to [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]], followed by work as an assistant to [[Adolf Bastian]] at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]]. In 1899 he became an assistant director at the ''[[Leipzig Museum of Ethnography|Museum für Völkerkunde zu Leipzig]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=im4LAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=%22Karl+Weule%22+Richthofen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3C5Sg6xOdn&amp;sig=fypOP9zg8j6ZYFqKJKKmmvReE-k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwA2oVChMIga_KvZ3IyAIVQfdjCh19Bga8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Karl%20Weule%22%20Richthofen&amp;f=false Native Life in East Africa: The Results of an Ethnological Research Expedition] by Karl Weule&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GR&gt;[http://www.germananthropology.com/short-portrait/karl-weule/291 SP Karl Weule - Interviews with German Anthropologists] (biographical information)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''khutor'''  ({{lang-rus|ху́тор|p=ˈxutər}}) or '''khutir''' ({{lang-uk|ху́тiр}}, ''khutir'', pl. ''ху́тори'', ''khutory'') is a type of rural locality in some countries of [[Eastern Europe]]; in the past the term mostly referred to a single-[[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] settlement.&lt;ref name=GSE&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/отруб/БСЭ/Хутор/ Khutor] from the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BE&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/brokgauz/all/111/111286.shtml Khutor] from the [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can be translated as "[[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingvo.ua/uk/Translate/uk-en/%D1%85%D1%83%D1%82%D1%96%D1%80 Українсько-англійський переклад «хутір» - ABBYY Lingvo-Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingvo.ua/uk/Translate/ru-en/%D1%85%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80 Російсько-англійський переклад «хутор» - ABBYY Lingvo-Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

They existed in [[Cossack]]-settled lands that encompassed today's [[Ukraine]], [[Kuban]], and the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]] basin while in Kuban and Don region the word ''khutor'' was also used to describe new settlements (irrespective of the number of homesteads) which had detached themselves from [[stanitsa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CH%5CKhutirIT.htm Khutir] at the [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Cossack]] communities, these types of settlements were referred to as ''posyólok'' or ''sélyshche''. In [[Russia]] the term "{{lang|ru|выселки}}" (''vyselki'', literally, "those who moved away") was also used. Khutor remains the official designation of many Russian villages in these regions.

During the [[Stolypin reform]]s in the Russian empire, [[Peter Stolypin]] envisaged rich [[peasant]]s "privatising" their share of the community (''[[obshchina]]'' or ''tovarystvo'') lands, leaving the obshchinas, and settling in khutors on their now individually owned land.  A less radical concept was that of an ''otrub'' (отруб) or ''vidrub'': a section of formerly ''obshchina'' land, whose owner has left the ''obshchina'' but still continued to live in the village and to "commute" to his land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/отруб/БСЭ/Отруб/ Otrub] from the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910 the share of khutors and ''otrubs'' among all rural households in the European part of Russia was estimated at 10.5%. These were practically eliminated during the [[collectivisation in the USSR]].&lt;ref name=GSE/&gt;

==In literature==
[[Nikolai Gogol]]'s first major work is called ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]'', where 'farm' is a translation of 'khutor' (Russian: Вечера на хуторе близ Диканьки, Vechera na khutore bliz Dikan'ki).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5829">This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in the [[United States Virgin Islands]]''' (a [[Insular area|U.S. territory]]), grouped by type and sorted by location.  It contains all public-use and military airports. Some private-use and former airports may be included where notable, such as airports that were previously public-use, those with commercial enplanements recorded by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] or airports assigned an [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] airport code.

==Airports==
&lt;!-- Note to editors:

(1) Please do not move or remove the onlyinclude tags; they are used to transclude this state's "Commercial Service - Primary" airports in the [[List of airports in the United States]]. Also please do not add columns to the table since all the U.S. state lists are using the same format so that they can be transcluded into a single sortable table.

(2) To compare airport use, enplanement (passenger boarding) figures are taken from a single source and are for the same year. This list currently contains the 2016 enplanement data, updated by the FAA in October 2017. Please do not change the enplanements for individual airports based on data from other sources. If you wish to add such information, please place it in the airport's article, not on this list.

(3) Airport names shown in bold indicate the airport has scheduled service on commercial airlines. If you change an airport name to bold, please be sure to also add an ==Airlines and destinations== section to the corresponding airport article.

'''Magdalena Island''' ({{lang-es|Isla Magdalena}}) is a small island in the [[Strait of Magellan]], Chile. 

==History==
[[Ferdinand Magellan | Magellan]], definitely saw the island as he passed for the first time in the strait. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], while speaking about the desertion of Sab Antonio cites in his famous book, ''[[:s:The First Voyage Round the World/Pigafetta's Account of Magellan's Voyage]]'' (Chap.79), that in to alert the crew of the ship if they ever try to get back:
{|q|
''"This manner of acting had been ordained by the captain from the commencement, in order to effect the junction of any ship which might be separated from the others. So the people of the said ship did what the captain had commanded them, and more, for they set two ensigns with letters; one of the ensigns was placed on a small hill at the first bay, the other on an islet in the third bay, where there were many sea wolves and large birds."''
|}

==Geography==
{{seealso|Los Pingüinos Natural Monument}}
It is located in [[Magallanes Region]] about 32&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the regional capital [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]]. In 1982, it and nearby Marta Island were declared a national monument—[[Los Pingüinos Natural Monument]]. The island is the breeding location for several species of seabirds, most notably the [[Magellanic penguin]]. The penguin colony on the island has been monitored since 1998 and was estimated to hold 63,000 breeding pairs in 2007. The island is currently uninhabited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1920">'''Michel Aco''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1680&amp;ndash;1702, also known as '''Michel Accault''') was a [[France|French]] explorer who, along with [[René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] and Father [[Louis Hennepin]], explored the [[Mississippi River]] in 1679.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/60/mode/1up |title=The new international encyclopaedia |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aco became La Salle's lieutenant because of his knowledge of [[Native American languages]] and his abilities as an explorer. When the party reached the [[Illinois River]]; Aco, Hennepin and another man were sent to explore the upper Mississippi.  During their exploration, they became the first [[Europe]]ans to see [[Carver's Cave]] and [[Saint Anthony Falls]]. They were later captured by [[Sioux]] Indians and held until the influence of [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]] won their release. He was brought to the mouth of the [[Wisconsin River]] and went on to explore the Wisconsin River, the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] down to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], and [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]], and finally, in 1681, to [[Montreal]]. After his exploring days were over, Aco settled in [[Illinois]] and became a trader. He married [[Aramepinchieue]], the daughter of a [[Kaskaskia]] chief in 1693, and had two children with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisianalineage.com/Rouensa.htm |title=Rouensa, Illiniwek Indian Chief |publisher=Louisianalineage.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mušicki''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Мушицки}}, {{IPA-sh|muʃǐtskiː|pron}}) is a Serbian family name, a [[demonym]]ic derived from the historical village of Mušić (now [[Gornji Mušić]] and [[Donji Mušić]], in [[Mionica]]). The ancestors of Lukijan Mušicki had settled in Habsburg territory ([[Bačka]]) from Mušić in the Ottoman [[Valjevo]] ''nahija'' (district). The surname was misspelled in records, the correct form being ''Mušićki'' (Мушићки). The old spelling was '''Emušickij''' (Емушицкиј), as seen from a 1797 letter of Lukijan Mušicki; he later shortened it to ''Mušicki''. It may refer to:

*[[Kosta Mušicki]] (1897–1946), Serbian collaborationist commander
*[[Lukijan Mušicki]] (1777–1837), Serbian poet, prose writer, and polyglot

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10030">'''No-dig gardening''' is a non-cultivation method used by some [[organic gardener]]s. The origins of no-dig gardening are unclear, and may be based on pre-industrial or nineteenth-century farming techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodgardeners.org.uk/pages/1a_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] started his pioneering research work in this domain in 1938, and began publishing in the 1970s his Fukuokan philosophy of "[[Do Nothing Farming]]", which is now acknowledged by some as the tap root of the [[Permaculture]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiserearth.org/resource/view/6a7b3e6dbd425e5680fc76fb4678b7f9 Resource: The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming - WiserEarth]&lt;/ref&gt; Two pioneers of the method in the twentieth century included F. C. King, Head Gardener at Levens Hall, South Westmorland, in the Lake District of England, who wrote the book "Is Digging Necessary?" in 1946 and a gardener from Middlecliffe in the UK, A. Guest, who in 1948 published the book "Gardening Without Digging". The work of these gardeners was supported by the [[Good Gardeners Association]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodgardeners.org.uk/pages/1a_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; No-dig gardening was also promoted by Australian Esther Deans in the 1970s, and American gardener [[Ruth Stout]] advocated a "permanent" garden mulching technique in ''Gardening Without Work'' and no-dig methods in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2004-02-01/Ruth-Stouts-System.aspx Ruth Stouts permanent mulch system]&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique recognizes that micro- and macro-biotic organisms constitute a "[[soil life|food web]]" community in the soil, necessary for the healthy cycling of nutrients and prevention of problematic organisms and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.org/attra-pub/soilborne.html Soil Systems Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The plants transfer a portion of the carbon energy they produce to the soil, and microbes that benefit from this energy in turn convert available organic substances in the soil to the mineral elements the plants need to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2003-06-01/Building-Fertile-Soil.aspx Michael Rothman, Building Fertile Soil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically the reasons for [[Tillage|tilling]] the [[soil]] are to remove [[weed]]s, loosen and aerate the soil, and incorporate organic matter such as [[compost]] or [[manure]] into lower soil layers. In areas with thin soil and high erosion there is a strong case against digging, which argues that in the long term it can be detrimental to the [[food web]] in the fragile topsoil. While digging is an effective way of removing [[perennial plant|perennial]] weed roots, it also often causes seeds that can remain dormant for many decades to come to the surface and [[germination|germinate]].  The act of aerating the soil also increases the rate of decomposition and reduces [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref&gt;http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/management/management.html&lt;/ref&gt; Digging can also damage [[soil structure]], causing  [[Soil compaction|compaction]], and unbalance [[symbiotic]] and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] interactions among soil life. Digging tends to displace nutrients, shifting surface organic material deeper, where there is less oxygen to support the decomposition to plant-available nutrients, which then need to be otherwise replenished. Digging is practised traditionally in countries with old, deep, rich soils such as Western Europe, however traditionally there, this is followed by periodic [[crop rotation|resting of the soil]], usually with an undisturbed [[cover crop]].

==Methods==
[[File:Mandala permaculture.jpg|right|thumb]]
No-dig methods allow nature to carry out cultivation operations. Organic matter such as well rotted [[manure]], [[compost]], [[leaf mold]], [[spent mushroom compost]], old straw, etc., is added directly to the soil surface as a [[mulch]] at least 5-15&amp;nbsp;centimeters (2–6&amp;nbsp;in) deep, which is then incorporated by the actions of [[worm]]s, insects and microbes. Worms and other soil life also assist in building up the soil's structure, their tunnels providing aeration and [[Soil drainage|drainage]], and their excretions bind together soil crumbs. This natural biosphere maintains healthy conditions in the upper soil horizons where annual plant roots thrive.  No-dig systems are said{{According to whom|date=June 2017}} to be freer of [[Pest (animal)|pest]]s and [[Plant pathology|disease]],{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=June 2017}} possibly due to a more balanced soil population being allowed to build up in this undisturbed environment, and by encouraging the buildup of beneficial rather than harmful soil [[fungi]]. Moisture is also retained more efficiently under mulch than on the surface of bare earth, allowing slower percolation and less leaching of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/soilmgmt.html Preston Sullivan, NCAT Agriculture Specialist, ''Sustainable Soil Management'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another no-dig method is [[sheet mulching]] wherein a garden area is covered with wetted paper or cardboard, compost and topped off with landscape mulch.

A no-dig system is easier than digging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nortoncreekpress.com/gardening_without_work.html Ruth Stout, ''Gardening Without Work'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is a long term process, and is reliant upon having plentiful organic matter to provide mulch material. It is also helpful to remove any perennial weed roots from the area beforehand, although their hold can be weakened by applying a light-excluding surface layer such as large sheets of cardboard or several thicknesses of spread out newspaper before adding the compost mulch. The newspaper or cardboard should be thoroughly wet to help it lie flat and keep it from blowing away until the overlying material is added.

==Australia==
Esther Deans wrote the books ''No-Dig Gardening'' and ''Leaves of Life''. She actively travelled to teach about this gardening method, cooking and promoting raised gardens for those with special needs. She also taught about the necessity to maintain excellent water quality. Deans continued gardening until the age of 95. Around this time, Harper Collins publishers held a special honorary event for her in their Ryde offices as Esther had become Australia's most published author. As Deans grew older, she was assisted by Lucinda Bartram who helped her carry on the tradition of teaching no-dig gardening methods to others. Between the mid 1990s and 2009 Bartram, from Bondi and then Randwick, helped Deans reach the public and maintained the prolific 'no-dig' flowerbeds kept by Deans around her nursing apartment in the northern Sydney suburb of Waitara. The women shared many years co-teaching 'no-dig' gardening techniques to school children and freely sharing their knowledge together at garden fairs until 2009. 

Esther Deans inspired many famous gardeners, including [[Bill Mollison]] of the [[Permaculture|Permaculture Movement]], although she said "it is not quite how I would do it", implying she did not allow nature to take over, but retained formality with strict garden edges and more annuals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Gardens fashioned on Esther Deans' no dig gardening principles include Randwick Community Organic Garden (RCOG), Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

==UK==
Since 1982 [[Charles Dowding]] has been practising no dig in his market gardens, on areas ranging from a quarter to seven acres. He has written seven books on gardening organically and without digging, and gives regular talks and courses on the subject. His methods centre on using compost as a mulch, rather than unrotted organic matter which tends to accumulate slugs in the damp, British climate. He encourages gardeners to be adaptable in their approach, according to local soil, conditions and crops grown. His own speciality is salad leaves for sale to local outlets and the plants grow well in undisturbed soil.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

'''Olo{{okina}}upena Falls''', or '''Oloupena Falls''', is a waterfall located in the north-eastern part of [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Island]] of [[Molokai]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=747 Olo'upena Falls | World Waterfall Database: World's Tallest Waterfalls]&lt;/ref&gt; and is unofficially cited as the [[List of waterfalls by height|fourth highest]] waterfall in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-waterfalls.com/database.php?s=N&amp;t=H&amp;orderby=height&amp;sortLimit=300 World Waterfall Database: World's Tallest Waterfalls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023160017/http://www.world-waterfalls.com/database.php?s=N&amp;t=H&amp;orderby=height&amp;sortLimit=300 |date=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest in the [[United States]].

The falls occur where a short, seasonal stream spills over the edge of one of the tallest sea-side cliffs of the world, located between the Pelekunu and [[Wailau]] valleys. They have eroded a groove in the cliff-face and can be observed only from the ocean or air.

The ''' Os&amp;#x323;un River''' (sometimes, but rarely spelt Oshun) is a [[river]] that flows southwards through central [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]land in southwestern [[Nigeria]] into the [[Lagos]] Lagoon and the Atlantic Gulf of Guinea. It is one of the several rivers ascribed in local [[mythology]] to have been women who turned into flowing waters after some traumatic event frightened or angered them.

The river is named after the [[Oshun|Os&amp;#x323;un]] or Oshun, one of the most popular and venerated [[Orisha|Orishas]].&lt;ref name="Murrell2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrell|first1=Nathaniel Samuel|title=Afro-Caribbean Religions: An Introduction to Their Historical, Cultural, and Sacred Traditions|date=2009|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781439901755|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9h5KDRfZ-JgC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=oshun+orisha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS17Ppy7nNAhWEDMAKHcNYCy8Q6AEIIjAB#v=snippet&amp;q=oshun%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual traditional worship at the [[Osun-Osogbo|Ọs&amp;#x323;un Shrine]] near the Ọs&amp;#x323;un River at [[Osogbo]] has become a popular [[pilgrimage]] and important [[tourist]] [[Tourist_attraction|attraction]], drawing people from all over Nigeria and abroad to the annual [[festival]] in August.

Osun is one of the river goddesses in Yorubaland, she is noted for providing for the needs of the people. She was reputedly one of the wives of [[Shango|S&amp;#x323;ango]], the [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] god of thunder.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to [[China]]:

The '''[[People's Republic of China]]''' is the most extensive country in [[East Asia]] and [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|the third or fourth most extensive country in the world]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 8, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|title=China|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Area rank is disputed with the United States and is either ranked third or fourth. See [[List of countries and outlying territories by area]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;  With a population of over 1,300,000,000, it is the [[List of countries by population|most populous country in the world]].

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has led the PRC under a [[one-party state|one-party system]] since the state's establishment in 1949. The PRC is involved in a dispute over the [[political status of Taiwan]]. The CPC's rival during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), fled to [[Taiwan]] and [[list of islands of the Republic of China|surrounding islands]] after its defeat in 1949, claiming legitimacy over China, [[Mongolia]], and [[Tuva]] while it was the ruling power of the Republic of China (ROC). The term "[[Mainland China]]" is often used to denote the areas under PRC rule, but sometimes excludes its two [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]]s: [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

Because of its vast population, rapidly growing economy, and large research and development investments, China is considered an "[[Potential superpowers|emerging superpower]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/arb/article.php?article=693 |title=Review of "China: The Balance Sheet -- What the World Needs to Know Now About the Emerging Superpower" |accessdate=2007-12-24 |last=Gordon |first=Peter |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=The Asia Review of Books |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527001617/http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/arb/article.php?article=693 |archivedate=2012-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/sjir/6.1.03_miller.html |title=China an Emerging Superpower? |accessdate=2007-12-24 |last=Miller |first=Lyman |publisher=Stanford Journal of International Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second largest economy]] ([[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|second largest]] in terms of [[purchasing power parity]].)

This early 21st century example of [[land art]] was installed temporarily in the remote township of [[Parkfield, California|Parkfield]],&lt;ref&gt;Petray, Josh.[http://www.pasoroblespress.com/V2_news_articles.php?heading=0&amp;page=72&amp;story_id=2657 "Seismic Land Art Comes to Parkfield"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715050720/http://www.pasoroblespress.com/V2_news_articles.php?heading=0&amp;page=72&amp;story_id=2657 |date=15 July 2011 }}. ''Paso Robles Gazette'', 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Central California. A geologically interactive installation, this machine [[Earthworks (art)|earthwork]] operated autonomously for a total of 91 days between 18 August and 16 November 2008.

An [[earthquake shaking table]] was used in this seismic [[art intervention]] which was controlled by realtime reported Californian earthquakes detected by the [[US Geological Survey]] seismic monitoring network.

==Construction==
Rogers selected the location of Parkfield for its significance as the most densely monitored earthquake region in the world. [[USGS]] Seismologist Andy Micheal originally suggested the location. Parkfield is also the home of the USGS Parkfield Earthquake Experiment&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/index.php "Parkfield Earthquake Experiment"]. [[USGS]], 23 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ([[SAFOD]]). The region of Parkfield is located on the central section of the [[San Andreas Fault]].

The work consisted of installing a re-engineered earthquake shake table in a crudely excavated trench in a vacant field between the Parkfield Cafe and Parkfield [[CAL FIRE]] Station. Local contractors Frank Parlot and John Jamrog used a bulldozer and excavator to displace 125 cubic yards of earth on 9 June 2008 from the site.

Rogers originally intended to have the installation operational between 28 June and 28 September. Extreme hot weather, natural dust devils, software development and financial constraints pushed the system switch on date to 18 August 2008.

Software for the installation was developed by Dr. Geo Homsy (US), Stock Plum (NL), Mr. Snow (NZ), Andy Michael (USGS) and Peter Luka (US).

The installation was two years in planning, culminating in 77 days of assembly, and resulted in 91 days of continuous seismic data connectivity. The seismic interface control system was shut down on 16 November 2008. Eight days later the shake table was removed from site. Rogers and local landowner John Varian filled in the excavated trench and repatriated the site.

==Performance==
The ''Parkfield Interventional EQ Fieldwork'' was triggered by almost 4500 Californian seismic events. Individual event IDS were allocated and have been archived by USGS databases. 43000 [[webcam]] frames were disseminated live via the internet. 7,862,400 seconds (91 days) of analogue VCR video recording was collected.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Michael. [http://rt.airstrip.com.au/article/89/9345 "The Science-Art of Quakes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706100448/http://rt.airstrip.com.au/article/89/9345 |date=6 July 2011 }}. ''Real Time Arts'', Issue 89, February–March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation was extensively documented by filmmaker Christina McPhee along with a series of photographs with [[kite aerial photography]] produced by geologist and photographer Scott Haefner.

Influenced by the monumental and permanent land art earthworks&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, Don.[http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm "Monumental Land Art of the United States"]. DaringDesigns.com, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; of the early 1970s, the installation was a conceptual [[feedback]] loop between the seismic activity of California and the mechanical reflection of these frequent seismic events which controlled the earthquake shake table. Each time an earthquake occurred an array of 5/8&amp;nbsp;inch steel rods attached to the earthquake shake table oscillated and resonated.

Today in Parkfield there is very little evidence to suggest that this earthwork actually took place.

The '''Sierra Madre Oriental''' (&lt;small&gt;Spanish&lt;/small&gt; {{Audio-IPA|SierraMadreOrientalPronunciation.ogg|[ˈsjera ˈmaðɾe oɾjenˈtal]|}}) is a [[mountain range]] in northeastern [[Mexico]].  The Sierra Madre Oriental is part of the [[American Cordillera]], a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western "backbone" of [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]].

==Setting==
Spanning {{convert|1000|km|mi}} the Sierra Madre Oriental runs from the [[Rio Grande]] on the border between [[Coahuila]] and [[Texas]] south through [[Nuevo León]], southwest [[Tamaulipas]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Querétaro]], and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] to northern [[Puebla]], where it joins with the east-west running [[Eje Volcánico Transversal]] of central Mexico.  The northernmost are the [[Sierra del Burro]] and the [[Sierra del Carmen]] which reach the border with the United States at the Rio Grande. North of the Rio Grande, the range continues northwestward into Texas and beyond as the [[Davis Mountains|Davis]] and [[Guadalupe Mountains|Guadalupe]] Ranges.

Mexico's [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] lies to the east of the range, between the mountains and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. The [[Mexican Plateau]], which averages {{convert|1100|m|ft}} in elevation, lies between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] further west.

The climate of the Sierra Madre Oriental is drier than the rainforest areas further south.

==Ecology==
This long range of tall mountains is noted for its abundant [[biodiversity]] and large number of [[Endemism|endemic]] species of plants and wildlife, from the dry north to the wetter south. The [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]] are found at high elevations in the range ({{convert|1000|-|3500|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} above sea level).&lt;ref name="WWFPOF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=na0303 |name=Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the east, the [[Tamaulipan matorral]] occupies the range's lower slopes in Nuevo León and northern Tamaulipas, while the [[Veracruz moist forests]] cover the lower slopes of the central range, and the eastern slopes at the southern end of the range are home to the [[Veracruz montane forests]]. West of the range, the [[Mexican Plateau]] is home to [[deserts and xeric shrublands]], including the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] to the north, the [[Meseta Central matorral]] on the central part of the plateau, and the [[Central Mexican matorral]] on the southern plateau.

Much of the wildlife can also be found in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], which runs parallel to these mountains along western Mexico.

===Flora===
Pine-oak forests are dominated by several species of [[pine]], such as ''[[Pinus nelsonii]]'', ''[[Mexican Pinyon|P. cembroides]]'', ''[[Pinus pseudostrobus|P. pseudostrobus]]'', and ''[[Arizona Pine|P. arizonica]]'', and oak, such as ''[[Quercus castanea]]'' and ''[[Quercus affinis|Q. affinis]]''.&lt;ref name="WWFPOF"/&gt; Matorral is characterized by woody shrubs, small trees, [[Cactus|cacti]], and [[Succulent plant|succulents]]. Montane chaparral is found above {{convert|1700|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is home to species in the genera ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Arbutus]]'', ''[[Yucca]]'', ''[[Cercocarpus]]'' and ''[[Bauhinia]]''. Piedmont scrub occurs below {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is composed of plants {{convert|3|to|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height such as ''[[Helietta parvifolia]]'', ''[[Neopringlea integrifolia]]'' and ''[[Acacia]]'' spp.&lt;ref name="WWFTM"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=na1311 |name=Tamaulipan matorral |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canopy of moist forests is dominated by trees up to {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, including ''[[Brosimum alicastrum]]'', ''[[Manilkara zapota]]'', ''[[Celtis monoica]]'', ''[[Bursera simaruba]]'', ''[[Dendropanax arboreus]]'', and ''[[Sideroxylon capiri]]''.&lt;ref name="WWFVMF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0176 |name=Veracruz moist forests |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
Birds of the forest include the [[Mexican chickadee]], [[Montezuma quail]], [[Strickland's woodpecker]], [[zone-tailed hawk]] and several species of [[jay]].

Pine-oak forests in Coahuila are part of the migration route of monarch butterflies (''[[Monarch (butterfly)|Danaus plexippus]]'').&lt;ref name="WWFPOF"/&gt;

===Threats and conservation===
Original habitats have been severely reduced by clearance for [[livestock]] [[grazing]] and [[logging]] over hundreds of years. Protected areas include the [[Cumbres de Monterrey National Park]] in Mexico and the [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas. The [[El Cielo Biosphere]] in Tamaulipas preserves the northernmost tropical [[Veracruz moist forests]] in Mexico and extensive temperate [[cloud forests]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gomez Farias Region and El Cielo Biosphere Reserve", {{cite web |url=http://www.botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/ma9.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305003818/http://botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/ma/ma9.htm |archivedate=2015-03-05 |df= }}, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Slip-off slope diagram.svg|thumb|Schematic cross section of a meandering river channel showing slip-off slope formation]]

A '''slip-off slope''' is a depositional [[landform]] that occurs on the inside convex bank of a [[Meander|meandering river]]. The term can refer to two different features: one in a freely meandering river with a [[floodplain]] and the other in an [[entrenched river]].

== Freely Meandering Rivers ==
In a freely meandering river, a ''slip-off slope'' is characterized by a gentle slope composed of [[sand]] and [[pebble]]s on the inside convex bank of a meander loop, across the channel from a [[cut bank]] or river-cut cliff.&lt;ref name="SchefferOthers2015"&gt;Scheffers, A.M., May, S.M. and Kelletat, D.H., 2015. ''Forms by Flowing Water (Fluvial Features).'' In ''Landforms of the World with Google Earth.'' (pp. 183-244). Springer, Amsterdam, Netherlands. 391 pp. {{ISBN|978-94-017-9712-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As water in a meandering river travels around a bend, it moves in a secondary corkscrew-like flow as it travels downstream, in a pattern called [[helicoidal flow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/738624314|title=Encyclopedia of sediments &amp; sedimentary rocks|last=|first=|date=2003|work=|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|others=Middleton, Gerard V.|year=|isbn=9781402036095|location=Dordrecht|pages=432|chapter=Meandering Channels|oclc=738624314}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon causes increased water velocity in the outside bend of the meander, driving lateral [[bank erosion]]. It is also responsible for slower water velocity on the inner bend of the meander. This low velocity allows eroded [[sediment]]s from the cut bank side to be deposited on the inner bank. The deposition of material at the toe of a slip-off slope often results in the formation of a [[point bar]].&lt;ref name="Davis1913a" /&gt; Geologically, the environment in which a slip-off slope is deposited is considered to be one of low energy.

This continual process of erosion of the outer bank and deposition on the inside bank causes the migration of meanders and formation of [[oxbow lake]]s as the meander necks are narrowed and eventually cut through by the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/829159703|title=Fluvial processes in geomorphology|last=1915-2006.|first=Leopold, Luna B.

(John Preston), 1923-1961.|isbn=9780486139739|edition= Dover |location=New York|oclc=829159703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are low-lying, slip-off slopes are easily inundated during high water events, contributing to floodplain evolution in the middle and lower courses of a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NANSON|first=GERALD C.|date=February 1980|title=Point bar and floodplain formation of the meandering Beatton River, northeastern British Columbia, Canada|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1980.tb01155.x|journal=Sedimentology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–29|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1980.tb01155.x|issn=0037-0746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrenched Rivers ==

The ''slip-off slope'' of an entrenched meander is a gently sloping bedrock surface that rises from the inside, concave bank of an asymmetrically entrenched river. A thin, discontinuous layer of alluvium often covers this gently sloping bedrock surface. This type of slip-off slope is formed by the contemporaneous migration of a meander as a river cuts downward into bedrock.&lt;ref name="Davis1913a"&gt;Davis, W.M., 1913.

''Lateral activity in a river of northwestern Canada.'' ''The Journal of Geology'', 68(4), pp. 377-391.&lt;/ref&gt; A terrace on the slip-off slope of a meander spur, known as '''slip-off slope terrace''', can formed by a brief halt during the irregular incision by an actively meandering river.&lt;ref name="HerrmannOthers2014a"&gt;Herrmann, H. and Bucksch, H., 2014.

      <comment>/* Underworld figures */ adding zabbaniya. making iblis position clear. especially since it is an interpretation that sometimes appears in Islamic tradition, poetry and so on (although not essential for theological discourse). His fate during endtime is also not clear. (he can also be simply annihilated. otherwise he can be in hell currently such as shayatin and marid jinn during Ramazan.</comment>

The '''underworld''' is the world of the dead in various religious traditions, located below the world of the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/underworld |title=Underworld |work=The free dictionary |accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chthonic]] is the technical adjective for things of the underworld. 

The concept of an underworld is found in almost every civilization, and "may be as old as humanity itself".&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Loring Wallace, Jennie Hirsh, ''Contemporary Art and Classical Myth'' (2011), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Common features of underworld [[myth]]s are accounts of [[Katabasis#Trip into the underworld|living people making journeys to the underworld]], often for some [[Hero|heroic]] purpose. Other myths reinforce traditions that entrance of souls to the underworld requires a proper observation of ceremony, such as the ancient Greek story of the recently dead [[Patroclus]] haunting [[Achilles]] until his body could be properly buried for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe G. Edmonds, III, ''Myths of the Underworld Journey: Plato, Aristophanes, and the 'Orphic' Gold Tablets'' (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Persons having social status were dressed and equipped in order to better navigate the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Mills, ''Underworlds: Philosophies of the Unconscious from Psychoanalysis to Metaphysics'' (2014), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of mythologies incorporate the concept of the soul of the deceased making its own journey to the underworld, with the dead needing to be taken across a defining obstacle such as a lake or a river to reach this destination.&lt;ref&gt;Evans Lansing Smith, ''The Descent to the Underworld in Literature, Painting, and Film, 1895-1950'' (2001), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery of such journeys can be found in both ancient and modern art. The descent to the underworld has been described as "the single most important myth for Modernist authors".&lt;ref&gt;Evans Lansing Smith, ''The Descent to the Underworld in Literature, Painting, and Film, 1895-1950'' (2001), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States Coast Pilot''''' is a nine-volume American [[navigation]] publication distributed yearly by the Office of Coast Survey, a part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Ocean Service]].  The purpose of the publication is to supplement nautical charts of the waters of the [[United States]].

==Contents==

Each volume of the ''United States Coast Pilot'' contains comprehensive sections on local operational considerations and navigation regulations, with later chapters containing detailed discussions of coastal navigation; an appendix provides information on obtaining additional weather information, communications services, and other data.  An index and additional tables complete the volume.&lt;ref name="american"&gt;Text from the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'', Section 405, produced by the [[United States Government]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Information comes from field inspections, survey vessels, and various harbor authorities. Maritime officials and pilotage associations provide additional information. Each volume of ''Coast Pilot'' is updated regularly using the weekly [[United States Government]]{{'}}s weekly ''[[Notice to mariners#United States|Notice to Mariners]]''.&lt;ref name="american"/&gt;

''Coast Pilot'' volumes provide more detailed information than the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]-produced multi-volume ''[[Sailing Directions]]'' publication because ''Sailing Directions'' is intended exclusively for the oceangoing mariner.&lt;ref name="american"/&gt; 

==History==

Various charts and pilot books for [[North America]]n waters were published in [[England]] beginning in 1671, but the first book of sailing directions, charts, and other information for mariners in North American waters published in North America was the ''American Coast Pilot'', first produced by [[Edmund March Blunt|Edmund M. Blunt]] in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1796. In 1833, Blunt{{'}}s son Edmund E. Blunt accepted employment with the [[United States Coast Survey]], and this began a relationship between the Blunt family and the Coast Survey in which the Coast Survey provided [[hydrographic survey]] information to the Blunts for incorporation into the ''American Coast Pilot'' and the Blunts sold the Survey{{'}}s charts, while the Blunts served as influential allies of the Survey in defending the Survey against its critics and lobbying for funding of the Survey{{'}}s efforts.&lt;ref name="coastpilot"&gt;[http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/cp-history.html noaa.gov Theberge, Albert E., Captain, NOAA Corps, "The United States Coast Pilot – A Short History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than providing information to the Blunts for publication in the ''American Coast Pilot'' and charts for them to sell, the Coast Survey relied exclusively on articles published in local newspapers to provide its information to mariners. This began to change in 1858, when the Coast Survey{{'}}s [[George Davidson (geographer)|George Davidson]] adapted an article published in a [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], newspaper into an addendum to that year{{'}}s ''Annual Report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey''. It was the first time that the Coast Survey had published a mariner{{'}}s guide of any kind outside of a newspaper or the Blunts{{'}} ''American Coast Pilot'', and it is retrospectively considered the first example of what would later become the ''United States Coast Pilot''.&lt;ref name="coastpilot"/&gt;

Twenty-one editions of the ''American Coast Pilot'' had been published by the time George W. Blunt sold the [[copyright]] for the publication to the U.S. Government in 1867. Although by that time the ''American Coast Pilot'' already consisted almost entirely of public information produced by the Coast Survey anyway, the transaction placed responsibility for regular production of the publication with the Coast Survey for the first time. The publication existed under various names until 1888, when the name ''United States Coast Pilot'' was adopted for volumes covering navigation along the [[United States East Coast]] and [[United States Gulf Coast]]. Thirty years later, the name also began to be applied to volumes covering the [[United States West Coast]] and the [[Territory of Alaska]].&lt;ref name="coastpilot"/&gt;

The Coast Survey, known from 1878 as the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], continued to publish the ''Coast Pilot'' until it merged with other U.S. Government agencies to form the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) on 3 October 1970. The Office of Coast Survey in NOAA{{'}}s [[National Ocean Service]] has published them since then.

It borders [[Argentina]] to its west and [[Brazil]] to its north and east, with the [[Río de la Plata]] (River of Silver) to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Uruguay}}|,||}}/1e6 round 2}} million people,{{UN_Population|ref}} of whom 1.8 million live in the [[metropolitan area]] of its capital and largest city, [[Montevideo]].

Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in the early 18th century, signifying the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Spain, Portugal, and later Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics.

A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century, culminating in a [[1973 Uruguayan coup d'état|1973 coup]], which established a [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civic-military dictatorship]]. The military government persecuted leftists, socialists, and political opponents, resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of [[torture]] by the military; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985. Uruguay is today a [[democracy|democratic]] constitutional republic, with a president who serves as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;

The name of [[Uruguay River|the namesake river]] comes from the Spanish pronunciation of the regional [[Guarani languages|Guarani]] word for it. There are several interpretations, including "bird-river" ("the river of the ''{{lang|gn|urú}}''", via [[Charruan languages|Charruan]], ''{{lang|gn|urú}}'' being a [[common noun]] of any wild fowl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revista Del Río de La Plata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOexAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|page=285|quote=The word itself, "Uruguay," is clearly derived from the Guaraní, probably by way of the tribal dialect of the [[Charrúa]]s […] from ''uru'' (a generic designation of wild fowl)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nordenskiöld|first=Erland|authorlink=Erland Nordenskiöld|title=Deductions suggested by the geographical distribution of some post-Columbian words used by the Indians of S. America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaguAAAAYAAJ|year=1979|publisher=AMS Press|isbn=978-0-404-15145-4|page=27|quote=In Paraguay the Guaraní Indians call a fowl ''{{lang|gn|uruguaçú}}''. The [[Cainguá]] in Misiones only say ''{{lang|gn|urú}}''. […] A few Guaraní-speakiug Indians who call a hen ''{{lang|gn|uruguasu}}'' and a cock ''{{lang|gn|tacareo}}''. ''{{lang|gn|Uruguaçu}}'' means "the big ''{{lang|gn|uru}}''".}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name could also refer to a river snail called ''{{lang|gn|uruguá}}'' (''[[Pomella (gastropod)|Pomella]] megastoma'') that was plentiful in the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/101008/pciuda-520474/informe/presentan-tesis-del-nombre-uruguay/ |work=[[El País]] |title=Presentan tesis del nombre Uruguay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314100414/http://www.elpais.com.uy/101008/pciuda-520474/informe/presentan-tesis-del-nombre-uruguay/ |archive-date=14 March 2012 |lang=Spanish|access-date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish colonial times, and for some time thereafter, Uruguay and some neighbouring territories were called the [[Cisplatina]] and ''{{lang|es|[[Banda Oriental]] [del Uruguay]}}'' ("East Bank [of the Uruguay River]"), then for a few years the "Eastern Province". Since its independence, the country has been known as ''{{lang|es|la República Oriental del Uruguay}}'', which literally means "the eastern republic of the Uruguay [River]". However, it is commonly translated either as the "Oriental Republic of Uruguay"&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620116/Uruguay|title=Uruguay|accessdate=2 September 2008|year=2008|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "Eastern Republic of Uruguay".&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Republic of Uruguay" is the official name used in many [[United Nations]] publications in English, e.g. {{cite book|title=Treaty Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4bp3hF2DfMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA118|year=1991|publisher=UN Publications|isbn=978-92-1-900187-9}} &amp; in some formal UK documents, e.g. {{cite book|title=Agreement Between the European Community and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_34BywAACAAJ|year=1974|publisher=[[H.M.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Uruguay}}
The documented inhabitants of Uruguay before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of the area were the [[Charrúa]], a small tribe driven south by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]] of [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="dept-state"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2091.htm|title= Background Note: Uruguay|author=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}} It is estimated that there were about 9,000 Charrúa and 6,000 Chaná and Guaraní at the time of contact with Europeans in the 1500s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh1fdSd5n-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=uruguay+by+leslie+jermyn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq0c-GyczPAhUFoZQKHY9EAhIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Uruguay|first=Leslie|last=Jermyn|date=1 October 1998|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fructuoso Rivera - Uruguay's first president – organized the Charruas' genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprisma.co.uk/2011/03/28/uruguay-and-the-memory-of-the-charrua/|title=Uruguay and the memory of the Charrúa tribe – ThePrisma.co.uk|website=theprisma.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, the Spanish began to introduce cattle, which became a source of wealth in the region. The first permanent Spanish settlement was founded in 1624 at [[Villa Soriano|Soriano]] on the [[Río Negro (Uruguay)|Río Negro]]. In 1669–71, the Portuguese built a fort at [[Colonia del Sacramento]]. 

[[Montevideo]] was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold in the country. Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]]'s capital, [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; Uruguay's early 19th century history was shaped by ongoing fights for dominance in the [[La Plata Basin|Platine region]],&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; between British, Spanish, Portuguese and other colonial forces. In 1806 and 1807, the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires and Montevideo]] as part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Montevideo was occupied by a British force from February to September 1807.

===Independence struggle (1811–1830)===

[[File:Juan Manuel Blanes - El Juramento de los Treinta y Tres Orientales.jpg|thumb|250px|The oath of the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] by Uruguayan painter [[Juan Manuel Blanes]]]]

In 1811, [[José Gervasio Artigas]], who became Uruguay's national hero, launched a successful revolt against the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Spanish authorities]], defeating them on 18 May at the [[Battle of Las Piedras (1811)|Battle of Las Piedras]].&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt;

In 1813, the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism, demanding political and economic autonomy for each area, and for the [[Banda Oriental]] in particular.&lt;ref name="loc-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/3.htm|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE, 1811–30&amp;nbsp;– Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental, however, and Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism.&lt;ref name="loc-3"/&gt;

As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815.&lt;ref name="loc-3"/&gt; Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn, the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government.&lt;ref name="loc-3"/&gt; Artigas organized the [[Liga Federal|Federal League]] under his protection, consisting of six provinces, four of which later became part of Argentina.&lt;ref name="loc-3"/&gt;

In 1816, a force of 10,000 Portuguese troops invaded the Banda Oriental from Brazil; they took Montevideo in January 1817.&lt;ref name="loc-3"/&gt; After nearly four more years of struggle, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]] annexed the ''Banda Oriental'' as a province under the name of "[[Cisplatina]]".&lt;ref name="loc-3"/&gt; The [[Empire of Brazil|Brazilian Empire]] became independent of Portugal in 1822. In response to the annexation, the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]], led by [[Juan Antonio Lavalleja]], declared independence on 25 August 1825 supported by the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] (present-day Argentina).&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; This led to the 500-day-long [[Cisplatine War]]. Neither side gained the upper hand and in 1828 the [[Treaty of Montevideo (1828)|Treaty of Montevideo]], fostered by the United Kingdom through the diplomatic efforts of [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Viscount John Ponsonby]], gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state. 25 August is celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Uruguay|national holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.elobservador.com.uy/google-homenajea-uruguay-el-dia-la-independencia-n231109 |title=Google homenajea a Uruguay |date=25 August 2012 |work=[[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]] |access-date=23 August 2018 |language=es-uy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's [[Constitution of Uruguay|first constitution]] was adopted on 18 July 1830.&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt;

===Blancos–Colorados conflicts===
{{Further information|Uruguayan Civil War}}
[[File:Manuel Oribe por Rose.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manuel Oribe]], leader of Blancos]]

At the time of independence, Uruguay had an estimated population of just under 75,000.&lt;ref name="loc-5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/5.htm|title=BEGINNINGS OF INDEPENDENT LIFE, 1830–52&amp;nbsp;– Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era from independence until 1904 was marked by regular military conflicts and civil wars between the Blanco and Colorado Parties. The political scene in Uruguay became split between two parties: the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] (Whites) headed by the second President [[Manuel Oribe]], representing the agricultural interests of the countryside; and the liberal [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados]] (Reds) led by the first President [[Fructuoso Rivera]], representing the business interests of Montevideo. The Uruguayan parties received support from warring political factions in neighbouring [[Argentina]], which became involved in Uruguayan affairs.

The Colorados favored the exiled Argentine liberal [[Unitarian Party|Unitarios]], many of whom had taken refuge in Montevideo while the Blanco president Manuel Oribe was a close friend of the Argentine ruler [[Manuel de Rosas]]. On 15 June 1838, an army led by the Colorado leader Rivera overthrew President Oribe, who fled to Argentina.&lt;ref name="loc-5"/&gt; Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839. The conflict would last 13 years and become known as the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]] (the Great War).&lt;ref name="loc-5"/&gt;

In 1843, an Argentine army overran Uruguay on Oribe's behalf but failed to take the capital. The [[Uruguayan Civil War#The Great Siege|siege of Montevideo]], which began in February 1843, would last nine years.&lt;ref name="loc-6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/6.htm|title=The Great War, 1843–52 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The besieged Uruguayans called on resident foreigners for help, which led to a French and an Italian legion being formed, the latter led by the exiled [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].&lt;ref name="loc-6"/&gt;
[[File:Caseros.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Caseros]], 1852]]
In 1845, Britain and France intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region. Their efforts proved ineffective and, by 1849, tired of the war, both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas.&lt;ref name="loc-6"/&gt; It appeared that Montevideo would finally fall when an uprising against Rosas, led by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], governor of Argentina's [[Entre Ríos Province]], began. The Brazilian intervention in May 1851 on behalf of the Colorados, combined with the uprising, changed the situation and Oribe was defeated. The siege of Montevideo was lifted and the Guerra Grande finally came to an end.&lt;ref name="loc-6"/&gt; Montevideo rewarded Brazil's support by signing treaties that confirmed Brazil's right to intervene in Uruguay's internal affairs.&lt;ref name="loc-6"/&gt;

In accordance with the 1851 treaties, Brazil intervened militarily in Uruguay as often as it deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="loc-7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/7.htm|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL, 1852–75 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] was formed by the [[emperor of Brazil]], the [[president of Argentina]], and the Colorado general [[Venancio Flores]], the Uruguayan head of government whom they both had helped to gain power. The Triple Alliance declared war on the Paraguayan leader [[Francisco Solano López]]&lt;ref name="loc-7"/&gt; and the resulting [[Paraguayan War]] ended with the invasion of Paraguay and its defeat by the armies of the three countries. Montevideo, which was used as a supply station by the Brazilian navy, experienced a period of prosperity and relative calm during the war.&lt;ref name="loc-7"/&gt;

The constitutional government of General [[Lorenzo Batlle y Grau]] (1868–72) suppressed the [[Revolution of the Lances]] by the [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]].&lt;ref name="loc-9"/&gt; After two years of struggle, a peace agreement was signed in 1872 that gave the Blancos a share in the emoluments and functions of government, through control of four of the [[departments of Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="loc-9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/9.htm|title=Caudillos and Political Stability – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Tuyuti1.jpg|thumb|left|Uruguayan troops entrenched in the [[Battle of Tuyutí]], 1866]] This establishment of the policy of co-participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise, based on the coexistence of the party in power and the party in opposition.&lt;ref name="loc-9"/&gt;

Despite this agreement, Colorado rule was threatened by the failed Tricolor Revolution in 1875 and Revolution of the [[Quebracho, Uruguay|Quebracho]] in 1886.

The Colorado effort to reduce Blancos to only three departments caused a Blanco uprising of 1897, which ended with the creation of 16 departments, of which the Blancos now had control over six. Blancos were given ⅓ of seats in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=co-participation%20uruguay#v=onepage&amp;q=co-participation%20uruguay&amp;f=true|title=Authoritarian Regimes in Latin America: Dictators, Despots, and Tyrants|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This division of power lasted until the President [[Jose Batlle y Ordonez]] instituted his political reforms which caused the last uprising by Blancos in 1904 that ended with the [[Battle of Masoller]] and the death of Blanco leader [[Aparicio Saravia]].

Between 1875 and 1890, the military became the center of power.&lt;ref name="loc-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/10.htm|title=MODERN URUGUAY, 1875–1903 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this authoritarian period, the government took steps toward the organization of the country as a modern state, encouraging its economic and social transformation. Pressure groups (consisting mainly of businessmen, ''[[hacendado]]s'', and industrialists) were organized and had a strong influence on government.&lt;ref name="loc-10"/&gt; A transition period (1886–90) followed, during which politicians began recovering lost ground and some civilian participation in government occurred.&lt;ref name="loc-10"/&gt;

====Mass immigration and development====
{{Main article|Immigration to Uruguay}}
[[File:Idiarte borda.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Idiarte Borda]] (1844–1897), 17th [[President of Uruguay]] and the only one assassinated]]

After the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]], there was a sharp rise in the number of [[immigration|immigrants]], primarily from Italy and Spain. By 1879, the total population of the country was over 438,500.&lt;ref name="loc-8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/8.htm|title=Evolution of the Economy and Society – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy reflected a steep upswing (if demonstrated graphically, above all other related economic determinants), in livestock raising and exports.&lt;ref name="loc-8"/&gt; Montevideo became a major economic center of the region and an [[entrepôt]] for goods from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.&lt;ref name="loc-8"/&gt;

===20th century===
The Colorado leader [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]] was elected president in 1903.&lt;ref name="loc-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/12.htm|title=THE NEW COUNTRY, 1903–33 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Blancos led a rural revolt and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader, [[Aparicio Saravia]], was killed in battle. Government forces emerged victorious, leading to the end of the co-participation politics that had begun in 1872.&lt;ref name="loc-12"/&gt; [[José Batlle y Ordóñez|Batlle]] had two terms (1903–07 and 1911–15) during which, taking advantage of the nation's stability and growing economic prosperity, he instituted major reforms, such as a welfare program, government participation in many facets of the economy, and a plural executive.&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt;

[[Gabriel Terra]] became president in March 1931. His inauguration coincided with the effects of the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="loc-14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/14.htm|title=THE CONSERVATIVE ADJUSTMENT, 1931–43 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the social climate became tense as a result of the lack of jobs. There were confrontations in which police and leftists died.&lt;ref name="loc-14"/&gt; In 1933, Terra organized a coup d'état, dissolving the General Assembly and governing by decree.&lt;ref name="loc-14"/&gt; A new constitution was promulgated in 1934, transferring powers to the president.&lt;ref name="loc-14"/&gt; In general, the Terra government weakened or neutralized economic nationalism and social reform.&lt;ref name="loc-14"/&gt;

In 1938, general elections were held and Terra's brother-in-law, General [[Alfredo Baldomir]], was elected president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections, freedom of the press, and a new constitution.&lt;ref name="loc-15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/15.htm|title=Baldomir and the End of Dictatorship – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Baldomir declared Uruguay neutral in 1939, British warships and the German ship {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} fought [[Battle of the River Plate|a battle]] not far off Uruguay's coast.&lt;ref name="loc-15"/&gt; The ''Admiral Graf Spee'' took refuge in [[Montevideo]], claiming sanctuary in a neutral port, but was later ordered out.&lt;ref name="loc-15"/&gt;

In the late 1950s, partly because of a worldwide decrease in demand for Uruguyan agricultural products, Uruguayans suffered from a steep drop in their standard of living, which led to student militancy and labor unrest. An armed group, known as the [[Tupamaros]] emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank robbery, kidnapping and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government.

===Civic-military regime===
President [[Jorge Pacheco Areco|Jorge Pacheco]] declared a state of emergency in 1968, followed by a further suspension of civil liberties in 1972. In 1973, amid increasing economic and political turmoil, the armed forces, asked by the President [[Juan María Bordaberry]], closed the Congress and established a [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civilian-military regime]].&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; Uruguay actively participated in [[Operation Condor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dinges |first1=John |title=Operation Condor |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/chile/operation-condor.htm |website=latinamericanstudies.org |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 200 Uruguayans are known to have been killed and disappeared, with hundreds more illegally detained and tortured during the 12-year civil-military rule of 1973 to 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New find in Uruguay 'missing' dig|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4494286.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 February 2011|date=3 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were killed in Argentina and other neighboring countries, with 36 of them having been killed in Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uruguay dig finds 'disappeared'.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4485288.stm|quote=|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 February 2011|date=30 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to democracy (1984–present)====
[[File:Batlle1.jpg|thumb|left|Uruguayan president [[Jorge Batlle]] with former U.S. president [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2003]]

A new constitution, drafted by the military, was rejected in a November 1980 referendum.&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; Following the referendum, the armed forces announced a plan for the return to civilian rule, and national elections were held in 1984.&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] leader [[Julio María Sanguinetti]] won the presidency and served from 1985 to 1990. The first Sanguinetti administration implemented economic reforms and consolidated democracy following the country's years under military rule.&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt;

The National Party's [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]] won the 1989 presidential election and amnesty for human rights abusers was endorsed by referendum. Sanguinetti was then re-elected in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1229362.stm|title=Uruguay timeline|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both presidents continued the economic structural reforms initiated after the reinstatement of democracy and other important reforms were aimed at improving the electoral system, social security, education, and public safety.

The 1999 national elections were held under a new electoral system established by a 1996 constitutional amendment. Colorado Party candidate [[Jorge Batlle]], aided by the support of the National Party, defeated [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] candidate [[Tabaré Vázquez]]. The formal coalition ended in November 2002, when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet,&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; although the Blancos continued to support the Colorados on most issues. Low commodity prices and economic difficulties in Uruguay's main export markets (starting in Brazil with the devaluation of the [[Brazilian real|real]], then in [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentina in 2002]]), caused a severe recession; the economy contracted by 11%, unemployment climbed to 21%, and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty rose to over 30%.&lt;ref name="cong-r"/&gt;
[[File:Actividades conmemorativas de las Instrucciones Año XIII 22.jpg|thumbnail|Bicentennial celebrations in 2011. The image shows 500 school children from 19 schools across the country gathered at the Palacio Legislativo.]]
In 2004, Uruguayans elected Tabaré Vázquez as president, while giving the Broad Front a majority in both houses of Parliament. Vázquez stuck to economic orthodoxy. As commodity prices soared and the economy recovered from the recession, he tripled foreign investment, cut poverty and unemployment, cut public debt from 79% of GDP to 60%, and kept inflation steady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14700728|title=The mystery behind Mujica's mask|date=22 October 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[José Mujica]], a former left-wing militant who spent almost 15 years in prison during the country's military rule, emerged as the new President as the Broad Front won the election for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8385092.stm|title=Uruguay elects José Mujica as president, polls show|date=30 November 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 February 2011|first=Candace|last=Piette}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion in Uruguay|Abortion]] was legalized in 2012, followed by [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|same-sex marriage]] and [[Legality of cannabis in Uruguay|cannabis]] in the following year.

In 2014, [[Tabaré Vázquez]] was elected to a non-consecutive second presidential term, which began on 1 March 2015.

In November 2010, Uruguay ratified the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]], becoming the ninth nation out of twelve to do so.

{{Main article|Economy of Uruguay}}
Uruguay experienced a major economic and financial crisis between 1999 and 2002, principally a [[spillover effect]] from the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|economic problems of Argentina]].&lt;ref name="cong-r"/&gt; The economy contracted by 11%, and unemployment climbed to 21%.&lt;ref name="cong-r"/&gt; Despite the severity of the trade shocks, Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its [[investment-grade]] [[sovereign bond]] rating, one of only two in South America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gosouthamerica.about.com/library/blUrurfactpage.htm About.com: Go South America], based on information from the [[CIA World Factbook]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2011|10|03}}

In 2004, the Batlle government signed a three-year $1.1 billion stand-by arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), committing the country to a substantial [[primary surplus|primary fiscal surplus]], low inflation, considerable reductions in external debt, and several [[structural reforms]] designed to improve competitiveness and attract [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]].&lt;ref name="cong-r"/&gt; Uruguay terminated the agreement in 2006 following the early repayment of its debt but maintained a number of the policy commitments.&lt;ref name="cong-r"/&gt;

Vázquez, who assumed the government in March 2005, created the "Ministry of Social Development" and sought to reduce the country's poverty rate with a $240 million National Plan to Address the Social Emergency (PANES), which provided a monthly [[conditional cash transfer]] of approximately $75 to over 100,000 households in extreme poverty. In exchange, those receiving the benefits were required to participate in community work, ensure that their children attended school daily, and had regular health check-ups.&lt;ref name="cong-r"/&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{Main article|Agriculture in Uruguay}}
In 2010, Uruguay's export-oriented agricultural sector contributed to 9.3% of the GDP and employed 13% of the workforce.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Official statistics from Uruguay's Agriculture and Livestock Ministry indicate that meat and sheep farming in Uruguay occupies 59.6% of the land. The percentage further increases to 82.4% when cattle breeding is linked to other farm activities such as dairy, forage, and rotation with crops such as rice.&lt;ref name="mp-aigri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2007/07/30/uruguay-has-3-8-cattle-per-capita-highest-in-the-world|title=Uruguay has 3.8 cattle per capita, highest in the world|date=30 July 2007|publisher=MercoPress|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[FAOSTAT]], Uruguay is one of the world's largest producers of [[soybeans]] (9th), [[Scoured wool|greasy wool]] (12th), [[horse meat]] (14th), [[beeswax]] (14th), and [[quinces]] (17th). Most farms (25,500 out of 39,120) are family-managed; beef and wool represent the main activities and main source of income for 65% of them, followed by vegetable farming at 12%, dairy farming at 11%, [[Pig|hogs]] at 2%, and poultry also at 2%.&lt;ref name="mp-aigri"/&gt; Beef is the main export commodity of the country, totaling over $1 billion US dollars in 2006.&lt;ref name="mp-aigri"/&gt;

In 2007, Uruguay had cattle herds totalling 12 million head, making it the country with the highest number of cattle per capita at 3.8.&lt;ref name="mp-aigri"/&gt; However, 54% is in the hands of 11% of farmers, who have a minimum of 500 head. At the other extreme, 38% of farmers exploit small lots and have herds averaging below one hundred head.&lt;ref name="mp-aigri"/&gt;

===Tourism===
{{main article|Tourism in Uruguay}}
[[File:DSC08422.JPG|thumb|The city of [[Punta del Este]] is an important tourist destination.]]
The tourism industry in Uruguay is an important part of its economy. In 2012 the sector was estimated to account for 97,000 jobs and (directly and indirectly) 9% of GDP.&lt;ref name="uruguayxxi.gub.uy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uruguayxxi.gub.uy/invest/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/09/Tourism-Sector-Uruguay-XXI-2014.pdf |title=Uruguay XXI |publisher=Uruguay XXI |date= |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Puerta Ciudadela Colonia del Sacramento Fefo Bouvier.jpg|thumb|The historic colonial village of [[Colonia del Sacramento]]]]
In 2013 2.8 million tourists entered Uruguay, of whom 59% came from Argentina and 14% from Brazil, with Chileans, Paraguayans, North Americans and Europeans accounting for most of the remainder.&lt;ref name="uruguayxxi.gub.uy"/&gt;

Cultural experiences in Uruguay include exploring the country's colonial heritage, as found in [[Colonia del Sacramento]]. Montevideo, the country's capital, houses the most diverse selection of cultural activities. Historical monuments such as [[Torres Garcia Museum]] as well as [[Estadio Centenario]], which housed the first world cup in history, are examples. However simply walking the streets allows tourists to experience the city's colorful culture.

One of the main natural attractions in Uruguay is [[Punta del Este]]. Punta del Este is situated on a small peninsula off the southeast coast of Uruguay.

[[Road surface|Surfaced]] roads connect Montevideo to the other urban centers in the country, the main highways leading to the border and neighboring cities. Numerous unpaved roads connect farms and small towns.

===Telecommunications===
{{Main article|Communications in Uruguay}}

The Telecommunications industry, in Uruguay, is more developed than in most other Latin American countries, being the first country in the Americas to achieve complete digital telephony coverage in 1997. The telephone system is completely digitized and has very good coverage over all the country. The system is government owned, and there have been controversial proposals to partially privatize since the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The mobile phone market is shared by the state-owned [[ANTEL]] and two private companies, [[Movistar]] and [[Claro Americas|Claro]].

{{Further information|Uruguayan people|Demographics of Uruguay|Spanish Uruguayan|Italian Uruguayan}}

Uruguayans are of predominantly European origin, with over 87.7% of the population claiming [[European ethnic groups|European descent]] in the 2011 census.&lt;ref name=enha_asc/&gt;
Most Uruguayans of European ancestry are descendants of 19th and 20th century immigrants from Spain and Italy (about one-quarter of the population is of Italian origin),&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; and to a lesser degree France, Germany and Britain.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Earlier settlers had migrated from Argentina.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; People of African descent make up an even smaller proportion of the total.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

From 1963 to 1985, an estimated 320,000 Uruguayans emigrated.&lt;ref name="loc-30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/30.htm|title=Population – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular destinations for Uruguayan emigrants are Argentina, followed by the United States, Australia, Canada, Spain, Italy and France.&lt;ref name="loc-30"/&gt; In 2009, for the first time in 44 years, the country saw an overall positive influx when comparing immigration to emigration. 3,825 residence permits were awarded in 2009, compared with 1,216 in 2005.&lt;ref name="bbc-secret"/&gt; 50% of new legal residents come from Argentina and Brazil. A migration law passed in 2008 gives immigrants the same rights and opportunities that nationals have, with the requisite of proving a monthly income of $650.&lt;ref name="bbc-secret"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11397130|title=Uruguay: South America's best-kept secret?|date=3 October 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay's rate of population growth is much lower than in other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Its median age is higher than the global average&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; due to its low birth rate, high life expectancy, and relatively high rate of emigration among younger people. A quarter of the population is less than 15 years old and about a sixth are aged 60 and older.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Metropolitan Montevideo is the only large city, with around 1.9 million inhabitants, or more than half the country's total population. The rest of the urban population lives in about 30 towns.&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt;

A 2017 [[Inter-American Development Bank|IADB]] report on labor conditions for Latin American nations, ranked Uruguay as the region's leader overall and in all but one subindexes, including gender, age, income, formality and labor participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Jobs|url=https://mejorestrabajos.iadb.org/en|publisher=IADB|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay has no official religion; church and state are officially separated,&lt;ref name="dept-state"/&gt; and [[religious freedom]] is guaranteed. A 2008 survey by the INE of Uruguay showed Catholicism as the main religion, with 45.7% of the population; 9.0% are non-Catholic Christians, 0.6% are [[Animists]] or [[Umbanda|Umbandists]] (an [[Afro-Brazilian]] religion), and 0.4% Jewish. 30.1% reported believing in a god, but not belonging to any religion, while 14% were [[atheist]] or [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name="ine-rel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gub.uy/anda/ddibrowser/?id=11&amp;section=variable&amp;varid=V157 |title=Encuesta Continua de Hogares 2008 – Religion |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística |accessdate=2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114015256/http://www.ine.gub.uy/anda/ddibrowser/?id=11&amp;section=variable&amp;varid=V157 |archivedate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the sizeable [[Armenians in Uruguay|Armenian]] community in Montevideo, the dominant religion is Christianity, specifically [[Armenian Apostolic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1/0 Technology Corp. – Paul R.

The small numbers of Uruguay's indigenous peoples and their fierce resistance to proselytism reduced the influence of the ecclesiastical authorities.&lt;ref name="rel-cs"/&gt;

After independence, [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] ideas spread to Uruguay, particularly from France, further eroding the influence of the church.&lt;ref name=government&gt;{{cite web|title=Explore Uruguay – About Uruguay Government|url=http://www.explore-uruguay.com/uruguay-government.html|publisher=Explore Uruguay|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837 civil marriage was recognized, and in 1861 the state took over the running of public cemeteries.

Uruguay's capital has 12 synagogues, and a community of 20,000 Jews by 2011. With a peak of 50,000 during the mid-1960s, Uruguay has the world’s highest rate of [[aliyah]] as a percentage of the Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/135932/touring-montevideo-s-jewish-quarters/|title=Touring Montevideo’s Jewish Quarters|publisher=Forward.com|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Main article|Rioplatense Spanish}}
[[Uruguayan Spanish]] has some modifications due to the considerable number of [[Italian Uruguayan|Italian immigrants]]. Immigrants used to speak a mixture of Spanish and Italian known as '[[cocoliche]]' and some of the words are still commonly used by the population. As is the case with neighboring Argentina, Uruguay employs both [[voseo]] and [[yeísmo]] (with {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}). English is common in the business world and its study has risen significantly in recent years, especially among the young. [[Uruguayan Portuguese]] is spoken as a native language by 15% of the Uruguayan population, in northern regions near the Brazilian border,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pgl.gal/situacao-atual-do-portugues-do-uruguai/ The Portuguese Dialect of Uruguay (DPU) is spoken by circa 15% of the Uruguayan population according to Juan Pedro Mir, director of education of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the country]. pgl.gal (19 August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; making it the second most spoken language of the country.

Another spoken dialect was the [[Patois]], which was a mixture of French and Italian. The dialect was spoken mainly in the [[Colonia Department]], where the first pilgrims settled, in the city called [[La Paz (Colonia)]]. Today it is considered a dead tongue, although some elders at the aforementioned location still practice it. There are still written tracts of the language in the [[Waldensians]] Library (Biblioteca Valdense) in the town of [[Colonia Valdense]], [[Colonia Department]].
[[Patois]] speakers arrived to Uruguay from the [[Piedmont]]. Originally they were Vaudois, who become [[Waldensians]], giving their name to the city Colonia Valdense, which translated from the Spanish means "Waldensian Colony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dedicaciontotal.udelar.edu.uy/adjuntos/produccion/742_academicas__academicaarchivo.pdf |title=Etnicidad y Lenguaje – La aculturación socio lingüística de los inmigrantes italianos en Montevideo |author=Graciela Barrios |publisher=Departamento de Publicaciones de la Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educación Universidad de la República |date=2008 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main article|Education in Uruguay}}
[[File:Facultad de Medicina, Montevideo 25.jpg|thumb|Faculty of medicine of the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|University of the Republic]], founded in 1849]]
[[Education in Uruguay]] is [[secularism|secular]], free,&lt;ref name="UNASEP"/&gt; and compulsory for 14 years, starting at the age of 4.&lt;ref name="iadb"/&gt; The system is divided into six levels of education: early childhood (3–5 years); primary (6–11 years); basic secondary (12–14 years); upper secondary (15–17 years); higher education (18 and up); and post-graduate education.&lt;ref name="iadb"&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/document.cfm?id=35521105 Uruguay, Secondary and technical education and teacher training support program] [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (pp. 7–8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public education is the primary responsibility of three institutions: the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Uruguay)|Ministry of Education and Culture]], which coordinates education policies, the [[National Public Education Administration]], which formulates and implements policies on early to secondary education, and the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|University of the Republic]], responsible for higher education.&lt;ref name="iadb"/&gt; In 2009, the government planned to invest 4.5% of GDP in education.&lt;ref name="UNASEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conuruyork.org/Comercial/Invest%20in%20Uruguay%20-%20UnASeP%20.pdf |title=Invest in Uruguay — Unidad de Apoyo al Sector Privado |page=24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174825/http://www.conuruyork.org/Comercial/Invest%20in%20Uruguay%20-%20UnASeP%20.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2016 |format=PDF |access-date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay ranks high on standardised tests such as [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] at a regional level, but compares unfavourably to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] average, and is also below some countries with similar levels of income.&lt;ref name="UNASEP"/&gt; In the 2006 PISA test, Uruguay had one of the greatest [[standard deviation]]s among schools, suggesting significant variability by socio-economic level.&lt;ref name="UNASEP"/&gt;

Uruguay is part of the [[One Laptop per Child]] project, and in 2009 became the first country in the world to provide a laptop for every primary school student,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/10/18/uruguay-becomes-first-nation-to-provide-a-laptop-for-every-prima/|title=Uruguay becomes first nation to provide a laptop for every primary school student|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Plan Ceibal]].&lt;ref name="olpc-bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8309583.stm|title=Laptop for every pupil in Uruguay|date= 16 October 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 February 2011|first=Verónica|last=Psetizki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the 2007–2009 period, 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers were involved in the scheme; around 70% of the laptops were given to children who did not have computers at home.&lt;ref name="olpc-bbc"/&gt; The OLPC programme represents less than 5% of the country's education budget.&lt;ref name="olpc-bbc"/&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main article|Culture of Uruguay}}
Uruguayan culture is strongly European and its influences from southern Europe are particularly important.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The tradition of the [[gaucho]] has been an important element in the art and folklore of both Uruguay and Argentina.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Visual arts===
[[File:Casapueblo.jpg|thumb|A "livable sculpture", [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]]'s [[Casapueblo]] was his home, hotel and museum.]]
A prominent exponent of Uruguayan art was abstract painter and sculptor [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]]. He drew from both [[Timbuktu]] and [[Mykonos]] to create his best-known work: his home, hotel and [[atelier]] [[Casapueblo]] near [[Punta del Este]]. Casapueblo is a "livable sculpture" and draws thousands of visitors from around the world. The 19th-century painter [[Juan Manuel Blanes]], whose works depict historical events, was the first Uruguayan artist to gain widespread recognition.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The [[Post-Impressionist]] painter [[Pedro Figari]] achieved international renown for his pastel studies of subjects in Montevideo and the countryside. Blending elements of art and nature the work of the landscape architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Leandro Silva Delgado|es}} has also earned international prominence.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Uruguay has a small but growing film industry, and movies such as ''[[Whisky (film)|Whisky]]'' by [[Juan Pablo Rebella]] and [[Pablo Stoll]] (2004), [[Marcelo Bertalmío]]'s ''Los días con Ana'' (2000; "Days with Ana") and [[Ana Díez]]'s ''[[Paisito]]'' (2008), about the 1973 military coup, have earned international honours.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The folk and popular music of Uruguay shares not only its [[gaucho]] roots with [[Argentina]], but also those of the [[tango (music)|tango]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; One of the most famous tangos, "[[La cumparsita]]" (1917), was written by the Uruguayan composer [[Gerardo Matos Rodríguez]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The [[candombe]] is a folk dance performed at [[Carnival]], especially [[Uruguayan Carnival]], mainly by Uruguayans of African ancestry.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The guitar is the preferred musical instrument, and in a popular traditional contest called the ''payada'' two singers, each with a guitar, take turns improvising verses to the same tune.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Folk music is called [[canto popular]] and includes some guitar players and singers such as [[Alfredo Zitarrosa]], [[José Carbajal (Uruguayan musician)|José Carbajal "El Sabalero"]], [[Daniel Viglietti]], [[Los Olimareños]], and [[Numa Moraes]].

Numerous radio stations and musical events reflect the popularity of rock music and the Caribbean genres, known as ''música tropical'' ("tropical music").&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Early classical music in Uruguay showed heavy Spanish and Italian influence, but since the 20th century a number of composers of classical music, including [[Eduardo Fabini]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Vicente Ascone|es}}, and [[Héctor Tosar]], have made use of Latin American musical idioms.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[Tango]] has also affected Uruguayan culture, especially during the 20th century, particularly the '30s and '40s with Uruguayan singers such as [[Julio Sosa]] from [[Las Piedras, Uruguay|Las Piedras]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A |title=Argentina, Uruguay bury hatchet to snatch tango honor |last=Termine |first=Laura |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |location=Buenos Aires |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011083629/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A |archivedate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the famous tango singer [[Carlos Gardel]] was 29 years old he changed his nationality to be Uruguayan, saying he was born in [[Tacuarembó]], but this subterfuge was probably done to keep French authorities from arresting him for failing to register in the French Army for [[World War I]]. Gardel was born in France and was raised in Buenos Aires.

[[Rock and roll]] first broke into Uruguayan audiences with the arrival of [[the Beatles]] and other British bands in the early 1960s. A wave of bands appeared in Montevideo, including [[Los Shakers]], [[Los Mockers]], [[Los Iracundos]], [[Los Moonlights]], and [[Los Malditos]], who became major figures in the so-called [[Uruguayan Invasion]] of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/jeanette_d/2009/10/03/are_you_ready_for_the_uruguayan_invasion |title=Are You Ready For the Uruguayan Invasion? |work=Salon |date=5 October 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011050622/http://open.salon.com/blog/jeanette_d/2009/10/03/are_you_ready_for_the_uruguayan_invasion |archivedate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular bands of the Uruguayan Invasion sang in English.

Popular Uruguayan rock bands include [[La Vela Puerca]], [[No Te Va Gustar]], [[El Cuarteto de Nos]], [[Once Tiros]], [[La Trampa]], [[Chalamadre]], [[Snake (band)|Snake]], [[Buitres]], and [[Cursi]]. In 2004, the Uruguayan musician and actor [[Jorge Drexler]] won an Academy Award for composing the song "[[Al otro lado del río]]" from the movie ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', which narrated the life of [[Che Guevara]].

===Literature===
{{Main article|Uruguayan literature}}
[[File:José Enrique Rodó.jpg|thumb|[[José Enrique Rodó]]]]
[[José Enrique Rodó]] (1871–1917), a modernist, is considered Uruguay's most significant literary figure.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His book ''Ariel'' (1900) deals with the need to maintain [[spirituality|spiritual]] values while pursuing material and technical progress.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Besides stressing the importance of upholding spiritual over materialistic values, it also stresses resisting cultural dominance by Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The book continues to influence young writers.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Notable amongst Latin American playwrights is [[Florencio Sánchez]] (1875–1910), who wrote plays about contemporary social problems that are still performed today.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

From about the same period came the romantic poetry of [[Juan Zorrilla de San Martín]] (1855–1931), who wrote epic poems about [[History of Uruguay|Uruguayan history]]. Also notable are [[Juana de Ibarbourou]] (1895–1979), [[Delmira Agustini]] (1866–1914), [[Idea Vilariño]] (1920–2009), and the short stories of [[Horacio Quiroga]] and [[Juan José Morosoli]] (1899–1959).&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The psychological stories of [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] (such as "No Man's Land" and "The Shipyard") have earned widespread critical praise, as have the writings of [[Mario Benedetti]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Uruguay's best-known contemporary writer is [[Eduardo Galeano]], author of ''Las venas abiertas de América Latina'' (1971; "[[Open Veins of Latin America]]") and the trilogy ''Memoria del fuego'' (1982–87; "Memory of Fire").&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Other modern Uruguayan writers include Mario Levrero, Sylvia Lago, [[Jorge Majfud]], and [[Jesús Moraes]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Uruguayans of many classes and backgrounds enjoy reading ''historietas'', comic books that often blend humour and fantasy with thinly veiled social criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Media===
The [[Reporters Without Borders]] worldwide press freedom index has ranked Uruguay as 37th of 178 reported countries in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721221055/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010%2C1034.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |title=Press Freedom Index 2010 |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |accessdate=25 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of speech and media are guaranteed by the constitution, with qualifications for inciting violence or "insulting the nation".&lt;ref name="BBC-profile"/&gt; Uruguayans have access to more than 100 private daily and weekly newspapers, more than 100 radio stations, and some 20 terrestrial television channels, and cable TV is widely available.&lt;ref name="BBC-profile"/&gt;

Uruguay's long tradition of freedom of the press was severely curtailed during the years of military dictatorship. On his first day in office in March 1985, Sanguinetti re-established complete freedom of the press.&lt;ref name="loc-80"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/80.htm|title=The Media – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Montevideo's newspapers, which account for all of Uruguay's principal daily newspapers, greatly expanded their circulations.&lt;ref name="loc-80"/&gt;

State-run radio and TV are operated by the official broadcasting service [[SODRE]].&lt;ref name="BBC-profile"/&gt; Some newspapers are owned by, or linked to, the main political parties.&lt;ref name="BBC-profile"/&gt; ''[[El Día (Uruguay)|El Día]]'' was the nation's most prestigious paper until its demise in the early 1990s, founded in 1886 by the Colorado party leader and (later) president José Batlle y Ordóñez. ''[[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]'', the paper of the rival Blanco Party, has the largest circulation.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; ''[[Búsqueda]]'' is Uruguay's most important weekly news magazine and serves as an important forum for political and economic analysis.&lt;ref name="loc-80"/&gt; Although it sells only about 16,000 copies a week, its estimated readership exceeds 50,000.&lt;ref name="loc-80"/&gt; ''[[MercoPress]]'' is an independent news agency focusing on news related to [[Mercosur]] and is based in Montevideo.&lt;ref name="about-mp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/about-mercopress|title=About MercoPress|publisher=MercoPress|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uruguay national football team]] has won the [[FIFA World Cup]] on two occasions. Uruguay won the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural tournament]] on home soil in 1930 and again in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|famously defeating]] home favourites [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the final match.&lt;ref name="givefb"/&gt; Uruguay has won the [[Copa América]] (an international tournament for South American nations and guests) more than any other country, their victory in 2011 making a total of 15 Copa Américas won. Uruguay has by far the smallest population of any country that has won a World Cup.&lt;ref name="givefb"&gt;{{citation |title=The smallest country to win the World Cup have big ambitions again |publisher=Give Me Football }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their early success, they missed three World Cups in four attempts from 1994 to 2006.&lt;ref name="givefb"/&gt; Uruguay performed very creditably in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], having reached the semi-final for the first time in 40 years.

FIFA.com. Retrieved on 25 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay exported 1,414 football players during the 2000s, almost as many players as Brazil and Argentina.&lt;ref name="pl-exp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2011/01/06/uruguay-exported-1.414-football-players-in-the-last-decade |title= Uruguay "exported" 1.414 football players in the last decade |date=6 January 2011 |publisher= MercoPress |accessdate= 23 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Uruguayan government enacted measures intended to retain players in the country.&lt;ref name="pl-exp"/&gt;

Football was taken to Uruguay by English sailors and labourers in the late 19th century. Less successfully, they introduced [[Rugby union|rugby]] and [[cricket]]. There are two Montevideo-based football clubs, [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] and [[Peñarol]], who are successful in domestic and South American tournaments and have won three Intercontinental Cups each.

Besides football, the most popular sport in Uruguay is basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.explore-uruguay.com/uruguay-sports.html#.WaO8SNFpzct |title= Top Uruguay Sports |date= 28 August 2017 |publisher= Explore Uruguay |accessdate= 28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Uruguay national basketball team|national team]] qualified for the [[Basketball World Cup]] 7 times, more often than other countries in South America, except [[Brazil national basketball team|Brazil]] and [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]]. Uruguay hosted the official [[Basketball World Cup]] for the [[1967 FIBA World Championship]] and the official [[Americas Basketball Championship ]] in [[1988 Tournament of the Americas|1988]], [[1997 Tournament of the Americas|1997]] and is a host of the [[2017 FIBA AmeriCup]].

A '''village perché''' is a village perched at the top of a [[topographic relief|relief]], most commonly found in France. Naturally difficult to access, often with ramparts, 'villages perchés' are for the most part fortified settlements dating from the [[Middle Ages]].  Many are located in the south-east of France in the present [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] region, this type of habitat considered typical of [[Provence]]. The villages, situated on their "rocky acropolis", have retained their medieval appearance, from the orientation of the facades of their houses - towards the valley or the road of communication - a true front of fortification.&lt;ref name=Benoit&gt;Benoit, F. (1975). ''La Provence et le Comtat Venaissin, Arts et traditions populaires.'' Aubanel, Avignon. {{ISBN|2-7006-0061-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fernand Benoit emphasizes their occasional prehistoric origin by pointing out that [[Cicero]], in reference to the Ligurians who inhabited the region, called them ''castellani'', inhabitants of the castellas (Brutus, LXXIII, 256).

==Location==
[[File:Gordes pano.jpg|thumb|[[Gordes]]]]
'Villages perchés' are found mainly in hilly areas where soil is poor and water scarce. This is generally case in Provence except in the lower Rhone valley and in the Durance valley, where alluvial land abounds and water is easily accessible from a well dug in the courtyard of the house.&lt;ref name=Benoit/&gt; 
Moreover, this grouping in a community closed in on itself corresponds to regions of small properties, where the only fertile lands are situated at the bottom of a few valleys, and this aggregation has facilitated the existence of rural handicraft indispensable to the villagers. Conversely, the dispersed habitat implies larger, wealthier estates, hence the aphorism penned by Fernand Benoit: "Poverty concentrates the habitat, wealth disperses it".&lt;ref name=Benoit/&gt;

==House type==
[[File:Bonnieux-2.JPG|thumb|A house at [[Bonnieux]]]] 
There is a specific habitat type that is linked to the village perché: the 'high house'. Benoit explains that "its originality consists in placing the beasts below, man above."  The building is subdivided into a barn on the ground floor, housing on one or two floors, and an attic.  It was the type of house reserved for the peasant villagers who had little livestock to accommodate. It is still found today in a number of mountainous massifs of western Provence, including the Alps valleys of Bléone and Haut Verdon, in the mountain of Lure where it is common in Banon, Cruis, Saint-Étienne-les-Orgues and Sigonce. 
Most of these houses date from the 16th century, when the religious wars forced the populace to hide behind the village fortifications. When the wars were over, there was a drift to the periphery of the agglomeration and "houses on land", more able to accommodate annexed buildings.&lt;ref name=Benoit/&gt;

Indeed, this type of dwelling, gathering people and animals in a village, could only remain frozen in time, any extension being impossible except vertically.  Their architecture is therefore characteristic: a narrow facade with one or two windows, and an elevation not exceeding four to five floors, including attic with its outer pulley to hoist the forage.  Currently, the only possible transformations - these houses having lost their agricultural status - are to install a garage on the ground floor and create new rooms in the attic.  For those houses restored with taste, the floor of the habitation is reached by a staircase joined to the facade. The presence of terrace or balcony was constant. The terrace was used primarily for the drying of fruit and vegetables suspended from a wire called a 'trihard' when forming a trellis that covered a rustic [[pergola]].  Where it formed a [[loggia]], columns supporting a canopy covered with tiles, it was called a 'galarié' or 'soulerie'.&lt;ref name=Benoit/&gt;

The '''Yakurr''' (also Yakö and Yakạạ) live in five compact towns in [[Cross River State]],&lt;ref&gt;Obono (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigeria]]. They were formally known as Umor, Ekoli, Ilomi, Nkoibolokom and Yakurr be Ibe.  Due to linguistic problems encountered by the early [[Europe]]an visitors, the settlements have come to be known by their mispronounced versions – [[Ugep]], [[Ekori]], [[Idomi]], Nko and [[Mkpani]] (Okoi-Uyouyo, 2002).  In the latter, it is a product of ''yakpanikpani'' (a Lokạạ word for "tricks"), a name, which Enang (1980) says was given to them by the Ugep people after being tricked in a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yakurrreporters.com''Yakurr News'' Latest info about Yakurr People.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territory==
{{further|Yakurr Local Government}}
Yakurr people are predominantly found in territories that lies between latitudes 50 401 and 60 101 north of the equator and longitudes 80 21 and 60 101 east of the [[Greenwich Meridian]] and {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Calabar]], the capital of Cross River State. They are found in the present-day [[Yakurr Local Government Area]] and constitute the largest ethnic group in the state. They share their northern and eastern boundaries with the Assiga, Nyima and Agoi Clans of the Yakurr Local Government Area, the southern boundary with the Biase Local Government Area and their western boundary with the [[Abi Local Government Area]].

By 1935, Yakurr had a population of 22,000 and 38,000 by 1953 (1939, 1950, and 1964; Hansford ''et al.'' 1976; and Crabb 1969).  The population numbers of Yakurr based on the 1991 national census were rejected by the local and state government due to discrepancies. The results of the 2006 census by the Nigerian government about the current population are still pending.{{When|date=April 2016}}

==Origins==
The language spoken by the Yakurr is '''[[Lokaa language|Lokạạ]]''', an [[Upper Cross River language]]. It is described by Iwara (1988) as one of the major languages of Cross River State, comparable, in terms of number of speakers, with [[Efik language|Efik]], which enjoys the special status of a lingua franca in the state. According to Ethnologue, it was spoken by 120.000 people in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=yaz|title=Lokaa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yakurr exhibits a very high degree of social heterogeneity, but linguistic, political, religious and cultural homogeneity. In the absence of written records, linguistic, political, religious and cultural homogeneous patterns are the most dependable evidences of establishing descent and biological connections.

All Yakurr people share a common tradition of overland migration and ancestry. The ancestral homeland of the Yakurr people is "Akpa", said to be a shortened form of "Lẹkanakpakpa". This area is believed to correspond with the Cameroon–Obudu range as it stands today. The Yakurr cites the Okuni, Nsofan and Ojo people as their neighbours at Lẹkanakpakpa. The traditions of Okuni, Nsofan and Ojo corroborate the Yakurr claim of having lived together at Lẹkanakpakpa, which is referred to as “Onugi” by the Okuni and Nsofan people and Lẹkpamkpa by the Ojo people.

The migration of Yakurr from their ancestral homeland started at about AD 1617, when a misunderstanding between the Yakurr and their neighbours, arising from the violation of a burial custom forced their neighbours to wage a war against them, leading to them being driven from their homeland.

The migratory history of the Yakurr people, as given by Ubi (1986 and 1978) is that, between 1617 and 1677, the Yakurr migrated from that ancestral homeland to look for a new homeland following a military defeat from Akpa. About A.D. 1660, some Yakurr migrants founded new homelands in their present locations. These locations are Idomi and Ugep. Between 1677 and 1707, some other Yakurr migrants founded the towns of Ekori and Nko. Between 1707 and 1737 yet another wave of Yakurr migrants founded Mkpani settlement.

The reasons for the relocation of populations in new settlements by the Yakurr is mainly due to competing demands for land resources, as a result of growing populations in one hand and unresolved conflicts in the other. This development is aided by the patrilocality of marriages and strong patriarchy in the family system. It was thus easy for patriclans to relocate to new settlements. This has produced a slight parallelism in names of patriclans and strong parallelism in names of matriclans in all the Yakurr settlements.
