The '''AN/SPQ-11 Cobra Judy''' was a [[passive electronically scanned array|PESA]] radar found on the {{USNS|Observation Island|T-AGM-23}} missile range instrumentation ship.

It was used for space tracking, ballistic missiles tracking and other instrumentation. Cobra Judy was the sea component of the COBRA program{{what|date=May 2015}}&lt;!-- and what is the COBRA program? when did it exist?  who funded it?  etc.; or a link would be useful --&gt; for monitoring missile launches and outer space. Cobra Judy was replaced by the Cobra Judy Replacement (CJR) in April 2014.

==Replacement==
The Cobra Judy Platform, {{USNS|Observation Island|T-AGM-23|6}} was taken out of service and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register March 31, 2014.&lt;ref name="NVR"&gt;{{cite web |title= USNS OBSERVATION ISLAND (T-AGM 23) |url= {{NVR url|id=AGM23}} |publisher= Naval Vessel Register |accessdate= 2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 31 March 2014, the Cobra Judy Replacement program, aboard {{USNS|Howard O. Lorenzen|T-AGM-25}} reached initial operational capability (IOC). According to the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), the U.S. Air Force also assumed operational and sustainment responsibilities for the ship.&lt;ref name="navy20140501"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=80748 |title=Cobra Judy Replacement Achieves Initial Operational Capability |work=Navy.mil |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2014 |id=No. NNS140501-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asus Transformer Pad Infinity''' (also known as the '''TF700T''') - is a [[tablet computer]] made by [[Asus]], successor to the [[Asus Transformer Prime]]. The manufacturer announced it at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2012, less than a month after the original product launch, to launch Q2 2012.&lt;ref name="CNET CES 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ces.cnet.com/8301-33378_1-57354292/asus-transformer-prime-gets-major-screen-upgrade/?tag=mncol%3b5n |title=Asus Transformer Prime gets major screen upgrade |last=Franklin |first=Eric |publisher=CNET |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new model includes a [[Tegra 3]] T33 processor clocked at 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz (as opposed to the Prime's T30), and an upgraded 1,920×1,200-pixel-resolution screen, more than doubling the pixel count of the prior model. The display was upgraded to a [[IPS panel|Super IPS+ panel]] for ultra bright outdoor readability with 178° wide viewing angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asus.com/Tablet_Mobile/ASUS_Transformer_Pad_Infinity_TF700T/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118053103/http://www.asus.com/Tablet_Mobile/ASUS_Transformer_Pad_Infinity_TF700T |archive-date=2013-01-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the signal problems&lt;ref name="GPSproblems"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landofdroid.com/2011/asus-response-to-transformer-prime-gps-problems/ |title=Asus Response To Transformer Prime GPS Problems |last=Tyler |publisher=Land of Droid |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it includes a new back-panel design with the upper part made of plastic to enhance [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], and [[GPS]] performance. The front camera was boosted from 1.2 megapixels to 2 megapixels. It has improved graphics performance with a 12-core GPU.

==Successor==
{{main|Asus Transformer Pad TF701T}}
In November 2013 a successor was released by the name of '''Asus Transformer Pad Infinity TF701'''.
The new Transformer Pad was upgraded with a Tegra 4 CPU, a 2560 x 1600 resolution display with 300 ppi, 2GB RAM and other upgrades over its predecessor.

== CyanogenMod ==

[[CyanogenMod]] 11 or newer is supported on the TF700T tablet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_tf700t How to Install CyanogenMod on the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity ("tf700t")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005185954/http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_tf700t |date=2014-10-05 }}, wiki.cyanogenmod.org, retrieved on 2014-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">{{About|a design technique||Forcing function (disambiguation){{!}}Forcing function}} 
A '''behavior-shaping constraint''', also sometimes referred to as a '''forcing function''' or [[poka-yoke]], is a technique used in [[error-tolerant design]] to prevent the user from making common [[error]]s or mistakes.  One example is the reverse lockout on the transmission of a moving [[automobile]].

The microwave oven provides another example of a forcing function.  In all modern microwave ovens, it is impossible to start the microwave while the door is still open.  Likewise, the microwave will shut off automatically if the door is opened by the user.  By forcing the user to close the microwave door while it is in use, it becomes impossible for the user to err by leaving the door open.  Forcing functions are very effective in safety critical situations such as this, but can cause confusion in more complex systems that do not inform the user of the error that has been made.

When automobiles first started shipping with on-board GPS systems, it was not uncommon to use a forcing function which prevented the user from interacting with the GPS (such as entering in a destination) while the car was in motion.  This ensures that the driver's attention is not distracted by the GPS.  However, many drivers found this feature irksome, and the forcing function has largely been abandoned.  This reinforces the idea that forcing functions are not always the best approach to shaping behavior.

These forcing functions are being used in the service industry as well.  [[Call centers]] concerned with [[credit card fraud]] and [[friendly fraud]] are using [[agent-assisted automation]] to prevent the agent from seeing or hearing the credit card information so that it cannot be stolen.  The customer punches the information into their phone keypad, the tones are masked to the agent and are not visible in the [[customer relationship management]] software.&lt;ref name="adsit"&gt;{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1854&amp;Itemid=1&amp;Itemid=1| title= Error-proofing strategies for managing call center fraud | work= isixsigma.com |date= February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brent Shawzin Hoberman''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 25 November 1968) is a British entrepreneur. Together with [[Martha Lane Fox]], he founded [[Lastminute.com]] in 1998, an online travel and gift business. As CEO, Hoberman successively floated and later sold Lastminute.com Ltd to [[Sabre Holdings|Sabre]] who purchased the company's equity and bond debt for £577&amp;nbsp;million (including additional gross debt of approximately £79&amp;nbsp;million and estimated cash at bank in hand of approximately £72&amp;nbsp;million). In 2006, Hoberman handed over the CEO position to [[Ian McCaig]], although he remained as chairman and chief strategic officer until 2007.

==Current business activities==
Hoberman remained CEO of lastminute.com throughout 2005, until April 2006 when he handed over the CEO position to Ian McCaig and took the position of chairman and chief strategy officer. He stepped down as chief strategy officer and chairman in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Derrick |first=Stuart |url=http://startups.co.uk/lastminute-com-brent-hoberman/ |title=Lastminute.com: Brent Hoberman – Startups.co.uk: Starting a business advice and business ideas |publisher=Startups.co.uk |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoberman founded VC-backed internet startup, mydeco.com, an online furniture and interior design site providing 3D technology for consumers to design their own rooms online in 2007 and the website launched in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/28/internet.web20|title=His next trick – designing the ultimate home page|last=Teather|first=David|date=28 March 2008|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoberman is a governor of the [[University of the Arts London]] and a non-executive board director of [[Guardian Media Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Brook, press correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/24/guardianmediagroup.citynews |title=Brent Hoberman joins Guardian Media Group board &amp;#124; Economy |work=The Guardian |date=24 January 2007 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Hoberman took on the role of non-executive chairman of [[wayn]].com – a travel and leisure social network. In December 2009, he stepped down from the board of wayn.com.  He is also an angel investor in several internet companies, including Viagogo, erepublik, wayn.com and academia.edu. Hoberman joined The Business Council for Britain in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/aboutus/corporate/bcb/members/page44854.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100304143947/http://www.berr.gov.uk/aboutus/corporate/bcb/members/page44854.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-03-04 |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Business Council for Britain – Members – BIS |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=15 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hoberman was selected as one of the World Economic Forum's [[List of Young Global Leaders|Global Young Leaders]] for the UK.

The fund invests in early stage internet investors.

Hoberman was co-founder and chairman of Made.com, a joint venture between mydeco.com and founder Ning Li.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://realbusiness.co.uk/news/madecom_gets_25m_to_change_furniture_industry |title=Made.com gets £2.5m to change furniture industry |publisher=Real Business |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828223958/http://realbusiness.co.uk/news/madecom_gets_25m_to_change_furniture_industry |archivedate=28 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December 2015 it was reported that Hoberman was leaving PROFounders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.eu/brief/brent-hoberman-leaves-profounders-capital Brent Hoberman leaves PROfounders Capital&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoberman was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61092|supp=y|page=N9|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/391413/New_Year_Honours_List_2015.pdf 2015 New Year Honours List]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoberman is also a co-founder of FoundersForum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ff.co/ FoundersForum]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a private network for digital and technology entrepreneurs. Founders Forum has been hosting invite-only events in London since 2006 and has since 2011 expanded to events in other countries such as the US, Brazil, India, Turkey and China. Speakers at the events have included prominent figures from the technology sector like [[Eric Schmidt]], [[Reid Hoffman]] and [[Arianna Huffington]]. The events are by invitation only.

==Early life and education==
Hoberman was born on 25 November 1968.  He was educated at the [[Dragon School]] in [[Oxford]], then [[Eton College]] and subsequently at [[New College, Oxford]].  He is married with two daughters and one son.

==Inspiration and motivation==
Hoberman says his mentors have been his father and South African grandfather Leonard Shawzin, who built an empire of over 650 clothes shops from a single store. He credits his entrepreneurial drive to the business successes of his father and grandfather, and says the catalyst for him starting his own business was being fired from his first job in investment banking for being "a prima donna".&lt;ref&gt;Fildes, Nic. "The very latest in furnishing for couch potatoes", "[[The Times]]", London, 11 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoberman has stated that he believes what makes a business successful is passion; in an interview with BBC 'The Bottom Line',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11696894 |title=My Bottom Line: Brent Hoberman |publisher=BBC |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he states his belief that the most successful small businesses are those where the founders remain passionate about their business, and are themselves part of their target market. He believes that by building a business to offer a solution to a problem you have yourself – as he did with lastminute.com and mydeco.com – founders stand a greater chance of remaining passionate and being successful.

==Public and political activities==
Hoberman is a member of the [[New Enterprise Council]], a group of entrepreneurs who advise the [[Conservative Party (UK)]] on policies related to the needs of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/parties-clash-in-corporate-credentials-battle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528060800/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/parties-clash-in-corporate-credentials-battle |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-28 |title= |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=15 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hoberman is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/striving-to-rediscover-hunger-will-make-successful-start-ups-1.32310&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation''''', also referred to as '''''CSI''''' and '''''CSI: Las Vegas''''', is an American procedural forensics crime drama television series which ran on [[CBS]] from October 6, 2000, to September 27, 2015, spanning 15 seasons. The series, starring [[William Petersen]], [[Marg Helgenberger]], [[George Eads]], [[Ted Danson]],  [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Elisabeth Shue]], and [[Jorja Fox]], is the first in the [[CSI (franchise)|''CSI'' franchise]]. The series concluded with a feature-length finale titled "[[Immortality (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation)|Immortality]]".

==Plot summary==
Mixing deduction and character-driven drama, ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' follows a team of crime-scene investigators, employed by the Las Vegas Police Department, as they use physical evidence to solve murders. The team is originally led by [[Gil Grissom]] (Petersen), a socially awkward forensic entomologist and career criminalist who is promoted to CSI supervisor following the death of a trainee investigator. Grissom's second-in-command, [[Catherine Willows]] (Marg Helgenberger), is a single mother with a cop's instinct. Born and raised in Las Vegas, Catherine was a stripper before being recruited into law enforcement and training as a blood-spatter specialist. Following Grissom's departure during the ninth season of the series, Catherine is promoted to supervisor. After overseeing the training of new investigator [[Raymond Langston]] (Fishburne), Willows is replaced by [[D.B. Russell]] (Danson), and recruited to the FBI shortly thereafter. Russell is a family man, a keen forensic botanist, and a veteran of the Seattle Crime Lab. In the series' 12th season, Russell is reunited with his former partner [[Julie Finlay]] (Elisabeth Shue), who like Catherine, is a blood-spatter expert with an extensive knowledge of criminal psychology. With the rest of the team, they work to tackle Las Vegas' growing crime rate and are on the job 24/7, scouring the scene, collecting the evidence, and finding the missing pieces that will solve the mystery.

== Creation ==

=== Concept and development ===
During the 1990s, [[Anthony Zuiker]] caught producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]'s attention after writing his first movie script. Zuiker was convinced that a series was in the concept; Bruckheimer agreed and began developing the series with [[Touchstone Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Touchstone"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=James B.|title=DisneyWar|date=2005|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743283908|pages=307-310|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/DisneyWar.html?id=qF5GigayEhQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=snippet&amp;q=csi&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio's head at the time liked the [[spec script]] and presented it to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], NBC, and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] executives, who decided to pass. The head of drama development at CBS saw potential in the script, and the network had a [[pay-or-play contract]] with actor William Petersen, who said he wanted to do the ''CSI'' [[Television pilot|pilot]]. The network's executives liked the pilot so much, they decided to include it in their 2000 schedule immediately, airing on Fridays after ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. After CBS picked up the show, the Disney owned Touchstone decided to pull out of the project, since they didn't want to spend so much money producing a show for another network (ABC is also owned by Disney).&lt;ref name="Touchstone" /&gt; Instead of the intended effect of making CBS cancel the show (since it no longer had a producer), Bruckheimer was able to convince [[Alliance Atlantis]] to step in as a producer, saving the show and adding CBS as another producer.&lt;ref name="Touchstone" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Initially, ''CSI'' was thought to benefit from ''The Fugitive'' (a remake of the 1960s series), which was expected to be a hit, but by the end of 2000, ''CSI'' had a much larger audience.&lt;ref name="heaven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/csi.htm |title=CSI: Crime Scene Investigation |accessdate=2008-05-15 |author=Spadoni, Mike |date=June 2007 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520034821/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/csi.htm |archivedate=2008-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' was produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer|Jerry Bruckheimer Television]] and [[CBS Productions]], which became [[CBS Paramount Network Television|CBS Paramount Television]] in the fall of 2006 and [[CBS Television Studios]] three years later. Formerly a co-production with the now-defunct [[Alliance Atlantis|Alliance Atlantis Communications]], that company's interest was later bought by the investment firm [[GS Capital Partners]], an affiliate of [[Goldman Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;Through "Entertainment AB Funding LLC"&lt;/ref&gt; CBS acquired AAC's international distribution rights to the program, though the non-US DVD distribution rights did not change (for example, [[Momentum Pictures]] continues to own UK DVD rights). The series is currently in syndication, and reruns are broadcast in the U.S. on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]], [[Syfy]] and the [[USA Network]] on cable, with [[Ion Television]] holding the broadcast syndication rights. The show has aired in reruns on the [[USA Network]] since January 14, 2011.&lt;ref name=USAadds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/01/11/usa-adds-syndicated-csi/38470/|title=USA Adds Syndicated CSI - Ratings {{!}} TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com|work=TVbytheNumbers|date=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSI catalog has been exclusive to the whole NBC Universal portfolio since September 2014, after several years with [[Viacom Media Networks]]' [[Paramount Network|Spike]] and [[TV Land]].&lt;ref name=USAadds /&gt;

===Filming locations===
[[File:HP 6890 Gas chromatogram-mass spectrometer used on CSI.jpg|thumb|The [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|Gas chromatogram-mass spectrometer]] formerly used as a prop in the show.]]
''CSI'' was shot at Rye Canyon, a corporate campus owned by [[Lockheed Martin]] situated in the Valencia area of [[Santa Clarita, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ludb.clui.org/ex/i/CA6082|title=Rye Canyon Office Park|accessdate=2008-05-15|publisher=The Center For Land Use Interpretation}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after episode 11, filming shifted to the Santa Clarita Studios, originally chosen for its similarity to the outskirts of Las Vegas. Occasionally, the cast still shot on location in Las Vegas (the season-four DVD set revealed that the episode "Suckers" was mostly shot during December 2003 in Las Vegas, where they filmed a Gothic club scene on location for rent, and in January 2004, some scenes were filmed at [[Caesars Palace]]), although primarily Las Vegas was used solely for [[second unit]] photography such as exterior shots of streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/JRD203/csi-locations.htm|title=Filming/Locations|accessdate=2008-05-15|publisher=Elyse'sCSI|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706065808/http://members.aol.com/JRD203/csi-locations.htm|archivedate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other California locations include [[Verdugo Hills High School]], [[UCLA]]'s [[Royce Hall]], [[Pasadena City Hall]], and [[California State University, Los Angeles]]. While shooting took place primarily at Universal Studios in [[Universal City, California]], Santa Clarita's surroundings had proven so versatile, ''CSI'' still shot some outdoor scenes there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csifiles.com/news/120805_01.shtml|title="The Unit" Takes Over CSI's Old Studio|accessdate=2008-05-15|publisher=CSI Files.com/LA Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
''CSI'''s [[theme tune|theme song]] was, since the last episode of season one, "[[Who Are You (song)|Who Are You]]", written by [[Pete Townshend]] with vocals by lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]]. Daltrey made a special appearance in the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 7)|season-seven]] episode "Living Legend", which also contained many musical references such as the words "Who's next" on a dry-erase board in the episode's opening sequence. In certain countries, to avoid music licensing fees, a unique theme was used, instead.

Throughout the series, music played an important role; artists such as [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[The Wallflowers]], [[John Mayer]], and [[Akon]] (with [[Obie Trice]]) performed onscreen in the episodes "Skin in the Game", "The Accused Is Entitled", "[[Built To Kill, Part 1]]", and "[[Poppin' Tags]]", respectively. [[Mogwai]] was often heard during scenes showing forensic tests in progress, as were [[Radiohead]] and [[Cocteau Twins]], but several other artists lent their music to ''CSI'', including [[Rammstein]] and [[Linkin Park]]&amp;mdash;used heavily in Lady Heather's [[Lady Heather#Appearances|story arc]]. [[Sigur Rós]] can be heard playing in the background in the episode "Slaves of Las Vegas", [[The Turtles]] in "[[Grave Danger]]", and [[Marilyn Manson]] in "Suckers". A cover of the [[Tears for Fears]] song "[[Mad World]]", arranged by [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and featuring vocals by [[Gary Jules]], was used in the pilot episode and during three episodes of season six ("Room Service", "Killer", and "Way to Go"). Industrial rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]] was also featured multiple times throughout the three series. One episode started with The Velvet Underground's excited rendition of "Sweet Jane" and ended with the downbeat version of Cowboy Junkies' revision of the song. Character David Hodges' good luck has, on occasion, been accompanied by [[Electric Light Orchestra]]'s "[[Mr. Blue Sky]]". This song was first used in the season-seven episode "Lab Rats", and last used during season 10's "Field Mice".

The ''Hollywood Reporter ''noted of the pilot "...the charismatic William Petersen and the exquisite Marg Helgenberger, lend credibility to the portrayals that might be indistinct in lesser hands.

The series had numerous episodes on [[sexual fetishism]] and other forms of sexual pleasure (notably the recurring character of [[Lady Heather]], a [[dominatrix|professional dominatrix]]). ''CSI'' was ranked among the worst primetime shows by the [[Parents Television Council]] from its second through sixth seasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2002/main.asp |title=Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Primetime Network TV 2001–2002 |publisher=Parents Television Council |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609011639/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2002/main.asp |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2004/main.asp |title=Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Primetime Network TV 2003–2004 |publisher=Parents Television Council |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527194146/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2004/main.asp |archivedate=2012-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2005/main.asp |title=Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Primetime Network TV 2004–2005 |publisher=Parents Television Council |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523142544/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2005/main.asp |archivedate=2007-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What Are Your Children Watching? |version= |publisher=[[Parents Television Council]] |date=2007-10-29 |url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2007/WAYCW2007.pdf |accessdate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202100512/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2007/WAYCW2007.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; being ranked the worst show for family prime-time viewing after the 2002–2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2003/main.asp|title=Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Primetime Network TV 2002–2003|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2005–2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2006/main.asp |title=Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Primetime Network TV 2005–2006 |publisher=Parents Television Council |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613060721/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2006/main.asp |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; seasons.

Real-life crime scene investigators and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows like ''CSI'' (often specifically citing ''CSI'') do not give a realistic picture of the work, wildly distorting the nature of crime-scene investigators' work, and exaggerating the ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence, scope, and comfort level of their jobs, which they describe as far more mundane, tedious, limited, and boring, and very commonly failing to solve a crime.&lt;ref name="how_accurate_are_crime_shows_2017_02_07_rasumssen_edu"&gt;Flavin, Brianna (quoting Brian McKenna, retired police Lieutenant and Crime Scene Investigator), [http://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/justice-studies/blog/crime-show-myths-debunked-forensic-experts-tell-what-life-is-real/ "How Accurate are Crime Shows on TV?

Another criticism of the show is the depiction of police procedure, which some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willing |first=Richard |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-08-05-csi-effect_x.htm |title='CSI effect' has juries wanting more evidence |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-08-05 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider to be decidedly lacking in realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/services/careers/csi.html|title=The Real CSI|author=Ross MacDowell|publisher=Australian Sunday Herald|accessdate=2006-10-14| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060918074050/http://www.aic.gov.au/services/careers/csi.html| archivedate = September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the show's characters not only investigate ("process") crime scenes, but they also conduct raids, engage in suspect pursuit and arrest, interrogate suspects, and solve cases, all of which falls under the responsibility of uniformed officers and detectives, not CSI personnel. Although 'some' detectives are also registered CSIs, this is exceedingly rare in actual life. It is considered an inappropriate and improbable practice to allow CSI personnel to be involved in detective work, as it would compromise the impartiality of scientific evidence and would be impracticably time-consuming. Additionally, it is inappropriate for the CSIs who process a crime scene to be involved in the examination and testing of any evidence collected from that scene. ''CSI'' shares this characteristic with similar British drama series ''[[Silent Witness]]''.

However, not all law enforcement agencies have been as critical; many CSIs have responded positively to the show's influence and enjoy their new reputation. In the UK, [[scenes of crime officer]]s now commonly refer to themselves as CSIs. Some constabularies, such as Norfolk, have even gone so far as to change the name of the unit to Crime Scene Investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolk.police.uk/article.cfm?artID=11271&amp;catID=671&amp;bctrail=0,535,844|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023005746/http://www.norfolk.police.uk/article.cfm?artID=11271&amp;catID=671&amp;bctrail=0,535,844|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-23|title=Norfolk Constabulary – Crime Scene Investigation web page|publisher=Norfolk Constabulary|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, recruitment and training programs have seen a massive increase in applicants, with a far wider range of people now interested in something previously regarded as a scientific backwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4284335.stm| title=CSI shows give 'unrealistic view'|publisher=BBC News Online|date=February 21, 2005|accessdate=January 2, 2010|first=Paul|last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''CSI'' effect===
{{Main|CSI effect}}

The "[[CSI effect|''CSI'' effect]]" is a reference to the alleged phenomenon of ''CSI'' raising crime victims' and jury members' real-world expectations of [[forensic science]], especially [[Forensic science|crime-scene investigation]] and [[DNA testing]].&lt;ref name=csi&gt;N. J. Schweitzer and [[Michael J. Saks]] [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=967706 The ''CSI'' Effect: Popular Fiction About Forensic Science Affects Public Expectations About Real Forensic Science.] [http://www.law.asu.edu/jurimetrics ''Jurimetrics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002153806/http://www.law.asu.edu/Jurimetrics/ |date=2007-10-02 }}, Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to have changed the way many trials are presented today, in that prosecutors are pressured to deliver more forensic evidence in court.&lt;ref name=csi2&gt;Donald E. Sheldon, Young S. Kim and Gregg Barak [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958224 A Study of Juror Expectations and Demands Concerning Scientific Evidence: Does the 'CSI Effect' Exist?] ''Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment &amp; Technology Law''&lt;/ref&gt; Victims and their families are coming to expect instant answers from showcased techniques such as DNA analysis and fingerprinting, when actual forensic processing often takes days or weeks, with no guarantee of revealing a "smoking gun" for the prosecution's case. District attorneys state that the conviction rate in cases with little physical evidence has decreased, largely due to the influence of ''CSI'' on jury members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-08-05-csi-effect_x.htm|title='CSI effect' has juries wanting more evidence|work=USA Today|date=2004-08-05|first1=Richard|last1=Willing|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some police and district attorneys have criticized the show for giving members of the public an inaccurate perception of how police solve crimes.

In 2006, the evidence cited in support of the supposed effect was mainly anecdotes from law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, and allegedly little empirical examination of the effect had been done, and the one study published by then suggested the phenomenon may be an urban myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, more recent research suggests that these modern TV shows do have an influence on public perceptions and expectations, and juror behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Holmgren| first = Janne A.

Citing the "''CSI'' effect", at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs.&lt;ref name="csi_effect_and_juror_decisions_2015_alldredge" /&gt;

The U.S. box sets are released by [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]), while the Canadian box sets are released by [[Alliance Atlantis]] (distributed by [[Universal Studios]]). The first season DVD release differs from all subsequent seasons in that it is available only in 1.33:1 or 4:3 [[full frame]], rather than the subsequent [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.78:1 or 16:9 [[widescreen]], which is the [[HDTV]] standard aspect ratio.

The first season is also the only DVD release of the series not to feature [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 surround audio, instead offering Dolby Digital stereo sound.

The Blu-ray disc release of Season One is 7.1 DTS sound and 1.78:1 widescreen.

====Regions 2====
Regions 2 releases have followed a pattern whereby each season is progressively released in two parts (each of 11 or 12 episodes [except for Season 8, in which part 1 contained 8 episodes and the ''Without a Trace'' crossover and part 2 contained the remaining 9 episodes] with special features split up) before finally being sold as a single box set. After having been almost 12&amp;nbsp;months behind region 2 releases after the first four series, region 4 releases are speeding up, with distributors simply releasing season five as a complete box set.

She also looks into the authenticity of the forensic investigations recreated for the dramatizations, and the painstaking real-life forensic process employed in every one of the actual cases—from notorious mass-murderer [[Richard Speck]], through the massacre of Buddhist monks in an Arizona Temple, to a baffling case of apparent [[spontaneous combustion]].

'''Clearstream''' is a post-trade services provider{{huh|date=December 2017}} owned by [[Deutsche Börse]] AG. It provides [[settlement (finance)|settlement]] and custody as well as other related services for [[securities]] across all [[asset classes]]. It is one of two European International [[Central Securities Depository|Central Securities Depositories]] ([[Euroclear]] being the other).

Clearstream operates securities settlement systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pol/activ/clearing/html/index.en.html|title=Securities settlement systems and central counterparties|website=European Central Bank|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in both [[Luxembourg]] and [[Germany]], which allow for the holding and transfer of securities.

Clearstream operates its International Central Securities Depository (ICSD) from Luxembourg. It is also a joint partner in the Luxembourgish Central Securities Depository (CSD), LuxCSD, together with the [[Central Bank of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.luxcsd.com/luxcsd-en/about-luxcsd/companygovernance |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518104158/http://www.luxcsd.com/luxcsd-en/about-luxcsd/companygovernance |archive-date=2015-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, Clearstream operates the German CSD, Clearstream Banking AG. Clearstream has links to over 50 domestic markets worldwide, and also issues and safekeeps [[Eurobond]]s.

In 2014, the value of assets under custody on behalf of customers averaged 12.2 trillion euros; furthermore, Clearstream processed 43.65 million ICSD and 82.68 million CSD settlement transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg/dispatch/en/notescontent/dbg_nav/press/10_Latest_Press_Releases/25_Clearstream/INTEGRATE/mr_pressreleases?notesDoc=0F4961D3C8F1EF50C1257DCD00369099&amp;newstitle=clearstreamsdecemberandyear201&amp;location=press|title=Deutsche Börse Group - Latest press releases|website=deutsche-boerse.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearstream has around 2,500 customers in 110 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/about-clearstream/who-we-are |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303053329/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/about-clearstream/who-we-are |archive-date=2017-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearstream accepts [[central banks]] and [[Money laundering#Enforcement|AML-regulated]] credit institutions (such as regulated banks) as customers. Clearstream does not accept [[natural persons]] as customers and no account is opened in the name of a natural person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/about-clearstream/becoming-a-clearstream-customer |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323181206/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/about-clearstream/becoming-a-clearstream-customer |archive-date=2015-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearstream has therefore been described as a "bank for banks" ("Plumbers and Visionaries, a history of settlement and custody in Europe", Peter Norman).

==History==
Clearstream was founded as "Cedel" (Centrale de Livraison de Valeurs Mobilières) in September 1970 by 66 of the world's major financial institutions as a clearing organisation whose objective was to minimise risk in the settlement of cross-border securities trading, particularly in the growing Eurobond market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/blob/10702/18ba88d5e20e7f6c77c75415680a1396/hbecomp-pdf-data.pdf |title=Clearstream Customer Handbook| page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a new corporate structure was introduced, establishing a parent company - Cedel International - with a subsidiary company, Cedelbank; two years later, a new subsidiary - Cedel Global Services - was established.

Clearstream was formed in January 2000 through the merger of Cedel International and Deutsche Börse Clearing. The full integration of Clearstream was completed in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg/dispatch/en/kir/dbg_nav/about_us/10_Deutsche_Boerse_Group/50_Company_History?horizontal=page4_DB_History_2000-2009|title=Deutsche Börse Group - Company history|website=Deutsche-boerse.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Clearstream has operational centres in Cork, Luxembourg, Prague and Singapore. It also maintains representative offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Dubai, New York and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/about-clearstream/who-we-are/office-locations |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323190618/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/about-clearstream/who-we-are/office-locations |archive-date=2015-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint ventures==
In July 2010, Clearstream founded LuxCSD together with the Luxembourg Central Bank, to act as a CSD for Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luxcsd.com/luxcsd-en/keydocuments/customer-handbook |title=LuxCSD Customer Handbook|website=Luxcsd.com |page=9|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Clearstream co-founded REGIS-TR, a joint venture with the Spanish Central Securities Depository Iberclear, to act as a [[Trade Repository|trade repository]] for [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s transactions, helping participants meet their regulatory reporting obligations brought about by the introduction of the [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation]] (EMIR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.regis-tr.com/index.php/media-centre/press-releases/76-otc-derivatives-trade-repository-regist-tr-starts-operations |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215101501/http://www.regis-tr.com/index.php/media-centre/press-releases/76-otc-derivatives-trade-repository-regist-tr-starts-operations |archive-date=2013-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supervision==
Based in Luxembourg and Germany, Clearstream is subject to the supervision of the regulatory authorities of these two countries. In Luxembourg, the [[Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier]] (CSSF) is the prudential regulator with authority over all banks and financial service providers. In Germany, Clearstream is regulated as a bank according to the German Banking Act ("Kreditwesengesetz") and is therefore subject to the prudential supervision of the [[Federal Financial Supervisory Authority|German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority]] (German: "Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" - BaFin). Moreover, Clearstream is regulated in each market where it has operational centres, for example by the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]].

As the operator of securities settlement systems in both Luxembourg and Germany, Clearstream is additionally regulated by the central banks of these two countries, namely the Banque centrale du Luxembourg and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]].

==Clearstream's business streams==

===Asset Services&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/asset-services |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323194235/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/asset-services |archive-date=2015-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Clearstream is responsible for the management, safekeeping/custody and administration of securities (assets) under custody. Services include income and redemption payments, [[corporate actions]] as well as tax and [[proxy voting]].

The majority of securities safekept by Clearstream are [[Settlement (finance)#Immobilisation|immobilised]]. Securities are reflected in book-entry form in the accounts of customers at Clearstream regardless of whether they are held in physical or dematerialised form. This means that they are no longer represented by physical certificates, but instead by data entered into the Clearstream systems.

===Global Securities Financing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/global-securities-financing |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318075422/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/global-securities-financing |archive-date=2015-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Securities financing is the ability to borrow or [[securities lending|lend]] cash or securities against [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. In securities financing, collateral comprises assets given as a guarantee by a borrower to secure a securities loan and subject to seizure in the event of [[default (finance)|default]]. [[Collateral management]] refers to the handling of all tasks related to the monitoring of collateral posted by a borrower to meet a financial obligation (optimisation, substitution, top-up, withdrawal, settlement instruction, reporting, processing of [[Margin (finance)#Margin Call|margin calls]] and returns, notification of corporate events, etc.).

Clearstream's collateral management, securities lending and borrowing services are gathered under the Global Liquidity Hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/global-securities-financing/global-liquidity-hub |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323202533/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/global-securities-financing/global-liquidity-hub |archive-date=2015-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a pool of [[market liquidity|liquidity]] through links to agent banks, trading platforms, [[clearing house (finance)|clearing houses]] and other market infrastructures.

Clearstream is a member of the Liquidity Alliance, which was established in January 2013 as a platform for CSDs to collaborate on collateral management. It was founded by [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]], Cetip, Clearstream, Iberclear and Strate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/blob/11358/2bc37b359ab16dd3e481528735430dd5/liquidity-alliance-brochure-data.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085605/http://www.clearstream.com/blob/11358/2bc37b359ab16dd3e481528735430dd5/liquidity-alliance-brochure-data.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment Fund Services===
Clearstream has developed the world's largest cross-border fund processing platform, called Vestima.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/investment-funds-services/vestima |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323202834/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/investment-funds-services/vestima |archive-date=2015-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It handles all types of funds, from [[mutual fund]]s to [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) and [[hedge fund]]s.

In addition to providing access to all fund types, Vestima supports their cross-border distribution. Services offered by Vestima include order routing, centralised [[delivery versus payment]] (DVP) settlement, safekeeping, asset servicing and collateral management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/investment-funds-services|title=Investment Fund Services||website=Clearstream.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issuance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/issuance--1-/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085510/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/issuance--1-/ |archive-date=2015-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;===
ICSDs and CSDs are often used to [[Primary market|bring a security issue to the market]], as they possess the necessary infrastructure for distributing the securities to the investors as well as for settlement and safekeeping. Clearstream's ICSD also provides custody services, which means that the security can be serviced throughout its entire lifecycle. Clearstream provides the infrastructure which enables issuers to reach investors worldwide.

Clearstream's services include eligibility assessments, issuance and distribution of domestic, foreign and international (i.e. Eurobonds) new issues of global and domestic instruments: [[certificates of deposit]], [[depositary receipt|depository receipts]], [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bill|treasury bills]], [[commercial paper]]s, short-term and medium-term notes, [[bond (finance)|bonds]], [[equity (finance)|equities]], [[warrant (finance)|warrants]], equity-linked notes and investment fund shares.

===Settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/settlement |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323180717/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/settlement |archive-date=2015-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Clearstream's ICSD settles trades in international securities and in domestic securities traded across borders. The CSDs settle domestic transactions in the German and Luxembourgish markets. Transactions between the two ICSDs Clearstream and Euroclear are settled via an electronic communications platform, called the Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/settlement/commercial-bank-money-settlement--icsd-/settlement-overview/bridge |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323194442/http://www.clearstream.com/clearstream-en/products-and-services/settlement/commercial-bank-money-settlement--icsd-/settlement-overview/bridge |archive-date=2015-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearstream operates a delivery versus payment settlement system, ensuring simultaneous settlement of securities and cash transfers on a gross (trade-by-trade) basis. This helps to minimise the risk associated with the settlement of securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d101.htm?|title=Principles for financial market infrastructures|date=16 April 2012|website=Bis.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===The Clearstream Affair===
Between 2001 and 2002, two books were published by co-authors [[Denis Robert]] and Ernest Backes, entitled "Révélation$" and "La Boîte Noire", accusing Clearstream of being a [[money laundering]] organisation and the worldwide centre for international financial crime committed by major banks, [[shell corporation|shell companies]] and organised crime all over the world.
An investigation opened by the Luxembourg authorities in 2001 found no evidence to support the authors' allegations and the case was dismissed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/11516/clearstream-wins-money-laundering-libel-case|title=Clearstream wins money laundering libel case|date=29 March 2004|website=Finextra Research|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a list leaked to a French judge indicated that Clearstream was a money laundering organisation covering illegal activities of French businessmen who were involved in the sale of warships by French defence giant [[Thomson-CSF|Thales]] (known as Thomson-CSF before 2000) to Taiwan and related bribes paid to French officials and businessmen.
An investigation that included the search of Clearstream's premises and an examination of accounts in 2004 found no evidence supporting the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/08/06/france-taiwan-corruption-idUKL625816220080806|title=French authorities seek end to Taiwan bribes case|website=Reuters.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, additional anonymous letters and CD-Roms sent to French judges accused Clearstream of running secret accounts for criminals and senior French politicians. In late 2005, French investigating authorities officially declared the documents as forgeries and dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/clearstream-nicolas-sarkozy-dominique-de-villepin|title=Nicolas Sarkozy awaits verdict on Clearstream - the political smear case that split the right|first=Lizzy|last=Davies|date=27 January 2010|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy inspired the 2014 film "The Clearstream Affair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3037028/|title=The Clearstream Affair|date=11 February 2015|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian funds controversy===
In 2008, several groups of plaintiffs commenced enforcement proceedings in the US to satisfy judgments which they had obtained against Iran by restraining certain positions held in a Clearstream securities account with its intermediary bank in the US, and asking for handover of the assets. Clearstream challenged the restraints and the handover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg/dispatch/en/binary/dbg_nav/investor_relations/30_Reports_and_Figures/30_Annual_Reports/20_Archive/Content_Files/Archive/Annual_Report_2010.pdf |title=Deutsche Börse's Annual Report 2010| page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the plaintiffs filed additional claims, this time directly against Clearstream, for damages of USD 250 million in connection with the purported wrongful conveyance of some of the restrained positions. Clearstream entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs that became effective in 2013. The settlement provided for the dismissal of the direct claims against Clearstream, and that the plaintiffs will not further sue Clearstream for damages and in return, Clearstream agreed to not further appeal an order directing the turnover of the restrained customer's assets to the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2010cv04518/364024/508/|title=Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, No. 1:2010cv04518 - Document 508 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)|website=Law.justia.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In 2013, a number of US plaintiffs from the 2011 case, as well as other US plaintiffs, filed a complaint targeting certain blocked assets that Clearstream holds as a custodian in Luxembourg. In 2015, the US court issued a decision dismissing the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2013cv09195/421817/166/|title=Peterson v.

Arising from the above, the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) investigated certain securities' transfers in 2008 within Clearstream's settlement systems regarding US Iran sanctions regulations. These 2008 transfers had been undertaken as part of the decision taken by Clearstream in 2007 to close its Iranian customers' accounts. In 2013 Clearstream entered into settlement talks with OFAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgap.de/dgap/News/adhoc/deutsche-boerse-deutsche-boerse-subsidiary-clearstream-enter-into-settlement-discussions-with-ofac/?companyID=273&amp;newsID=744552|title=Deutsche Börse AG: Deutsche Börse AG subsidiary Clearstream to enter into settlement discussions with OFAC|website=Dgap.de|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was resolved in 2014 through a settlement and payment of USD 151.9 million that does not constitute a final determination that a violation of Iran sanctions had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgap.de/dgap/News/adhoc/deutsche-boerse-settlement-between-deutsche-boerse-subsidiary-clearstream-and-ofac-effective/?companyID=273&amp;newsID=785799|title=Deutsche Börse AG: Settlement between Deutsche Börse AG subsidiary Clearstream and OFAC effective |website=Dgap.de|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Merge |Air dryer |date=March 2018 }}
'''Compressed air dryers''' are special types of filter systems that are specifically designed to remove the water that is inherent in compressed air.  The process of compressing air raises its temperature and concentrates atmospheric contaminants, primarily water vapor.  Consequently, the compressed air is generally at an elevated temperature and 100% relative humidity.   As the compressed air cools, water vapor condenses into the tank(s), pipes, hoses and tools that are downstream from the compressor.

Excessive liquid and condensing water in the air stream can be extremely damaging to equipment, tools and processes that rely on compressed air.  The water can cause corrosion in the tank(s) and piping, wash out lubricating oils from pneumatic tools, emulsify with the grease used in cylinders, clump blasting media and fog painted surfaces.  Therefore, it is desirable to remove condensing moisture from the air stream to prevent damage to equipment, air tools and processes.  The function of removing this unwanted water is the purview of the compressed air dryer.

There are various types of compressed air dryers.  These dryers generally fall into two different categories, Primary and Secondary. Their performance characteristics are typically defined by flow rate in Standard Cubic Feet per Minute ([[Standard cubic feet per minute|SCFM]]) and [[dew point]] expressed as a temperature, (sometimes referred to as Pressure Dew Point.)

Primary Dryers:  Coalescing, Refrigerated and Deliquescent.

Secondary Dryers:  Desiccant, Absorption and Membrane.

== Applications ==
Water contamination is an inherent byproduct of compressing atmospheric air.  Because of this phenomenon, compressed air systems usually benefit from the addition of a compressed air dryer located on the output of the air compressor and/or at various locations throughout the distribution system.  In most cases, the output of the compressor is processed through a primary dryer or system dryer.  In cases where higher quality air is required the output of the primary dryer is further processed through a secondary dryer or polishing dryer.

== Coalescing Filters ==
Coalescing filters aren’t actually filters, rather they operate more as a consolidation element.  The idea behind these devices is that the compressed air is forced through gaps or porosity within an otherwise solid
[[File:Dryer-Coalescing Filter.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of a two-stage coalescing filter set.]]
element. These gaps and/or porosity are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] and small enough that water vapor wets to the internal surfaces.  The liquid water that forms during the wetting process is forced through the media and drips down into a trap.  The dry air travels up to and out of the discharge port.

There are two basic types of coalescing elements.  The first type utilizes a cast material that is dominated with an internal microscopic [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]. The air is forced to flow through the lattice which, in turn, allows the water vapor to wet to the internal surfaces.  The second type is generally referred to as a stacked plate element.  In this case, fine discs are stacked with microscopic gaps between them.  The air is forced to flow through the gaps which, in turn, allows the water vapor to wet to the internal surfaces.

In principle, a coalescing filter is an ideal way to separate water from the compressed air stream.  Practically speaking, this is not the case.  Coalescing elements are extremely sensitive to oil and particulate contamination and therefore would be better placed as a second stage dryer.  However, the dew point performance of a coalescing filter places it in the primary category of compressed air dryers.  In order to use coalescing filters as primary dryers, they are typically set-up in pairs.  The first filter has an element with larger gaps that are designed to remove oil from the stream.  The second filter uses a finer element that is intended to remove water vapor.  Because of the sensitivity of the elements, coalescing filters are not particularly common.  One area where these filters have found acceptance is with dental compressors.  The way that dental compressors are designed and used makes a two stage coalescing filter an almost ideal solution for water contamination in these systems.

== Refrigerated Dryers ==
Refrigerated dryers are the most common type of compressed air dryer.  They remove water from the air stream by cooling the air to approximately 38&amp;nbsp;°F and effectively condensing out the moisture in a

controlled environment.  38&amp;nbsp;°F is the realistic lower limit for a refrigerated dryer because a lower temperature runs the risk of freezing the separated water.  They are typically specified as primary dryers and generally produce air quality that is appropriate for approximately 95% of all compressed air applications.  Refrigerated dryers are generally manufactured in one of two different ways, [[Freon]] based units and [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule-Thomson]] based units.

=== Freon Based Refrigerated Compressed Air Dryers ===
These dryers derive their cooling from a closed cycle refrigeration system based around one of three commercial refrigerants, R-22, R-134a or R410a.  The refrigeration system these dryers use is similar to home and commercial air conditioning systems.  The schematic shown to the right illustrates a typical Freon based refrigerated compressed air dryer.

Freon based refrigerated compressed air dryers generally consist of a heat exchanger that is similar to a water cooled after cooler. Instead of using water as the coolant, liquid CFC fills the shell of the heat exchanger.  The liquid CFC is maintained at a pressure that allows it to boil at 38&amp;nbsp;°F.  After the CFC boils, the vapor is drawn through the suction line into a compressor, which compresses the CFC to a high pressure and high temperature.  The high pressure/temperature CFC is cooled in the condenser and relaxes into its liquid state.  The liquid is reintroduced into the heat exchanger via the metering device and a closed refrigeration cycle is formed.  When the compressed air passes through the heat exchanger, it is cooled to the temperature of the boiling CFC.  As the compressed air is cooled, it loses its ability to retain moisture and the water vapor condenses onto the inside of the exchanger tube.

'''''See Also:'''''  ''[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]''

Variations on this basic design include units equipped with reheating exchangers, which are intended to improve efficiency.  In these cases, the cooled compressed air is reheated by the incoming air.

High temperature dryers are equipped with an additional pre-cooler that removes excess heat via a forced air system.  These units are designed to allow excessively hot compressed air to be effectively dried.  Compressed air temperatures in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;°F are very common in Southern climates, mining operations, steel mills, shipboard, etc.  In areas and applications that demand operations in elevated ambient temperatures, high temperature dryers are a necessity.

Cycling dryers (also known as thermal mass dryers) utilize a thermal mass, usually a tank of water, to store the energy produced by the refrigeration system.  The temperature of the water controls the refrigeration system through a thermostat.  The compressed air passes through the thermal mass via a water cooled heat exchanger.  The value of this type of configuration is that they normally produce more consistent cooling results.

=== Joule-Thompson (JT) Based Refrigerated Compressed Air Dryers ===
JT type dryers are units that utilize the compressed air stream as their refrigeration element.  High pressure compressed air (150 ~ 175 PSI) is fed into a pressure reducing valve on top of the dryer.  The output of this valve (90 ~120 PSI) is directed into an expansion chamber which is surrounded with porous walls.   As the air expands to a lower pressure, it becomes cold (based on the Joule-Thomson Effect) and its ability to retain moisture is reduced.  The moisture is released from the air in the form of fog.  The fog laden air then passes through the porous walls of the chamber.  The micro-droplets of water that make up the fog wet to the porous material and collect until they form droplets that can be affected by gravity.  The water then drops into a trap and the dried air travels up to and out of the discharge port.  The drawback of the JT Dryer is that it can only be used with two-stage compressors.  This is because a two-stage compressor derives its efficiency by pumping to a high pressure (150 ~ 175 PSI.)  This pressure is inappropriate for the shop floor and must be dropped to (90 ~ 120 PSI.)  The JT Dryer takes advantage of this pressure drop to remove moisture from the compressed air stream through the inherent refrigeration based on the Joule-Thompson effect of the expanding air.  Leveraging this pressure drop allows a JT dryer to produce the same relative dew points that Freon based dryers produce.

== Deliquescent Dryers ==
Deliquescent dryers typically consist of a pressure vessel filled with a hygroscopic medium that has a high affinity for water vapor.  Practically speaking, these dryers are
[[File:Dryer-Deliquescent Dryer.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of a deliquescent compressed air dryer.]]
typically a large pressure vessel that is filled with salt crystals.  When water vapor comes in contact with the salt, it attaches and dissolves the media, or deliquesces.  As liquid water builds on the salt crystals, brine is formed, which drains down and collects in the bottom of the vessel.  Periodically, the brine must be drained and similarly, the media must be refilled.  Typically, deliquescent dryers will produce a dew point suppression of 18 to 25&amp;nbsp;°F.

On the plus side, these dryers are very simple, have no moving parts and do not require electrical power.  However, they do not perform well with high temperature air streams and/or in high ambient temperatures.   They are disproportionately large units which are filled with a corrosive substance.  Their size and corrosive nature can present problems with any system that uses them.  Because of this, these dryers are typically used only in specialty applications.

== Desiccant Dryers ==
[[File:Dryer-Desiccant Dryer.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of a twin tower desiccant compressed air dryer.]]
Desiccant dryers, sometimes referred to as absorption dryers, operate by absorbing water vapor into a porous media with a high affinity for water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent
| number        = US5522150A
| title         = Modular air dryer for compressed air with dessicant

| pubdate       =1994
| inventor      =   Goodell
| url = https://patents.google.com/patent/US5286283A/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These types of dryers are also referred to as absorption systems or getters.  Because these dryers get and hold the water, they are minimally effective as a first stage dryer.  If a desiccant is used in this role, the media quickly becomes saturated and the effectiveness of the dryer is negated.  Desiccant dryers are best applied in a second stage or polishing role.  They are usually used down-stream from a refrigerated dryer or some other primary dryer.  When applied as a second stage dryer, they can easily and reliably produce dew points in the sub zero range.

Desiccant dryers are typically supplied in two patterns, “Single Canister” and “Twin Tower” units.  Single canister units have the outward appearance of a filter housing.  However, they are filled with a granular media that must be periodically replaced.  The media can be regenerated by baking it at a high temperature in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations.  Single canister desiccant dryers are typically installed in point-of-use applications.  When applied as a second stage dryer, they can easily and reliably produce dew points in the sub-zero range.

A variation on the single canister desiccant dryer is the Toilet Paper filter.  These types of filters provide the same basic function as a desiccant dryer except they use an ordinary roll of toilet paper as their absorption media.  When the toilet paper becomes saturated, it is removed and replaced with a fresh roll.  The popularity of these filters is primarily based around their low cost, convenience and effectiveness.  Surprisingly enough, these types of filters are very effective in point-of-use roles.

Twin Tower, or regenerative desiccant dryers, have two vertical tanks filled with media.  When the media in the first tank becomes saturated, the air stream is automatically redirected through the second tank.  The first tank is then heated while a portion of the dried air, referred to as the purge air, is back flowed through the tank and vented to atmosphere. This process dries, or regenerates, the media in the first tank and makes it ready for the next redirect.  One of the most significant drawbacks of twin tower desiccant dryers is their use of the purge air.  Typically, a twin tower desiccant dryer uses some 15 to 20% of its capacity to regenerate the opposite tank, making these dryers inefficient and costly to operate.

== Membrane Dryer ==
'''''See also:''' [[Membrane gas separation]]''

Membrane dryers operate on the principle of migration.  The compressed air to be dried is passed over a membrane that has a high affinity for water vapor.  The water
[[File:Dryer-Membrane Dryer.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of a membrane type compressed air dryer.]]
vapor builds on the membrane and migrates through to the opposite or low pressure, side.  A dry cover gas is flowed across the low pressure side and absorbs the water on the membrane.  After absorbing the water, the cover gas is discharged to the atmosphere.  The cover gas is generally taken from the output of the dryer.  The membrane is typically a series of small tubes collected in a bundle within an outer housing.

If set-up and operated properly, membrane dryers can produce extremely low dew points.  For this reason they are very common in laboratories, medical facilities and specialty manufacturing environments where limited amounts of high quality compressed air is required.  They are usually set up as a point-of-use dryer and provide the best service when used in a second or third stage role.  The delicate nature of the equipment and how it is used makes them generally unsuitable for more mainstream or industrial applications.

'''Dancing Dots Braille Music Technology''', L.P., is an American company based in [[Philadelphia]] that was founded in 1992 to develop and adapt music technology for the blind. Its founder, Bill McCann, is a blind musician. Among the products it offers are several programs that produce a musical version of [[Braille]] by converting print [[musical notation]], allowing blind musicians access to the [[Sheet music|scores]] used by their sighted counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rudolph | first = Thomas E. | title = Teaching Music With Technology | publisher = GIA Publications | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-57999-313-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OnPnMsWOkVAC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22Dancing+Dots%22&amp;client=firefox-a | page = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also offers programs that aid blind musicians in [[Transcription (music)|transcribing]] their compositions to Braille.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams |first=John M. |title=Blind musicians get a techno boost |work=[[Business Week]] |date=2000-11-19 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2000/nf20001129_316.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523214017/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2000/nf20001129_316.htm |archivedate=2011-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing Dots created the latter products to help speed the process of Braille transcription for blind composers, who might otherwise have to wait between two weeks and six months to have their compositions transcribed by one of the less than one hundred certified Braille music transcribers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Solomon | first = Karen | date = 2000-02-24 | title = You gotta feel the music | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2008-10-26 | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/02/34495}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing Dots has developed more products to help blind musicians in the areas of [[MIDI]] and [[digital audio]] production and musical instruction.

==History==
The company was founded in 1992 by Bill McCann, a blind [[trumpeter]]. It struggled financially in its early years in the long lead between developing technology and releasing its first product in 1997, a difficult period assisted by federal contracts beginning in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Byrd | first = Jerry W. | title = U.S. says customer is king | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB2A64F8AAB5388&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | date = 1994-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the company released its GOODFEEL Braille Music Translator to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Jennifer | date = 1997-06-15 | title = Software Hits Right Note for Blind Musicians; Technology: GOODFEEL program translates music into Braille.

==Products and services==
Dancing Dots maintains a website at which it markets its products, as well as related and complementary products by other companies. Dancing Dots has customers throughout the U.S. and twenty-six other countries.

With GOODFEEL combined with a few mainstream products, sighted musicians can prepare a Braille score with no knowledge of braille. Music scanning software can be used to speed data entry. Blind users can make sound recordings and print and Braille editions of their compositions. The company provides customers who may not need to purchase their own copy of GOODFEEL a transcription service for individual scores.

Dancing Dots is also the publisher of several courses to assist blind musicians, including ''An Introduction to Music for the Blind Student: A Course in Braille Music Reading'' and ''An Introduction to the Piano for the Blind Student''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">The '''digital commons''' are a form of [[commons]] involving the distribution and communal ownership of [[Information technology|informational resources]] and [[technology]]. Resources are typically designed to be used by the community by which they are created.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, Felix. ''Digital Commons: A dictionary entry''. http://felix.openflows.com/node/137. 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the digital commons include [[wiki]]s, [[open-source software]], and [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. The distinction between digital commons and other digital resources is that the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources.&lt;ref name="onlinecreation.info"&gt;Fuster Morell, M. (2010, p. 5). Dissertation: Governance of online creation communities: Provision of infrastructure for the building of digital commons. http://www.onlinecreation.info/?page_id=338&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital commons provides the community with free and easy access to information. Typically, information created in the digital commons is designed to stay in the digital commons by using various forms of licensing, including the [[GNU General Public License]] and various [[Creative Commons]] licenses.

== Early development ==

One of the first examples of digital commons is the [[Free Software movement]], founded in the 1980s by [[Richard Stallman]] as an organized attempt to create a digital software commons. Inspired by the 70s programmer culture of improving software through mutual help, Stallman's movement was designed to encourage the use and distribution of free software.&lt;ref name="bollier"&gt;Bollier, David. ''Viral Spiral. How the Commoners Built a Digital Republic of Their Own''. New York, London, New Press http://www.learcenter.org/pdf/ViralSpiral.pdf, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent the misuse of software created by the movement, Stallman founded the [[GNU General Public License]]. Free software released under this license, even if it is improved or modified, must also be released under the same license, ensuring the software stays in the digital commons, free to use.

== Today ==
Today the digital commons takes the form of the Internet. With the internet come radical new ways to share information and software, enabling the rapid growth of the digital commons to the level enjoyed today. People and organisations can share their software, photos, general information, and ideas extremely easily due to the digital commons.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Rishab Aiyer. ''CODE: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy''. Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayo Fuster Morell]] proposed a definition of digital commons as "information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources".&lt;ref name="onlinecreation.info"/&gt;

The [[Foundation for P2P Alternatives]] explicitly aims to "creates a new public domain, an information commons, which should be protected and extended, especially in the domain of common knowledge creation" and actively promotes extending [[Creative Commons Licenses]].&lt;ref&gt;http://p2pfoundation.net/P2P_Foundation:About&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the [[Zero Marginal Cost Society]], the [[Commons Transition]] and the transition to a digital commons in particular, appears to be inevitable. Critics observe the tension between contributing to the digital Commons, which is fundamentally abundant, and making a living, which is based on scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;See for example http://kamiel.creativechoice.org/2015/09/10/will-work-for-the-commons/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern examples ==

=== Creative Commons ===
[[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization that provides many free copyright licenses with which contributors to the digital commons can license their work. Creative Commons is focused on the expansion of flexible [[copyright]]. For example, popular image sharing sites like [[Flickr]] and [[Pixabay]], provide access to hundreds of millions of Creative Commons licensed images, freely available within the digital commons.&lt;ref name="walljasper"&gt;Walljasper, Jay. ''All That We Share: How to save the Economy, the Environment, the Internet, Democracy, Our Communities, and Everything Else That Belongs to All of Us.'' New York: New, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Creators of content in the digital commons can choose the type of Creative Commons license to apply to their works, which specifies the types of rights available to other users.  Typically, Creative Commons licenses are used to restrict the work to non-commercial use.&lt;ref name="walljasper"/&gt;

=== Wikis ===
[[Wiki]]s are a huge contribution to the digital commons, serving information while allowing members of the community to create and edit content. Through wikis, knowledge can be pooled and compiled, generating a wealth of information from which the community can draw.

=== Public software repositories ===
Following in the spirit of the [[Free Software movement]], [[Software repositories|public software repositories]] are a system in which communities can work together on open-source software projects, typically through [[version control]] systems such as [[Git (software)|Git]] and [[Subversion]]. Public software repositories allow for individuals make contributions to the same project, allowing the project to grow bigger than the sum of its parts. A popular platform hosting public and open source software repositories is [[GitHub]].

=== City Top Level Domains ===
Top Level Domains or TLDs are Internet resources that facilitate finding the numbered computers on the Internet. The largest and most familiar TLD is .com. Beginning in 2012, ICANN, the California not-for-profit controlling access to the Domain Name System, began issuing names to cities. More than 30 cities applied for their TLDs, with .paris, .london, .nyc, .tokyo having been issued as of May 2015. A detailing of some commons names within the .nyc TLD includes neighborhood names, voter related names, and civic names.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coactivate.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/commons.nyc&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital reproduction''' is one form of data [[reproduction]] which is based on the [[Digital data|digital]] data model. The advantage of digital reproduction of data over analogue reproduction is its [[lossless]] quality. Reproducing analogue data is inherently [[lossy]], because every (electronic) component involved in any analogue reproduction process can introduce noise to the final result.

Compare [[analogue processing]] to [[digital processing]].

'''Electro-optical MASINT''' is a subdiscipline of Measurement and Signature Intelligence, (MASINT) and refers to [[list of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence gathering]] activities which bring together disparate elements that do not fit within the definitions of [[Signals Intelligence]] (SIGINT), [[Imagery Intelligence]] (IMINT), or [[HUMINT|Human Intelligence]] (HUMINT).

Electro-optical MASINT has similarities to IMINT, but is distinct from it. IMINT's primary goal is to create a picture, composed of visual elements understandable to a trained user. Electro-optical MASINT helps validate that picture, so that, for example, the analyst can tell if an area of green is vegetation or camouflage paint. Electro-optical MASINT also generates information on phenomena that emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic energy in the [[infrared]], [[visible light]], or [[ultraviolet]] spectra, phenomena where a "picture" is less important than the amount or type of energy reported. For example, a class of satellites, originally intended to give early warning of rocket launches based on the heat of their exhaust, reports energy wavelengths and strength as a function of location(s). There would be no value, in this specific context, to seeing a photograph of the flames coming out of the rocket.

Subsequently, when the geometry between the rocket exhaust and the sensor permits a clear view of the exhaust, IMINT would give a visual or infrared picture of its shape, while electro-optical MASINT would give, either as a list of coordinates with characteristics, or a "false-color" image, the temperature distribution, and [[spectroscopic]] information on its composition.

In other words, MASINT may give warning before characteristics visible to IMINT are clear, or it may help validate or understand the pictures taken by IMINT.

MASINT techniques are not limited to the United States, but the U.S. distinguishes MASINT sensors from others more than do other nations. According to the [[United States Department of Defense]], MASINT is technically derived intelligence (excluding traditional imagery [[IMINT]] and signals intelligence [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]]) that – when collected, processed, and analyzed by dedicated MASINT systems – results in intelligence that detects, tracks, identifies, or describes the signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  MASINT was recognized as a formal intelligence discipline in 1986.&lt;ref name =IOSS-2&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to describe MASINT is "a 'non-literal' discipline. It feeds on a target's unintended emissive byproducts, the 'trails' of thermal energy, chemical or radio frequency emission that an object leaves in its wake. These trails form distinct signatures, which can be exploited as reliable discriminators to characterize specific events or disclose hidden targets".&lt;ref name=Lum&gt;

As with many branches of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT defined by the Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into Electro-optical, Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and Radiofrequency disciplines.&lt;ref name = CSMR&gt;

MASINT collection technologies in this area use radar, lasers, staring arrays in the infrared and visual, to point sensors at the information of interest. As opposed to IMINT, MASINT electro-optical sensors do not create pictures. Instead, they would indicate the coordinates, intensity, and spectral characteristics of a light source, such as a rocket engine, or a missile reentry vehicle. Electro-optical MASINT involves obtaining information from emitted or reflected energy, across the wavelengths of infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Electro-optical techniques  include measurement of the radiant intensities, dynamic motion, and the materials composition of a target. These measurements put the target in spectral and spatial contexts. Sensors used in electro-optical MASINT include radiometers, spectrometers, non-literal imaging systems, lasers, or laser radar (LIDAR).&lt;ref name=FM2-0Ch9&gt;

Observation of foreign missile tests, for example, make extensive use of MASINT along with other disciplines. For example, electro-optical and radar tracking establish trajectory, speed, and other flight characteristics that can be used to validate the [[TELINT]] telemetry intelligence being received by SIGINT sensors. Electro-optical sensors, which guide radars, operate on  aircraft, ground stations, and ships.

==Airborne electro-optical missile tracking MASINT==

U.S. [[RC-135]]S COBRA BALL aircraft have MASINT sensors that are "…two linked electro-optical sensors—the Real Time Optics System (RTOS) and the Large Aperture Tracker System (LATS). RTOS consists of an array of staring sensors encompassing a wide field of regard for target acquisition. LATS serves as an adjunct tracker. Due to its large aperture, it has significantly greater sensitivity and resolving power than the RTOS, but is otherwise similar.&lt;ref name=COBRABALL&gt;

[[Image:RC-135 Cobra Ball aircraft parked at Offutt.jpg|thumb|Two Cobra Ball aircraft on the flightline at [[Offutt Air Force Base]], Nebraska.]] There is a broader program to standardize the architecture of the various RC-135 aircraft, so that there will be greater commonality of parts, and some ability to switch missions: a COBRA BALL will be able to carry out some SIGINT missions of the [[RC-135#RC-135V/W Rivet Joint|RIVET JOINT]] RC-135.

COBRA BALL [[MASINT#Cueing|cues]] the COBRA DANE ground radar and the COBRA JUDY ship-based radar. See [[Radar MASINT]]

==Tactical counter-artillery sensors==
Both electro-optical and radar sensors have been coupled with acoustic sensors in modern counter-artillery systems. Electro-optical sensors are directional and precise, so need to be cued by acoustic or other omnidirectional sensors. The original [[Canada|Canadian]] sensors, in the [[First World War]], used electro-optical flash as well as geophysical sound sensors.

===Purple Hawk===
Complementing [[Radar MASINT#Counterartillery Radar|counter-mortar radar]] is the [[Israel]]i Purple Hawk mast-mounted electro-optical sensor, which detects mortars and provides perimeter security. The device, remotely operated via fiber optics or microwave, is intended to have a laser designator.&lt;ref&gt;

===Rocket launch spotter===
A newer U.S. system couples an electro-optical and an acoustic system to produce the Rocket Artillery Launch Spotter (RLS).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; RLS combines components from two existing systems, the Tactical Aircraft Directed Infra-Red Countermeasures (TADIRCM) and the UTAMS . The two-color infrared sensors were originally designed to detect surface-to-air missiles for TADIRCM. Other TADIRCM components also have been adapted to RLS, including the computer processors, inertial navigation units (INU), and detection and tracking algorithms.

It is an excellent example of [[MASINT#Cueing|automatic cueing]] of one sensor by another. Depending on the application, the sensitive but less selective sensor is either acoustic or non-imaging electro-optical. The selective sensor is [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR).

[[Image:MASINT-RocketLaunchSpotter.png|thumb|left |Electro-optical components of Rocket Launch Spotter system]]

RLS uses two TADIRCM sensors, an INU, and a smaller field-of-view single-color (FLIR) camera on each tower.  The INU, which contains a GPS receiver, allows the electro-optical sensors to align to the azimuth and elevation of any detected threat signature.

The basic system mode is for rocket detection, since a rocket launch gives a bright flare. In basic operation, RLS has electro-optical systems on three towers, separated by 2 to 3 kilometers, to give omnidirectional coverage. The tower equipment connects to the control stations using a wireless network.

When a sensor measures a potential threat, the control station determines if it correlates with another measurement to give a threat signature.  When a threat is recognized, RLS triangulates the optical signal and presents the Point of Origin (POO) on a map display. The nearest tower FLIR camera then is cued to the threat signature, giving the operator real-time video within 2 seconds of detection.  When not in RLS mode, the FLIR cameras are available to the operator as surveillance cameras.

[[Image:MASINT-UTAMStower.png|thumb|UTAMS-RLS tower head]]

Mortar launches do not produce as strong an electro-optical signature as does a rocket, so RLS relies on acoustic signature cueing from an [[Geophysical MASINT#UTAMS|Unattended Transient Acoustic Measurement and Signal Intelligence System (UTAMS)]]. There is an UTAMS array at the top of each of the three RLS towers. The tower heads can be rotated remotely.

Each array consists of four microphones and processing equipment. Analyzing the time delays between an acoustic wavefront's interaction with each microphone in the array UTAMS provides an azimuth of origin. The azimuth from each tower is reported to the UTAMS processor at the control station, and a POO is triangulated and displayed. The UTAMS subsystem can also detect and locate the point of impact (POI), but, due to the difference between the speeds of sound and light, it may take UTAMS as long as 30 seconds to determine the POO for a rocket launch 13&amp;nbsp;km away. This means UTAMS may detect a rocket POI prior to the POO, providing very little if any warning time. but the electro-optical component of RLS will detect the rocket POO earlier.

==Infrared MASINT==
While infrared IMINT and MASINT operate in the same wavelengths, MASINT does not "take pictures" in the conventional sense, but it can validate IMINT pictures. Where an ''IR IMINT'' sensor would take a picture that fills a frame, the ''IR MASINT'' sensor gives a list, by coordinate, of IR wavelengths and energy. A classic example of validation would be analyzing the detailed optical spectrum of a green area in a photograph:  is the green from natural plant life, or is it camouflage paint?

The Army's AN/GSQ-187 Improved Remote Battlefield Sensor System (I-REMBASS) contains a Passive Infrared Sensor, DT-565/GSQ, which "detects tracked or wheeled vehicles and personnel. It also provides information on which to base a count of objects passing through its detection zone and reports their direction of travel relative to its location. The monitor uses two different [magnetic and passive infrared] sensors and their identification codes to determine direction of travel.

Similar systems are now available in Army helicopters and armored fighting vehicles.

==Optical measurement of nuclear explosions==
There are several distinctive characteristics, in the range of visible light, from nuclear explosions. One of these is a characteristic "dual flash" measured by a [[bhangmeter]]. This went into routine use on the [[Vela (satellite)|advanced Vela]] nuclear detection satellites, first launched in 1967. The earlier Velas only detected X-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.

The bhangmeter technique was used earlier, in 1961, aboard a modified US KC-135B aircraft monitoring the preannounced Soviet test of [[Tsar Bomba]], the largest nuclear explosion ever detonated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US test monitoring, which carried both broadband electromagnetic and optical sensors including a bhangmeter, was named SPEEDLIGHT.

As part of Operation BURNING LIGHT, one MASINT system photographed the nuclear clouds of French atmospheric nuclear tests to measure their density and opacity.&lt;ref name=SAC1971&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This operation is borderline with [[Nuclear MASINT]].

Bhangmeters on Advanced Vela satellites detected what is variously called the [[Vela Incident]] or South Atlantic Incident, on 22 September 1979. Different reports have claimed that it was, or was not, a nuclear test, and, if it was, probably involved South Africa and possibly Israel. France and Taiwan have also been suggested. Only one bhangmeter detected the characteristic double-flash, although US Navy hydrophones suggest a low-yield blast. Other sensors were negative or equivocal, and no definitive explanation has yet been made public.

==Schlieren Photography==
[[Schlieren Photography]] can be used to detect [[Stealth aircraft]], [[UAV]], and missile flights even after engine cutoff.  [[Schlieren]] analysis is based on the principle that any disturbances to the surrounding air may be detected (the [[Schlieren effect]]), like the shadow cast by the sun through the steam and hot air from a hot coffee, or even the [[Mirage]] wave effect caused by the hot air on pavement on a summer day.  It is essentially the reverse of [[Adaptive optics]], rather than minimizing the effect of [[Astronomical seeing|atmospheric disturbance]], Schlieren detection capitalizes on that effect. This form of MASINT is both optical and geophysical because of the optical detection of a [[geophysical]] ([[atmospheric]]) effect. Schlieren photography may be used to provide an early warning of an imminent threat or impending attack, and if sufficiently advanced, may be used in the elimination of stealth targets.

==Laser MASINT==
This discipline includes both measuring the performance of lasers of interest, and using lasers as part of MASINT sensors. With respect to foreign lasers, focus of the collection is on laser detection, laser threat warning, and precise measurement of the frequencies, power levels, wave propagation, determination of power source, and other technical and operating characteristics associated with laser systems strategic and tactical weapons, range finders, and illuminators.&lt;ref name=FM2-0Ch9 /&gt;

In addition to passive measurements of other lasers, the MASINT system can use active lasers (LIDAR) for distance measurements, but also for destructive remote sensing that provides energized material for spectroscopy.  Close-in lasers could do chemical (i.e., materials MASINT) analysis of samples vaporized by lasers.

Laser systems are largely at a proof of concept level.&lt;ref name=OSD-UASR-2005 /&gt;  One promising area is a synthetic imaging system that would be able to create images through forest canopy, but the current capability is much less than existing SAR or EO systems.

A more promising approach would image through obscurations such as dust, cloud, and haze, particularly in urban environments. The laser illuminator would send a pulse, and the receiver would capture only the first photons to return, minimizing scattering and blooming.

Use of LIDAR for precision elevation and mapping is much closer, and again chiefly in urban situations.

==Spectroscopic MASINT==

Spectroscopy can be applied either to targets that are already excited, such as an engine exhaust, or stimulated with a laser or other energy source. It is not an imaging technique, although it can be used to extract greater information from images.

Where an ''IMINT'' sensor would take a picture that fills a frame, the ''Spectroscopic MASINT'' sensor gives a list, by coordinate, of wavelengths and energy. Multispectral IMINT is likely to discriminate more wavelengths, especially if it extends into the IR or UV, than a human being, even with an excellent color sense, could discriminate.

The results plot energy versus frequency. A spectral plot represents radiant intensity versus wavelength at an instant in time. The number of spectral bands in a sensor system determines the amount of detail that can be obtained about the source of the object being viewed. Sensor systems range from

:*multispectral (2 to 100 bands) to 
:*hyperspectral (100 to 1,000 bands) to 
:*ultraspectral (1,000+ bands).

More bands provide more discrete information, or greater resolution. The characteristic emission and absorption spectra serve to fingerprint or define the makeup of the feature that was observed. A '''radiometric plot''' represents the radiant intensity versus time; there can be plots at multiple bands or wavelengths. For each point along a time-intensity radiometric plot, a spectral plot can be generated based on the number of spectral bands in the collector, such as the radiant intensity plot of a missile exhaust plume as the missile is in flight. The intensity or brightness of the object is a function of several conditions including its temperature, surface properties or material, and how fast it is moving.&lt;ref name="FM2-0Ch9"/&gt; Remember that additional, non-electro-optical sensors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, can correlate with these bands.

Advancing optical spectroscopy was identified as a high priority by a National Science Foundation workshop&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in supporting counterterrorism and general intelligence community needs. These needs were seen as most critical in the [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] context. The highest priority was increasing the sensitivity of spectroscopic scanners, since, if an attack has not actually taken place, the threat needs to be analyzed remotely. In the real world of attempting early warning, expecting to get a signature of something, which is clearly a weapon, is unrealistic. Consider that the worst chemical poisoning in history was an industrial accident, the [[Bhopal disaster]]. The participants suggested that the "intelligence community must exploit signatures of feedstock materials, precursors, by-products of testing or production, and other inadvertent or unavoidable signatures." False positives are inevitable, and other techniques need to screen them out.

Second to detectability, as a priority was rejecting noise  and background. It is especially difficult for biowarfare agents, which are the greatest WMD challenge to detect by remote sensing rather than laboratory analysis of a sample. Methods may need to depend on signal enhancement, by clandestine dispersion of reagents in the area of interest, which variously could emit or absorb particular spectra. Fluorescent reactions are well known in the laboratory; could they be done remotely and secretly? Other approaches could pump the sample with an appropriately tuned laser, perhaps at several wavelengths. The participants stressed that the need to miniaturize sensors, which might enter the area in question using unmanned sensors, including miniaturized aerial, surface, and even subsurface vehicles.

Electro-optical spectroscopy is one means of chemical detection, especially using non-dispersive [[infrared spectroscopy]] is one MASINT technology that lends itself to early warning of deliberate or actual releases. In general, however, chemical sensors tend to use a combination of [[gas chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]], which are more associated with materials MASINT. See [[Materials MASINT#Chemical Warfare and Improvised Chemical Devices|Chemical Warfare and Improvised Chemical Devices]].

Laser excitation with multispectral return analysis is a promising chemical and possibly biological analysis method.&lt;ref name=OSD-UASR-2005 /&gt;

===Multispectral MASINT===

SYERS 2, on the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft,  is the only operational airborne military multi-spectral sensor, providing 7 bands of visual and infrared imagery at high resolution.&lt;ref name=OSD-UASR-2005 /&gt;

===Hyperspectral MASINT===

Hyperspectral MASINT involves the synthesis of images as seen by visible and near infrared light. US MASINT in this area is coordinated by the  Hyperspectral MASINT Support to Military Operations (HYMSMO) project.  This MASINT technology differs from IMINT in that it attempts to understand the physical characteristics of what is seen, not just what it looks like.&lt;ref name=Gatz&gt;

Hyperspectral imaging typically needs multiple [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence#Basic interaction of energy sources with targets|imaging modalities]]d, such as whiskbroom, pushbroom, tomographic, intelligent filters, and time series.

====Design issues====

Some of the major issues in visible and infrared hyperspectral processing include atmospheric correction, for the visible and short wave infrared.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (0.4–2.5 micrometer) dictate sensor radiances need to be converted to surface reflectances. This dictates a need for measuring, and connecting for:
:*atmospheric absorption and scattering 
:*aerosol optical depth, 
:*water vapor, 
:*correction for the effect of bi-directional reflectance distribution function, 
:*blurring due to the adjacency effect and retrieval of reflectance in shadows.

Hyperspectral, as opposed to multispectral, processing gives the potential of improved spectral signature measurement from airborne and spaceborne sensor platforms. Sensors on these platforms, however, must compensate for atmospheric effects. Such compensation is easiest with high contrast targets sensed through well-behaved atmosphere with even, reliable illumination, the real world will not always be so cooperative.  For more complicated situations, one can not simply compensate for the atmospheric and illumination conditions by taking them out. The Invariant Algorithm for target detection was designed to find many possible combinations of these conditions for the image.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was developedfor radar measurements, but is comparable to other signature development areas for other sensors and may be used for hyperspectral sensing of buried objects.

====Applications====

In applications of intelligence interest, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) has demonstrated that hyperspectral sensing allows discrimination of refined signatures, based on a large number of narrow frequency bands across a wide spectrum.&lt;ref name=Kolodner&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques can identify include military vehicle paints, characteristic of particular countries' signatures. They can differentiate camouflage from real vegetation. By detecting disturbances in earth, they can detect a wide variety of both excavation and buried materials. Roads and surfaces that have been lightly or heavily trafficked will produce different measurements than the reference signatures.
 
It can detect specific types of foliage supporting drug-crop identification; disturbed soil supporting the identification of mass graves, minefields, caches, underground facilities or cut foliage; and variances in soil, foliage, and hydrologic features often supporting NBC contaminant detection. This was done previously with false-color infrared photographic film, but electronics are faster and more flexible.&lt;ref name=Gatz/&gt;

=====Minefield detection=====

JHU/APL target-detection algorithms have been applied to the Army Wide Area Airborne Minefield Detection (WAAMD) program's desert and forest. By using the COMPASS and AHI hyperspectral sensors, robust detection of both surface and buried minefields is achieved with very low false alarm rates.

=====Underground construction=====

Hyperspectral imaging can detect disturbed earth and foliage. In concert with other methods such as [[Radar MASINT#Coherent change detection (CCD)|coherent change detection radar]], which can precisely measure changes in the height of the ground surface. Together, these can detect underground construction.

While still at a research level, [[Geophysical MASINT#Gravitimetric MASINT|Gravitimetric MASINT]] can, with these other MASINT sensors, give precise location information for deeply buried command centers, WMD facilities, and other critical target. It remains a truism that once a target can be located, it can be killed. "Bunker-buster" nuclear weapons are not needed when multiple precision guided bombs can successively deepen a hole until the no-longer-protected structure is reached.

=====Urban spectral target detection=====

Using data collected over US cities by the Army COMPASS and Air Force SPIRITT sensors, JHU/APL target detection algorithms are being applied to urban hyperspectral signatures. The ability to robustly detect unique spectral targets in urban areas denied for ground inspection, with limited ancillary information will assist in the development and deployment of future operational hyperspectral systems overseas.&lt;ref name="Kolodner"/&gt;

=====Mass graves=====

Peace operations and war crimes investigation may require the detection of often-clandestine mass graves. Clandestinity makes it difficult to get witness testimony, or use technologies that require direct access to the suspected grave site (e.g., ground penetrating radar). Hyperspectral imaging from aircraft or satellites can provide remotely sensed reflectance spectra to help detect such graves. Imaging of an experimental mass grave and a real-world mass grave show that hyperspectral remote imaging is a powerful method for finding mass graves in real time, or, in some cases, retrospectively.&lt;ref name=Kalacska&gt;

=====Ground order-of-battle target detection=====

JHU/APL target detection algorithms have been applied to the HYMSMO desert and forest libraries, and can reveal camouflage, concealment and deception protecting ground military equipment. Other algorithms have been demonstrated, using  HYDICE data, that they can identify lines of communication based on the disturbance of roads and other ground surfaces.&lt;ref name="Kolodner"/&gt;

=====Biomass estimation=====
Knowing the fractions of vegetation and soil is of helps estimate the biomass. Biomass is not extremely important for military operations, but gives information for national-level economic and environmental intelligence. Detailed hyperspectral imagery  such as the leaf chemical content (nitrogen, proteins, lignin and water) can be relevant to counterdrug surveillance.&lt;ref name=Borel&gt;

==Space-based staring infrared sensors==

The US, in 1970, launched the first of a series of space-based [[staring array]] sensors that detected and located infrared heat signatures, typically from rocket motors but also from other intense heat sources. Such signatures, which are associated with measurement of energy and location, are not pictures in the IMINT sense. Currently called the Satellite Early Warning System (SEWS), the program is the descendant of several generations of [[Defense Support Program]] (DSP) spacecraft. The USSR/[[Russia]]n [[US-KMO]] spacecraft has been described, by US sources, as having similar capabilities to DSP.&lt;ref name=IOSS3&gt;

[[Image:STS-44 DSP deployment.jpg|thumb|220px|DSP satellite deployment during [[STS-44]]]]

Originally intended to detect the intense heat of an [[ICBM]] launch, this system proved useful at a theater level in 1990-1991. It detected the launch of Iraqi [[Scud]] missiles in time to give early warning to potential targets.

==Shallow water operations==

Several new technologies will be needed for shallow-water naval operations.&lt;ref name=NASCGER-91/&gt;  Since acoustic sensors (i.e., passive hydrophones and active sonar) perform less effectively in shallow waters than in the open seas, there is a strong pressure to develop additional sensors.

One family of techniques, which will require electro-optical sensors to detect, is bioluminescence: light generated by the movement of a vessel through plankton and other marine life.  Another family, which may be solved with electro-optical methods, radar, or a combination, is detecting wakes of surface vessels, as well as effects on the water surface caused by underwater vessels and weapons.

The '''European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service''' ('''EGNOS''') is a [[satellite based augmentation system]] (SBAS) developed by the [[European Space Agency]] and [[EUROCONTROL]] on behalf of the [[European Commission]]. It supplements the [[GPS]], [[GLONASS]] and [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]]  by reporting on the reliability and accuracy of their positioning data and sending out corrections. 

EGNOS consists of a network of about 40 ground stations and 3 [[geostationary satellite]]s. Ground stations determine accuracy data of the satellite navigation systems and transfer it to the geostationary satellites; users may freely obtain this data from those satellites using an EGNOS-enabled receiver, or over the internet. One main use of the system is in [[aviation]].

According to specifications, horizontal position accuracy when using EGNOS-provided corrections should be better than seven metres. In practice, the horizontal position accuracy is at the metre level. 

Similar service is provided in North America by the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), and in Asia, by Japan's [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS) and India's [[GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation]] (GAGAN).

==History and roadmap==
The system started its initial operations in July 2005, with accuracy better than two metres and availability above 99%.  As of July 2005, EGNOS has been broadcasting a continuous signal, and at the end of July 2005 the system was again used to track cyclists in the [[Tour de France]] road race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/The_present_-_EGNOS/What_is_EGNOS|title=What is EGNOS?|date=2 August 2013|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the European Commission announced it had signed a contract with the company [[European Satellite Services Provider]] to run EGNOS. The official start of operations was announced by the European Commission on 1 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/The_present_-_EGNOS/EGNOS_Open_Service_available_a_new_era_for_European_navigation_begins_today|title=EGNOS 'Open Service' available: a new era for European navigation begins today|date=1 October 2009|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was certified for use in safety of life applications in March 2011.&lt;ref name="ESA20110302"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/The_present_-_EGNOS/EGNOS_navigation_system_begins_serving_Europe_s_aircraft|title=EGNOS navigation system begins serving Europe's aircraft|date=2 March 2011|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An EGNOS Data Access Service became available in July 2012.

Initial work to extend EGNOS coverage to the Southern Africa region is being done under a project called ESESA - EGNOS Service Extension to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esesa.org/about/index.php|title=What is ESESA?|publisher=ESESA|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission is defining the roadmap for the evolution of the EGNOS mission. This roadmap should cope with legacy and new missions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navipedia.org/index.php/EGNOS_Future_and_Evolutions|title=EGNOS Future and Evolutions|date=16 October 2015|publisher=[[ESA]] / NAVIPEDIA|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2011-2030: En-route / NPA / APV1 / LPV200 service based on augmentation of GPS L1 only. The Safety Of Life (SoL) will be guaranteed up to 2030 in compliance with ICAO SBAS SARPS.
*2020+: It is planned that EGNOS will experiment with a major evolution by 2020, EGNOS V3, including the fulfilment of the SBAS L1/L5 standard, expansion to dual-frequency, and evolution toward a multi-constellation concept.

Similar to [[WAAS]], EGNOS is mostly designed for [[aviation]] users who enjoy unperturbed reception of direct signals from [[geostationary satellite]]s up to very high [[latitude]]s. The use of EGNOS on the ground, especially in urban areas, is limited due to relatively low [[elevation]] of [[geostationary satellite]]s: about 30° above [[horizon]] in central [[Europe]] and much less in the North of Europe. To address this problem, [[ESA]] released in 2002 SISNeT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Signal-in-Space_through_the_Internet|title=Signal-in-Space through the Internet|date=19 September 2002|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egnos-pro.esa.int/sisnet/publications.html|title=SISNeT - related publications|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Internet]] service designed for continuous delivery of EGNOS signals to ground users. The first experimental SISNeT receiver was created by the [[Finnish Geodetic Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Navigate_via_the_web_with_the_SISNeT_receiver|title=Navigate via the web with the SISNeT receiver|date=6 September 2002|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial SISNeT receivers have been developed by [[Septentrio]]. PRN #136 was  placed into the Operational Platform from 23/08/2018 at 10:00 UTC and PRN #120 was placed into Test Platform from 30/08/2018 at 13:00 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/The_present_-_EGNOS/Satellite_navigation_receiver_uses_EGNOS_signals_delivered_via_Internet|title=Satellite navigation receiver uses EGNOS signals delivered via Internet|date=25 October 2005|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground stations==
[[File:EGNOS RIMS BRN.jpg|200px|thumb|EGNOS RIMS "BRN" (Berlin) close to [[Berlin]]]]

More than 40 ground stations are linked together to create EGNOS network which consists:

* 40 RIMS ('''R'''anging and '''I'''ntegrity '''M'''onitoring '''S'''tations): receiving signals from US GPS satellites,
* 4 MCC ('''M'''ission '''C'''ontrol '''C'''enters):  data processing and differential corrections counting,
* 6 NLES ('''N'''avigation '''L'''and '''E'''arth '''S'''tations):  accuracy and reliability data sending to three geostationary satellite transponders to allow end-user devices to receive them.

==Aviation==

In March 2011, the EGNOS Safety-of-Life Service was deemed acceptable for use in aviation. This allows pilots throughout Europe to use the EGNOS system as a form of positioning during an approach, and allows pilots to land the aircraft in [[Instrument meteorological conditions|IMC]] using a GPS approach. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/The_present_-_EGNOS/What_is_EGNOS&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2014 LPV ([[Localizer performance with vertical guidance]]) landing procedures, which are EGNOS-enabled, were available at more than 114 airports across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.europa.eu/news/gothenburg-city-airport-pioneers-lpv-approach-sweden|title=Gothenburg City Airport pioneers LPV approach in Sweden|publisher=[[European GNSS Agency]]|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beyond"/&gt;

}}'''Flowmaster Ltd.''' was a leading British Engineering Simulation Software company based in Towcester, UK. Its flagship 1D [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] product, also named ‘Flowmaster’, was first released commercially in 1987 although initial versions went back to the early 1980s having originated from BHRA, the not-for-profit British Hydromechanics Research Association, later to become the BHR Group.

Flowmaster 1D thermo-fluid systems simulation software employed a matrix type solver and was the first tool of its type onto the market. It was initially sold and marketed by Amazon Computers Ltd based in Milton Keynes, UK. The software covered many different industries such as [[aerospace]], [[Automotive industry|automotive]], marine, [[oil]] &amp; [[gas]], [[Electricity generation|power generation,]] process, [[Rail transport|rail]] and [[water]].

Flowmaster software itself was based on extensive experimental validation data from [[Donald S. Miller|D. S. Miller]]’s internationally respected scientific textbook, ‘[[Internal Flow Systems]]’, first published in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Internal Flow Systems|last=Miller|first=D. S.|publisher=Mentor Graphics Corp.|year=2014|isbn=978-0956200204|edition=3rd|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A company called Flowmaster International (that later became Flowmaster Ltd) was created in 1992 when Richard Tickle was appointed CEO. During the next ten years Flowmaster experienced significant growth opening international sales offices near Frankfurt, Germany and Chicago, USA.  Richard was followed as CEO by Alan Berry who led the company up to its acquisition in 2012 by Mentor Graphics Corporation where it became part of Mentor’s Mechanical Analysis Division.

The Flowmaster product has subsequently been renamed as FloMASTER by Mentor Graphics in 2016 for its V8 release.

== History ==
[[File:Evolution of User Interfaces for Flowmaster - FloMASTER.png|thumb|330x330px|''Evolution of User Interfaces for Flowmaster/FloMASTER: V0, V1, V3, V5, V7 &amp; V8 (1984-2017)'']]
Development work first commenced on a commercial computer code that would become ‘Flowmaster’ in the period between 1980 and 1984 based on the extensive BHRA research data from [[Donald S. Miller|Don Miller]]’s ‘Internal Flow Systems’ for pipework and ducting. Flowmaster V1.0 was subsequently released commercially in 1987. It was the first general purpose 1D CFD flow solver, having ‘pick and drop’ components and an interactive user interface with “joystick” control; all innovations for their time. Its first customer was [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering|Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd]]. in the UK. By 2002, the 1,000th commercial license of Flowmaster was purchased by [[Tokyo Gas|Tokyo Gas Company Ltd]].

Flowmaster V1 was released in 1987.

Flowmaster V2 was released in 1990.

Flowmaster V3 was released in 1993.

Flowmaster V4 was released in 1995.

Flowmaster V5 was released in 1997.

Flowmaster V6 was released in 1999.

Flowmaster V7 was released in 2007.

FloMASTER (Flowmaster) V8 was released in 2016.

Flowmaster helped to pioneer software for virtual hybrid electric vehicles with its integration into the USA-based NREL ‘ADVISOR’ program that sought to simulate a complete vehicle cooling system in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, R., &amp; Burke, J., “Detailed VTMS Modeling in ADVISOR through Integration with FLOWMASTER2”, ADVISOR User Conference Proceedings, August 2000, Costa Mesa, USA, p162-168.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has evolved into the concept of “[[Digital Twins|digital twins]]” which today is a major driving force in many industries.

[[File:Flowmaster in 1987.png|thumb|319x319px|''Flowmaster in 1987'']]Flowmaster has been added to over the years including the application of the Method of Characteristics to compressible pipe flow systems, a new approach to the modeling of AC components, the first commercial co-simulation link between 1D and 3D CFD software &lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, T.G., Sapsford, S.M. and Butler D.J., “Underhood Airflow Prediction Using VECTIS Coupled to a 1D System Model”, Proceedings of 5th Ricardo Software International Users Conference, Shoreham-by-Sea, UK 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and control models were added in 1999. Industry specific variants of Flowmaster for Automotive, Aerospace, Power and Energy and Gas Turbines and were released from 2007 – 2016.

After Flowmaster Ltd was acquired by Mentor Graphics Corporation in 2012 the software has been enhanced numerically and upgraded such that FloMASTER V8 was launched in December 2016 with Organic Rankine Cycle enhancements for Waste Heat Recovery &lt;ref&gt;Streater, S., “Meeting The Challenge of Organic Rankine Cycle Based Waste Heat Recovery Simulation”, NAFEMS UK Conference, Telford, UK, June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; predictions, a new user interface ‘Launchpad’ experience, plus a new integrated 1D-3D CFD workflow that allows for accelerated Simulation Based Characterization (SBC) of multi-arm 3D components inside the 1D systems simulation environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bornoff, R., “Simulation Based Characterization. A 3D to 1D System Level Thermo-Fluid CFD Workflow”, Mentor Graphics White Paper, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product ==
Flowmaster is a general purpose 1D [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) code for modeling and analysis of [[fluid mechanics]] in complex piping and ducting systems of any scale. It is a thermo-fluid systems engineering package that has the ability to simulate flows of gases and liquids, [[heat]] and [[mass transfer]], moving bodies, [[two-phase flow]]s and [[Fluid–structure interaction|fluid-structure interaction]] (FSI) through [[Computer simulation|computational modeling]] [[algorithm]]s. It uses a [[Method of characteristics|Method of Characteristics]] solver that allows it to handle accurately fluid transients in complex systems and systems-of-systems such as pressure surge and ‘[[water hammer]]’. It also has an advanced gas turbine secondary air modeling capability.&lt;ref&gt;Tondello, G., Boruszewski, W., Mengele, F., Assato, M., Shimizu S. &amp; Ziegler, S., “Coupled Simulation of the Secondary Air Flow, Heat Transfer, and Structural Deflection of a Gas Turbine Engine”, ASME Turbo Expo Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition, Copenhagen, Denmark, June 11–15, 2012, pp. 2295-2303.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Typical FloMASTER 1D thermo-fluid automotive engine fuel injection system.jpg|thumb|315x315px|''Typical FloMASTER 1D thermo-fluid automotive engine fuel injection system''|center]]

== Technology ==
FloMASTER simulates 1D thermo-fluid systems and complex systems-of-systems through:

'''Empirical Data:'''  The code is underpinned by [[Donald S. Miller|D.S. Miller]]’s '[[Internal Flow Systems]]' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; component and fluids data plus Wylie and Streeter’s 'Fluid Transients in Systems' &lt;ref&gt;Wylie, E. B., &amp; Streeter, V. L., “Fluid Transients in Systems”, 2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1985, {{ISBN|0070622426}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that both allow for simulations to be initiated before detailed design information exists. The 1D model can then evolve according to the user’s requirements.

'''Solver:''' Steady state analysis for pressure drop, flow and heat balance calculations to the same model can then be used for dynamic simulations such as pressure surge and water hammer behavior. The solver has embedded ‘parametrics’ for design iterations, and a SQL [[relational database]] to store and track all models, results, and performance data.

'''Integration:''' Open APIs allow for the direct integration with product development tools and systems, including optimization codes, [[MATLAB]] and other CAE codes.

'''Software Development Kit (SDK):''' A suite of tools that enable FloMASTER to be integrated with product development tools and systems, including optimization tools such as Optimus, Control Modeling tools such as Simulink and other CAE tools. Integration is facilitated through an open API which supports COM and .NET as well as through an embedded script editor which allows creation of native macros, scripts and plug-ins.

'''1D-3D CFD:''' [[Model-based design|Model-Based Design]] (MBD) and Simulation-Based Characterization (SBC) features that allow for modeling of components for which data is either difficult to obtain, or non-existent in a 1D sense, to be created.  Examples include multi-arm junctions and non-standard ducts and bends. The SBC approach leads to a virtual ‘flow [[test bench]]’ inside the Mentor Graphics FloEFD 3D CFD tool to extend the FloMASTER component catalog.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''glory hole''' in the context of the offshore petroleum industry is an excavation into the sea floor designed to protect the [[wellhead]] equipment installed at the surface of a [[oil well|petroleum well]] from [[icebergs]] or [[pack ice]].  An economically attractive alternative for exploiting offshore petroleum resources is a [[Floating oil production system|floating platform]]; however, ice can pose a serious hazard to this solution.  While floating platforms can be built to withstand ice loading up to a design threshold, for the largest icebergs or the thickest pack ice the only sensible alternative is to move out of the way.  Floating platforms can be disconnected from the wellheads in order to allow them to be moved away from threatening ice, but the wellhead equipment is fixed in place and hence vulnerable.

The keel of an iceberg or pack ice can extend far below the surface of the water.  If this keel extends deep enough to make contact with the sea floor, it will scour the sea floor as the ice moves with the current.  To protect the wellhead equipment from possible scouring, a glory hole is excavated into the sea floor.  This excavation must be deep enough to allow adequate clearance between the top of the wellhead equipment and the surrounding sea floor.  The resulting glory hole can be either open or cased.  A cased glory hole utilizes steel casing as a retaining wall while an open glory hole is simply an excavation.

Due to the cost of excavating individual glory holes, typically each glory hole will contain several wellheads.  Locating multiple wellheads within a single glory hole is made possible by the use of [[directional drilling]].

==Etymology==

The usage of the term '''glory hole''' in this context almost certainly is taken from its historical usage in the mining industry to refer to excavations.

[[File:Green Bridge System.JPG|thumb|Green bridge system]]
'''Green bridges''' are an [[Ecotechnology|ecotechnological]] [[In_situ#Environmental_engineering|in-situ]] horizontal filtration system. Their different physical and biological filters work in combination to remove suspended and dissolved impurities of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kodarkar|first=Mohan|title=Ecological Restoration of Highly Polluted Stretch of Ahar River, Udaipur &amp; Ecological Improvement of Udaisagar Lake, Rajasthan, India, p. 7|url=http://rcse.edu.shiga-u.ac.jp/gov-pro/plan/2010list/10/indian_lakes/ilbm_impact_story-udaipur%27s_ecological_restoration_of_ahar_river_using_green_bridge_technology__2_.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green bridge filters help in reducing the suspended solids by filtration process, reducing [[Chemical oxygen demand|Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)]]/[[Biochemical oxygen demand|Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)]] by aerobic degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sayali|first=Joshi|title=Ecotechnological Applications for control of lake pollution|url=http://wldb.ilec.or.jp/data/ilec/wlc12/F%20-%20Eutrophication%20and%20its%20Control/F-12.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Bridges also help in the restoration of ecological food chain.

== Development ==
Natural streams, rivers and lakes have their own in-built purification system which consists of natural slopes, stones for biological growth and complex [[food web]] help in the purification process. This food web is nothing but utilization of one's waste by another as its own food. Nature has her own living machinery of detritivorous microbes and other living species to consume wastes. These principles have been harnessed in the treatment of polluted streams.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Green bridges are developed using fibrous material with stones. All the floatable and suspended solids are trapped in this biological bridge and the turbidity of flowing water is reduced. Green plants on the bridges increase the DO level in water, which in turn facilitates the growth of aerobic organisms, which degrade organic pollutants. Sandeep Joshi, director, SERI (Shrishti Eco-Research Institute) has developed this technology and has received a patent for it.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Benefits ==
* Capital expenditure is comparable with the annual operational cost of conventional bioremediation systems.
* Can be developed and operated in combination with conventional systems to improve the performance of the latter.
* Reduce the ecotoxicity of the man-made substances released into the water bodies and facilitate the eco-assimilation of those pollutants into the ecological cycles thus reducing the quantum of hazardous residues to zero which otherwise require costly secured landfill and incineration techniques.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Expected results===
* Solids control : 40–80% reduction
* Pollution control : COD/BOD reduction – 40–90%
* Fecal coliforms control : 50–100% reduction
* Ecotoxicity : Nil
* Dissolved oxygen : Increased by 150% – 1200%
* Aquatic species : 
** Increase in plants/plankton – 200%
** Increase in micro-invertebrates – 200%

Other than the changes in the water quality mentioned above a multifold change in population of avifauna, terrestrial plants along the riverbanks has been noticed. There is an overall odour and mosquito reduction and improvement of river aesthetics. Increase in health status of aquatic life in lentic-lotic system by reduction in ecotoxicity of pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kodarkar|first=Mohan|title=Ecological Restoration of Highly Polluted Stretch of Ahar River, Udaipur &amp; Ecological Improvement of Udaisagar Lake, Rajasthan, India, p. 12|url=http://rcse.edu.shiga-u.ac.jp/gov-pro/plan/2010list/10/indian_lakes/ilbm_impact_story-udaipur%27s_ecological_restoration_of_ahar_river_using_green_bridge_technology__2_.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jackson Barnett No. 11 Oil Well''' was the most productive [[oil well]] in the [[Cushing Oil Field]] of northeastern [[Oklahoma]], to the south of [[Drumright, Oklahoma|Drumright]]. The well was drilled in 1916 in the Shamrock Dome section of the Cushing field by the Gypsy Oil Company, striking oil on February 17. The well was on the land of [[Jackson Barnett]], a [[Muscogee people|Creek]] landowner who subsequently became known as the "world's richest Indian."&lt;ref name=nrhpinv1&gt;{{cite web|last=Sweet|first=Robert|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Jackson Barnett No. 11 Oil Well|url={{NRHP url|id=82003681}}|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=7 May 2013|date=July 21, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnett owned {{convert|160|acre|ha}} in trust [[Creek County, Oklahoma|Creek County]], which began producing oil in 1912. Jackson's 12.5 percent royalty on the oil from his land earned him between $3 million and $4 million during his lifetime, but only received a few hundred dollars per year at first. Until 1920 his fortune was managed as a trust by Creek County courts and the Department of the Interior, on the pretext that Jackson was illiterate and legally incompetent due to a head injury.&lt;ref name=thorne1&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorne|first=Tanis C.|title=The World's Richest Indian: The Scandal Over Jackson Barnett's Oil Fortune|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195182989|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett's money became the subject of extensive litigation and eventual Congressional hearings. In 1920 he was pursued by Anna Laura Lowe, whom he married after one meeting. When a court gave part of the trust's money to Anna to administer, the couple moved to Los Angeles and bought a mansion.&lt;ref name=anb&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thorne|first=Tanis C.|chapter=Barnett, Jackson|title=[[American National Biography]]|chapter-url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01869.html|publisher=Oxford University Press}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well was drilled into the Tucker sand layer at a depth between {{convert|2800|ft|m}} and {{convert|3000|ft|m}}Production on the well's first day was 4,000 barrels, rising to 10,000 barrels a day and peaking at 18,000 barrels per day.  Average production was 10,000 barrels a day for most of its life. It was the first well in the Cushing field to produce 1 million barrels of oil and established the Oklahoma record for production from a single well. The well was capped in the mid-1960s. The site includes concrete foundations, the capped well casing, and a sign. In 1980 eight neighboring wells continued to produce oil.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv1/&gt;

The Jackson Barnett well was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 27, 1982.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

'''LinkedIn Learning''' (formerly lynda.com) is an American [[massive open online course]] website offering video courses taught by industry experts in software, creative, and business skills. It is a subsidiary of [[LinkedIn]].

It was founded in 1995 by Lynda Weinman as ''lynda.com'' before being acquired by LinkedIn in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://readwrite.com/2013/12/03/lynda-weinman-online-education-builders | title=Lynda.com Founder: I Was Educating Online Before Online Education Was Cool | publisher=[[ReadWrite]] | accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] acquired lynda.com's parent company [[Linkedin]] in December 2016.

==History==
LinkedIn Learning was founded as lynda.com was founded in 1995 in [[Ojai, California]], as online support for the books and classes of [[Lynda Weinman]], a special effects animator and multimedia professor who founded a digital arts school with her husband, artist Bruce Heavin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xconomy.com/national/2013/03/28/knowledge-when-you-need-it-lynda-com-and-the-rise-of-online-education/?single_page=true | title=Knowledge When You Need It: Lynda.com and the Rise of Online Education | publisher=[[Xconomy]] | date=2013-03-28 | author=Roush, Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the company began offering courses online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/06/lynda/|title=A Paywall That Pays Off: How Lynda.com Broke All the Rules and Won|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, there were 100 courses, and in 2008, the company began producing and publishing documentaries on creative leaders, artists, and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemeyer/2015/05/12/linkedins-blockbuster-deal-with-lynda-com-what-it-means-to-the-online-learning-industry/3/#|title=LinkedIn's Blockbuster Deal With Lynda.com: What It Means To The Online Learning Industry|last=Meyer|first=Stephen J.|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, LinkedIn Learning (then lynda) received its first outside investment, raising $103 million in growth [[Equity (finance)|equity]] from [[Accel Partners]] and [[Spectrum Equity]], with additional contributions from [[Meritech Capital Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/after-17-years-education-platform-lynda-com-raises-its-first-round-of-funding-103m-from-accel-spectrum/ | title=After 17 Years, Education Platform Lynda.com Raises Its First Round of Funding, $103M From Accel &amp; Spectrum | publisher=TechCrunch | date=2013-01-15 | author=Empson, Rip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2015, LinkedIn Learning (then lynda.com) announced it had raised $186 million in financing, led by investment group [[TPG Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/investors-put-186-million-into-lynda-com-an-online-tutorial-service/?_r=0 | title=Investors Put $186 Million Into Lynda.com, an Online Tutorial Service | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2015-01-14 | author=Singer, Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2015, [[LinkedIn]] announced its intention to buy lynda.com in a deal valued at $1.5 billion, which officially closed on May 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/04/09/lynda-joins-linkedin|title=Welcome to the LinkedIn Family, lynda.com|last=Roslansky|first=Ryan|date=2015-04-09|website=blog.linkedin.com|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site re-branded to "Lynda.com® From LinkedIn".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lynda.com/aboutus/|title=About Us|website=Lynda.com – from LinkedIn|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, LinkedIn Learning (then lynda.com) began to broadcast courses on their [[Apple TV]] application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/21/linkedin-makes-all-lynda-com-courses-available-on-apple-tv/|title=LinkedIn makes all Lynda.com courses available on Apple TV {{!}} VentureBeat|website=venturebeat.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2016, [[Microsoft]] announced that it would acquire lynda.com's parent company LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. The acquisition was completed on December 8, 2016.&lt;ref name="news_Micr"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://news.microsoft.com/2016/06/13/microsoft-to-acquire-linkedin/|title=Microsoft to acquire LinkedIn {{!}} News Center|date=June 13, 2016|quote=Microsoft Corp. and LinkedIn Corporation on Monday announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Microsoft will [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquire]] LinkedIn for $16 per [[Share (finance)|share]] in an all-cash [[Financial transaction|transaction]] valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn’s net cash.|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj ms"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-to-acquire-linkedin-in-deal-valued-at-26-2-billion-1465821523|title=Microsoft to Acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion|date=2016-06-13|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|last2=Steele|first2=Anne|first1=Jay|last1=Greene|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-microsoft-our-next-play-begins-jeff-weiner|title=LinkedIn + Microsoft: Our Next Play Begins|last=Weiner|first=Jeff|date=2016-12-08|publisher=LinkenIn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, lynda was merged and renamed as ''LinkedIn Learning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lynda.com/Business-tutorials/Upgrading-from-Lynda-com-LinkedIn-Learning/675718-2.html|title=Upgrading from Lynda.com to LinkedIn Learning|website=Lynda.com - from LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisitions ==

In February 2013, LinkedIn Learning (then lynda.com) acquired video2brain, an [[Austria]]n-based provider of online classes in web design and programming, available in German, French, Spanish, and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://gigaom.com/2013/02/13/flush-with-cash-lynda-com-buys-european-online-learning-site-video2brain/ | title=Flush with cash, Lynda.com buys European online learning site video2brain | publisher=[[Gigaom]] | date=2013-02-13 | author=Heussner, Ki Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mannheim process''' is an industrial process for the production of [[hydrogen chloride]] and [[sodium sulfate]].

== Process ==

The Mannheim process is used to produce sodium sulfate. Sulfuric acid is reacted with sodium chloride within the Mannheim furnace. The furnace is a large cast iron kiln where the sodium chloride and sulfuric acid are first fed onto a stationary reaction plate where an initial reaction takes place. The stationary plate is up to 6 m in diameter. Rotating rabble arms constantly turn over the mixture and move the intermediate product to a lower plate. The kiln portion of the furnace is constructed with bricks that have high
resistance to direct flame, temperature, and acid. The other parts of the furnace are heat and acid resistant. Hot flue gas passes up over the plates carrying out liberated Hydrogen Chloride gas. The intermediate product reacts with more sodium chloride in the lower, hotter section of the kiln producing sodium sulfate. This exits the furnace and passes through cooling drums before being
milled, screened and sent to product storage facilities. 
The process involves two chemical reactions. In the first step sodium chloride and sulfuric acid are combined to produce sodium bisulfate and hydrochloric acid, an exothermic reaction that can occur at room temperature. The second step of the process involves an endothermic reaction, requiring energy input. A temperature of 600° to 700°C is required and maintained within the furnace to convert additional sodium chloride and the intermediate product to produce sodium sulfate and more hydrochloric acid. Based on public information about Mannheim Furnace production, about 80% of the production cost results from purchasing chemicals and 10% of the
cost is for fuel (energy) and sulfuric acid.

== Chemistry ==

The reactants in the chemical reaction are [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl, table salt). The reaction yields [[sodium sulfate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and gaseous [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl).

2 [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]  +  [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]  →  [[Sodium sulfate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  2 [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riegel|first1=Emil Raymond|editor1-last=Kent|editor1-first=James Albert|title=Riegel's Handbook of Industrial Chemistry|date=1974|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|location=New York|isbn=9780442243470|page=132|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science''' is a [[Junior minister]]ial post in the [[Scottish Executive Education Department|Education Department]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. As a result, the Minister does not attend&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_1 Scotland Act (1998)], ''Only those appointed under Section 47 of the Scotland Act "attend" Cabinet. Junior ministers are appointed under Section 49 and may be "present".''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Government of the 4th Scottish Parliament|Scottish Cabinet]]. The post was created in May 2007 after the appointment of the [[Scottish National Party]] minority administration and the Minister reports to the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills]], who has overall responsibility for the portfolio, and is a member of cabinet. The Minister has specific responsibility for further education and colleges, higher education and universities, science and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics, student funding, youth work, and widening access to education.&lt;ref name=june2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/minister-further-education-higher-education-science/|title=Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science|date=2018-06-27|accessdate=2018-06-27|publisher=Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post is one of two reporting to the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, alongside the [[Minister for Children and Young People]].

==History==
The responsibilities of the junior ministerial reporting to the Education Secretary have changed considerably over time.  The post was originally focused on schools: from 1999 to 2000, responsibility for schools rested with the '''Minister for Children and Education''', which became the '''Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs''' in the [[McLeish Government]] of 2000 to 2001. From 2001 to 2007, the schools portfolio rested with the '''Minister for Education and Young People'''. The skills brief also rested with the '''Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning''' between 1999 and 2007.

The [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|Salmond government]], elected following the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007]], created the junior post of the '''Minister for Schools and Skills''' who assisted the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]], in the [[Scottish Executive Education Department]].  This was then retitled on 7 December 2011 following the creation of the [[Minister of Youth Employment]] post which took over the responsibility for skills and training. A further change occurred in May 2016, following Nicola Sturgeon's reshuffle. The post was rebranded as '''Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science'''.

The post was vacant for a period over as the summer of 2018, as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]]'s original choice, [[Gillian Martin]], was revealed to have posted comments of a [[transphobic]] nature in a [[blog]] in 2007. Ms Martin's name was omitted from the list of appointments to be approved by [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] on 28 June 2018 following a [[reshuffle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-minister-gillian-martin-axed-from-education-role-1-4761272|title=SNP Minister Gillian Martin axed from education role|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date=2018-06-28|accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lochhead]] was later appointed to the role.

{{Nanotechnology}}
'''Nanotechnology''' ("'''nanotech'''") is  manipulation of matter on an [[atom]]ic, [[molecular]], and [[Supramolecular complex|supramolecular]] scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology&lt;ref name=Engines1&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology|year=1986|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-19973-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nanotsystems&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation|year=1992|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-57547-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as [[molecular nanotechnology]]. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 [[nanometers]]. This definition reflects the fact that [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects are important at this [[quantum realm|quantum-realm]] scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Through 2012, the USA has invested $3.7 billion using its [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], the European Union has invested $1.2 billion, and Japan has invested $750 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=230436 Apply nanotech to up industrial, agri output] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426122818/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=230436 |date=2012-04-26 }}, [[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|''The Daily Star'' (Bangladesh)]], 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as [[surface science]], [[organic chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[semiconductor physics]], [[energy storage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|pages=48–55|volume=15|issue=5 |date=2010|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shinn|first1=E.|title=Nuclear energy conversion with stacks of graphene nanocapacitors|journal=Complexity|date=2012|doi=10.1002/cplx.21427|bibcode=2013Cmplx..18c..24S|volume=18|issue=3|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microfabrication]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=David|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=IEEE|date=2013|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1467–1471}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[molecular engineering]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saini|first=Rajiv |author2=Saini, Santosh |author3=Sharma, Sugandha|title=Nanotechnology: The Future Medicine|journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=32–33|doi=10.4103/0974-2077.63301|pmc=2890134|pmid=20606992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional [[Semiconductor device|device physics]] to completely new approaches based upon [[molecular self-assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belkin|first1=A.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Self-Assembled Wiggling Nano-Structures and the Principle of Maximum Entropy Production|journal=Sci.

Scientists currently debate the future [[implications of nanotechnology]]. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications]], such as in [[nanomedicine]], [[nanoelectronics]], [[biomaterial]]s energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the [[Nanotoxicology|toxicity]] and environmental impact of nanomaterials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Origins==
{{Main|History of nanotechnology}}
The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in his talk ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms. The term "nano-technology" was first used by [[Norio Taniguchi]] in 1974, though it was not widely known.

[[File:Comparison of nanomaterials sizes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Comparison of Nanomaterials Sizes]]

Inspired by Feynman's concepts, [[K. Eric Drexler]] used the term "nanotechnology" in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]'', which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded [[The Foresight Institute]] (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.

Thus, emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter. Since the popularity spike in the 1980s, most of nanotechnology has involved investigation of several approaches to making mechanical devices out of a small number of atoms.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 2002 1193"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1193|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era. First, the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989.

Second, [[Fullerenes]] were discovered in 1985 by [[Harry Kroto]], [[Richard Smalley]], and [[Robert Curl]], who together won the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/318162a0| title = C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;: Buckminsterfullerene| journal = Nature| volume = 318| issue = 6042| pages = 162–163| year = 1985| last1 = Kroto | first1 = H.

In the early 2000s, the field garnered increased scientific, political, and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress. Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies, exemplified by the [[Royal Society]]'s report on nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="royalsociety"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=13 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526060835/http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, which culminated in a public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, commercialization of products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging. These products are limited to bulk applications of [[nanomaterials]] and do not involve atomic control of matter. Some examples include the [[Silver Nano]] platform for using [[silver nanoparticles]] as an antibacterial agent, [[nanoparticle]]-based transparent sunscreens, [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]] strengthening using silica nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles.&lt;ref name="americanelements"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanotechnology Information Center: Properties, Applications, Research, and Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.americanelements.com/nanomaterials-nanoparticles-nanotechnology.html|publisher=[[American Elements]]|accessdate=13 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226011154/http://www.americanelements.com/nanomaterials-nanoparticles-nanotechnology.html|archivedate=26 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emergingnano"&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |publisher=The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies |title=Analysis: This is the first publicly available on-line inventory of nanotechnology-based consumer products |accessdate=13 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505011238/http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |archivedate=5 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments moved to promote and [[Funding of science|fund research]] into nanotechnology, such as in the U.S. with the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established funding for research on the nanoscale, and in Europe via the European [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]].

By the mid-2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish.  Projects emerged to produce nanotechnology roadmaps&lt;ref name=PNRoadmap&gt;{{cite web|title=Productive Nanosystems Technology Roadmap|url=http://www.productivenanosystems.com/docs/Nanotech_Roadmap_2007_main.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908014630/http://www.productivenanosystems.com/docs/Nanotech_Roadmap_2007_main.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASAroadmap&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Draft Nanotechnology Roadmap|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501325main_TA10-Nanotech-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122114146/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501325main_TA10-Nanotech-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf|archivedate=2013-01-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which center on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected capabilities, goals, and applications.

==Fundamental concepts==
Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.

One [[nanometer]] (nm) is one billionth, or 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon [[bond length]]s, or the spacing between these [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]], are in the range {{nowrap|0.12–0.15 nm}}, and a [[DNA]] double-helix has a diameter around 2&amp;nbsp;nm. On the other hand, the smallest [[cell (biology)|cellular]] life-forms, the bacteria of the genus ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', are around 200&amp;nbsp;nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range {{nowrap|1 to 100 nm}} following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm [[kinetic diameter]]) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which  phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Fritz |last=Allhoff |first2=Patrick |last2=Lin |first3=Daniel |last3=Moore |title=What is nanotechnology and why does it matter?: from science to ethics |pages=3–5 |location= |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-7545-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of [[microtechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. K. |last=Prasad |title=Modern Concepts in Nanotechnology |pages=31–32 |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2008 |isbn=978-81-8356-296-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth.&lt;ref name="NationalG"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Kahn| first =Jennifer |title=Nanotechnology|journal=National Geographic |volume=2006 |issue=June |pages=98–119 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or another way of putting it: a nanometer is the amount an average man's beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face.&lt;ref name="NationalG"/&gt;

Two main approaches are used in nanotechnology. In the "bottom-up" approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which [[self-assembly|assemble themselves]] chemically by principles of [[molecular recognition]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kralj|first1=Slavko|last2=Makovec|first2=Darko|title=Magnetic Assembly of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Clusters into Nanochains and Nanobundles|journal=ACS Nano|date=27 October 2015|volume=9|issue=10|pages=9700–9707|doi=10.1021/acsnano.5b02328|pmid=26394039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "top-down" approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|author=Rodgers, P. |year=2006|title=Nanoelectronics: Single file|doi=10.1038/nnano.2006.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of physics such as [[nanoelectronics]], [[nanomechanics]], [[nanophotonics]] and [[nanoionics]] have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology.

===Larger to smaller: a materials perspective===
[[File:Atomic resolution Au100.JPG|right|thumb|Image of [[Surface reconstruction|reconstruction]] on a clean [[Gold]]([[Miller index|100]]) surface, as visualized using [[scanning tunneling microscopy]]. The positions of the individual atoms composing the surface are visible.]]

{{main|Nanomaterials}}

Several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These include [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] effects, as well as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects, for example the "[[quantum]] size effect" where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called [[quantum realm]]. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics. ''Mechanical'' properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research. The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with [[biomaterial]]s.

Materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminium); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as a potent chemical [[catalyst]] at nanoscales. Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lubick N | year = 2008 | title = Silver socks have cloudy lining | url = | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 42 | issue = 11| page = 3910 | pmid=18589943 | doi = 10.1021/es0871199 | last2 = Betts | first2 = Kellyn|bibcode = 2008EnST...42.3910L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple to complex: a molecular perspective===
{{Main|Molecular self-assembly}}

Modern [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]] has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure. These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as [[drug|pharmaceuticals]] or commercial [[polymer]]s. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into [[supramolecular assembly|supramolecular assemblies]] consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.

These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or [[supramolecular chemistry]] to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a [[Top-down and bottom-up#Nanotechnology|bottom-up]] approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to [[Noncovalent bonding|non-covalent]] [[intermolecular force]]s. The Watson–Crick [[base pair|basepairing]] rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an [[enzyme]] being targeted to a single [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], or the specific [[protein folding|folding of the protein]] itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.

Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in [[biology]], most notably Watson–Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions. The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones.

===Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view===
{{Main|Molecular nanotechnology}}

Molecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the [[molecular assembler]], a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of [[mechanosynthesis]]. Manufacturing in the context of [[productive nanosystems]] is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.

When the term "nanotechnology" was independently coined and popularized by [[Eric Drexler]] (who at the time was unaware of an [[History of nanotechnology|earlier usage]] by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on [[molecular machine]] systems. The premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated, [[stochastic]]ally optimised [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]] can be produced.

It is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using [[biomimetic]] principles. However, Drexler and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;Phoenix, Chris (March 2005) [http://www.crnano.org/developing.htm Nanotechnology: Developing Molecular Manufacturing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901071028/http://www.crnano.org/developing.htm |date=2005-09-01 }}. crnano.org&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/PNAS.html|title=Some papers by K. Eric Drexler|work=imm.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411075149/http://www.imm.org/PNAS.html|archivedate=2006-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler's book ''Nanosystems''.

In general it is very difficult to assemble devices on the atomic scale, as one has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness. Another view, put forth by Carlo Montemagno,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsi.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel%5fid=105488 Carlo Montemagno, Ph.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917071431/http://www1.cnsi.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=105488 |date=2011-09-17 }} California NanoSystems Institute&lt;/ref&gt; is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines. Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules.

This led to an exchange of letters in the [[American Chemical Society|ACS]] publication [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Cover Story – Nanotechnology|date=December 1, 2003|volume =81|issue=48|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|pages=37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machine systems are possible, non-biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy. Leaders in research on non-biological molecular machines are Dr. [[Alex Zettl]] and his colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and UC Berkeley.[http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/zettl/] They have constructed at least three distinct molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing voltage: a nanotube [[nanomotor]], a molecular actuator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/zettl/pdf/312.NanoLett5regan.pdf|doi=10.1021/nl0510659|pmid=16159214|year=2005|last1=Regan|first1=BC|last2=Aloni|first2=S|last3=Jensen|first3=K|last4=Ritchie|first4=RO|last5=Zettl|first5=A|title=Nanocrystal-powered nanomotor|volume=5|issue=9|pages=1730–3|journal=Nano Letters|bibcode=2005NanoL...5.1730R|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510143208/http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/zettl/pdf/312.NanoLett5regan.pdf|archivedate=2006-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sabl/2005/May/Tiniest-Motor.pdf|doi=10.1063/1.1887827|title=Surface-tension-driven nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator|year=2005|last1=Regan|first1=B.

An experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by Ho and Lee at [[Cornell University]] in 1999. They used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal, and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.

[[Peter Grünberg]] and [[Albert Fert]] received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 for their discovery of Giant magnetoresistance and contributions to the field of spintronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/index.html|title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2007|accessdate = 2007-10-19|publisher = Nobelprize.org|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/60pw08KmP?url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/index.html|archivedate = 2011-08-10|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Solid-state techniques can also be used to create devices known as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] or NEMS, which are related to [[microelectromechanical systems]] or MEMS.
*[[Focused ion beam]]s can directly remove material, or even deposit material when suitable precursor gasses are applied at the same time. For example, this technique is used routinely to create sub-100&amp;nbsp;nm sections of material for analysis in [[Transmission electron microscopy]].
*Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale "write head" to deposit a resist, which is then followed by an etching process to remove material in a top-down method.

===Speculative===
These subfields seek to [[Futures studies|anticipate]] what inventions nanotechnology might yield, or attempt to propose an agenda along which inquiry might progress. These often take a big-picture view of nanotechnology, with more emphasis on its societal implications than the details of how such inventions could actually be created.
*Molecular nanotechnology is a proposed approach which involves manipulating single molecules in finely controlled, deterministic ways. This is more theoretical than the other subfields, and many of its proposed techniques are beyond current capabilities.

*Productive nanosystems are "systems of nanosystems" which will be complex nanosystems that produce atomically precise parts for other nanosystems, not necessarily using novel nanoscale-emergent properties, but well-understood fundamentals of manufacturing. Because of the discrete (i.e. atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution. [[Mihail Roco]], one of the architects of the USA's National Nanotechnology Initiative, has proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex [[nanomachine]]s and ultimately to productive nanosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/mcr_05-0526_intpersp_nano.pdf |title=International Perspective on Government Nanotechnology Funding in 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131175645/http://nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/mcr_05-0526_intpersp_nano.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Programmable matter]] seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of [[information science]] and [[materials science]].
*Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words [[picotechnology]] and [[femtotechnology]] have been coined in analogy to it, although these are only used rarely and informally.

===Dimensionality in nanomaterials===
Nanomaterials can be classified in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D [[nanomaterials]]. The dimensionality play a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including [[:wikt:physical|physical]], [[chemical]] and [[biological]] characteristics. With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed. This indicate that smaller dimensional [[nanomaterials]] have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials. Recently, [[two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials]] are extensively investigated for [[electronics|electronic]], [[biomedical]], [[drug delivery]] and [[biosensor]] applications.

==Tools and techniques==
[[File:AFMsetup.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Typical [[Atomic force microscope|AFM]] setup. A microfabricated [[cantilever]] with a sharp tip is deflected by features on a sample surface, much like in a [[phonograph]] but on a much smaller scale. A [[laser]] beam reflects off the backside of the cantilever into a set of [[photodetector]]s, allowing the deflection to be measured and assembled into an image of the surface.]]

There are several important modern developments. The [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM) and the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of [[scanning probe microscopy]]. Although conceptually similar to the scanning [[confocal microscope]] developed by [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1961 and the [[scanning acoustic microscope]] (SAM) developed by [[Calvin Quate]] and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.

The tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). [[Feature-oriented scanning]] methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode.&lt;ref name="feature2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lapshin, R. V.|year=2004|title=Feature-oriented scanning methodology for probe microscopy and nanotechnology|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=15|issue=9|pages=1135–1151|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/15/9/006|url=http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#feature2004|format=PDF|bibcode=2004Nanot..15.1135L|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909230837/http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#feature2004|archivedate=2013-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fospm2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lapshin, R.

Various techniques of nanolithography such as [[optical lithography]], [[X-ray lithography]], dip pen nanolithography, [[electron beam lithography]] or [[nanoimprint lithography]] were also developed. Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.

Another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of [[Ion track technology (track etching)|nanotubes]] and [[Ion track technology (track replication)|nanowires]], those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.&lt;ref name="pmid26295171"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kafshgari | first1 = MH | last2 = Voelcker | first2 = NH | last3 = Harding | first3 = FJ | year = 2015 | title = Applications of zero-valent silicon nanostructures in biomedicine | journal = Nanomedicine (Lond) | volume = 10 | issue = 16| pages = 2553–71 | doi = 10.2217/nnm.15.91 | pmid = 26295171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques.&lt;ref name="feature2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fospm2011"/&gt; At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.

In contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, [[self-assembly]] and positional assembly. [[Dual polarisation interferometry]] is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another variation of the bottom-up approach is [[molecular beam epitaxy]] or MBE. Researchers at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of [[spintronics]].

However, new therapeutic products, based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the ultradeformable, stress-sensitive [[Transfersome]] vesicles, are under development and already approved for human use in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajan|first=Reshmy|last2=Jose|first2=Shoma|last3=Mukund|first3=V.

As of August 21, 2008, the [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] estimates that over 800 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3–4 per week.&lt;ref name="emergingnano"/&gt; The project lists all of the products in a publicly accessible online database.

Scientists are now turning to nanotechnology in an attempt to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes. Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine [[Catalysis|catalyst]] in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catalytic converter#Diesel engines|''Catalytic Converter'']] at Wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt; Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/catalytic-converter2.htm ''How Catalytic Converters Work''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210142147/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/catalytic-converter2.htm |date=2014-12-10 }} at howstuffworks.com&lt;/ref&gt; Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst—in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes—and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/nanotechnology-provide-cleaner-diesel-engines ''Nanotechnology to provide cleaner diesel engines''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214133618/http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/nanotechnology-provide-cleaner-diesel-engines |date=2014-12-14 }}.

==Implications==
{{Main|Implications of nanotechnology}}

An area of concern is the effect that industrial-scale manufacturing and use of nanomaterials would have on human health and the environment, as suggested by [[nanotoxicology]] research. For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments. Others counter that overregulation would stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations.

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of nanotechnology}}

Calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have occurred alongside a growing debate related to the human health and safety risks of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanolabweb.com/index.cfm/action/main.default.viewArticle/articleID/290/CFID/3564274/CFTOKEN/43473772/index.html|title=Nanobiotechnology Regulation: A Proposal for Self-Regulation with Limited Oversight|author=Kevin Rollins (Nems Mems Works, LLC)|work=Volume 6 – Issue 2|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714153112/http://www.nanolabweb.com/index.cfm/action/main.default.viewArticle/articleID/290/CFID/3564274/CFTOKEN/43473772/index.html|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. Some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology products and processes (to varying degrees) – by "bolting on" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowman D, Hodge G |title=Nanotechnology: Mapping the Wild Regulatory Frontier |journal=Futures |volume=38 |pages=1060–1073 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2006.02.017 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2008) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. C. (2008).

Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] ("mad cow" disease), [[thalidomide]], genetically modified food,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0963662505056611| title = Difficulties in evaluating public engagement initiatives: Reflections on an         evaluation of the UK GM Nation?

The Royal Society report&lt;ref name="royalsociety"/&gt; identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that "manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure" (p. xiii).

The Center for Nanotechnology in Society has found that people respond to nanotechnologies differently, depending on application – with participants in [[deliberations|public deliberations]] more positive about nanotechnologies for energy than health applications – suggesting that any public calls for nano regulations may differ by technology sector.&lt;ref name="harthorn"/&gt;

The '''Open Connectivity Foundation''' ('''OCF''') is an industry group whose stated mission is to develop specification standards, promote a set of [[interoperability]] guidelines, and provide a certification program for devices involved in the [[Internet of Things|Internet of Things (IoT)]]. It has become one of the biggest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://industrial-iot.com/2016/02/meet-the-open-connectivity-foundation-ocf/|title=IoT Standards Get a Big Push: Meet the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF)|date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; industrial connectivity [[standards organization]]s for IoT, including in its membership [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Qualcomm]] and [[Electrolux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2016/02/20/new-open-connectivity-foundation-combines-open-interconnect-consortium-and-allseen-alliance/|title=Gigaom - New Open Connectivity Foundation combines Open Interconnect Consortium and AllSeen Alliance|author=Stowe Boyd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/19/microsoft-intel-samsung-others-launch-iot-standards-group-open-connectivity-foundation/|title=Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, &amp; others launch IoT standards group: Open Connectivity Foundation|author=Paul Sawers|work=VentureBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are more than 300 member companies.&lt;ref name="MembersList"&gt;[http://openconnectivity.org/about/membership-list OCF Membership List]&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCF tries to realize the Internet of Things also called Network of Everything. The IoT requires easy discovery, and trusted and reliable connectivity between things. The OCF delivers a framework that enables these requirements via a specification,&lt;ref&gt;[http://openconnectivity.org/upnp/specifications UPNP Specification Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openconnectivity.org/resources/specifications OCF Specification Page]&lt;/ref&gt; a reference implementation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iotivity.org/ OCF Reference Implementation Page]&lt;/ref&gt; and a certification program. [[IoTivity]], the open source reference implementation of the specifications, is actively developed by different members of the OCF.

==History==
The Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) began as an industry group whose stated mission was to develop standards and certification for devices involved in the [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) based around [[Constrained Application Protocol]] (CoAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Michael|title=Smart Home Show: The Open Interconnect Consortium|url=http://www.technology.fm/thesmarthomeshow/shs-2015-i02|publisher=TECHNOLOGY.FM|accessdate=6 March 2015|ref=fm}}&lt;/ref&gt; OIC was created in July 2014 by [[Intel]], [[Broadcom]], and [[Samsung Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/intel-samsung-create-internet-of-things-group/ Intel, Samsung create Internet of Things group]&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcom left the consortium shortly after it was established, due to a disagreement on how to handle intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gigaom.com/2014/10/10/its-an-iot-standards-shakeup-as-broadcom-dumps-intels-open-interconnect-consortium/ It’s an IoT standards shakeup as Broadcom dumps Intel’s Open Interconnect Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2015 a release candidate of the specification in version 1.0 for the core framework, smart home device, resource type, security and remote access capabilities was released to the public, accessible also for non members without registration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openinterconnect.org/oic-news-releases/open-interconnect-consortium-unveils-cloud-native-support-for-internet-of-things|OIC Candidate Specification 1.0 released]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2016 the OIC changed its name to the Open Connectivity Foundation and added [[Microsoft]], [[Qualcomm]] and [[Electrolux]] to its membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2016/02/19/microsoft-qualcomm-join-rebranded-internet-of-things-club/  Microsoft, Qualcomm Join Rebranded Internet of Things Club]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently, there are more than 300 other member partners, including OCF "Diamond Members" companies; [[Cisco Systems]], [[Qualcomm]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[CableLabs]], [[Electrolux]], [[LG Corporation|LG]], [[Haier]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], and [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://openinterconnect.org/members/ List of OIC members]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PCI-X''', short for '''Peripheral Component Interconnect eXtended''', is a [[computer bus]] and [[expansion card]] standard that enhances the 32-bit [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] local bus for higher bandwidth demanded mostly by [[Server (computing)|servers]] and [[workstations]].  It uses a modified protocol to support higher clock speeds (up to 133&amp;nbsp;MHz), but is otherwise similar in electrical implementation.  PCI-X 2.0 added speeds up to 533&amp;nbsp;MHz{{r|PCIX2.0|p=23}}, with a reduction in electrical signal levels.

The slot is physically a 3.3&amp;nbsp;V PCI slot, with exactly the same size, location and pin assignments.  The electrical specifications are compatible, but stricter.  However, while most conventional PCI slots are the 85&amp;nbsp;mm long 32-bit version, most PCI-X devices use the 130&amp;nbsp;mm long 64-bit slot, to the point that 64-bit PCI connectors and PCI-X support are seen as synonymous.

PCI-X is in fact fully specified for both 32- and 64-bit PCI connectors{{r|PCIX1.0a|p=14}}, and PCI-X 2.0 added a 16-bit variant for embedded applications.{{r|PCIX2.0|p=22}}

It has been replaced in modern designs by the similar-sounding [[PCI Express]] (officially abbreviated as PCIe),&lt;ref name="Andrews2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Andrews|title=A+ Guide to Managing and Maintaining Your PC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtjI4Qq93ZAC&amp;pg=PA187|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4354-9778-8|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a completely different connector and a very different electrical design, having one or more narrow but fast serial connection lanes instead of a number of slower connections in parallel.

==History==

=== Background and motivation ===
[[File:Intelpromtserverpcixadapter1000mta342.jpg|240px|thumb|right|A PCI-X [[Gigabit Ethernet]] expansion card.]]
[[File:dualportintelmtpro1000mtserveradapterspc.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Dual Port Network Card for single PCI-X slot to save on PCI-X slots and use the full potential of the PCI-X [[64-bit]] bus]]
In PCI, a transaction that cannot be completed immediately is postponed by either the target or the initiator issuing retry-cycles, during which no other agents can use the PCI bus.  Since PCI lacks a split-response mechanism to permit the target to return data at a later time, the bus remains occupied by the target issuing retry-cycles until the read data is ready.  In PCI-X, after the master issues the request, it disconnects from the PCI bus, allowing other agents to use the bus.  The split-response containing the requested data is generated only when the target is ready to return all of the requested data.  Split-responses increase bus efficiency by eliminating retry-cycles, during which no data can be transferred across the bus.

PCI also suffered from the relative scarcity of unique interrupt lines.  With only 4 interrupt lines (INTA/B/C/D), systems with many PCI devices require multiple functions to share an interrupt line, complicating host-side interrupt-handling.  PCI-X added [[Message Signaled Interrupts]], an interrupt system using writes to host-memory.  In MSI-mode, the function's interrupt is not signaled by asserting an INTx line.  Instead, the function performs a memory-write to a system-configured region in host-memory.  Since the content and address are configured on a per-function basis, MSI-mode interrupts are dedicated instead of shared.  A PCI-X system allows both MSI-mode interrupts  and legacy INTx interrupts to be used simultaneously (though not by the same function.)

The lack of registered I/Os limited PCI to a maximum frequency of 66&amp;nbsp;MHz.  PCI-X I/Os are registered to the PCI clock, usually through means of a PLL to actively control I/O delay the bus pins.  The improvement in setup time allows an increase in frequency to 133&amp;nbsp;MHz.

Some devices, most notably Gigabit Ethernet cards, SCSI controllers (Fibre Channel and Ultra320), and cluster interconnects could by themselves saturate the PCI bus's 133 MB/s bandwidth.  Ports using a bus speed doubled to 66&amp;nbsp;MHz and a bus width doubled to 64 bits (with the pin count increased to 184 from 124), in combination or not, have been implemented. These extensions were loosely supported as optional parts of the PCI 2.x standards, but device compatibility beyond the basic 133 MB/s continued to be difficult.

Developers eventually used the combined 64-bit and 66-MHz extension as a foundation, and, anticipating future needs, established 66-MHz and 133-MHz variants with a maximum bandwidth of 532 MB/s and 1064 MB/s respectively. The joint result was submitted as PCI-X to the [[PCI-SIG|PCI Special Interest Group]] ([[Special Interest Group]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]). Subsequent approval made it an [[open standard]] adoptable by all computer developers. The PCI SIG controls technical support, training, and compliance testing for PCI-X. IBM, Intel, Microelectronics, and Mylex were to develop supporting chipsets. [[3Com]] and [[Adaptec]] were to develop compatible peripherals. To accelerate PCI-X adoption by the industry, Compaq offered PCI-X development tools at their Web site.

===PCI-X 1.0===
The PCI-X standard was developed jointly by [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], and [[Compaq]] and submitted for approval in 1998. It was an effort to codify proprietary [[Server (computing)|server]] extensions to the [[PCI local bus]] to address several shortcomings in PCI, and increase performance of high bandwidth devices, such as Gigabit Ethernet, [[Fibre Channel]], and [[SCSI|Ultra3 SCSI]] cards, and allow processors to be interconnected in [[Computer cluster|clusters]].

Intel gave only a qualified welcome to PCI-X, stressing that the next generation bus would have to be a "fundamentally new architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PCI-X Gang of Three challenges Intel with Future I/O  |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/01/13/pcix_gang_of_three_challenges/ |date=1999-01-13 |first= John |last=Lettice |journal=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cary Snyder, a senior analyst with the ''[[Microprocessor Report]]'', "PCI-X took two years to take off" because of a "falling-out between the PCI SIG and a key Intel interconnect designer who spearheaded development on the [[Accelerated Graphics Port]] caused Intel to pull out of the initial PCI-X effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1204479 |title=Servers gas up with 4-Gbyte/s PCI-X 2.0 spec |first=Rick |last=Merritt |date=2001-11-21 |journal=EE Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first PCI-X products only hit the market after Intel had already announced their next-generation [[PCI Express]] at the 2001 [[Intel Developer Forum]]. When more details of PCI Express were released in August 2001, PCI SIG chairman Roger Tipley expressed his belief that "PCI-X is going to be in servers forever because it serves a certain level of functionality, and it may not be compelling to switch to 3GIO [PCI Express] for that functionality. We learned that from not being able to get rid of ISA. ISA hung around because of all of these systems that weren't high-volume parts." Tipley also announced that (at the time) the PCI SIG was planning to fold PCI Express and PCI-X 2.0 into a single work tentatively called PCI 3.0,&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Ascierto (8/30/2001) "[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1228264 Intel details next-generation I/O spec]", ''EE Times''&lt;/ref&gt; but that name was eventually used for a relatively minor revision of conventional PCI.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcisig.com/news_room/faqs/faq_pci30/pci30_faq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCI-X 2.0===
In 2003, the PCI SIG ratified PCI-X 2.0. It adds 266-MHz and 533-MHz variants, yielding roughly 2,132 MB/s and 4,266 MB/s throughput, respectively. PCI-X 2.0 makes additional protocol revisions that are designed to help system reliability and add [[Error-correcting code]]s to the bus to avoid re-sends.&lt;ref name="PCI-SIG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcisig.com/news_room/faqs/faq_20/|title=PCI-SIG&amp;nbsp;— FAQ&amp;nbsp;— PCI-X 2.0|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; To deal with one of the most common complaints of the PCI-X form factor, the 184-pin connector, 16-bit ports were developed to allow PCI-X to be used in devices with tight space constraints. Similar to PCI-Express, PtP functions were added to allow for devices on the bus to talk to each other without burdening the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] or bus controller.

Despite the various theoretical advantages of PCI-X 2.0 and its backward compatibility with PCI-X and PCI devices, it has not been implemented on a large scale ({{as of|2008|lc=y}}). This lack of implementation primarily is because hardware vendors have chosen to integrate [[PCI Express]] instead.

[[IBM]] was one of the (few) vendors which provided PCI-X 2.0 (266&amp;nbsp;MHz) support in their [[System i5]] Model 515, 520 and 525; IBM advertised these slots as suitable for [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] adapters, which they also provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4011.pdf|quote="A third generation of PCI is now offered with the introduction of the 1.9 GHz System i5 Models 515, 520, and 525.

In 2003, [[Dell]] announced it would skip PCI-X 2.0 in favor of more rapid adoption of PCI Express solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/2100-1010-992769.html PCI-X marks the spot for IBM, HP]&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by [[PC Magazine]], Intel  began to sideline PCI-X in their 2004 roadmap, in favor of PCI Express, arguing that the latter had substantial advantages in terms of system latency and power consumption, more dramatically stated as avoiding "the 1,000-pin apocalypse" for their [[Intel Xeon chipsets#NetBurst-based Xeon chipsets|Tumwater]] chipset.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,909447,00.asp Intel Begins Making Its Case Against PCI-X]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical description==
PCI-X revised the [[conventional PCI]] standard by doubling the maximum clock speed (from 66&amp;nbsp;MHz to 133&amp;nbsp;MHz)&lt;ref name="PCI-SIG" /&gt; and hence the amount of data exchanged between the computer processor and peripherals.  Conventional PCI supports up to [[64-bit|64 bits]] at 66&amp;nbsp;MHz (though anything above 32 bits at 33&amp;nbsp;MHz is seen only in high-end systems). The theoretical maximum amount of data exchanged between the processor and peripherals with PCI-X is 1.06 GB/s, compared to 133 MB/s with standard PCI. PCI-X also improves the fault tolerance of PCI, allowing, for example, faulty cards to be reinitialized or taken offline.

PCI-X is backward compatible to PCI in the sense that the entire bus falls back to PCI if any card on the bus does not support PCI-X.

The two most fundamental changes are:
* The shortest time between a signal appearing on the PCI bus and a response to that signal occurring on the bus has been extended to 2 cycles, rather than 1.  This allows much faster clock rates, but causes many protocol changes:
** The ability of the conventional PCI bus protocol to insert wait states on any cycle based on the IRDY# and TRDY# signals has been deleted; PCI-X only allows bursts to be interrupted at 128-byte boundaries.
** The initiator must deassert FRAME# ''two'' cycles before the end of the transaction.
** The initiator may not insert wait states.  The target may, but only before any data is transferred, and wait states for writes are limited to multiples of 2 clock cycles.
** Likewise, the length of a burst is decided before it begins; it may not be halted on an arbitrary cycle using the FRAME# and STOP# signals.
** Subtractive decode DEVSEL# takes place two cycles after the "slow DEVSEL#" cycle rather than on the next cycle.
* After the address phase (and before any device has responded with DEVSEL#), there is an additional 1-cycle "attribute phase", during which 36 additional bits (both AD and C/BE# lines are used) of information about the operation are transmitted.  These include 16 bits of requester identification (PCI bus, device and function number), 12 bits of burst length, 5 bits of tag (for associating split transactions), and 3 bits of additional status.

==Mixing of 32-bit and 64-bit PCI cards in different width slots==
[[File:PCI-X in a 32-bit slot.jpg|thumb|right|64-bit PCI-X card partially inserted in 32-bit PCI slot, showing compatibility.]]
Most 32-bit PCI cards will function properly in 64-bit PCI-X slots, but the bus speed will be limited to the clock frequency of the slowest card, an inherent limitation of PCI's shared bus topology. For example, when a PCI 2.3, if a 66-MHz peripheral is installed into a PCI-X bus capable of 133&amp;nbsp;MHz, the entire bus backplane will be limited to 66&amp;nbsp;MHz. To get around this limitation, many motherboards have multiple PCI/PCI-X buses, with one bus intended for use with high-speed PCI-X peripherals, and the other bus intended for general-purpose peripherals.

Many 64-bit PCI-X cards are designed to work in 32-bit mode if inserted in shorter 32-bit connectors, with some loss of speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if it would work, installing a 64-bit PCI-X card in a 32-bit slot will leave the 64-bit portion of the card edge connector not connected and overhanging, which requires that there be no motherboard components positioned so as to mechanically obstruct the overhanging portion of the card edge connector.

==Comparison with PCI-Express==
PCI-X is often confused by name with similar-sounding [[PCI Express]], commonly abbreviated as PCI-E or PCIe, although the cards themselves are totally incompatible and look different. While they are both high-speed computer buses for internal peripherals, they differ in many ways. The first is that PCI-X is a 64-bit parallel interface that is backward compatible with 32-bit PCI devices. PCIe is a serial point-to-point connection with a different physical interface that was designed to supersede both PCI and PCI-X.

PCI-X and standard PCI buses may run on a PCIe bridge, similar to the way [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] buses ran on standard PCI buses in some computers. PCIe also matches PCI-X and even PCI-X 2.0 in maximum bandwidth. PCIe 1.0 x1 offers 250 MB/s in each direction (lane), and up to 16 lanes (x16) are currently supported each direction, in [[Full-duplex#Full-duplex|full-duplex]], giving a maximum of 4 GB/s bandwidth in each direction. PCI-X 2.0 offers (at its maximum 64-bit 533-MHz variant) a maximum bandwidth of 4,266 MB/s (~4.3 GB/s), although only in [[half-duplex]].

PCI-X has technological and economical disadvantages compared to PCI Express. The 64-bit parallel interface requires difficult trace routing, because, as with all parallel interfaces, the signals from the bus must arrive simultaneously or within a very short window, and noise from adjacent slots may cause interference.  The serial interface of PCIe suffers fewer such problems and therefore does not require such complex and expensive designs. PCI-X buses, like standard PCI, are [[half-duplex]] bidirectional, whereas PCIe buses are [[full-duplex]] bidirectional.  PCI-X buses run only as fast as the slowest device, whereas PCIe devices are able to independently negotiate the bus speed.  Also, PCI-X slots are longer than PCIe 1x through PCIe 16x, which makes it impossible to make short cards for PCI-X.  PCI-X slots take quite a bit of space on motherboards, which can be a problem for [[ATX]] and smaller [[Motherboard form factor|form factors]].

The '''Peli Lens''' is a [[mobility aid]] for people with [[homonymous hemianopia]]. It is also known as “EP” or Expansion Prism concept and was developed by Dr. [[Eli Peli]] of [http://serinet.meei.harvard.edu/faculty/peli/ Schepens Eye Research Institute] in 1999. It expands the [[visual field]] by 20 degrees. He tested this concept on several patients in his private practice with great success using 40Δ Fresnel press-on prisms (Peli 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Peli E. (2000) Field Expansion for Homonymous Hemianopia by Optically Induced Peripheral Exotropia, Optometry and Vision Science, Vol. 77, No. 9, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the lens and clinical trials were funded by NEI-NIH Grant EY014723 awarded to Chadwick Optical.  The results of the multi-center clinical trials were published in 2008 reporting a 74% patient acceptance rate.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers A, Keeney K, Peli E. (2008) Community-Based Trial of Peripheral Prism Visual Field Expansion Device for Hemianopia. Archives of Ophthalmology 126(5):657-664&lt;/ref&gt; Under this grant Chadwick Optical also designed and produced a cosmetically acceptable permanent version of this concept in a prescription lens.

An improved version of the Peli Lens expanding the visual field by 30 degrees is available.  Clinical trial results are pending.

'''Release notes''' are documents that are distributed with software products, sometimes when the product is still in the development or test state (e.g., a [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] release). For products that have already been in use by clients, the release note is delivered to the customer when an update is released.

==Purpose and Responsibilities==
Release notes are documents that are shared with end users, customers and clients of an organization. The definition of the terms 'End Users', 'Clients' and 'Customers' are very relative in nature and might have various interpretations based on the specific context. For instance, Quality Assurance group within a software development organization can be interpreted as an internal customer. They detail the corrections, changes or enhancements made to the service or product the company provides. This document is usually circulated only after the product or service is thoroughly tested and approved against the specification provided by the development team. However this document might also be provided as an artifact accompanying the deliverables for System Testing and System Integration Testing and other managed environments especially with reference to an information technology organization.

Release notes can also contain test results and information about the [[Software testing|test procedure]]. This kind of information gives readers of the release note more confidence in the fix/change done; this information also enables implementer of the change to conduct rudimentary [[Acceptance testing|acceptance tests]].

==Content and Format==
There is no standard format for release notes that is followed throughout different organizations. Organizations normally adopt their own formatting styles based on the requirement and type of the information to be circulated. The content of release notes also vary according to the release type. For products that are at testing stage and that are newly released, the content is usually more descriptive compared to release notes for bug fixes and feature enhancements, which are usually brief. 
Release notes may include the following sections:
* '''Header''' – Document Name (i.e. Release Notes), product name, release number, release date, note date, note version, etc.
* '''Overview''' - A brief overview of the product and changes, in the absence of other formal documentation.
* '''Purpose''' - A brief overview of the purpose of the release note with a listing of what is new in this release, including [[bug fix]]es and new features.
* '''Issue Summary''' - A short description of the bug or the enhancement in the release.
* '''Steps to Reproduce''' - The steps that were followed when the bug was encountered.
* '''Resolution''' - A short description of the modification/enhancement that was made to fix the bug.
* '''End-User Impact''' - What different actions are needed by the end-users of the application.  This should include whether other functionality is impacted by these changes.
* '''Support Impacts''' - Changes required in the daily process of administering the software.
* '''Notes''' - Notes about software or hardware [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]], upgrades and product documentation (including documentation updates)
* '''Disclaimers''' - Company and standard product related messages. e.g.; [[freeware]], [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]], duplication etc.. See also [[Disclaimer]].
* '''Contact''' - Support contact information.

A release note is usually a terse summary of recent changes, enhancements and bug fixes in a particular software release. It is not a substitute for [[user guide]]s. Release notes are frequently written in the present tense and provide information that is clear, correct, and complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">'''Rudolf Bailovic''' (born 1885 in [[Sarajevo]]) was a [[Serbo-Croatian]] interpreter and [[Cryptography|cryptographer]], of [[Austria]]n descent, who was head of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] Referat of [[General der Nachrichtenaufklärung]] during [[World War II]]. Bailovic held the civil service rank of ({{lang-de|Regierungsrat}}) and became Oberregierungsrat in 1944.&lt;ref name="seven704"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSDIC 1704 - The organisation and history of the cryptographic service within the German Army.|url=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_oIJbGCCNYeMGUxNzk0NWQtNzNhZi00YWVjLWI1NmItMzc2YWZiZGNjNjQ5|website=Google Drive|publisher=TICOM|accessdate=29 January 2018|format=pdf|date=8 July 1945}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailovic was considered an anti-Nazi, who held anti-Nazi views, and refused to wear German decorations, when in uniform. Bailovic was also a Turkish interpreter and spent significant time in evaluation, providing intelligence.

==Military career==
Bailovic was an Austrian [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]]. A colonel in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], who served as an officer in [[Trieste]] and was director of the Austrian cipher bureau during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="seven704"/&gt; He was considered a middle ranking official of the Austrian cipher section, by Fenner, before and during [[World War II]]. During the [[Anschluss]], Bailovic refused to surrender the keys of his department to the [[Nazism|Nazis]] when Austria was subsumed. Subsequently, he was relegated to a minor position in the Austrian civil service.  General [[Erich Fellgiebel]] and [[Fritz Thiele]], recognising his potential, ordered [[Wilhelm Fenner]] to Vienna, to bring Bailovic, along with seven of his colleagues back to Germany, to be employed as cryptanalysts and evaluators. In the final tally, only 4 people came back with Bailovic, that included Joseph Seifert, the then current director of the Austrian cipher bureau. Upon their landing in Germany, a Forschungsamt official met the party at the airport where the [[Research Office of the Reich Air Ministry|Forschungsamt]] (abbr. FA) official offered money to Bailovic to work for them, which Fenner found disturbing.

Bailovic initially worked for the FA, which was the [[Luftwaffe]]'s chief [[Hermann Göring]] private cipher bureau, specifically for the Nazi Party.&lt;ref name="Vol7"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/european-axis-sigint/assets/files/Volume_7_goerings_research_bureau.pdf |title=European axis signal intelligence in World War II as revealed by "TICOM" investigations and by other prisoner of war interrogations and captured material, principally German, Volume 7, Goering's "Research" Bureau |publisher=NSA |pages=54–55|format=PDF |accessdate= 31 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailovic worked at the FA unit, for several months, when he quit and was known to be employed by Inspectorate 7/VI by Autumn 1941, when he ran the Balkan section.&lt;ref name="Vol7"/&gt; During this period, the results from solving both codes and cyphers in the Balkan section were generally forwarded to [[Signal Intelligence Regiment (KONA)#Kona 4|KONA 4]], the Signals unit assigned to the Balkans theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trifković|first1=Gaj|title=The German 'ultra': signals intelligence in Yugoslavia 1943–1944|journal=Journal of Intelligence History|volume=17|issue=2|pages=104–120|doi=10.1080/16161262.2018.1425033|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailovic ran the ''Bailovic Party'' inside In 7/VI, that was an anti-nazi clique. After the [[20 July plot]], the Grupperleiter Major Lechner, who replaced Major Metting as commander of In 7/VI, was a fanatical Nazi. The Bailovic Party, held the most able personnel, but dwindling Balkan traffic meant the unit was superfluous. With a new Nazi leader in Major Lechnet, and the plot to kill Hitler occurring, the group was to be disbanded. Bailovic was removed from the unit, along with several others, with Lechner being posted to the west to become commander of [[Signal Intelligence Regiment (KONA)#Kona 6|KONA 6]].&lt;ref name="seven704"/&gt;

In Oct 1944 Bailovic moved to the [[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht|OKW/Chi]], also as head of a section dealing with [[Balkans|Balkan]] traffic. Towards the end of the war, he became an administrator, as Balkan message traffic dwindled by its nature, and became progressively rarer, as the war reached its conclusion.&lt;ref name="Vol7"/&gt;

==About the Semiconductor Industry Association==

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) positions itself as the voice of the U.S. semiconductor industry.  This is one of America's top export industries and a driver of American economic strength, national security and global competitiveness. Founded in 1977 by five microelectronics pioneers [[Wilfred Corrigan]] of [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], [[Robert Noyce]] of [[Intel Corporation]], [[Jerry Sanders (businessman)|Jerry Sanders]] of [[Advanced Micro Devices]], [[Charles Sporck]] of [[National Semiconductor Corporation]] and John Welty of [[Motorola]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiconductors.org/about/the_history_of_semiconductor_industry_association/ |title=The History of Semiconductor Industry Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; SIA unites companies that account for 80 percent of America’s semiconductor production. Through this coalition, SIA seeks to strengthen US leadership of semiconductor design and manufacturing by working with Congress, the Administration and other key industry stakeholders to encourage policies and regulations that fuel innovation, propel business and drive international competition. 
 
==SIA Goals==

The SIA maintains that a robust semiconductor industry is the only way to ensure that America remains the global technology leader, and works towards this goal through outreach to members of Congress, their staff, executive branch officials, foreign governments, member companies and trade associations.

Semiconductors – microchips that control all modern electronics – have a major impact on modern life. They enable the technologies that people use to work, communicate, travel, entertain, harness energy, treat illness and make new scientific discoveries.
 
*The semiconductor industry directly employs a quarter of a million people in the U.S. and supports more than one million additional American jobs.
*In 2012, U.S. semiconductor companies generated $146 billion in sales and semiconductors make the global trillion dollar electronics industry possible.
*U.S. semiconductor companies represent over half the worldwide market.
*Semiconductors are one of America’s largest exports.

'''SlideWiki''' is an open web-based [[OpenCourseWare]] authoring system. It supports learning content authoring and management (including [[SCORM]] 2004 compliance) and tools for collaboration/crowd-sourcing, translation, communication, evaluation and assessment.

== Concept ==

SlideWiki is a Web application facilitating the collaboration around educational content. With SlideWiki users can create and collaborate on slides and arrange slides in presentations. Presentations can be organized hierarchically, so as to structure them reasonably according to their content. Currently large-scale collaboration (also referred to as crowd-sourcing) around educational content (other than texts) is supported only in a very limited way. Slides, presentations, diagrams, assessment tests etc. are mainly created by tutors, teachers, lecturers and professors individually or in very small groups. The resulting content can be shared online (e.g. using Slideshare, OpenStudy, Google Docs). However, proper community collaboration, authoring, versioning, branching, reuse and re-purposing of educational content similarly as we know it from the open-source software community is currently not supported.

SlideWiki is a platform, where potentially large communities of teachers, lecturers, academics are empowered to create sophisticated educational content in a collaborative way. For newly emerging research fields, for example, a collaboration facility such as SlideWiki allows disseminating content and educating PhD students and peer-researchers more rapidly, since the burden of creating and structuring the new field can be distributed among a large community. Specialists for individual aspects of the new field can focus on creating educational content in their particular area of expertise and still this content can be easily integrated with other content, re-structured and re-purposed. A particular aspect, which is facilitated by SlideWiki is multi-linguality. Since all content is versioned and richly structured, it is easy to semi-automatically translate content and to keep track of changes in various multi-lingual versions of the same content object.

== Features ==

SlideWiki particularly focusses on the crowd-sourced authoring, translation support and enrichment of educational content with self-assessment questions. Features include:

* WYSIWYG slide authoring
* Logical slide and deck representation
* LaTeX/MathML integration
* Multilingual decks / semi-automatic translation in 50+ languages
* PowerPoint/HTML import
* Source code highlighting within slides
* Dynamic CSS themability and transitions
* Social networking activities
* Full revisioning and branching of slides and decks
* E-Learning with self-assessment questionnaires
* Source, citation and attribution tracking
* Synchronization and remote control of presentations

== SlideWiki H2020 project ==
SlideWikis future development has been established with the beginning of the year 2016 as an EU funded project. It was reengineered on a new technology stack and released on the official SlideWiki.org platform in 2017. 17 partner institutes from all over Europe and also South America cooperate in order to improve SlideWiki and implement many new features and enhance the user experience in order to become a central hub for open educational resources, especially presentations.

A '''snubber''' is a device used to suppress ("[[wiktionary:snub|snub]]") a phenomenon such as voltage transients in [[electronics|electrical]] systems, pressure transients in [[fluid]] systems (caused by for example [[water hammer]]) or excess force or rapid movement in [[mechanics|mechanical]] systems.

==Electrical systems==
Snubbers are frequently used in electrical systems with an [[electromagnetic induction|inductive]] load where the sudden interruption of [[electric current|current]] flow leads to a sharp rise in [[voltage]] across the current switching device ("inductive kick"), in accordance with [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]. This transient can be a source of [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be safely discharged. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in [[switch mode power supply|power supplies]]. Snubbers are also often used to prevent [[electric arc|arcing]] across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and [[welding]] or sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also [[arc suppression]]).

A simple RC snubber uses a small [[resistor]] (R) in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] with a small [[capacitor]] (C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ott |first=Henry W. |title=Noise Reduction Techniques in Electronic Systems |publisher=John Wiley |date=1976 |isbn=0-471-65726-3 |pages=189–192 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination can be used to suppress the rapid rise in [[voltage]] across a [[thyristor]], preventing the erroneous turn-on of the thyristor; it does this by limiting the rate of rise in voltage (dV/dt) across the thyristor to a value which will not trigger it. An appropriately-designed RC snubber can be used with either [[direct current|DC]] or [[alternating current|AC]] loads. This sort of snubber is commonly used with [[electromagnetic induction|inductive]] loads such as [[electric motor]]s. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so a decreasing transient current will flow through it for a small fraction of a second, allowing the voltage across the switch to increase more slowly when the switch is opened. Determination of voltage rating can be difficult owing to the nature of transient waveforms, and may be defined simply by the power rating of the snubber components and the application. RC snubbers can be made discretely and are also built as a single component (see also [[Boucherot cell]]).

===Diode snubbers===
{{Main|Flyback diode}}
When the current flowing is DC, a simple [[rectifier]] [[diode]] is often employed as a snubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ott|1976|p=193}}; diode protects transistor driver from overvoltage.&lt;/ref&gt; The snubber diode is wired in parallel with an inductive load (such as a [[relay]] coil or [[electric motor]]). The diode is installed so that it does not conduct under normal conditions. When the external driving current is interrupted, the inductor current flows instead through the diode. The stored energy of the inductor is then gradually dissipated by the diode voltage drop and the resistance of the inductor itself. One disadvantage of using a simple rectifier diode as a snubber is that the diode allows current to continue flowing for some time, causing the inductor to remain active for slightly longer than desired. When such a snubber is utilized in a relay, this effect may cause a significant delay in the ''drop out'', or disengagement, of the actuator.

The diode must immediately enter into forward conduction mode as the driving current is interrupted. Most ordinary diodes, even "slow" power silicon diodes, are able to turn on very quickly,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130923164732/http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/diode_turn-on_time.htm cliftonlaboratories.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to their slow [[reverse recovery time]]. These are sufficient for snubbing electromechanical devices such as relays and motors.

In high-speed cases, where the switching is faster than 10 nanoseconds, such as in certain switching power regulators, "fast", "ultrafast", or [[Schottky diode]]s may be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/application-note/an122f.pdf cds.linear.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===RCD snubbers===
More sophisticated designs use a diode with an RC network.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ott|1976|p=192–193}}: "''The R–C–D network provides optimum contact protection'', but it is more expensive than other methods and cannot be used in an ac circuit."&lt;/ref&gt;

===More sophisticated solid-state snubbers===
In some DC circuits, a [[varistor]] or two inverse-series [[Zener diode]]s (collectively called a [[transient-voltage-suppression diode|Transil]] or [[transient-voltage-suppression diode|Transorb]]) may be used instead of the simple diode. Because these devices dissipate significant power, the relay may drop-out faster than it would with a simple rectifier diode. An advantage to using a transorb over just one diode is that it will protect against over voltage with both polarities, if connected to ground, forcing the voltage to stay between the confines of the breakdown voltages of the Zener diodes. A Zener diode connected to ground will protect against positive transients that go over the Zener's breakdown voltage, and will protect against negative transients greater than a normal forward diode drop.

In [[alternating current|AC]] circuits a rectifier diode snubber cannot be used; if a simple RC snubber is not adequate a more complex bidirectional snubber design must be used.

==Mechanical and hydraulic systems==
{{Main|Mechanical snubber}}

Snubbers for pipes and equipment are used to control movement during abnormal conditions such as earthquakes, turbine trips, [[safety valve]] closure, [[relief valve]] closure, or [[fuse (hydraulic)|hydraulic fuse]] closure. Snubbers allow for free thermal movement of a component during regular conditions, but restrain the component in irregular conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipingtech.com/products/snubbers.htm Hydraulic &amp; Mechanical Snubbers] Piping Technology &amp; Products, (retrieved February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A hydraulic snubber allows for pipe deflection under normal operating conditions. When subjected to an impulse load, the snubber becomes activated and acts as a restraint in order to restrict pipe movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipingtech.com/technical/bulletins/hyd_snubber.htm Hydraulic Snubber] Piping Technology &amp; Products,(retrieved January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; A mechanical snubber uses mechanical means to provide the restraint force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipingtech.com/technical/articles/snubbers-hydraulic-mechanical.htm Snubbers: A General Overview] Piping Technology &amp; Products, (retrieved February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two thousand superconducting qubits are in a commercial product by [[D-Wave Systems]], however these qubits implement [[Quantum annealing]] instead of a universal model of quantum computation.

==Background==
Classical [[computation]] models rely on physical implementations consistent with the laws of [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dayal |first1=Geeta |title=LEGO Turing Machine Is Simple, Yet Sublime |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/lego-turing-machine/ |work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known, however, that the classical description is only accurate for specific cases, while the more general description of nature is given by the [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Quantum computation]] studies the application of quantum phenomena, that are beyond the scope of classical approximation, for information processing and communication. Various models of quantum computation exist, however the most popular models incorporate the concepts of [[qubit]]s and [[quantum gate]]s. A qubit is a generalization of a [[bit]] - a system with two possible states, that can be in a [[quantum superposition]] of both. A quantum gate is a generalization of a [[logic gate]]: it describes the transformation that one or more qubits will experience after the gate is applied on them, given their initial state. The physical implementation of qubits and gates is difficult, for the same reasons that quantum phenomena are hard to observe in everyday life. One approach is to implement the quantum computers in superconductors, where the quantum effects become macroscopic, though at a price of extremely low operation [[temperature]]s.

In a superconductor, the basic charge carriers are pairs of [[electron]]s (known as [[Cooper pairs]]), rather than the single electrons in a normal conductor. The total [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a Cooper pair is an integer number, thus the Cooper pairs are [[boson]]s (while the single electrons in the normal conductor are [[fermion]]s). Cooled bosons, contrary to cooled fermions, are allowed to occupy a single quantum energy level, in an effect known as the [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]. In a classical interpretation it would correspond to multiple particles occupying the same position in space and having an equal momentum, effectively behaving as a single particle.

At every point of a superconducting electronic circuit (that is a network of [[electrical element]]s), the condensate [[wave function]] describing the charge flow is well-defined by a specific complex [[probability amplitude]]. In a normal conductor electrical circuit, the same quantum description is true for individual charge carriers, however the various wave functions are averaged in the macroscopic analysis, making it impossible to observe quantum effects. The condensate wave function allows designing and measuring macroscopic quantum effects. For example, only a discrete number of [[magnetic flux quantum|magnetic flux quanta]] penetrates a superconducting loop, similarly to the discrete atomic [[energy level]]s in the [[Bohr model]]. In both cases, the quantization is a result of the complex amplitude [[Continuous function|continuity]]. Differing from the microscopic quantum systems (such as [[atom]]s or [[photon]]s) used for implementations of quantum computers, the parameters of the superconducting circuits may be designed by setting the (classical) values of the electrical elements that compose them, e.g. adjusting the [[capacitance]] or [[inductance]].

In order to obtain a quantum mechanical description of an electrical circuit a few steps are required. First, all the electrical elements are described with the condensate wave function amplitude and phase, rather than with the closely related macroscopic [[Electric current|current]] and [[voltage]] description used for classical circuits. For example, a square of the wave function amplitude at some point in space is the probability of finding a charge carrier there, hence the square of the amplitude corresponds to the classical charge distribution. Second, generalized [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] are applied at every node of the circuit network to obtain the [[equations of motion]]. Finally, the equations of motion are reformulated to [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|quantum Hamiltonian]] is derived.

==Technology==
The devices are typically designed in the [[Radio-frequency engineering|radio-frequency spectrum]], cooled down in [[dilution refrigerator]]s below 100mK and addressed with conventional electronic instruments, e.g. [[frequency synthesizer]]s and [[spectrum analyzer]]s. Typical dimensions on the scale of micrometers, with sub-micrometer resolution, allow a convenient design of a [[quantum Hamiltonian]] with the well-established [[integrated circuit]] technology.

A distinguishing feature of superconducting quantum circuits is the usage of a [[Josephson junction]] - an [[electrical element]] non existent in [[Superconductivity#Superconducting phase transition|normal conductors]]. A junction is a weak connection between two leads of a superconducting wire, usually implemented as a thin layer of insulator with a [[Niemeyer–Dolan technique|shadow evaporation]] technique. The condensate wave functions on the two sides of the junction are weakly correlated - they are allowed to have different superconducting phases, contrary to the case of a continuous superconducting wire, where the superconducting wave function must be [[Continuous function|continuous]]. The current through the junction occurs by [[quantum tunneling]]. This is used to create a non-linear inductance which is essential for qubit design, as it allows a design of [[Anharmonicity|anharmonic oscillators]]. A [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] cannot be used as a qubit, as there is no way to address only two of its states.

==Qubit archetypes==
The three superconducting qubit archetypes are the [[phase qubit|phase]], [[charge qubit|charge]] and [[flux qubit|flux]] [[qubit]]s, though many hybridizations exist (Fluxonium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manucharyan |first1=V.

For any qubit implementation, the logical [[quantum states]] &lt;math&gt;\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; are to be mapped to the different states of the physical system, typically to the discrete (quantized) [[energy level]]s or to their [[quantum superposition]]s. In the charge qubit, different energy levels correspond to an integer number of [[Cooper pair]]s on a superconducting island. In the flux qubit, the energy levels correspond to different integer numbers of [[magnetic flux quantum|magnetic flux quanta]] trapped in a superconducting ring. In the phase qubit, the energy levels correspond to different quantum charge oscillation amplitudes across a Josephson junction, where the charge and the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory|phase]] are analogous to momentum and position correspondingly of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. Note that the phase here is the complex argument of the superconducting wavefunction, also known as the superconducting order parameter, not the phase between the different states of the qubit.

In the table below, the three archetypes are reviewed. In the first row, the qubit electrical circuit diagram is presented. In the second, the quantum Hamiltonian derived from the circuit is shown. Generally, the Hamiltonian can be divided to a "kinetic" and "potential" parts, in analogy to a particle in a [[potential well]]. The particle mass corresponds to some inverse function of the circuit capacitance, while the shape of the potential is governed by the regular [[inductor]]s and Josephson junctions. One of the first challenges in qubit design is to shape the potential well and to choose the particle mass in a way that the energy separation between specific two of the energy levels will differ from all other inter-level energy separations in the system. These two levels will be used as the logical states of the qubit. The schematic wave solutions in the third row of the table depict the complex amplitude of the phase variable. In other words, if a phase of the qubit is measured while the qubit is in a specific state, there is a non-zero probability to measure a specific value only where the depicted wave function oscillates. All three rows are essentially three different presentations of the same physical system.

==Single qubits==
The GHz energy gap between the energy levels of a superconducting qubit is intentionally designed to be compatible with available electronic equipment, due to the [[terahertz gap]] - lack of equipment in the higher frequency band. In addition, the [[BCS theory#Implications|superconductor energy gap]] implies a top limit of operation below ~1THz (beyond it, the Cooper pairs break). On the other hand, the energy level separation cannot be too small due to cooling considerations: a temperature of 1K implies [[thermal fluctuations|energy fluctuations]] of 20&amp;nbsp;GHz. Temperatures of tens of mili-Kelvin achieved in dilution refrigerators allow qubit operation at a ~5&amp;nbsp;GHz energy level separation. The qubit energy level separation may often be adjusted by means of controlling a dedicated bias current line, providing a "knob" to fine tune the qubit parameters.

===Single qubit gates===
An arbitrary single qubit gate is achieved by rotation in the [[Bloch sphere]]. The rotations between the different energy levels of a single qubit are induced by [[microwave]] pulses sent to an antennae or [[transmission line]] coupled to the qubit, with a frequency resonant with the energy separation between the levels. Individual qubits may be addressed by a dedicated [[transmission line]], or by a shared one if the other qubits are off resonance. The axis of rotation is set by [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] of the microwave pulse, while the pulse length determines the angle of rotation.&lt;ref name=oneQBgate&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Motzoi |first1=F. |last2=Gambetta |first2=J.

K. |title=Simple Pulses for Elimination of Leakage in Weakly Nonlinear Qubits |arxiv=0901.0534 |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=8 September 2009 |volume=103 |issue=11 |pages=110501 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.110501|pmid=19792356 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103k0501M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, following the notation of,&lt;ref name=oneQBgate/&gt; for a driving signal

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(t)=\mathcal{E}^x(t)\cos(\omega_d t)+\mathcal{E}^y(t)\sin(\omega_d t)&lt;/math&gt;

of frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_d&lt;/math&gt;, a driven qubit Hamiltonian in a [[rotating wave approximation]] is

&lt;math&gt;H^R/\hbar=(\omega-\omega_d)|1\rangle\langle 1|+\frac{\mathcal{E}^x(t)}{2}\sigma_x+\frac{\mathcal{E}^y(t)}{2}\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the qubit resonance and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x,\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; are [[Pauli matrices]].

In order to implement a rotation about the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; axis, one can set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^y(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; and apply the microwave pulse at frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_d=\omega&lt;/math&gt; for time &lt;math&gt;t_g&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting transformation is

&lt;math&gt;U_x=\exp\left\{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_0^{t_g}H^R dt\right\}=\exp\left\{-i\int_0^{t_g}\mathcal{E}^x(t) dt\cdot\sigma_x/2\right\}&lt;/math&gt;,

that is exactly the [[rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] &lt;math&gt;R_X(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; by angle &lt;math&gt;\theta=\int_0^{t_g}\mathcal{E}^x(t) dt&lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; axis in the Bloch sphere. An arbitrary rotation about the &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; axis can be implemented in a similar way. Showing the two rotation operators is sufficient for universality, as every single qubit unitary operator &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; may be presented as &lt;math&gt;U=R_X(\theta_1)R_Y(\theta_2)R_X(\theta_3)&lt;/math&gt; (up to a global [[Phase factor|phase]], that is physically unimportant) by a procedure known as the &lt;math&gt;X-Y&lt;/math&gt; decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chuang |first1=Michael A. Nielsen &amp; Isaac L. |title=Quantum computation and quantum information |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-107-00217-3 |pages=174–176 |edition=10th anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, setting &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{t_g}\mathcal{E}^x(t) dt=\pi&lt;/math&gt; results with a transformation

&lt;math&gt;U_x=\exp\left\{-i\int_0^{t_g}\mathcal{E}^x(t) dt\cdot\sigma_x/2\right\}=e^{-i\pi\sigma_x/2}=-i\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt;,

that is known as the [[Quantum gate#Pauli-X gate (= NOT gate)|NOT gate]] (up to the global phase &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt;).

==Coupling qubits==
Coupling qubits is essential for implementing 2-qubit gates. Coupling two qubits may be achieved by connecting them to an intermediate electrical coupling circuit. The circuit might be a fixed element, such as a [[capacitor]], or controllable, such as a [[SQUID#DC SQUID|DC-SQUID]]. In the first case, decoupling the qubits (during the time the gate is off) is achieved by tuning the qubits out of resonance one from another, i.e. making the energy gaps between their computational states different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rigetti |first1=Chad Tyler |title=Quantum gates for superconducting qubits |page=21 |bibcode=2009PhDT........50R |isbn=9781109198874}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is inherently limited to allow nearest-neighbor coupling only, as a physical electrical circuit is to be lay out in between the connected qubits. Notably, [[D-Wave Systems]]' nearest-neighbor coupling achieves a highly connected unit cell of 8 qubits in the Chimera graph configuration. Generally, quantum algorithms require coupling between arbitrary qubits, therefore the connectivity limitation is likely to require multiple [[Quantum gate#Swap gate|swap]] operations, limiting the length of the possible quantum computation before the processor decoherence.

Another method of coupling two or more qubits is by coupling them to an intermediate quantum bus. The quantum bus is often implemented as a [[microwave cavity]], modeled by a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. Coupled qubits may be brought in and out of resonance with the bus and one with the other, hence eliminating the nearest-neighbor limitation. The formalism used to describe this coupling is [[cavity quantum electrodynamics]], where qubits are analogous to atoms interacting with optical photon cavity, with the difference of GHz rather than THz regime of the electromagnetic radiation.

===Cross resonant gate===
One popular gating mechanism includes two qubits and a bus, all tuned to different energy level separations. Applying microwave excitation to the first qubit, with a frequency resonant with the second qubit, causes a &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; rotation of the second qubit. The rotation direction depends on the state of the first qubit, allowing a [[Quantum gate#Controlled gates|controlled phase gate]] construction.
&lt;ref name=CRgate&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chow |first1=Jerry M. |last2=Córcoles |first2=A. D. |last3=Gambetta |first3=Jay M. |last4=Rigetti |first4=Chad |last5=Johnson |first5=B. R. |last6=Smolin |first6=John A. |last7=Rozen |first7=J. R. |last8=Keefe |first8=George A. |last9=Rothwell |first9=Mary B. |last10=Ketchen |first10=Mark B. |last11=Steffen |first11=M. |title=Simple All-Microwave Entangling Gate for Fixed-Frequency Superconducting Qubits |arxiv=1106.0553 |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=17 August 2011 |volume=107 |issue=8 |pages=080502 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.080502|pmid=21929152 |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107h0502C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, following the notation of,&lt;ref name=CRgate/&gt; the drive Hamiltonian describing the system excited through the first qubit driving line is

&lt;math&gt;H_D/\hbar=A(t)\cos(\tilde{\omega}_2t)\left(\sigma_x \otimes I-\frac{J}{\Delta_{12}}\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_x+m_{12}I\otimes\sigma_x\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the shape of the microwave pulse in time, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\omega}_2&lt;/math&gt; is the resonance frequency of the second qubit, &lt;math&gt;\{I,\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z\}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Pauli matrices]], &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the coupling coefficient between the two qubits via the resonator, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{12}\equiv \omega_1-\omega_2&lt;/math&gt; is the qubit detuning, &lt;math&gt;m_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is the stray (unwanted) coupling between qubits and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck constant]] divided by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. The time integral over &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; determines the angle of rotation. Unwanted rotations due to the first and third terms of the Hamiltonian can be compensated with single qubit operations. The remaining part is exactly the controlled-X gate.

==Qubit readout==
Architecture-specific readout ([[Quantum measurement|measurement]]) mechanisms exist. The readout of a phase qubit is explained in the [[#Qubit archetypes|qubit archetypes table]] above. A state of the flux qubit is often read by an adjust DC-SQUID magnetometer. A more general readout scheme includes a coupling to a microwave resonator, where the resonance frequency of the resonator is shifted by the qubit state.&lt;ref name=NatRev2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gambetta |first1=Jay M. |last2=Chow |first2=Jerry M. |last3=Steffen |first3=Matthias |title=Building logical qubits in a superconducting quantum computing system |journal=[[npj Quantum Information]] |date=13 January 2017 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/s41534-016-0004-0 |doi-access=free |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-016-0004-0|bibcode=2017npjQI...3....2G }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==DiVincenzo's criteria==
The list of [[DiVincenzo's criteria]] for a physical system to implement a logical qubit is satisfied by the superconducting implementation. The challenges currently faced by the superconducting approach are mostly in the field of microwave engineering.&lt;ref name=NatRev2017/&gt;

# '''A scalable physical system with well characterised qubits.''' As the superconducting qubits are fabricated on a chip, the many-qubit system is readily scalable, with qubits allocated on the 2D surface of the chip. Much of the current development effort is to achieve an interconnect, control and readout in the third dimension, with additional lithography layers. The demand of well characterised qubits is fulfilled with (a) qubit non-linearity, accessing only two of the available energy levels and (b) accessing a single qubit at a time, rather than the entire many-qubit system, by per-qubit dedicated control lines and/or frequency separation (tuning out) of the different qubits.
# '''The ability to initialise the state of the qubits to a simple fiducial state.''' One simple way to initialize a qubit is to wait long enough for the qubit to relax to its energy ground state. In addition, controlling the qubit potential by the tuning knobs allows faster initialization mechanisms.
# '''Long relevant decoherence times.''' Decoherence of superconducting qubits is affected by multiple factors. Most of it is attributed to the quality of the Josephson junction and imperfections in the chip substrate. Due to their mesoscopic scale, the superconducting qubits are relatively short lived. Nevertheless, thousands of gate operations have been demonstrated in many-qubit systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devoret |first1=M. H. |last2=Schoelkopf |first2=R. J. |title=Superconducting Circuits for Quantum Information: An Outlook |journal=Science |date=7 March 2013 |volume=339 |issue=6124 |pages=1169–1174 |doi=10.1126/science.1231930|bibcode=2013Sci...339.1169D }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''A “universal” set of quantum gates.''' Superconducting qubits allow arbitrary rotations in the Bloch sphere with pulsed microwave signals, thus implementing arbitrary single qubit gates. &lt;math&gt;\sigma_z \sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; couplings are shown for most of the implementations, thus complementing the universal gate set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chow |first1=Jerry M. |last2=Gambetta |first2=Jay M. |last3=Córcoles |first3=A.

At this point, Krishnan Ganesh and Meena Ganesh stepped down from all management roles in the Bangalore-based company and Srikanth Iyer was appointed the new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/pearson-ups-stake-in-tutorvista-to-own-100-113022400239_1.html|title=Pearson ups stake in TutorVista to own 100%|last=Mitra|first=Sounak|date=2013-02-24|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisitions and investments ==
* TutorVista had acquired Edurite, an education solutions provider, in 2007. 
* Pearson acquired a 17% stake in TutorVista from Bengaluru-based entrepreneur-investor couple K Ganesh and Meena Ganesh in 2009.
* In January 2011, it purchased another 59% holding for Rs 577 crore before increasing its controlling stake to 80% shortly after. 
* Two years later, Pearson acquired the remaining 20%. 
* TutorVista, founded by serial entrepreneur K Ganesh in 2005, was bought by Pearson in a multi-million (around Rs. 1000 crore) deal across several years which was completed in 2013.
* Bengaluru-based edutech company Byju’s has acquired the online education ventures of TutorVista and Edurite from the world’s biggest learning company Pearson in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/byjus-acquires-tutorvista-and-edurite/articleshow/59427281.cms|title=Byju's acquires TutorVista, Edurite from Pearson|last=Vignesh|first=J.|date=2017-07-03|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism==
''[[The Economist]]'' has suggested that building trust for an unknown Indian brand was the biggest difficulty faced by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/9358954 | work=[[The Economist]] | title=The outsourcerer | date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been several protests in the United States against those organizations that do not allow face-to-face and personalized tutoring. Officials and parents from both local and national bodies have mixed reactions regarding the ethical and practical implications of this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Tutoring and the Offshoring of Education| url=http://tcc.kcc.hawaii.edu/previous/TCC%202007/ciano.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK it is estimated that 1 in 4 students is now tutored outside school, with offshore tutoring companies increasingly entering the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook generation fuels boom in online tutors | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9029841/Facebook-generation-fuels-boom-in-online-tutors.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Julie | last=Henry | date=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VX''' was a short-lived and unsuccessful consumer [[analog recording]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format developed by [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] and launched in 1975 in Japan. In the United States it was sold using the [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]] brand and marketed under the name "'''The Great Time Machine'''" to exhibit its [[time-shifting]] capabilities, since VX machines had a companion electro-mechanical clock timer for timed recording of [[television program]]s. In Japan, the VX-100 model was launched in 1975, with the VX-2000 following in 1976. The first and only model sold in North America was the Quasar VR-1000 (based on the Panasonic VX-2000), with the VT-100 timer.

==Design==

The VX cassette itself had both reels of {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magnetic tape]] stacked on top of each other in a coaxial fashion (much like the earlier [[Philips]] "[[Video Cassette Recording|VCR]]" and [[Cartrivision]] formats) in the bottom half of the tape, with a circular opening on the underside of the top half of the cassette, where the video head drum would enter.  The tape in this opening was pre-formed in a loop to go around the head drum, eliminating the need for the tape to be pulled out of the cassette and threaded around the drum (as with later videocassette formats such as [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]]).  The opening was protected by a cylindrical plastic plug to protect the tape, which was unscrewed from the opening when the tape was loaded in the machine (by means of moving a horizontal lever on the front of the machine), and inserted back into the tape when ejected (by moving the lever back).

The video head drum itself of a VX machine also has the unique distinction of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment.  The drum has a knurled nut on top, which can be adjusted by hand, allowing the drum to be removed from the deck for cleaning or replacement.  To this date, the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature.

'''WaterML''' is a [[technical standard]] and [[information model]] used to represent [[hydrological]] [[time series]] structures. The current version is WaterML 2.0, released an [[open standard]]&lt;ref name="OGC_WaterML"&gt;{{Citation |date=2014-02-24 |title=OGC WaterML 2.0 |publisher=[[Open Geospatial Consortium]] |url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC).

==History==

===WaterML 1.0===
Version 1.0 of WaterML was published in 2009 by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science.&lt;ref name="WaterML 1.0"&gt;{{citation |first1=David |last1=Valentine |first2=Ilya |last2=Zaslavsky |date=June 11, 2009 |title=CUAHSI WaterML 1.0 |publisher=Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science |url=http://his.cuahsi.org/documents/WaterML_1_0_part1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; WaterML 1.0 (and 1.1) is an [[XML]] exchange format developed for use specifically in the United States.

===WaterML 2.0===
WaterML 2.0 is an open standard&lt;ref name="OGC_WaterML"/&gt; of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]. Version 2.0 marks a harmonisation with different formats from various organisations and countries, including the Australian [[Water Data Transfer Format]], WaterML 1.0 from the United States,&lt;ref name="WaterML 1.0" /&gt; [http://www.xhydro.de/index_en.html XHydro] from Germany, and with existing OGC formats. WaterML 2.0 was adopted as an official standard by the OGC in September 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressrelease/1696], OGC press release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Australia-setting-the-standard-for-water-information-exchange.aspx], CSIRO press release&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the US Federal Geographic Data Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/news/WaterML], FGDC press release&lt;/ref&gt; and has been proposed for adoption by the [[World Meteorological Organisation]] (WMO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/hwrp/chy/chy14/documents/final_report/1105_en.pdf], WMO, Resolution 3, Commission for Hydrology session November 2012 - Abridged final report with resolutions and recommendations&lt;/ref&gt;

Example uses include: exchange of data for operational hydrological monitoring programs; supporting operation of infrastructure (e.g. dams, supply systems); cross-border exchange of observational data; release of data for public dissemination; enhancing disaster management through data exchange; and exchange in support of national reporting. The standard was developed through a harmonisation process&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwaponline.com/jh/up/jh2013174.htm], Taylor, P.; Cox, S.; Walker, G.; Valentine, D; Sheahan, P. WaterML 2.0: Development of an open standard for hydrological time series data exchange. Journal of Hydroinformatics. doi:10.2166/hydro.2013.174.&lt;/ref&gt; by members of the joint OGC-WMO Hydrology Domain Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/hydrologydwg] WMO/OGC Hydrology Domain Working Group wiki page&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
WaterML 2.0 makes use of existing OGC standards, primarily [[Observations and Measurements]] (O&amp;M) and the [[Geography Markup Language]] (GML). This enhances consistency and interoperability with other standards and web services. Through use of the O&amp;M standard, WaterML 2.0 defines types allowing for standard definition of the core properties relating to hydrological time series, including:

* The observed phenomenon 
* Spatial context
* Temporal bounds
* Procedure used in generating the time series (e.g. raw data from a sensor)
* Result-specific metadata, such as time series qualifiers, interpolation types, comments, quality codes etc.
* Monitoring points
* Collections of related objects
* Vocabularies for domain-specific terms

The core information model is defined using the [[Unified Modelling Language]], allowing for flexibility in creating implementation-specific encodings. The standard defines a GML-conformant [[XML]] encoding allowing for use with OGC [[Web Services]].

'''William Westerfield Havens Jr.''' (March 31, 1920{{spaced ndash}}June 29, 2004) was an American [[physicist]].

A graduate of [[City College of New York]] and [[Columbia University]], Havens worked with [[James Rainwater]] on the construction of a [[Neutron spectroscopy|neutron spectrometer]], which became the subject of his doctoral thesis. During World War II he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], the effort to create the first [[atomic bomb]]s, in its Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories.

Havens was awarded his doctorate in 1946 after his thesis was declassified.  He spent the rest of his career at Columbia University, where he became a full professor in 1955, and was its director of nuclear science and engineering from 1961 to 1977. He was part of the US delegation at the United Nations [[Atoms for Peace]] Conferences in Geneva in July and August 1955 and in September 1958, and became a consultant at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1962. He retired from Columbia in 1985, and from then until 1990 was the first full-time CEO of the [[American Physical Society]].

== Early life ==
Havens was born in [[the Bronx]] on March 31, 1920, the son of William Havens Sr., a civil engineer, and Elsie S. Nedle, a schoolteacher. He had an older sister, Marjorie, who became a lawyer.&lt;ref name="Oral1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/31723_1.html |title=Oral History Transcript — Dr. William Havens —  Session I |publisher= American Physical Society |date=February 21, 1991 |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkroots.org/bookarchive/historyofnewyorkstate/bio/pt60.html |title=The History of New York State Biographies, Part 60 |editor-first=James |editor-last=Sullivan |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of [[Jonathan Nicoll Havens]], a politician who served in the [[United States Congress]] from 1795 to 1799.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000359 |title=Havens, Jonathan Nicoll – Biographical Information |publisher=[[United States Congress]] |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Evander Childs High School]], from which he graduated in 1935 at the age of 15. His father wanted him to enter [[Columbia University]], his own ''alma mater'', but Columbia would not accept his on account of his age. He therefore entered the [[City College of New York]], which he attended on a scholarship. While there he was on the [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] team, and served in the [[ROTC]], reaching the rank of cadet captain. During the summer of 1938 he was a [[lifeguard]] at the ROTC camp. The following year he worked as a lifeguard at [[Jones Beach Island]]. He graduated with his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1939, majoring in [[mathematics]] and [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

In 1939, Havens entered Columbia University, where he studied [[physics]], taking classes on [[mechanics]] with [[George B. Pegram]], [[atomic physics]] with [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[electromagnetism]] with Shirley L. Quimby.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; He was awarded his [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1941.&lt;ref name="Fu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apam.columbia.edu/william-w-havens-jr-1920-2004  |title=William W. Havens Jr. (1920–2004) |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began working on his doctorate under the supervision of [[John R. Dunning]]. Fellow graduate students in physics at the time included [[James Rainwater]], [[Herbert L. Anderson]] and [[George Weil]]. He worked with Rainwater on the construction of a [[Neutron spectroscopy|neutron spectrometer]].&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; His thesis, on "Slow neutron cross sections of indium, gold, silver, antimony, lithium and mercury as measured with a neutron beam spectrometer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1514041 |title=Slow neutron cross sections of indium, gold, silver, antimony, lithium and mercury as measured with a neutron beam spectrometer |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was classified.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

==Manhattan Project==
The physics faculty at Columbia were drawn into what became the [[Manhattan Project]], the effort to create the first [[atomic bomb]]s, which accelerated after the United States entered [[World War II]] in December 1941. Fermi and Anderson carried out studies of [[neutrons]] emitted by [[Nuclear fission|fission]], while Dunning began investigating [[isotope separation]]. Havens and Rainwater attempted to measure the time it took for fission to occur. That found it was less than a microsecond, which was the smallest time that they could measure. They analyzed samples of uranium that [[Robert R. Wilson]]'s team at [[Princeton University]] had attempted to separate the isotopes using a device called the "isotron". They reported that the degree of enrichment was slight, and the process was eventually abandoned. Wilson's group was transferred to the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=47–48}}

Fermi's reactor group also left Columbia, as [[Arthur Compton]] consolidated the Manhattan Project's reactor project at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]]. Those that remained at Columbia became the Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories, under the direction of [[Harold Urey]], which was mainly concerned with isotope separation for [[uranium enrichment]]. Havens and Rainwater also devised a means of measuring residual [[hydrogen]] in [[fluorocarbons]], a subject of great interest because [[uranium hexafluoride]] gas was being considered for use in isotope separation processes.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;  Havens, Rainwater and [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] worked on the development of radiation detector instrumentation, and studies of [[neutron cross section]]s using the neutron spectrometer. This included work with [[plutonium]]. After the war ended in August 1945, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published.{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=18}} This included his PhD thesis, and he was awarded his doctorate after it was published, along with Rainwater's, in the [[Physical Review]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Later life==
Havens spent the rest of his career at Columbia University, where he became a full professor in 1955, and was its director of nuclear science and engineering from 1961 to 1977.&lt;ref name="Fu" /&gt; In the immediate post-war period, Columbia built a powerful 400 M[[electronvolt|eV]] [[synchrotron]], which became operational in 1950, at the [[Nevis Laboratories]], on an estate on the [[Hudson River]] at [[Irvington, New York]], willed to Columbia University by the [[DuPont]] family.{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=15}} To learn about cyclotrons, Havens spent some time with [[Emilio Segrè]]'s group at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="Oral2" /&gt; Havens used the Nevis synchrotron to produce neutrons as part of an [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] project to see if plutonium could be produced without a nuclear reactor, as it was believed at the time that uranium was scarce. The project eventually evolved into the Materials Test Accelerator at the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]; but it never served its intended purpose, as uranium was found to not be a scarce as first thought.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

From 1948 until the 1970s, Havens served with the AEC Neutron Cross-sections Advisory Group. This led to his being a part of the US delegation at the United Nations [[Atoms for Peace]] Conferences in Geneva in July and August 1955 and in September 1958. Havens pressed the AEC to release more information on neutron cross-sections, but was thwarted by its chairman, [[Lewis Strauss]],&lt;ref name="Oral2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/31723_2.html|title=Oral History Transcript — Dr. William Havens —  Session II |publisher= American Physical Society |date=July 17, 1991 |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/physics/2ndgenconf/data/Proceedings%201958/NG900090.pdf |title=Proceedings of the Second United Nations International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy |date=1–13 September 1958 |publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] |accessdate=April 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who explained, "We’ve got to keep something secret".&lt;ref name="Oral2" /&gt;

The work with neutrons led to Havens becoming a consultant (later called "visiting staff member") at Los Alamos in 1962. He would attend occasional meetings at Los Alamos during the academic year, and spend a couple of weeks there during the summer. At the time there was considerable interest in neutron weapons.&lt;ref name="Oral4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/31723_4.html |title=Oral History Transcript — Dr. William Havens —  Session IV |publisher= American Physical Society |date=August 5, 1991 |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Havens retired from Columbia and became the first full-time CEO of the [[American Physical Society]] (APS), the largest professional physicists' body in the world. He retired from this in 1990. He oversaw the APS a period of considerable growth,&lt;ref name="Renowned"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/04/07/havens.html |title=Renowned Physicist William W. Havens Jr. Dies at 84 |first=Alissa Kaplan |last=Michaels |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |date=July 29, 2004 |accessdate=March 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with [[Vera Kistiakowsky]] to promote the role of women in science.&lt;ref name="Oral4" /&gt;

Havens died from complications related to [[leukaemia]] in [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital]] on June 29, 2004. He was survived by his wife Aldine, daughters Nancy and Cynthia, and sister, Marjorie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paid Notice – Deaths Havens, Dr. William Westerfield, Jr. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=July 1, 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
