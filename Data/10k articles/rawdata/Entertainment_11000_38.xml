==Plot==
In real-life police departments, officers who work in Special Victims Units must rotate out, or otherwise they become affected by the horrible things they see in the course of their jobs.

A superhero named John Dusk begins executing criminals after having seen too many horrible sights, believing they do not deserve to live because of the magnitude of their crimes.

== Sequels ==
''Absolution: Rubicon'' is a 5-issue sequel created &amp; written by Christos Gage with art by Daniel Gete. It was published by Avatar with first issue dated June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=40724 Absolution: Rubicon] at Comic Book DB. Retrieved August 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2139">'''ActiMates''' were a series of interactive toys released by [[Microsoft Home#Kids|Microsoft Kids]] in September 1997. The toys were in the form of licensed dolls which can interact with many episodes of their respective [[television series]] from 1997-2000 or on special ActiMates-compatible [[VHS]] tapes and special PC games.

Microsoft released seven characters: [[Barney &amp; Friends|Barney]], [[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur and his sister D.W.]] and the [[Teletubbies]]. ActiMates Barney was the first to be released in 1997, becoming a success that holiday season. The dolls can interact with the TV and the computer (the Teletubbies can't interact with the PC) using a special TV and PC Pack. The toys were marketed as educational tools and gave positive affirmations for correct answers from the user. They can also be played without the packs for the VCR and computer. There are 3 ActiMates Barney PC games released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1997/feb97/actimate.mspx Microsoft Launches ActiMates Early Learning System At Toy Fair: Unique Realmation Animation Technology Makes Interactive Barney Ideal Learning Partner&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623161910/https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1997/feb97/actimate.mspx |date=June 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1998/9-29mates.mspx ActiMates Arthur and D.W.

'''''Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] in a [[fantasy]] setting. The sequel to ''[[Age of Wonders]]'', it was developed by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[video game developer]] [[Triumph Studios]].

==Gameplay==
Unlike in ''Age of Wonders'', where the player has the option of removing their leader from the map, players in ''Age of Wonders II'' take the role of an immortal spell-casting Wizard, who cannot be upgraded, but in certain circumstances can survive being killed.

[[Image:Age of Wonder 2 screencap2.jpg|thumb|left|Screen capture of tactical battle in ''Age of Wonders II''.]]

===Combat and heroes===
In contrast to ''Age of Wonders'', the maps for tactical battles are now much smaller. This led to faster [[combat]] and less maneuvering of units. Also in contrast to its predecessor, when gaining new levels Heroes can no longer choose new skills from a list of all available skills; instead, the player is forced to choose one of three offered skills, depending on the Hero's class.

===Magic system===
In ''Age of Wonders'', magic is used via the spell casting abilities of leaders and heroes, and global spells can be cast some distance away from the hero; use of spells in combat is restricted to battles where a hero with spell casting is present.

Magic use in ''Age of Wonders II'' uses a "domain" system; spells can only be cast within the domain of the casting wizard, or the domain of an allied wizard. Magic domains can overlap with each other, and in the simple case, are centered &lt;!-- do '''not''' change this to "centered" - check Wiktionary --&gt; on the Wizard. When a Wizard is present in a Wizard's Tower, the radius of the domain increases significantly, and in addition is radiated by other Wizard's Towers, Magic Relays and Heroes under the control of the player. Global spells can only be cast by the Wizard, via a spell book located in the main user interface; spells can be cast in combat by either Heroes involved in the battle, or (provided the battle takes place inside their domain) the Wizard who controls any party which entered the battle.

Improved audio quality and graphics, sub-quests from various gods, more races and build options as well as two large single-player campaigns made most of the large fanbase of ''[[Age of Wonders]]'' happy migrating to ''Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne''{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}; this was aided by the involvement of members of the HeavenGames community in suggestions, testing and development of the game.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Probably planned as an [[expansion pack]], ''[[Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic]]'' was published later as a stand-alone game.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

''Age of Wonders II'' was a nominee for ''[[PC Gamer US]]''{{'}}s "2002 Best Turn-Based Strategy Game" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin]]''.&lt;ref name=pcgamerusawards2003&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2003 | title=The Ninth Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards | volume=10 | number=3 | pages=48–50, 54, 58, 60, 66, 68, 70  | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | author=Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a finalist for ''[[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]]''{{'}}s 2002 "Best Strategy Game for PC" prize, but lost to ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos]]''.&lt;ref name=blister2002&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030308163735/http://elecplay.com/feature.html?article=10626#mr_toppy | url=http://elecplay.com:80/feature.html?article=10626#mr_toppy | title=Blister Awards 2002 | archivedate=2003-03-08 | author=Staff | work=[[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]] | deadurl=yes | access-date=2018-10-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game includes elements borrowed from ''Space Invaders'' and ''Arkanoid''. The player maneuvers the Vaus [[spacecraft]] along the [[blue]] region located at the bottom of the screen, and must deflect a [[ball]] at a formation of [[brick]]s and Space Invaders [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]]. The player will need to avoid fire from the latter, although the player can deflect the shots at the aliens. The goal of each stage is to destroy the formation of bricks as well as the aliens, and the player will move forward to the next stage once this goal has been completed. The player will need to make his/her way across several different worlds, with each world containing four stages. At the final stage, the player will need to fight a final boss before moving on. Once a world has been completed, the player will acquire a random power-up in the form of characters representing older Taito properties, such as ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'', ''[[Darius (video game)|Darius]]'' and ''[[Psychic Force]]''.

''Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders'' received positive reviews from critics, with reviews praising the amalgamation of ''Arkanoid'' and ''Space Invaders'', and ditching the [[free-to-play]] model of [[Mobile app|mobile applications]]. The game currently has an 85/100 score on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; Eli Hodapp of ''[[TouchArcade]]'' states that “the ''Arkanoid'' and ''Space Invaders'' universes have been duct taped together in a way that actually works quite well” and that it is "A super-solid brick breaker with an interesting twist and no freemium shenanigans".&lt;ref name="TouchArcade" /&gt; Chris Shilling of ''[[Waypoint (website)|Waypoint]]'' describes the game as "Crisp and colorful with an energetic EDM soundtrack, ''Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders'' is a fizzy, addictive treat—like a bag of cola bottles but with slightly more nutritional value, and all for roughly the price of a London pint".&lt;ref&gt;https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/arkanoid-vs-space-invaders-is-an-arcade-crossover-for-the-ages&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Allen of [[Gamezebo]] commented by saying that "''Arkanoid'' and ''Space Invaders'' is one of those perfectly shrewd moves that you had no idea could work so well until, well, it did. Partly skills based and partly a puzzle game, it's a delightful combination of two iconic classics. Even better, you won’t have to suffer the scourge of in-app purchases to enjoy it." However, she did criticise the boss battles by stating that they "are somewhat lackluster, never quite fulfilling their potential".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamezebo.com/2017/05/25/arkanoid-vs-space-invaders-review-beautiful-pairing/&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Slater of ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' described ''Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders'' as "a mash up of two of Taito's old arcade franchises. And it's actually pretty interesting. There's bouncing, there are blocks, there are waves of alien invaders trying to destroy the cosmos. While that might sound like a silly mish mash, there's actually a decent amount of cohesion here".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Arkanoid+vs+Space+Invaders/review.asp?c=74102&lt;/ref&gt; CJ Andrissen of ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised the game by stating that it is "One of the best mobile games of the year" and that "there is just so much game here to enjoy and with no ads, no microtransactions, and no need to always be connected to the internet, ''Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders'' is missing most of the red flags people wave when dismissing the mobile marketplace. It isn’t the best version of ''Space Invaders'' out there but it is the best version of ''Arkanoid'' currently available".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.destructoid.com/review-arkanoid-vs-space-invaders-437741.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Armored Core: Nexus'''''  is a [[mecha]] video game in the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series, developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Agetec]].  It is the sequel to ''[[Silent Line: Armored Core]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Plot==
Years have passed since [[Silent Line: Armored Core|the incident at the Silent Line]], and with it the collaborative effort began by the Corporations in response to it is long gone. The battle between the Corporations has re-emerged and continues unabated. Now a new Corporation has entered the scene; this Corporation, Navis, while nowhere near the size of the other Corporations, does have a trump card; it has complete control over a brand new and very useful resource, and they do not intend to share. The other Corporations obviously will not sit back and let that stand, so they set up contracts with Ravens through Raven's Ark. Of course, Navis is employing the use of the Ravens as well, and a full-scale conflict seems apparent on the horizon.

'''Black Element Software Co., LTD''' is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[video game developer]] based in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. Prior to their acquisition by [[Bohemia Interactive Studio]] in 2010, they [[video game developer|developed]] [[Video game|computer and console]] games directly.

==History==
Black Element Software was founded in 2000 by the members of Insanity, known for their games [[Testament (video game)|Testament]] and [[Testament II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testament II|url=http://hol.abime.net/5739|website=Hall of Light|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They released their first game, ''[[Shade: Wrath of Angels]]'', on 1 October 2004. In 2005, they joined with [[Bohemia Interactive Studio]] and [[Altar Games]] to form IDEA Games, which functioned as a publisher and consultant for several independent developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDEA Games|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/idea-games/3010-488/|website=Giant Bomb|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2010, Black Element Software was acquired by fellow IDEA Games member [[Bohemia Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea-games.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=165&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Support |publisher=Idea Games |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this acquisition, [[Bohemia Interactive]] promised that the acquired companies, including Black Element Software, would continue to operate individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bistudio.com/index.php/english/company/profile |title=Bohemia Interactive company profile |publisher=Bistudio.com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811154953/http://www.bistudio.com/index.php/english/company/profile |archivedate=11 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since acquisition, Black Element Software has been credited as a subsidiary of Bohemia Interactive Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zing.cz/special/974/bohemia-interactive-studio-ktere-zlepsilo-herni-prumysl-kapitola-sesta-arma-2-se-rozsiruje |title=Speciál: Bohemia Interactive: Studio, které zlepšilo herní průmysl - Kapitola šestá - Arma 2 se rozšiřuje|language=Czech |publisher=Zing.cz |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2365">A '''Bobby Car''' is a [[toy car]] designed for children from the age of around two. The Classic model is red, made of [[plastic]] and is about 60&amp;nbsp;cm long and 40&amp;nbsp;cm high. It has four wheels. The car has been produced by the BIG company since 1972 at sites in [[Fürth]] and [[Burghaslach]] in Germany. After the death of the Bobby Car inventor [[Ernst A. Bettag]] in 2003, the [[Simba Dickie Group]] took over the company. The name ''Bobby Car'' is protected. Since 2005, a new Bobby Car has been produced for which the Classic design was revised.

== Bobby car for children ==
[[Image:Bobbycar.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bobby Car Classic]]

The Bobby Car was invented in order to help children learn to walk. It has a kind of seat in which the child can sit as on a [[motorcycle]]. By swinging its legs, the child can move the car. Today, numerous accessories exist such as connecting rods, light running tyres, trailer and so on. As well as being manufactured in different colours, it also comes in variants such as a police car or tow truck. Special editions have been made to honour well-known German cars, such as [[Mercedes-Benz SLK]], [[Audi TT]], [[Smart (automobile)|Smart]] and [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. In cooperation with tyre manufacturer Fulda, a model having real tyres, rather than the usual hard plastic variety was produced.
&lt;!--To date, 300 million Bobby Cars have been sold.--&gt;

== Bobby Car Racing ==
In the 1990s another use of Bobby Cars emerged: Professional competitive driving. The plastic body is strong enough to carry an adult. The steering element and the axles are strengthened to handle high speeds (approximately 60&amp;nbsp;km/h). Competitions are held on closed roads with steep downward gradients.

The "official" German speed record of a Bobby Cars was set on 28 April 2003 by Marco Fischer from the Bobby Car Club [[Coburg]], who achieved a speed of 108.2&amp;nbsp;km/h.  On 5 August 2018, Dirk Auer set a new record of 119&amp;nbsp;km/h at the Race at Airport event, which took place at the Bottrop-Kirchhellen airfield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/panorama/weltrekord-extremsportler-schafft-119-km-h-auf-bobby-car-31066528], Berliner Zeitung: Extremsportler schafft 119 km/h auf Bobby-Car (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Born in either [[Snow Hill, Alabama|Snow Hill]]&lt;ref name=original&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_RqSDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=%22charles+anderson%22+blues+%22seals+louis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AaLAjdWMtf&amp;sig=9aV7Kr68YnOqRD3iG_t5LqlNq28&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUoLbMptbZAhWhD8AKHcqMD_4Q6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charles%20anderson%22%20&amp;f=false Lynn Abbott, Doug Seroff, ''The Original Blues: The Emergence of the Blues in African American Vaudeville'', Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2017, pp.145-146]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Birmingham, Alabama]],&lt;ref name="bare"/&gt; Anderson was an active vaudeville performer by 1909, when he played in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  He shared bills with [[Bessie Smith]] on several occasions, and by summer 1913 was known for his comedy and his performances of blues songs and "lullaby [[yodel]]s", called by one reviewer "the Male Mockingbird".&lt;ref name=original/&gt;  Anderson regularly performed as a female impersonator, in costume as an [[Mammy archetype|archetypal "mammy"]], and performed songs including "[[Baby Seals Blues]]" and [[W. C. Handy]]'s "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|Saint Louis Blues]]".  [[Ethel Waters]], long regarded as the first performer of the latter song, stated that she had first heard it sung by Anderson in [[Baltimore]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=abbott&gt;[http://files.umwblogs.org/blogs.dir/7134/files/2014/10/09161940/Abbot-and-Seroff.pdf   Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff, ""They Cert'ly Sound Good to Me": Sheet Music, Southern Vaudeville, and the Commercial Ascendancy of the Blues",  ''American Music'', Vol. 14, No. 4, New Perspectives on the Blues (Winter, 1996), pp.421-422]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also toured in [[Ontario]], [[Michigan]], and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=original/&gt;

In 1923, Anderson recorded Seals' blues for [[Okeh Records]], as "Sing 'Em Blues", with piano accompaniment by [[Eddie Heywood|Eddie Heywood Sr.]].  Blues scholars Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff commented on the performance: "Capturing the full range of Anderson's folk-operatic tenor voice in a remarkable rendition of the first published vocal blues song, this record survives to demonstrate an unabashedly comical resolution of "high" and "low" art, a positive realization of "colored folks opera."&lt;ref name=abbott/&gt;  Anderson recorded a further six songs for Okeh in 1924, and at his final recording session in 1928 recorded "Saint Louis Blues" as well as "I Got Those Crying Yodelin' Blues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/115559/Anderson_Charles_vocalist  "Charles Anderson (vocalist)", ''Discography of American Historical Recordings'']. Retrieved 5 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a favorite with black vaudeville audiences at the time, Anderson has tended to be dismissed as a curiosity by later critics because of his high voice and clear diction, which Abbott and Seroff say "conflict with modern tastes and stereotypes."&lt;ref name=original/&gt;

Anderson is thought to have died in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], after 1937.&lt;ref name="bare"/&gt;

A '''dance film''' is a [[film]] in which [[dance]] is used to reveal the central themes of the film, whether these themes be connected to narrative or story, states of being, or more experimental and formal concerns. In such films, the creation of [[choreography]] typically exists only in film or video. At its best, dance films use filming and editing techniques to create twists in the plotline, multiple layers of reality, and emotional or psychological depth.

Dance film is also known as the [[cinematography|cinematic]] interpretation of existing dance works, originally created for live performance. When existing dance works are modified for the purposes of filming this can involve a wide variety of [[film technique]]s. Depending on the amount of choreographic and/or presentational adjustment an original work is subjected to, the filmed version may be considered as dance for camera. However, these definitions are not agreed upon by those working with dance and film or video.

== Examples ==

Britain's [[DV8 Physical Theatre]], founded by [[Lloyd Newson]], is well known for its film versions of staged works. The reworking of ''[[Enter Achilles]]'' (1995) for film in 1996 is a seminal example of [[Dance for camera]]. Recently acclaimed works include ''[[The Cost of Living (2004 film)|The Cost of Living]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dv8.co.uk/film/film.folder.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's The Physical TV Company, directed by [[Richard James Allen]] and [[Karen Pearlman]], is well known for creating original works that are a sophisticated meeting of the possibilities of cinema with those of dance. Dance films such as ''Rubberman Accepts The Nobel Prize'' (2001), ''No Surrender'' (2002), and ''Down Time Jaz'' (2003) are differing examples of the possibilities of this approach involving comedy, visual effects, drama, and animation.

The [[Machinima]] work by Chris Brandt: '[[Dance, Voldo, Dance]]' which uses computer game characters within the game ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'' to act out a live, choreographed dance. Two players simultaneously performed the dance piece using game controllers. The work existed as a live performance on screen, and has since been edited and distributed on the internet as a video work.

The [[Mitchell Rose|Mitchell Rose's]] ''Deere John'', part of his ''Modern Daydreams'' suite created with [[BodyVox]] artistic directors [http://bodyvox.com/bio/bodyvox/jamey-hampton Jamey Hampton] and [http://bodyvox.com/bio/bodyvox/ashley-roland Ashley Roland], that features a man doing a [[pas de deux]] with a 22-ton John Deere [[Excavator]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''''Dofus''''' is a [[Turn-based tactics|tactical turn-oriented]] [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) developed and published by [[Ankama Games]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ankama-games.com/game.php?game_id=1 Ankama Games official website about ''Dofus'']&lt;/ref&gt; a French computer game manufacturer. Originally released solely in French, it has since been translated into many other languages. The game includes both [[Pay to play#In online gaming|pay-to-play]] accounts offering the full experience and [[free-to-play]] accounts offering a more limited amount of content. Its success has led to the marketing of spin-off products, such as books, art, comics and a movie released in 2016. It has also led to the development of two continuations: ''[[Dofus Arena]]'', released at the beginning of 2006, which is an alternative "tournament" version of ''Dofus''; and ''[[Wakfu]]'', a continuation of ''Dofus''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The game has attracted over 40 million players worldwide and is especially well known in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2007/03/france_games|title=Latest French Avant Garde: Games|publisher=''[[Wired News]]''|date=March 2007|accessdate=22 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221151531/http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2007/03/france_games|archivedate=21 December 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are more than 1.5 million subscribers every month on the game.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Gameplay==
''Dofus'' takes place in "The World of Twelve", named for the 12 gods that inhabit it. Players control a 2D [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] belonging to one of 18 character classes in a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] view. Each class has a unique set of spells that other classes can not obtain. As with most other [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role-playing games]], players gain levels by obtaining experience. Experience can be gained by defeating monsters and completing quests. With each level, players gain points that can be used to improve their avatar's characteristics and spells. Players can access new spells and equipment by advancing in level. Players receive a special 'aura' when they reach level 100, and gain a different aura at 200, the maximum level. Players may also decide to take up professions and frequently band together to undertake dungeons. Many also become part of [[Clan (computer gaming)|guilds]], to more easily coordinate with others. Players complete [[Quest (gaming)|quests]] to gain experience and other rewards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

While the game takes place in real-time, combat in ''Dofus'' is conducted more like a turn based strategy game – where each player takes it in turns to make a series of moves and attacks within a time limit. As such, when a player attacks monsters – they are transported to a 'copy map' where the fighting takes place. Once a fight begins, no other players may join that fight. Players use a series of spells (which are unique to that character class) to, amongst other effects, attack, heal, [[Buff (computer gaming)|buff]] or drain one's Action Points (AP) or Movement Points (MP). All actions done in combat (by both players and monsters) consumes an amount of AP and all movement consumes MP. In combat if a character loses all of their health points (HP) they're rendered dead.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;CHARACTERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

* '''Feca's Shield''', Fecas have a human appearance and form the defensive spellcaster class. They are seen as defensive supporters and/or resistant tanks - with spells involving increasing ally resistance to attacks and laying a variety of (spell) glyphs which AoE damage or effects. Weapon speciality: staffs
* '''Osamodas's Whip''', Osamodas are the summoner classes and have a human appearance with horns and a tail. They are able to summon various AI monsters to fight alongside them - however the AI of these monsters deter many from selecting this class. They also share many cleric-type spells making them a secondary healer. Due to their many summons, they are balanced supporters with a weapon speciality in hammers.
* '''Enutrof's Fingers''', Enutrofs are depicted as elderly humans and are known as the treasure hunter class - around which their spells and abilities revolve. Enutrofs have a higher probability of obtaining rare drops when fighting against monsters in Dofus. They are seen as the multi-purpose ranged supporter class and are the only class with a weapon speciality in shovels.
* '''Sram's Shadow''', Srams form the assassin/thief character class in Dofus with their appearance differing depending on the gender of the character. Their playing style is said to be more tactical than the other classes - being the only class that lay a variety of hidden traps on the ground and can render themselves invisible to get into close range. As a result, they are evasive close combat attacker with unique weapon speciality in daggers.
* '''Xelor's Sandglass''' , Xelors are the specialist denial and crowd control class with their spells focused upon restricting the moves of opponents. However they do have a number of ranged attacks and are therefore seen as the evasive ranged attacker. They have a mummy-like appearance and a weapon speciality in hammers.
* '''Ecaflip's Coin''', Ecaflips have a cat-like appearance and are the gambler class - with their main theme being chance or luck. They have attacks and buffs that can be either beneficial or harmful and are seen as the versatile attacker. Weapon speciality: swords.
* '''Eniripsa's Hands''', Eniripsas have a fairy / pixie appearance that differ depending on the gender of the character. They are the healer or clerics of Dofus with a range of healing and buff spells. They are also the only class with a weapon speciality in wands.
* '''Iop's Heart''', Iops form the warrior/paladin high-damage-dealing class. They have an elf-like appearance but with no pupil in their eyes. They are the specialist class in Dofus for close combat attackers. Weapon speciality: swords.
* '''Cra's Range''', Cras are the elf-like archer class in Dofus making them a specialist long ranged attacker. Many of their spells are linked to the bow and range. Unsurprisingly, they are the only class with a weapon speciality in bows, but maybe some will use daggers.
* '''Sadida's Boots''', A race of tree people that are the invoker class and offensive ranged attacker. Their spells orient around nature and various voodoo dolls - therefore acting as a secondary summoner in Dofus. They also have a handful of AoE spells and crowd control measures making them a versatile offensive ranged attacker. Weapon speciality: staffs.
* '''Sacrier's Blood''', Sacriers Berserkers and the primary tanks in Dofus. Their spells concentrate around receiving damage to do damage &amp; protecting allies in a tanking role. Their appearance is similar to that of zombies. They are the only class that does not have a weapon speciality.
* '''Pandawa's Pint''', As their names suggest, they have a panda-like appearance. Their spells are focus upon making an opponent weaker to attacks and two different states reliant on drinking alcohol. With their wide variety of spells, they are seen as the multi-purpose balanced close combat fighter. They are the only class with a speciality in Axes.

Characters in ''Dofus'' can learn up various professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg-game/characters/iop|title=Reckless Warrior|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a special type of profession called a specialization which can enhance item stats. Collecting professions involve players going out into the wilderness and collecting natural resources, such as certain wood and flowers. These can be later made into breads and such that restore health. They may also be sold as many of them are needed as quests items. Crafting professions involve the player piecing collected resources together to make a vast array of different items. Players gain experience in each profession by gathering the resources of that profession and/or by crafting items, depending on the type. As a player's collecting profession gains levels, they can collect new types of resources and obtain resources quickly. When a crafting profession levels, the player can create more powerful items and create them with a higher success rate, meaning that crafting will fail less often.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The currency used in ''Dofus'' is called "[http://www.kamasfarm.top Kamas]" (k). There are three cities that contain a [[marketplace]] where people can buy and sell goods and equipment for a fee. The [http://www.kamasfarm.top kamas] from these sales deposit directly into the player's [[bank account]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Accounts are separated into two categories, [[Free-to-play|Free-to-Play]] and [[Pay-to-Play]]. The game includes a zone accessible to Free-to-Play accounts. Free accounts have access to the new player zone of Incarnam and access to the city of Astrub and most of its outlying areas. This makes it possible for a new player to enjoy seemingly full game play, unbounded by time restrictions. Access to the entire world of ''Dofus''—including access to other cities, participating in factional Player vs. Player battles and being able to raise profession levels above 30—requires a monthly fee, with discounts given for longer term subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.dofus.com/en/shop/18-subscription|title=Subscription|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Since its release, ''Dofus'' has seen more than 25 million accounts created from its release and distributed at least 51 servers. ''Dofus'' has roughly 1.5 millions active subscribers in 2016.

=== Main Characters ===

* '''Kerub Crepin''' - Kerub takes the leading role as head of the house, father figure, shop keeper and storyteller. Most episodes focus on stories of his past, and he often maintains the leading role in present-day episodes as well. Through his many stories, viewers get to know him as a child, a teenager and an adventurer in his prime. These different periods of heroism, conquest and bravado are contrasted by his current wisdom, melancholy and care for Joris. Having left many flaws in his past, he often delivers morals to Joris, but he still displays mischief and other traits that children may identify with.
* '''Joris''' - Joris, 7 years old, is the second focus of the series, a young boy whom the target audience can relate to with his mischief, disdain for chores and love of stories and (child-scale) adventures. He is always pressing his "Papycha" for more stories, asking about the various magic items in the shop, all of which were acquired through adventuring. He is very curious and obedient and clearly loves his adoptive father. His pet flea Flifli is often helpful in situations of need, frequently acting like a guard dog.
* '''Simone''' - Simone is an Osamodas maid that is hired by Kerub in the second episode, although her arrival is based on a misunderstanding. Although she plays a secondary role in most episodes, she becomes a member of the family after a fashion despite being aloof toward most people, with the notable exception of Joris, with whom she sometimes behaves like a nanny. She also befriends Luis quickly, which allows her to set both the ''house'' and the ''household'' straight. She develops a romantic relationship with a local Ecaflip hairdresser named Julie, but her sexual orientation is never treated as out of the ordinary or used to make a point. Despite working as a maid, she is fearsome in a fight and secretive about her past.
* '''Lou''' - Lou is the lifelong love interest of Kerub, and also a capable adventurer in adulthood. Featuring in many episodes focused on the past, the Ouginak is sometimes seen as a prize, sometimes as a companion, and sometimes as a disgruntled lover to win back. Her strong temperament often clashes with Kerub's exuberant and carefree attitude, but his love for her is never diminished. She, on the other hand, seems to have left him for good and is never seen in the present day.
* '''Indie Delagrandaventure''' - The Ouginak Indie Delagrandaventure is Kerub's greatest rival. Similar in many ways, yet perfect opposites in others, they have spent their whole lives competing to determine who was the greatest adventurer. In their youth, they also competed for the love of Lou, but neither of them truly won that competition. Where Kerub relies heavily on luck and persuasion, Indie owes his success entirely to skill and discipline. He sees himself as a gentleman adventurer, refined and respectable, and Kerub as a "stray" merely playing at being a hero.

=== Supporting Characters ===

* '''Luis''' - As the living house where current-day events take place, the Shushu Luis is mostly involved in conversation, but he also has control over various parts of the house and can use doors, among other things, to hinder or assist Kerub depending on his mood. One episode is dedicated to showing how Kerub and Lou came into "possession" of him.
* '''Ecaflip''' - As Kerub was raised in Ecaflip's temple and became his favorite disciple, the god Ecaflip makes several appearances throughout the series, influencing his luck, watching over him or placing challenges in his way.
*'''Julie''' - Julie is a local Ecaflip hairdresser. She is revealed to be a [[lesbian]] as she falls for Simone the minute she sees her during Episode 1.&lt;ref&gt;""Kerubim"". ''[[Dofus#Animated series|Dofus: The Treasures of Kerubim]]''. Episode 1. January 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They develop a romantic relationship and are always seen together going on dates.
* '''Crocosec''' - Crocosec has an uncanny gift for disguise that is nothing short of unbelievable, which made him a valuable asset as part of Kerub's old crew. Unfortunately, he also feels uncontrollable urges to betray his allies at the worst times, but the others seem to accept his handicap rather gracefully.
* '''Kanigroo''' - Kanigroo is an expert tracker with a zen attitude, who never resorts to violence despite his impressive strength. His extraordinary sense of smell also allows him to detect lies.
* '''Tortue Brutale''' - This excitable member of Kerub's old crew has a fascination for explosives that needs to be kept in check by his friends, but his expertise on weaponry is equally valuable. He usually handles the more technical part of their operations.
* '''Bash Squale''' - Although he and Kerub used to be best friends, Bash has never forgiven Kerub for his perceived betrayal (episode 7). As he lives close by, Kerub often tries to be cordial with him, but his efforts seem wasted, to his chagrin.

'''''Dungeons 3''''' is a video game developed by Realmforge Studios and published by [[Kalypso Media]]. It was released on October 13, 2017, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. It is the sequel to the 2015 video game ''[[Dungeons 2]]'' and the third installment of the ''Dungeons'' series.

''Dungeons 3'' combines [[Construction and management simulation|dungeon building]] with [[real-time strategy]] elements. Players are tasked with creating an underground dungeon for creatures to live in as well as defending their dungeon against invading heroes from the world above. They can also send creatures to the world above where they can take direct control of their units. The game's [[Single-player video game|single-player campaign]] follows the story of Thalya, a [[Dark elves in fiction|dark elf]] sorcerer, on her quest to conquer the continent she lives on at the behest of the Dungeon Lord from the previous games. In [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], players can either [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperate to play the campaign]] or compete against each other.

The game features twenty single-player missions as well as a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op mode]] that allows two players to complete the campaign together.&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamereactor-review" /&gt; Additionally, the game contains a skirmish mode which allows battles against the computer on randomly generated maps as well as a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other but not attack each other's dungeons (unlike in ''Dungeons 2'').&lt;ref name="pcgamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dungeon-keeper-esque-strategy-game-dungeons-3-is-out-now/|title=Dungeon Keeper-esque strategy game Dungeons 3 is out now|last=Horti|first=Samuel|date=October 15, 2017|website=PC Gamer|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgames-review"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgames.de/Dungeons-3-Spiel-60725/Tests/Review-Strategie-Kalypso-1241159/|title=Dungeons 3 im Test: Besseres Gameplay, schlechtere Gags|last=Schütz|first=Felix|date=October 14, 2017|work=PC GAMES|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric perspective]] that can be rotated by 90° to display the environment and uses two different [[mini-map]]s for dungeon and over-world view.&lt;ref name="game" /&gt; Cut-scenes that tell the story use comic book style drawings instead of being rendered in the game's [[Game engine|engine]].&lt;ref name="game" /&gt;

== Synopsis ==

=== Setting and characters ===
The game's story takes place a short time after the events of ''Dungeons 2'' on a new continent ruled by the good paladin Tanos with the help of his friends, racist dwarf king Grimli, the vain paladin Elric the Pretty, and the greedy Yaina Overproud. Tanos has also adopted a young dark elf sorcerer named Thalya in an attempt to cure her inner darkness and prevent her from doing evil.&lt;ref name="Dungeons 3"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dungeons 3|developer=Realmforge Studio|publisher=Kalypso Media|platform=Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One|date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player's goal is to conquer the empire for the Dungeon Lord using Thalya as their lieutenant.&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;

=== Plot ===
After conquering the lands above, the Dungeon Lord becomes bored and attempts to invade a new continent which fails due to the minions' incompetence in boat-building. The Dungeon Lord casts a spell that allows him to control Thalya, awakening her evil side. After she slaughters the people in her home village, she decides to let her dark side take over and begins serving the Dungeon Lord as its chief lieutenant. on her quest to punish Tanos for attempting to convert her.

On this quest, Thalya gradually conquers more and more parts of the continent and dispatches of Tanos' friends one by one. Facing Tanos himself, she fails to defeat him and uses a spell to temporarily transport the Dungeon Lord to the continent where he battles with Tanos who then flees and becomes more fanatic in his attempts to destroy Thalya and her forces, sacrificing his own cities and people and calling upon dead heroes from [[Valhalla]] to fight for him instead. In the end, Thalya manages to defeat Tanos and subjugate the empire under the Dungeon Lord's will.&lt;ref name="Dungeons 3" /&gt;

=== Humor ===
More so than its predecessors, ''Dungeons 3'' contains a lot of allusions to other works of science-fiction and fantasy as well as [[meta-humor]], which includes frequently [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] by both the narrator and Thalya in dialogue.&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2017-10-17-dungeons-3-recensione|title=Dungeons III - recensione|last=Forlani|first=Andrea|date=October 17, 2017|publisher=Eurogamer Italy|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroIT" /&gt; The narrator (Kevan Brighting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/dungeons-3-releases-into-the-overworld-today-with-accompanying-livestream-466833.phtml|title=Dungeons 3 releases into the Overworld today with accompanying livestream|work=destructoid|access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also frequently argues with Thalya during missions and alters the missions based on these dialogues, such as having Thalya be attacked by bears he conjured out of thin air because she made a snippy comment at his expense.&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wccftech" /&gt; Allusions to other games of the same genre, especially ''Warcraft III'', as well as other games, films, such as ''The Lord of the Rings'', and fantasy franchises  are numerous.&lt;ref name="kotaku-review" /&gt;

== Development ==
Kalypso Media announced the development of ''Dungeons 3'' on February 21, 2017 with a press release and an announcement teaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gematsu.com/2017/02/dungeons-3-announced-ps4-xbox-one-pc|title=Dungeons 3 announced for PS4, Xbox One, and PC - Gematsu|last=Romano|first=Sal|date=February 21, 2017|work=Gematsu|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was shown to reporters at [[Game Developers Conference]] 2017. According to the developer, the introduction of the over-world as an area to be captured in ''Dungeons 2'' has proven a successful addition to the formula which is why Realmforge Studios concentrated on expanding upon this concept while keeping the changes that players liked from the last game.&lt;ref name="polygon-preview" /&gt;

''Dungeons 3'' was released worldwide and for all supported platforms on October 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/05/dungeons-3-release-date/|title=Dungeons 3 out next week, features more keeping and more overworlding|date=October 5, 2017|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first entry in the series that was released on multiple platforms, i.e.  [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], at the same time.&lt;ref name="pcgamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamereactor-review" /&gt;

=== Downloadable content ===
Realmforge Studios released three [[downloadable content]] (DLC) to ''Dungeons 3'' that expand upon the story:

* ''Once Upon a Time'' was released on February 2, 2018 and pits Thalya against a variety of [[fairy tale]] characters in three newly designed missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psu.com/news/dungeons-3-dlc-once-upon-time/|title=Dungeons 3 DLC Is A Trio of Content Starting With ‘Once Upon A Time’|last=Vito|first=Johnny|date=January 25, 2018|work=PlayStation Universe|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Evil of the Caribbean'' features a spoof of franchises like [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'']] and adds pirate-themed monsters and locations. It was released on March 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgames.de/Dungeons-3-Spiel-60725/News/piraten-voraus-im-neuen-dlc-evil-of-the-caribbean-1251590/|title=Dungeons 3: Piraten voraus im neuen DLC "Evil of the Caribbean"|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2018|work=PC GAMES|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DLC also adds new gameplay mechanisms by allowing enemies to create outposts within the player's dungeon area as well as the ability to build defenses outside the dungeon and three new traps and three new spells.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.de/articles/2018-10-01-dungeons-3-erweiterung-clash-of-gods-veroeffentlicht|title=Dungeons 3: Erweiterung Clash of Gods veröffentlicht|last=Jakobs|first=Benjamin|date=October 1, 2018|work=Eurogamer.de|access-date=November 2, 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a new multiplayer mode allows two players to plunder and raze an enemy city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

}}

The PC version of ''Dungeons 3'' received "generally favorable" reviews according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt; The [[Xbox One]] version received slightly worse reviews and is considered by Metacritic as having "mixed or average reviews". Multiple reviewers opined that ''Dungeons 3'' was the closest the developer has come to creating a successor to [[Bullfrog Productions]]' iconic [[Dungeon Keeper (series)|''Dungeon Keeper'' series]].&lt;ref name="wccftech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-cz-review" /&gt;

Most reviewers noted the graphics and audio positively.&lt;ref name="IGN ES" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-cz-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroIT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wccftech" /&gt; ''Eurogamer.it''  emphasized that the game's cartoonish look and feel are consistent with the humor of the game and highlighted how the world is peaceful and idyllic when the good heroes rule it but instantly turns dark, gloomy and oppressive when the player's units capture parts of it.&lt;ref name="EuroIT" /&gt; Other reviewers also lauded the colorful world and especially noted the level of details when units are in combat and magic effects are used.&lt;ref name="IGN ES" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wccftech" /&gt; However, some critics also argued that improvements compared to ''Dungeons 2'' were almost non-existent, making ''Dungeons 3'' merely a polished version of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="gamereactor-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroG-de-review"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.de/articles/2018-02-07-dungeons-3-test|title=Dungeons 3 - Test|last=Woger|first=Martin|date=February 7, 2018|work=Eurogamer.de|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Console versions were rated worse than the PC version, with ''4Players'' especially criticizing the Xbox One version's graphical errors.&lt;ref name="4players-review"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.4players.de/4players.php/dispbericht_fazit/Allgemein/Test/Fazit_Wertung/Allgemein/38533/82843/Dungeons_3.html|title=Test (Wertung) zu Dungeons 3 (Strategie)|last=Oertel|first=Mathias|date=October 27, 2017|work=4Players|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers also lauded the improved user interface (UI) and ease of input, which includes easy input on consoles, something seldom achieved by strategy and simulation games that tend to be tailored to PC keyboard and mouse input.&lt;ref name="gamereactor-review" /&gt; The UI drew minor criticisms as well though for having menus that block the whole screen when opened, thus making it harder to use them during battle.&lt;ref name="gamereactor-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku-review" /&gt;

German magazine ''GameStar'' noted positively that the fact that different resources only exist in the over-world or in the underground forces players to care about both areas.&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt; Reviewers also positively noted the variety of missions, such as missions where enemies are far stronger during the day than they are at night or where the player has to prevent food from being delivered to starve an otherwise invincible enemy.&lt;ref name="wccftech" /&gt; The pacing of the campaign, giving players access to more rooms and technologies gradually, was also remarked upon positively.&lt;ref name="gamereactor-review" /&gt; On the other hand, ''PC Games'' criticized the dungeon building aspect for always relying on the same pattern since there are no missions in which a scarcity of resources would force players to change their approach.&lt;ref name="pcgames-review" /&gt; That research was not saved and had to be repeated each mission was also seen as negatively forcing players into monotonous routine.&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroG-de-review" /&gt;

Although the game's humor was praised by some reviewers, many critics noted that not all players will enjoy the type of humor and that the game relies too much on humor to the point of becoming annoying.&lt;ref name="gamestar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wccftech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgames-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamereactor-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4players-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroG-de-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-cz-review" /&gt;

''PC Games'' lauded the new co-op mode but criticized that ''Dungeons 3'', unlike its predecessor, no longer offered a multiplayer mode that allowed to attack another player's dungeon.&lt;ref name="pcgames-review" /&gt;

'''GeneRally''' is a [[freeware]] [[Racing video game|racing game]] originally developed by brothers Hannu and Jukka Räbinä &lt;ref&gt;[http://wakoopa.com/developers/hannu-rbin-jukka-rbin Hannu and Jukka Räbinä] at [http://www.wakoopa.com Wakoopa], On-line software profile&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Finland]]. Although it features a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics engine, GeneRally has a [[top-down perspective]], where you can see all the cars (which is perfect for multiplayer races). Its art design calls to mind older arcade racing games such as [[Super Sprint]] and [[Slicks 'N' Slide]]. PCGamer, in an issue about free PC games, described it as "A minimalist [[Micro Machines (video games)|Micro Machines]]".&lt;ref&gt;"365 Days of Free Games." PC Gamer Big Book of Free. Summer 2009: pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The game and its system==
Up to six cars (either human or computer-controlled by [[AI]]) can race at the same time on a track. The game is quite easy to learn because the game physics are quite forgiving if you happen to lose control of the car. The game offers three game modes - time trial mode (player attacks best lap of a track; option of ghost car is available), race mode (against next 1-5 human or artificial opponents) and championship mode (season of several races). No matter on simple appearance, the game offers a basic damage model and even tire wear and fuel consumption causing necessity of [[Pit stop|pit-stops]] during the race - rare options in genre of arcade racing games including commercial titles. All settings of game are fully customizable (including details like separate adjustable AI level of every single AI opponent or pointing system of held championship).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.download-free-games.com/review/generally/ GeneRally Review at download-free-games.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplayer===
GeneRally does not support online or LAN play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://generally.rscsites.org/readme.shtml GeneRally Readme file]&lt;/ref&gt; However, up to 6 human players can play around one computer using same keyboard or keyboard combined with other devices like joystick or gamepad.

===Generally 2===
Generally 2, the [[sequel]] to GeneRally has been announced and is currently in the [[pre-alpha]] stage of development. A day and night cycle has already been showcased for Generally 2 in a video on the Curious Chicken Games [[YouTube]] channel &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCqNSdDFVS4hkGQoQ-hw7A]&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be in the coming sequel. A demo is also ready to play on the Generally 2 website&lt;ref&gt;[http://gene-rally.com/ksdemo/]&lt;/ref&gt; which players can only play on the [[Unity (game engine)]] web player. According to the 'GR2 Developer Blog' the demo represents maybe only 15% of the progress to the final game. The Demo has all the basic features of the original Generally, though now with added features. It has a dynamic shadowing feature and a Day and Night sequence as well, however according to the Developer Blog many additional features haven't been added yet and are under development. Respected Community player and car modeler Kimmo Kaisla &lt;ref&gt;[http://gene-rally.com/history/]&lt;/ref&gt; has joined in with the development team to help with development and a Kickstarter campaign was started on 9 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiouschickengames/generally-2-top-down-arcade-racing-game | title = GeneRally 2 - Top-Down Arcade Racing Game Kickstarter page | accessdate = 10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, soon after the campaign launch, the team could not get in contact with Kimmo for reasons that were unknown at that moment. Since Kimmo held a major role in the development of GeneRally 2, the rest of the team was unable to deliver new updates to the bakers and this caused a knock-off effect on the whole campaign, which in the end didn't reach the funding goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.gene-rally.com/page/3/]&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, Kimmo let the team know that he had some important issues (not disclosed to the public) which made it impossible for him to continue the development of the game. Still, the team decided to continue working with what they had; two more posts were written in the developer blog,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.gene-rally.com/page/2/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.gene-rally.com/page/1/]&lt;/ref&gt; but then no more news about GeneRally 2 seem to have surfaced ever since, despite the roadmap and the established release dates.

==Elements of the game==
Most of GeneRally is customizable, It is not possible to change only the models of in-game objects and the layout of the user interface, which causes, that the GeneRally is deeply customizable by 3rd-party content. This possibility allows to the player to set the game precisely to their needs and interests.

===The cars===
GeneRally cars are made up of a maximum of 40 [[polygons]]. Therefore, it is quite a skill to build them, which is done using community built tools. Most of the cars, that you can choose to drive, are fully color-customizable, which adds a personal touch to the game.

===The tracks===
The tracks that come with GeneRally are small and simple, unlike most current third-party tracks. An official [[Level editor|track editor]] lets the user put different objects (e.g. trees, walls, bridges and buildings) around the track, and make elevation changes, draw the areas with surfaces (asphalt, grass, mud, gravel, snow or water)  and export and edit land's map into various advanced external graphic editors like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.squakenet.com/computer_games/5446/Gene-Rally/download.html Review at Squakenet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Every month since July 2003 the community sets up Track of Month,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tom.gene-rally.com/ Track of Month]&lt;/ref&gt; where the members of the community vote for the best tracks published over each month. The default game itself comes with two basic folders of tracks, an [Old Tracks] set, with a variety of creative courses, and a [World Tour Tracks] set, with courses based on several countries. They are all fictional, but some hint at or resemble real-life locations. In the recent version of 1.10, an additional track set was released by TuomoH and included in GeneRally.

===Other customizable elements===

====Drivers====
Drivers can be created easily within GeneRally, and each can be assigned to be either a computer-controlled driver or a human-controlled driver. If human-controlled, the commands for Accelerate, Brake, Left, and Right can be assigned. If computer-controlled, a skill level from 0-200 can be chosen, with 200 being the "most-skilled". Also, each driver can choose primary and secondary colors for themselves, both of which are selected using a "color mixer" of primary and secondary colors (both in RGB scales).

====Fonts====
Various third party fonts for GeneRally are downloadable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gene-rally.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1209 Font Tutorial by JWong]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a TTF file.

====Palettes====
A palette is a file (with the extension ".pal") that allows you to change the in-game colors in order to create a specific atmosphere (fog, rain, autumn, night,etc.) or just small changes to the environment (blue kerbs, grey wooden planks, darker grass,etc.).

==Competitions==
The community of GeneRally has created several types of competitions to solve lack of competing to each other online. For all of them is common, that racer, who is taking a part, runs his event alone and not affected by other humans. Then he submits before set deadline predefined types of files of event to organizer (obviously savegame with full replay of his ride, then file of track, which he used and finally screenshot of game menu with after-race summary). The organizer then analyzes the files to verify their values (to prevent frauds), creates summary classification of all human drivers, merges the submitted replays and release results to public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.volja.net/ceca8/Files/HTJ%20Guide%20v1.0%20-%20ENG.pdf "How to Join a GeneRally Competition"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of events===
Three types of events exist: ''race'', where a human racer runs together with AI racers - human racer with fastest race time wins, In a ''hotlap'' event the human racer has to race alone, without AI racers, and attempts to set the fastest single lap - the racer with fastest lap time wins. It's very similar system to game's mod ''time trial''. However the term ''time trial'' has another sense in competition's terminology, it represents a combined version of ''race'' and ''hotlap'' - a racer runs a ride without AI racers like in ''hotlap'', but on distance of several laps, trying to set as short summary time as possible like in ''race''.

===Classical event===
The classical GeneRally event allows unlimited tries - racer can choose, which of his several tries will be submitted by him then and counted by organizer into the results. It eliminates natural accidents, failures, mistakes and influence of vis maior on racing.

===GeneRally World Ranking===
GeneRally World Ranking is classification and statistic of each one driver, team or nation, who joined one of supported competitions. It aims to compare the performances of GeneRally racers according to their performances in various competitions and to the difficulty of these. Sometimes it's compared with various real ranks like tennis' [[ATP Rankings|ATP]]. Since March 2003 every event, which fulfills GWR's rules, is classified and racers, teams and nations taking a part are awarded by number of points according defined scales.

'''Ghost Town Village''' (formerly "Ghost Town in the Sky at Ghost Mountain Park) is a [[Wild West]]-themed [[amusement park]] in [[Maggie Valley, North Carolina]], United States that is currently on hiatus. An unusual aspect of this park is that it is located atop a mountain which can only be accessed by visitors via a {{convert|3370|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[chair lift]] or an inclined [[funicular]] railway. These start at the parking area beside Jonathan Creek at an elevation of {{convert|3150|ft}}, climbing to the lower level of the park at {{convert|4400|ft}}, a climb of {{convert|1250|ft}}. The recreated "Ghost Town" sits at {{convert|4600|ft}}, with the highest elevation in the park being about {{convert|4650|ft}}. The park is located on a ridge extending from Buck Mountain border, an extension of the Cataloochee Divide, to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. The park's entrance is located on [[U.S. Highway 19]], the main road through the town. Ghost Town is promoted as "North Carolina's mile-high theme park."

Ghost Town was the brainchild of R.B. Coburn, a Covington, VA native who moved to Maggie Valley, North Carolina. The park was designed by Russell Pearson and constructed for approximately $1 million in 1960. The park opened on May 1, 1961 and quickly became one of Western North Carolina's most popular tourist attractions. Pearson and Coburn also opened Frontierland in Cherokee North Carolina in 1964, then another Wild West theme park: [[Six Gun Territory]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=mountaineer&gt;[https://archive.is/20070928043016/http://www.themountaineer.com/archives/2006/08/18/topstories_inthemaking.html Themountaineer.com], Retrieved on 2009-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, 620,000 people visited Ghost Town each year.&lt;ref name=studenc&gt;Bill Studenc, "Maggie Valley Considers Loan for Ghost Town," ''Asheville Citizen-Times'', May 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This number declined to 340,000 by 2008.&lt;ref name=rodriguez&gt;Andre Rodriguez, "Ghost Town Back in Business," ''Asheville Citizen-Times'', May 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was sold in 1973 to National Services for a stock swap, but Coburn bought it back in 1986 and constructed the park's famous Red Devil [[roller coaster]]. In its later years under Coburn's ownership, the park suffered from mismanagement and a lack of maintenance. The Red Devil, Goldrusher, Sea Dragon, Monster, Mountain Town Swings, Undertaker, Dream Catcher, Casino, Round Up, Lil Devil and Silver Bullet rides were regularly breaking down and rarely opened, causing many visitors to tell others not to go. The chairlift and incline railway also required constant maintenance and repair. Coburn spent thousands of dollars maintaining them.&lt;ref name=mountaineer/&gt; On July 16, 2002, the chairlift stopped, stranding passengers for over two hours. With fewer people visiting Ghost Town because of the bad condition of the park, Coburn closed Ghost Town a few days after the chairlift failure and put the park up for sale. The park remained closed and unmaintained for the next four years, leading many to believe that nobody would buy the park because of the bad condition of the rides.

Ghost Town was sold in August 2006 and reopened on May 25, 2007 after $38 million was spent on renovations and improvements.&lt;ref name=Sandford&gt;Jason Sandford, "Ghost Town in the Sky, one of WNC's most unique tourist attractions comes back to life", ''Asheville Citizen-Times'', July 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the rides were reopened except the incline railway, the train and the Monster. The opening of the park in May was scheduled closely by Dean Teaster and Hank Woodburn so the motion picture ''Dean Teaster's Ghost Town,'' which was filmed in the western town could premiere that same weekend.

In 2009, after more than $11 million had been spent, $6 million of that on the Cliffhanger roller coaster, Ghost Town filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|bankruptcy]]. The [[Late 2000s recession|economy]] and high gas prices the previous year were blamed for the park's problems, but managing partner Lynn Sylvester said reopening was planned for May 15 and the park would continue to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Rodriguez, "Struggling Ghost Town Files for Bankruptcy," ''Asheville Citizen-Times'', March 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-May 2009, the park's rides had not been inspected and Ghost Town claimed to need a $330,000 loan in order to reopen for the summer on May 22. The park asked the town for that money. Failure to secure the loan was expected to mean the loss of 200 jobs and a $2 million payroll, as well as impact local businesses who benefited from park visitors.&lt;ref name=studenc/&gt; An anonymous investor provided the money, according to park president Steve Shiver, so a vote by the town on the loan request became unnecessary and the park opened as planned, except for rides that had not been inspected. The park also added a new ride, Geronimo Drop, which had been at [[Libertyland]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and was bought by Ghost Town in 2007. Shiver said the park had a $27 million plan to improve the park over four to five years, including moving and adding rides and introducing new events.&lt;ref name=rodriguez/&gt;

Ghost Town continued to struggle financially until the end of the 2009 season, when the park closed while the owners dealt with bankruptcy issues amid complaints that employees were not being paid.

On February 5, 2010, a massive mudslide occurred when retaining walls on the Ghost Town property gave way. Although there were no injuries, more than 40 homes had to be evacuated and three homes were damaged around the mountain. The park itself sustained damage, but to what extent is not publicly known. This led to speculation that the park would not open at all for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20100206/FRONTPAGE/100206024|title=Maggie Valley residents recall horror of landslide|last1=Morrison|first1=Clarke|last2=Ball|first2=Julie|last3=Ostendorff|first3=Jon|last4=Fraser|first4=Thomas|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=2010-02-06|accessdate=2010-02-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20100214/NEWS01/100213015|title=Maggie Valley landslide leaves more questions than answers|last=Ostendorff|first=Jon|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=2010-02-14|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiver announced on a local news program that the park was still slated to open on Memorial Day weekend, but this did not happen. Federal funding was granted to the park in the amount of $1.3 million for the clean-up of its main access road, Rich Cove, which was buried in the slide.

In early March, 2010, a judge ruled in favor of the park's largest creditors, [[SunTrust]] and [[BB&amp;T]], to proceed with foreclosure on Ghost Town and sell the property to begin paying off the park's $9 million debt to SunTrust and $5 million debt to BB&amp;T. Ghost Town partners negotiated a separate deal with SunTrust and BB&amp;T which gave them until May 31 to come up with an alternate plan to allow the park to continue operating if funding was obtained. On May 4, a judge approved a takeover bid by American Heritage Family Parks, who pledged to pay SunTrust $7 million of its debt, BB&amp;T its entire $5 million of debt and pay $100,000 in back taxes to [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood County]]. The park was said to be allowed to open for the season while details of the sale were worked out.&lt;ref&gt;"Company makes bid to buy Ghost Town," ''Asheville Citizen-Times'', 2010-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the park remained closed.

In April 2011, the bankruptcy administrator recommended dismissing the case, citing the failure of Ghost Town partners to submit a sufficient reorganization plan to pay its debts.  This allowed foreclosure proceedings to continue as the park was no longer protected under Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smokymountainnews.com/news/item/3789-ghost-town-bankruptcy-hits-dead-end|title=Ghost Town bankruptcy hits dead end|last=Johnson|first=Becky|work=[[Smoky Mountain News]]|date=2011-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the park was purchased at public auction by Alaska Presley for $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="smokymountainnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokymountainnews.com/news/item/6231-resurrecting-a-ghost-town-alaska-presley-hopes-to-revive-maggie-valley-by-reopening-the-once-popular-ghost-town-amusement-park |title=Resurrecting a ghost town: Alaska Presley hopes to revive Maggie Valley by reopening the once-popular Ghost Town amusement park |publisher=Smokymountainnews.com |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presley, a Maggie Valley businesswoman involved with the park since its beginning, hoped to have at least a portion of the park open for the end of the 2012 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20120211/NEWS/302110025/Ghost-Town-Sky-sold-auction|title=|last=Morrison|first=Clarke|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=2012-02-10|accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2012, the park's A-frame entrance opened to the public for the first time in four years for gifts to be sold. The chairlift was also open and tours of the town could be taken.

A limited opening of the park was planned for 2013. During the four years the park was idle and without security, the property was subject to vandalism and theft. New laws required millions of dollars to be spent on labor and time lost due to state inspections. Wells for private water were condemned because they were too close to potentially unacceptable objects. Four new wells were drilled and all were failures except one of limited output. The option of city water was decided and virtually every piece and part of an old system had to be replaced.

In November 2014, Ghost Town was listed for sale with an asking price of $3 million by Action Creak Realty. The sale of the lower half of the property, which housed the Western theme park, was placed up for sale to attract investors for Presley's redevelopment of the upper portion of the property as a "Holy Land replica theme park." On January 24, 2015 the property was taken off the market, prompted by major progress in the redevelopment of other parts of the property.

On October 22, 2015, the park announced the rebranding of the park to Ghost Town Village with a planned opening on June 1, 2016. The rebranded park was to feature gunfights, the chairlift, gift shops, ziplines, a museum, a paintball course, arcade and horseback riding.&lt;ref name="ghosttownvillage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghosttownvillage.com/press-releases.html|title=ghosttownvillage.com|website=www.ghosttownvillage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to park management, the rebranding was due to the park's inability to reopen any of its former roller coasters and rides as the repair costs were too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1163742070319921&amp;set=p.1163742070319921&amp;type=3&amp;theater|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2016, park management announced that the park would not open in 2016 and was again being offered for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://themountaineer.villagesoup.com/p/ghost-town-announces-decision-to-sell/1532392|title=Ghost Town announces decision to sell|work=[[The Mountaineer]]|date=2016-06-03}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2018, an article in the Waynesville Mountaineer stated that a newly formed investment group, called "Ghost Town Adventures" had completed a purchase agreement for the park property from Alaska Presley, and is currently in the starting phases of restoring the park to its former glory, anticipating a 2019 re-opening, with a July 2018 preview for the public.

==Features==
The park is divided into several "towns" located at different elevations of the mountain, each with a different theme. Among these are the "Indian Village", "Mountain Town" and "Mining Town." The heart of the park is the recreated Old West town, complete with two saloons, a schoolhouse, bank, jail and church and various other businesses. Each hour, a gunfight was staged in the street, with visitors lining up to watch on the board sidewalks. The "Silver Dollar Saloon" featured hourly shows of Old West can-can dancers, while the "Red Dog Saloon" featured live country and bluegrass music performances throughout the day. "Indian Village" featured shows about Indian life in Old West days, including a deer hunt and a raid on a frontier settlement. "Mining Town" had areas where people could pan for gold and silver. It also had shows about life in mining settlements. "Mountain Town" featured shows about life in the Smoky Mountains.

At the terminus of the chairlift and incline railway is the "Heritage Town Square," a 2007 addition to the park. This area featured a museum chronicling the history of "Ghost Town", a restaurant, the Freefall, the casino and the Cliffhanger.

Originally opened in 1988, Red Devil was renamed Cliffhanger in 2007 and given a new paint job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcdb.com/234.htm?dt=126&amp;d=242 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928203508/http://www.rcdb.com/234.htm?dt=126&amp;d=242 |archivedate=2012-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coaster is unique in that rather than boarding the train and being towed up the lift hill, its boarding station is at the top of the hill. Once riders boarded, the train rolled out of the station, around a 90-degree curve and then over the main drop and into its one inverted loop. The rest of the track extends over the edge of the mountain with great views of the surrounding mountains. Cliffhanger's reopening was pushed back through the 2007 and 2008 seasons because of necessary major repairs.

It opened on June 30, 2009, but was closed less than two days later after a ride operator detected something wrong with one of the train’s seats. State inspectors on site discovered a hairline crack in the seat’s frame next to a bolt that attached the seat to the rest of the car. Rotational Motion, who built the custom cars for Ghost Town, was tasked with finding a solution. The coaster began operating again during the last few weeks of the 2009 season with no reported problems.

During a test run the day before Ghost Town's 2010 season began, there was a problem with one of the train's wheel chassis. Contrary to reports, the train did not derail, but came to an abrupt halt. Shiver said that Cliffhanger would be closed until a new train was purchased.

The other roller coaster operating at Ghost Town is a children's small coaster, Tumbleweed.  It was originally named Lil Devil, but received a name change along with Red Devil/Cliffhanger.&lt;ref name="rcdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdb.com/674.htm|title=Tumbleweed - Ghost Town Village (Maggie Valley, North Carolina, USA)|website=www.rcdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above Ghost Town, a section of the park hosts a variety of standard amusement rides and the "Mountain Top Music Hall" and "Indian Dance Hall." All of the rides are situated at the edge of the mountain, with one ("The Gun Slinger") that swings out over the mountainside.

A new feature in 2009 was "The House of Terror," a haunted house open during the Halloween season.

In October and November 2006, a movie was filmed at the park. The film, titled ''Ghost Town: The Movie'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0849441|Ghost Town: The Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt; was directed by Haywood County native [[Dean Teaster]] and technical director Jeff Kennedy. The film starred [[Bill McKinney]] and  Herbert Coward, [[DJ Perry]], [[Renee O'Connor]], [[Terrance Knox]], and [[Princess Lucaj]] with appearances by [[Rance Howard]] and [[Stella Parton]] ([[Dolly Parton|Dolly]]'s sister). The movie was based on the legend of Harmon Teaster, a Haywood County native from Cold Springs now named Harmon Den Game Refuge Area, and premiered at the Eaglenest Entertainment Center in Maggie Valley on June 2, 2007. The inspiration of the movie came from Haywood County native Dean Teaster who had a story to tell about his ancestor Harmon Teaster and Ghost Town in the Sky, where he spent many summers as a child. Teaster's desire was to capture Ghost Town in the Sky as how it might have looked in the late 1870's.

''Ghost Town: The Movie'', later titled ''Dean Teaster's Ghost Town,'' at the time of release on Lionsgate label was listed the most rented Western film by "Rentrax" reporting service. This position held for sixteen weeks after its release. The rename was due to Paramount releasing their movie titled ''[[Ghost Town (2008 film)|Ghost Town]]'' a month prior to the Lionsgate release of ''Ghost Town: The Movie.'' The movie brought elements of the original gunfight staged plays written by RB Coburn and Hubert Presley from the early 1960 era. Some of the gunfighters in the movie were the original gunfighter crew of 1961. Dean Teaster wanted to capture some of the original park design by Coburn, to keep it forever forged on film. Dean Teaster also brought his fathers character "Digger the Undertaker", back to life in the film to give tribute to his fathers original first creation of Coburn's "Digger the Undertaker". While Robert Teaster is noted as being one of the original "Internationally Famous Ghost Town Gunfighters" as well as the first undertaker, many others shared in this movie tribute to the first gunfighter crew. A marble stone was erected at the base of the mountain after filming as a tribute to the first gunfighter crews and the Hollywood stars that performed there.

Two independent films were filmed at the park, ''Mandie and the Secret Tunnel'' (2008) and ''Ringside Rosary'' (2010).

==Company history==

Years of turmoil followed the release of SuperPower 2, with the [[Financial Crisis]] and the [[Great Recession]] soon ''looming'' over the market at large. Ironically for GolemLabs, this famous Depression-times styled wording, used in SuperPower 2, soon hit the company itself. Forbes explained the everyday situation in 2012 like this: 
 "Whether it’s selling stuff on eBay, or offering B&amp;B, you can’t have too many strings to your financial bow, especially when '''dark economic clouds are looming'''".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2012/06/28/the-great-depression-ii-five-ways-to-survive/#48faa9e32475&lt;/ref&gt; 
Akin to this deep [[macroeconomic]] SuperPower 2 study, we find that: [https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/h/Herbert_Hoover.htm Hard Times Are Still Hoover-ing Over Us]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/h/Herbert_Hoover.htm&lt;/ref&gt; at "[[Great Depression]]", [[Hooverville]].

During the [[Financial Crisis]] and the following [[Great Recession]], both customers and investors for the gaming industry faced difficult times, spending was low, frugality was encouraged, resulting in investments and sales both drying up also for the gaming industry. An example of this is [[Obsidian Entertainment]]'s history with the [[THQ|old THQ]], the publisher [[Obsidian Entertainment#2012–2015: The Stick of Truth, financial troubles, and Pillars of Eternity|going bankrupt in late 2011]] caused by the publisher's own commercial failures: [[THQ#Reorganization, financial struggles (2010–2012)|The old THQ's Reorganization, financial struggles (2010–2012)]] &amp; [[THQ#Bankruptcy and liquidation, THQ Nordic (2012–present)|the old THQ's Bankruptcy and liquidation, THQ Nordic (2012–present)]].

At the same time, [[JoWooD Entertainment]], publisher of [[The Guild 2|The Guild Series]], went into administration. They had received [[Metascore]] ranging from mediocre to below average (The Guild 2 [http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-guild-2-venice Venice flagged red, 49%]) for their niche games and were bogged down by a lawsuit filed by JoWooD against Koch Media GmbH for €2.36 million ($3.06 million) plus interest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.256472-JoWooD-Declares-Bankruptcy&lt;/ref&gt; This caused their newly acquired subsidiary [[Dreamcatcher Interactive]], GolemLabs' publisher for SuperPower 1 &amp; 2, to file for bankruptcy.

So a decade after GolemLabs' last published title, two different remastered versions of ''SuperPower 2'' were finally released with [[THQ Nordic#Nordic Games GmbH (2011–2016)|Nordic Games]] as publisher: ''SuperPower 2 Steam Edition'', released on Steam on April 18, 2014,&lt;ref name="steamcommunity.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/93765200/1397823953|title=Steam Community :: Discussions|website=steamcommunity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an unnamed version on [[Good Old Games]]/[[GOG.com]] on August 13, 2015.&lt;ref name="gog.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/news/release_superpower_2|title=Release: SuperPower 2|website=GOG.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, [[Lars Wingefors]]' company (Swedish entrepreneur, Nordic Games) as the new owners of the rights for [[The Guild 2|The Guild series]], "was able to hire the Canadian developer GolemLabs in 2014", (2013 according to insider sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/the_guild_3/preview/article-1234.html|title=The Guild 3 PC preview - "Gamescom 2014: Not your mother's The Guild" - Hooked Gamers|website=www.hookedgamers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) "for the sequel of the popular The Guild series.&lt;ref&gt;http://theguildgame.com/#about-the-guild-3&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive work has since 2013 been done on ''[[The Guild 3]]'' with GolemLabs as developer, and with [[Heinrich Meyer]], one of the designers and authors of the first two The Guild games as producer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.golem.de/news/wirtschaftssimulation-golem-labs-entwickelt-die-gilde-3-1408-108620.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theguildgame.com/soundtrack-musicians-and-compositions/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THQ Nordic https://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/the_guild_3/preview/article-1234.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[THQ Nordic]], "has been passionately committed on supporting and expanding the "Guild" games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thqnordic.com/games/guild-3|title=Guild 3 - THQ Nordic GmbH|website=www.thqnordic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership with GolemLabs, who has a long experience in strategy games, combines the creative talents of both companies to expand on the potential of this beloved franchise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golemlabs.com/?news=2|title=GolemLabs|website=GolemLabs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna, Austria, August 12, 2016: Nordic Games had acquired the rights to the THQ brand name, and reincorporated &amp; renamed itself with a fusioned name: [[THQ Nordic]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thqnordic.com/article/nordic-games-reincorporates-thq-nordic&lt;/ref&gt; and went public with its own listing on the stock exchange. This meant even better times for GolemLabs, The new funding (finances) and therefore prospects were better after THQ Nordic took over. Swedish press instantly labeled [[Lars Wingefors]] as a "Super Entrepreneur" and "billionaire", hailing the move as a great commercial success. Sweden, being the land of [[Ingvar Kamprad]], the man behind [[IKEA]].

[[The Guild 3]] will act as a change of platform, superseding [[The Guild 2]] as a new, more modern, up-to-date &amp; better platform for expansive content, user generated content and modding for another decade or more.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thqnordic.com/games/guild-3|THQ Nordic -&gt; The Guild 3 -&gt; Features -&gt; Scenario Editor.&lt;/ref&gt; [[THQ Nordic]] has scheduled [[The Guild 3]] for release in the second half of 2017.&lt;ref name="steamcommunity.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/311260/discussions/0/135510393205178549/|title=Release date - UPDATE 2017 :: The Guild 3 General Discussions|website=steamcommunity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, an [[alpha version]] of the game was shown to the public at [[Gamescom]], according to German PC Games, relaying footage from [[THQ Nordic]] &amp; GolemLabs' room there.&lt;ref&gt;PC Games - Die Gilde 3 Gameplay - Gamescom-Präsentation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge9HAHGQl3k&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2017, the company claimed that the game was in the last stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theguildgame.com/#developer-blog|title=The Guild 3 – by THQ Nordic|website=theguildgame.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However after 10 months of further development the game had not left Early Access and had been handed over to [[Purple Lamp Studios]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.purplelamp.com/portfolio-item/the-guild-3/|title=The Guild 3 – Purple Lamp Studios|website=www.purplelamp.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/311260/discussions/1/1729827777334892119/|title=THQ Nordic raises development resources for The Guild 3|website=steamcommunity.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harlem Globetrotters''' are an [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] [[basketball]] team. They combine [[wikt:athleticism|athleticism]], [[theater]], and [[comedy]] in their style of play. Over the years they have played more than 26,000 exhibition games in 123 countries and territories. The team's signature song is [[Brother Bones]]' whistled version of "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]". Their mascot is an anthropomorphized globe named Globie. The team plays over 450 live events worldwide each year. The team is currently owned by [[Herschend Family Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Company buys Harlem Globetrotters |url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9753269/harlem-globetrotters-acquired-herschend-family-entertainment-corp |website=www.espn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive offices for the team are located in suburban Atlanta.

==History==
The Globetrotters originated on the south side of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in the 1920s, where all the original players were raised. The Globetrotters began as the Savoy Big Five, one of the premier attractions of the Savoy Ballroom opened in January 1928, a basketball team of African-American players that played exhibitions before dances. In 1928, several players left the team in a dispute. That autumn, several of the players, led by Tommy Brookins, formed a team called the "Globe Trotters" and toured Southern Illinois that spring. [[Abe Saperstein]] became involved with the team as its manager and promoter. By 1929, Saperstein was touring Illinois and Iowa with his basketball team called the "New York Harlem Globe Trotters". Saperstein selected [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]], as their home city since Harlem was considered the center of African-American culture at the time and an out-of-town team name would give the team more of a mystique.&lt;ref name="harlem"&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Jay | title = Harlem Globetrotters | website = [[WTTW]] |publisher=Window to the World Communications Inc.| url = http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?p=1,7,1,1,18 | accessdate = December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Globetrotters did not play in Harlem until 1968, four decades after the team's formation.

The Globetrotters were perennial participants in the [[World Professional Basketball Tournament]], winning it in 1940. In a heavily attended matchup a few years later, the [[1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game]], the Globetrotters made headlines when they beat one of the best white basketball teams in the country, the Minneapolis Lakers (now the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]). Once one of the most famous teams in the country, the Globetrotters were eventually eclipsed by the rise of the [[National Basketball Association]], particularly when NBA teams began fielding African-American players in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/books/review/24BERKOWL.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|title='Spinning the Globe': Ball Hog Heaven|first=Ira|last=Berkow|date=July 24, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Harlem Globetrotter [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] became the first black player to be drafted in the NBA by Boston and teammate [[Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]] became the first African-American player to sign an NBA contract when the [[New York Knicks]] purchased his contract from the Globetrotters.

The Globetrotters gradually worked comic routines into their act—a direction the team has credited to [[Goose Tatum|Reece "Goose" Tatum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Harlem Globetrotters|url=http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/our-story|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930215157/http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/our-story|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 30, 2011|title=Our Story|accessdate=May 23, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who joined in 1941—and eventually became known more for entertainment than sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/03/21/harlem-globetrotters-keeping-fun-sports/bhSDDQwz3Jl0NCcKhR9dcM/story.html |work=The Boston Globe|publisher=[[John W.

In 1952, the Globetrotters invited [[Louis Klotz|Louis "Red" Klotz]] to create a team to accompany them on their tours. This team, the [[Washington Generals]] (who also played under various other names), became the Globetrotters' primary opponents. The Generals are effectively stooges for the Globetrotters, with the Globetrotters handily defeating them in thousands of games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/washington-generals-folding-harlem-globetrotters/|title=Losers' Lament: After decades of defeat, the Washington Generals have lost for the final time|first=Joe|last=Posnanski|accessdate=August 14, 2015|work=[[NBC Sports]]|publisher=[[NBC Sports Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13433859/harlem-globetrotters-drop-washington-generals-primary-opponent|title=After 63 years, Globetrotters drop rival Generals as primary opponent|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015|first=Darren|last= Rovell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Harlem Globetrotters in Scheveningen.ogv|thumb|right|250px|The Harlem Globetrotters in the Netherlands (1958)]]
In 1959, the Globetrotters played nine games in Moscow after Saperstein received an invitation from Vasily Gricorevich, the director of [[Luzhniki Stadium|Lenin Central Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Sun 16 June 1959" /&gt; The team, which included Wilt Chamberlain, was welcomed enthusiastically by spectators and authorities; they met Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]&lt;ref name="Victoria Advocate 9 July 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Khruschchev Surprises U.S. Cagers By Street|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yQBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0IAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=5358%2C2447599|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|publisher=Victoria Advocate Publishing|date=July 9, 1959|agency=Associated Press|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and collectively received the Athletic Order of Lenin medal.&lt;ref name="Cummings 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cummings|first=Richard H.|title=Harlem Globetrotters and Nikita Khrushchev|url=http://coldwarradios.blogspot.com/2011/01/harlem-globetrotters-and-nikita.html|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=Cold War Radios|date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to one report, spectators were initially confused: "A Soviet audience of 14,000 sat almost silently, as if in awe, through the first half of the game. It warmed up slightly in the second half when it realized the Trotters are more show than competition."&lt;ref name="Eagle 7 July 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians Baffled by Harlem Fun|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sJAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-JcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=6190%2C2163140|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|publisher=Reading Eagle Company|date=July 7, 1959|agency=[[United Press International]]|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Globetrotters brought their own opponent—not the Washington Generals, but the San Francisco Chinese Basketeers.&lt;ref name="Sun 16 June 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe's 'Trotters Off to Moscow|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YY9lAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FooNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=3015%2C3683991|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|date=June 16, 1959|agency=Associated Press|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in [[Pravda]] stated, "This is not basketball; it is too full of tricks" but praised the Globetrotters' skills and suggested that "they have some techniques to show us."&lt;ref name="Leader-Post 8 July 1959"&gt;{{cite news|title=Globetrotters impress Soviets|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IatUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pzsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=3437%2C1213817|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Leader-Post]]|publisher=Postmedia Network|date=July 8, 1959|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The American press—particularly [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]]—made note of the fact that the Globetrotters were paid (per game) the equivalent of $4,000, which could be spent only in Moscow. The games were used as evidence that U.S.–Soviet relations were improving, that Moscow was backing off its criticism of race relations inside America, and that the USSR was becoming more capitalist (Pearson suggested that the games were held because Lenin Stadium needed money).&lt;ref name="Pearson 1959"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Drew|title=US–USSR Relations Much Improved|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BJUuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OUgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=7134%2C5499922|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Management Corporation]]|date=July 30, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 11 Sept 1959"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Drew|title=Ike Should Go to Russia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bVcrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8JwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=globetrotters%20moscow&amp;pg=1202%2C1724043|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=September 11, 1959|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous basketball players have played for the Globetrotters. Greats such as "Wee" Willie Gardner, [[Connie Hawkins|Connie "The Hawk" Hawkins]], [[Wilt Chamberlain|Wilt "The Stilt" Chamberlain]], and [[Nathaniel Clifton|Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]] later went on to join the NBA. The Globetrotters signed their first female player, Olympic gold medalist [[Lynette Woodard]], in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cleveland.com/sports/index.ssf/2008/12/globetrotters_mains.html |work= [[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]] |location= Cleveland |title= It's a new spin: Harlem Globetrotters trying to put a high-tech gleam on a vintage product |date= December 22, 2008 |first= Bill |last= Lubinger |accessdate= May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Globetrotters have featured thirteen female players in their history. Baseball Hall of Famers Ernie Banks, Bob Gibson, and Ferguson Jenkins also played for the team at one time or another. 
Because the majority of the team players have historically been [[African American]], and as a result of the  buffoonery involved in many of the Globetrotters' [[sketch comedy|skit]]s, they drew some criticism during the [[Civil Rights]] era. The players were accused by some civil-rights advocates of "Tomming for Abe", a reference to [[Uncle Tom]] and Jewish owner [[Abe Saperstein]]. However, prominent civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] (who would later be named an Honorary Globetrotter) came to their defense by stating,
"I think they've been a positive influence... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior."&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;
In 1995, Orlando Antigua became the first Hispanic player on the team. He was the first non-black player on the Globetrotters' roster since Bob Karstens played with the squad in 1942–43.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/28/sports/sports-people-basketball-a-non-black-player-joins-globetrotters.html|title=Sports People: Basketball – A Non-Black Player Joins Globetrotters|date=December 28, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|access-date=July 6, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While parts of a modern exhibition game are pre-planned, the games themselves are not fixed. While their opponents do not interfere with the Globetrotters’ hijinks while on defense, they play a serious game when in possession of the ball and about 20 to 30 percent of a game is "real". This once led to an infamous defeat at the hands of the Washington Generals, to the distress of a watching crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/basketball-3/as-the-harlem-globetrotters-ditch-their-archrivals-we-remember-the-one-time-the-washington-generals-won/|title=Washington Generals Beat Harlem Globetrotters|date=August 14, 2015|work=SportsGrid|access-date=July 6, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trophies==
The Globetrotters won the [[World Professional Basketball Tournament]] once, in 1940, beating the [[Chicago Bruins]] with a score of 31–29.

==Draft==
Starting in 2007, the Globetrotters have conducted an annual "draft" a few days before the [[National Basketball Association Draft|NBA draft]], in which they select players they feel fit the mold of a Globetrotter. Being drafted by the Globetrotters does not guarantee a spot on the team, although several drafted players have gone on to become Globetrotters: Anthony "Ant" Atkinson (2007), Brent Petway (2007), William "Bull" Bullard (2008), Tay "Firefly" Fisher (2008), Charlie Coley III (2009), Paul "Tiny" Sturgess (2011), Jacob "Hops" Tucker (2011), Darnell "Spider" Wilks (2011), Bryan "B-Nice" Narcisse (2012), Tyrone Davis (2013), Corey "Thunder" Law (2013), Tyler "Iceman" Inman (2014) Devan "Beast" Douglas (2016) and AJ "Money" Merriweather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/harlem-globetrotters-mark-10th-anniversary-draft-first-ever-live-announcements-twitter|title=Harlem Globetrotters Mark 10th Anniversary of Draft with First-Ever Live Announcements on Twitter|date=29 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
The Harlem Globetrotters have been featured in several of their own films and television series:
* ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters (film)|The Harlem Globetrotters]]'', a 1951 feature film starring [[Marques Haynes]] and other Globetrotters, also featuring [[Thomas Gomez]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]], Bill Walker, and Angela Clarke. Young Bill Townsend drops out of college to join the famous independent Trotter team. He also finds romance along the way. "Goose" Tatum and fancy dribbler Haynes were the star players of the Globetrotters at the time and Saperstein was the owner. Tatum, Haynes, Babe Pressley, Ermer Robinson, Duke Cumberland, Clarence Wilson, [[Pop Gates]], Frank Washington, Ted Strong, and other current team members appear in the film as themselves. Also featured is a lot of actual game footage (three times against the Celtics with [[Tony Lavelli]] and Big Bob Hahn), including the "Sweet Georgia Brown" warm-up routine. (Along with making the film, the team toured [[Major League Baseball]] stadiums that year and went on their first tour of South America.)
* ''[[Go, Man, Go!]]'', a 1954 sequel starring [[Dane Clark]] as Abe Saperstein and [[Sidney Poitier]] as Inman Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Bosley |last= Crowther | authorlink = Bosley Crowther |title= The Screen in Review; Harlem Globetrotters Perform in a Sports Romance, 'Go, Man, Go!' at the Globe |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E2DE1738E23BBC4852DFB566838F649EDE |work= The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company|date=March 10, 1954 |accessdate=May 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 19, 1956, twelve members of the Globetrotters appeared as guest challengers on the TV panel show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' Clarence Wilson acted as the spokesman and was accompanied by members George "Meadowlark" Lemon, Charlie Hoxie, Roman Turmon, Andy Johnson, Woodrow "Woody" Sauldsberry, Carl Green, Leon Hillard, Willie Gardner, and others.
* ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', a [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[Saturday morning cartoon]], broadcast from September 12, 1970, to May 1973. Originally broadcast on [[CBS]] and later rerun on [[NBC]] as ''The Go-Go Globetrotters''. The cartoon Globetrotters also guest-starred three times on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. [[Scatman Crothers]] provided the voice for [[Meadowlark Lemon]]'s character on the show.
* ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine]]'', a 1974 live-action Saturday morning [[variety show]] starring the Globetrotters that featured comedy skits, [[blackout gag]]s, and educational segments. The show was produced by Funhouse Productions and Yongestreet Productions for CBS. The show also starred [[Rodney Allen Rippy]] and [[Avery Schreiber]].
* ''[[The Super Globetrotters]]'', a second animated series created by Hanna-Barbera for [[NBC]] in 1979. It featured the Globetrotters (now including new squad members [[James Sanders (American basketball player)|James "Twiggy" Sanders]], [[Nate Branch]], and [[Louis Dunbar|Louis "Sweet Lou" Dunbar]]) as undercover [[superhero]]es who would transform themselves by entering magic portable lockers carried in "Sweet Lou" Dunbar's [[afro]] or in a basketball-shaped medallion. Although the Super Globetrotters would first attempt to take on the villain with standard comical heroics, things would almost always be settled with a basketball game.
* In a 1979 episode of ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'', the Globetrotters appear wherein Coach Reeves convinces the team to help him send his basketball team a reality check about overconfidence and underestimating their opponents as a result of a winning streak that got to his players' heads. The Globetrotters returned in season three (1980) when star player Warren Coolidge convinced that his basketball ability would preclude his need to finish high school, considers dropping out of school and trying out for the Globetrotters. After failing miserably in his tryout, Coolidge is persuaded to finish his education before giving any thought to a basketball career.
* ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island]]'', a 1981 made-for-TV film featured the Globetrotters alongside [[Bob Denver]] and the rest of the cast of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. The film's plot follows the first animated series' formula to a degree with a conflict that ends with an unusual basketball game against an opposing team made up of [[robot]]s. The Globetrotters decide to play with standard moves in the first half, which the robots are able to counter until Gilligan unwittingly comments that they have not done any fancy tricks. This makes the Professor advise the team to use their comedic style of play to win, which hopelessly confuses the machines. However, a couple of Globetrotters suffer injuries, and the team needs the help of Gilligan and Skipper to substitute.
* In "Hoopla" (1984), an episode of the television series ''[[The Love Boat]]'', the Globetrotters are on a cruise and challenged the crew to a game in the dining room.
* In "[[Homie the Clown]]", an episode of the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Krusty the Clown]] bets all the money he earned franchising his name against the Globetrotters in a game, saying that he "thought [[Washington Generals|the Generals]] were due". He then shouts "That game was fixed! They used a freakin' ladder for God's sake!"
* The animated series ''[[Futurama]]'' features several episodes in which the Harlem Globetrotters appear as brilliant scientists as well as basketball players living on another planet, the Globetrotter Homeworld. Ironically, the Harlem Globetrotters react harshly to anyone who "laughs at their antics" as evidenced in the episode "[[Time Keeps On Slippin']]" (2001).
* The Globetrotters appeared in the 2000 comedy ''[[Little Nicky]]'' with [[Adam Sandler]], wherein they are shown losing to the [[Washington Generals]], which is caused by one of Nicky's demonic brothers.
* ''Harlem Globetrotters: The Team that Changed the World'', a 2005 [[documentary film|documentary]] featuring interviews with the Globetrotters, NBA coaches, and fans such as [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Phil Jackson]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]—himself an honorary Globetrotter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Maurice |last= Sorrell |title=The Week's Best Photos | journal=JET |volume=51 |issue=17 |pages=41–41 |date=January 1977  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and including photos of the Globetrotters with [[Pope John Paul II]].
* ''[[Harlem Globetrotters: World Tour]]'', a video game for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and the [[Nintendo DS]]
* In ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'': [[The Amazing Race 15|season 15]] (2009), [[Herbert "Flight Time" Lang]] and [[Nathaniel "Big Easy" Lofton]] participated, finishing fourth place. They returned for [[The Amazing Race 18|season 18]] (2010), which is subtitled "Unfinished Business," featuring fan-favorite teams who lost the competition because of various circumstances. The pair finished second overall. They also returned for [[The Amazing Race 24|season 24]] (2014), dubbed an "All Star" season, featuring some of the shows fan favorites, this time finishing sixth.
* As part of the cross-promotion of ''The Amazing Race'', Lang and Lofton also appeared on [[CBS Daytime]]'s game show ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' to model prizes (a Sport Court basketball court) and present a showcase.
* In 2009 and 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title| id=1931370| title= 77th McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade ''(2010) (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSx_Vsa9-tc |title=2010 2N Globetrotters | website= YouTube |publisher=[[Google]] |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the Harlem Globetrotters appeared on the nationally-televised McDonald's Thanksgiving Day Parade in [[Chicago]].
* In 2010, five members of the Globetrotters appeared on ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (U.S. syndicated game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'', raising money for charity.
* On December 5, 2010, in a game televised on [[ESPN2]] against the [[Washington Generals]] from [[HP Field House]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], the game saw several landmark events occur. A four-point shot may be scored from the four-point circle {{convert|35|ft|abbr=on}} away from the basket, with three minutes or less to go in any quarter. A penalty box was introduced as the price to be paid for any 'funny business' by a player. The Globetrotters made the first, and most, of the four-point shots in the game. All of the penalties in this game were assessed to the Globetrotters. The visiting Globetrotters went on to beat the Generals 104–98 in this historical game of firsts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/?article_id=276 |title= Game Ball From Historic 4-Point Shot Headed to the Hall| website= Harlem Globetrotters| access-date= December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2012, the Globetrotters made a special guest appearance on [[Disney XD]]'s ''[[Kickin' It]]'', in the episode "Eddie Cries Uncle".
* Three members of the Globetrotters appeared in a February 28, 2012, episode of the [[Blendtec]] online video series ''[[Will It Blend?]]'', wherein they help Blendtec CEO Tom Dickson and his Uncle Floyd blend miniature basketballs, glitter dust, a whistle, and a bottle of [[Gatorade]]. The team then pour the mixture into a bucket, magically turning it into confetti, which they throw on Dickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Dickson, Tom (host) |date=February 28, 2012 |title=The Harlem Globetrotters |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalqszWGtEM&amp;hd=1 |medium=Television production |trans_title= |publisher=[[Blendtec]] |location= |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerome Zerbe''' (July 24, 1904, [[Euclid, Ohio]] – August 19, 1988) was an American photographer. He was one of the originators of a genre of [[photography]] that is now common: celebrity [[paparazzi]].  Zerbe was a pioneer in the 1930s of shooting photographs of the famous at play and on-the-town.  According to the cocktail recipe book ''Bottoms Up'' (1951), he is also credited with inventing the vodka [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]].

Zerbe differed from the common paparazzo in a major way: he never hid in bushes or jumped out and surprised the rich and famous he was photographing. Rather, Zerbe often traveled and vacationed with the film stars themselves.  As one biographer{{who|date=August 2017}} stated, Zerbe never rode in a rented limousine, and his coat pocket always had in it an engraved invitation to the high-society events.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

"Once I asked [[Katharine Hepburn]] to come up from her place at Fenwick, a few miles away, and pose for some fashion photos for me," Zerbe recalled in his book ''Happy Times''. "She arrived with a picnic hamper full of food and wine for the two of us. I snapped her just as she came to the door."{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Zerbe's library held well over 50,000 photos.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Some of his well-known images were of [[Greta Garbo]] at lunch, [[Cary Grant]] helping columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] move into her new home, [[Steve Reeves]] shaving, [[Moss Hart]] climbing a tree, [[Howard Hughes]] having lunch at "[[21 Club|21]]" with [[Janet Gaynor]], [[Ginger Rogers]] flying first-class, plus legendary stars [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Gene Tunney]], [[Thomas Wolfe]], and the [[Vanderbilts]].

Zerbe claimed to be the first – and only – society photographer.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  He was for years the official photographer of [[Manhattan]]'s famed nightspot [[El Morocco]], the place to be and be seen, whether you were [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[John O'Hara]], or [[Ed Sullivan]]. Zerbe pioneered the business arrangement of getting paid by the [[nightclub]] to photograph its visitors, then turning around and giving the photos away to the gossip pages. Today, the practice is a common [[public relations]] stunt.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Early life and education==
Zerbe was born in [[Euclid, Ohio]], on July 24, 1904. His father, Jerome B. Zerbe, was the president of a coal company and a prominent citizen in nearby [[Cleveland]], where the family later resided. Young Jerry Zerbe was driven to public school in the family limousine, which got him beaten up by bullies. He managed to survive well enough to be sent East, to the [[Salisbury School]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut]]. There he took an interest in art, drawing, and photography.

Zerbe graduated from [[Yale]] in 1928, where he was an editor of the campus humor magazine ''[[The Yale Record]]'' with writer [[Geoffrey T. Hellman]], writer and film critic [[Dwight MacDonald]], and Hollywood art director [[Jack Otterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yale Banner and Pot Pourri|location= New Haven|publisher= Yale University Press|date= 1927|page= 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an undergrad, Zerbe had a knack for getting around the [[Prohibition]] laws, and was known as the guy who knew where the booze and parties were. (It helped that there was a  [[speakeasy]] in the basement of ''[[The Yale Record]]'' building.) This paid off, and he became a supreme social networker. He gained important social prominence in [[New Haven]], which would serve him well in [[New York City]], [[Paris]], and [[London]].

==Early career==
After graduation he went out to [[Hollywood]] to try his hand at drawing portraits of the famous residents. He was befriended by a young [[Gary Cooper]], which led to Zerbe's quickly becoming friends with [[Hedda Hopper]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Randolph Scott]], [[Marion Davies]], and [[Paulette Goddard]].

It did not take long for Zerbe to put down his paintbrush and pick up a camera. He photographed numerous stars in Hollywood's Golden Age and some of the hopefuls, before they became known, posed for him wearing few if any clothes.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Breaking into photography==
During the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Zerbe landed his first major job, as art director of ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'', which was headquartered in his hometown, [[Cleveland]]. This was where he began his career of setting up portraits of the upper crust. He persuaded the wealthy local residents that it would help them to be photographed at their parties, which was simply not done at the time. He convinced them that it would assist the charity balls and fundraisers the leading society matrons were hosting. This paid off. He shot hundreds of debutantes, brides, newlyweds, and formal dinners in North America and Europe.

Soon afterward,  Harry Bull, the editor of ''[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]'' in New York, saw some of Zerbe's society photos from Cleveland and made him an offer to photograph ritzy parties in the Midwest. This gave Zerbe's photos' a wide audience and garnered offers of work from the capital of glitz -- [[Manhattan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

When Zerbe arrived in New York, he was in the right place at the right time. Prohibition had just ended, and nightlife was booming. The city had seven daily newspapers and three press associations. They all needed society photographs.

Zerbe got himself hired by the [[Rainbow Room]] – on the 65th Floor of [[30 Rockefeller Center]] – to set up fashionable dinner parties and photograph the guests. Zerbe was shocked that at the height of the Depression, unemployed readers craved looking at photos of high-society types dressed in evening clothes and drinking [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==The nightclub era==
Around 1934, Zerbe was in business in Manhattan. He was the staff photographer for both the [[Rainbow Room]] and a bustling nightclub, [[El Morocco]]. Zerbe said that from 1933 to 1938, he spent most nights from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. at El Morocco eating, drinking, and taking pictures.

Many considered El Morocco the classiest nightclub in town and looked down upon the [[Stork Club]] regulars as "tacky". El Morocco was the place to be seen – particularly if one just came from a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show. Zerbe photos taken at El Morocco are readily identifiable due to the blue-and-white zebra-stripe fabric on all the banquettes and couches.

[[World War II]] prompted Zerbe to enlist in the [[Navy]]. He was able to bring his camera, became the official photographer for [[Admiral Nimitz]], and found a way to travel with the stars who flew overseas to entertain the troops.

After the war, Zerbe took up photographing  [[café society]] with gusto. He was a charming man who was able to rub shoulders with dukes, duchesses, visiting dignitaries, as well as [[John Hay Whitney]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt IV]], and scores of others. He traveled to [[France]] to photograph estates and country homes – and the residents as well.

In the 1940s, Zerbe worked for the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] newspaper chain, and wrote a Sunday column for the ''Sunday Mirror'' for more than 10 years. From 1949 to 1974, he was the society editor for ''[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]''. He traveled around the globe photographing big celebrity events.

Zerbe had several "coffee table" photo books published. Among them were ''People on Parade'' (1934),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zerbe |first1=Jerome |first2=Lucius |last2=Beebe |author2link=Lucius Beebe |title=People on Parade |year=1934 |publisher=D. Kemp |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''John Perona's El Morocco Family Album'' (1937),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zerbe |first1=Jerome |first2=Lucius |last2=Beebe |author2link=Lucius Beebe |title=John Perona's El Morocco Family Album |year= 1937 |publisher=privately published |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art of Social Climbing'' (1965), and with [[Brendan Gill]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Zerbe's greatest collection, ''Happy Times'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zerbe |first=Jerome |author2=Gill, Brendan   |title=Happy Times |year=1973 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death ==
Zerbe died on August 19, 1988, at his [[Sutton Place, Manhattan|Sutton Place]] apartment in Manhattan. He was 85.

The Zerbe photographic archive was purchased by Frederick R. Koch, eldest son of industrialist [[Fred C. Koch]], and gifted in 2013 to the Beinecke Rare Book Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Handle.net|title=Beinecke Rare Book Library: Zerbe|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.zerbe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==

In the 1930s, Zerbe was the partner of the society columnist and writer [[Lucius Beebe]]. Beebe made so many flattering references to Zerbe in his newspaper column, ''This New York,'' that rival columnist [[Walter Winchell]] suggested that Zerbe should change the name to "Jerome Never Looked Lovelier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gill, Brendan|title=Here at The New Yorker|publisher=Berkley Medallion Edition|date= 1976|isbn=0-425-03043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1173">In [[mathematics]], there are different results that share the common name of the '''Ky Fan inequality'''.  The Ky Fan inequality presented here is used in [[game theory]] to investigate the existence of an equilibrium.
Another Ky Fan inequality is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] involving the [[geometric mean]] and [[arithmetic mean]] of two sets of [[real number]]s of the [[unit interval]].

==Statement==
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a convex compact subset of a Hilbert space and that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function from &lt;math&gt;E\times E&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
*  &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is lower semicontinuous for every &lt;math&gt;y\in E&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;y\mapsto f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is concave for every &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt;.
Then there exists &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{y\in E}f(e,y)\le \sup_{y\in E} f(y,y).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27522">A '''literary language''' is the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|form]] of a [[language]] used in the [[writing]] of the language. It is typically a [[dialect]] or [[Standard language|standardised form]] of the language. It can sometimes differ noticeably from the various [[Spoken language|spoken]] forms of the language, but difference between literary and non-literary forms is greater in some languages than in others. Where there is a strong divergence between a written form and the spoken [[vernacular]], the language is said to exhibit [[diglossia]].

A related concept is [[Sacred language|liturgical writing]], which is the language or form of language used in the [[liturgy]] of some religions.

{{For|written English|Standard Written English}}
For much of its history, there has been a distinction in the English language between an elevated literary language and a colloquial language.&lt;ref name=Rissanen9&gt;Matti Rissanen, ''History of Englishes: New Methods and Interpretations in Historical Linguistics'', Walter de Gruyter, 1992, p9. {{ISBN|3-11-013216-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Norman conquest of England]], for instance, Latin and French displaced English as the official and literary languages,&lt;ref&gt;Elaine M. Treharne, ''Old and Middle English C.890-c.1400: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2004, pxxi. {{ISBN|1-4051-1313-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and standard literary English did not emerge until the end of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Pat Rogers, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of English Literature'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p3. {{ISBN|0-19-285437-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time and into the [[Renaissance]], the practice of [[aureation]] (the introduction of terms from [[classical language]]s, often through poetry) was an important part of the reclamation of status for the English language, and many historically aureate terms are now part of general common usage. Modern English no longer has quite the same distinction between literary and colloquial registers.&lt;ref name=Rissanen9/&gt;

English has been used as a literary language in countries that were formerly part of the [[British Empire]], for instance in [[Indian English literature|India]] up to the present day,&lt;ref&gt;R.R.Mehrotra in Ofelia García, Ricardo Otheguy, ''English Across Cultures, Cultures Across English: A Reader in Cross-cultural Communication'', Walter de Gruyter, 1989, p422. {{ISBN|0-89925-513-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Languages of Malaysia|Malaysia]] in the early 20th century&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p104. {{ISBN|0-521-53033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Languages of Nigeria|Nigeria]], where English remains the official language.

==Other languages==
{{See also|Standard language}}

===Arabic===
{{main article|Modern Standard Arabic}}

[[Modern Standard Arabic]] is the contemporary literary and standard register of [[Classical Arabic]] used in writing across all [[The Arab World|Arabic]]-speaking countries and any governing body with Arabic as an official language. Many western scholars distinguish two varieties: the Classical Arabic of the [[Qur'an]] and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) [[Arabic literature|literature]]; and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the [[standard language]] in use today. The modern standard language is closely based on the Classical language, and most Arabs consider the two varieties to be two registers of the same language. Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages {{Clarify|date=September 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]]—the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts. Educated Arabic speakers are usually able to communicate in MSA in formal situations. This diglossic situation facilitates [[code-switching]] in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. In instances in which highly educated Arabic-speakers of different nationalities engage in conversation but find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Kuwaiti), they are able to code switch into MSA for the sake of communication.

===Aramaic===

The [[Aramaic language]] has been diglossic for much of its history, with many different literary standards serving as the "high" liturgical languages, including [[Syriac language]], [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]], [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]], [[Samaritan Aramaic language]] and [[Mandaic language]], while the vernacular [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] serve as the vernacular language spoken by the common people like [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], [[Hértevin language]], [[Koy Sanjaq Syriac language]], [[Senaya language]]), [[Western Neo-Aramaic]], [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]], [[Central Neo-Aramaic]] ([[Mlahsô language]], [[Turoyo language]]), [[Neo-Mandaic]], [[Hulaulá language]], [[Lishana Deni]], [[Lishanid Noshan]], [[Lishán Didán]], [[Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic]].

===Armenian===
The [[Armenian language]] was a diglossic language for much of its history, with [[Classical Armenian]] serving as the "high" literary standard and liturgical language, and the [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]] dialects serving as the vernacular language of the Armenian people. Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian were eventually standardized into their own literary forms.

===Bengali===

Standard [[Bengali language|Bengali]] has two forms:

*'''Chôlitôbhasha''', the vernacular standard based on the elite speech of [[Kolkata]]
*'''Shadhubhasha''', the literary standard, which employs more [[Sanskrit]]ized vocabulary and longer prefixes and suffixes.

Grammatically, the two forms are identical, and differing forms, such as verb conjugations, are easily converted from one form to another. However, the vocabulary is quite different from one form to the other and must be learned separately. Among the works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] are examples of both shadhubhasha (especially among his earlier works) and chôlitôbhasha (especially among his later works). The [[national anthem of India]] was originally written in the shadhubhasha form of Bengali.

===Chinese===
{{main article|Classical Chinese}}

Literary Chinese, ''Wényánwén'' (文言文), "Literary Writing", is the form of written [[Chinese language|Chinese]] used from the end of the [[Han dynasty]] to the early 20th century when it was replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], or ''Baihua'' (白話) spoken according to [[Standard Mandarin]] pronunciation. Literary Chinese continually diverged from [[Classical Chinese]] as the dialects of China became more disparate and as the Classical written language became less representative of the [[Chinese spoken languages|spoken language]]. At the same time, Literary Chinese was based largely upon the Classical language, and writers frequently borrowed Classical language into their literary writings. Literary Chinese therefore shows a great deal of similarity to Classical Chinese, even though the similarity decreased over the centuries.

Starting from early 20th century, [[written vernacular Chinese]] have become a standard for Chinese writing which is mostly aligned with a standardized form of Mandarin Chinese, which however mean there are divergence between written vernacular Chinese against other Chinese variants like [[Cantonese]], [[Shanghainese]], [[Hokkien]] and [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]]. Some of these variants have their own literary form but none of them are being used in formal register.

===Finnish===
The [[Finnish language]] has a literary variant, literary Finnish, and a spoken variant, [[spoken Finnish]]. Both are considered a form of non-dialectal standard language, and are used throughout the country. Literary Finnish is a consciously created fusion of dialects for use as a literary language, which is rarely spoken at all, being confined to writing and official speeches.

===Georgian===
The [[Georgian language]] has a literary liturgical form, the [[Old Georgian language]], while the vernacular spoken varieties are the [[Georgian dialects]] and other related [[Kartvelian languages]] like [[Svan language]], [[Mingrelian language]], and [[Laz language]].

=== German ===
{{main article|Standard German}}

[[German language|German]] differentiates between ''Hochdeutsch''/''Standarddeutsch'' ([[Standard German]]) and ''Umgangssprache'' (colloquial language). Amongst the differences is the regular use of the [[genitive case]] or the simple past tense ''[[preterite|Präteritum]]'' in written language. In colloquial German genitive phrases ("des Tages") are frequently replaced with a construction of "von" + [[dative case|dative]] object ("von dem Tag") - comparable to English "the dog's tail" vs. "the tail of the dog" - likewise the ''Präteritum'' ("ich ging") can be substituted with the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] ("ich bin gegangen") to a certain degree. Nevertheless, the use of neither the ''Präteritum'' nor especially the genitive case is totally unusual in colloquial language, just quite rare, yet also depending on a region's dialect and/or the grade of education of the speaker. People of higher education use the genitive more regularly in colloquial language and the use of perfect instead of ''Präteritum'' is especially common in southern Germany, where the ''Präteritum'' is considered somewhat declamatory. The German ''Konjunktiv I / II'' ("er habe" / "er hätte") is also used more regularly in written form being replaced by the conditional ("er würde geben") in colloquial language, although in some southern German dialects the ''Konjunktiv II'' is used more often. Generally there is a continuum between more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties in German, while colloquial German nonetheless tends to increase [[Analytic language|analytic elements]] at the expense of [[Synthetic language|synthetic elements]].

===Greek===
{{main article|Katharevousa}}

From the early nineteenth century until the mid-20th century, ''[[Katharevousa]]'', a form of [[Greek language|Greek]], was used for literary purposes. In later years, ''Katharevousa'' was used only for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting) while ''[[Modern Greek|Dhimotiki]]'', ‘demotic’ or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a [[diglossia|diglossic situation]] until in 1976 ''Dhimotiki'' was made the official language.

===Hebrew===
During the [[revival of the Hebrew language]], spoken and literary Hebrew were revived separately, causing a dispersion between the two. The dispersion started to narrow sometime after the two movements merged, but substantial differences between the two still exist until nowadays.

===Italian===

When Italy was [[Italian unification|unified]], in 1861, [[Italian language|Italian]] existed mainly as a literary language. Different languages were spoken throughout the Italian Peninsula, many of which were [[Romance language]]s which had developed in every region, due to the political fragmentation of Italy. Now, it is the [[standard language]] of Italy.

===Japanese===
Until the late 1940s, the prominent literary language in Japan was the [[Classical Japanese language]] (文語 "Bungo"), which is based on the language spoken in [[Heian period]] ([[Late Old Japanese]]) and is different from the [[Japanese language|contemporary Japanese language]] in grammar and some vocabulary. It still has relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived [[World War II]] are still written in ''bungo'', although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). Bungo grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect, and fixed form poetries like [[Haiku]] and [[Waka (poetry)|Tanka]] are still mainly written in this form.

In the [[Meiji period]], some authors started to use the colloquial form of the language in their literature. Following the government policy after the [[World War II]], the standard form of contemporary Japanese language is used for most literature published since the 1950s. The standard language is based on the colloquial language in [[Tokyo]] area, and its literary stylistics in polite form differs little from its formal speech. Notable characteristics of literary language in contemporary Japanese would include more frequent use of Chinese origin words, less use of expressions against [[prescriptive grammar]] such as "ら抜き言葉", and use of non-polite normal form ("-だ/-である") stylistics that are rarely used in colloquial language.

===Javanese===
In the [[Javanese language]], [[alphabet]] characters derived from the alphabets used to write [[Sanskrit]], no longer in ordinary use, are used in literary words as a mark of respect.

===Kannada===

[[Kannada language|Kannada]] exhibits a strong [[diglossia]], like [[Tamil language|Tamil]], also characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style, and a modern [[colloquial]] form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.

The formal style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of [[Kannada literature]] and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio.

There are also many dialects of Kannada, one major dialect being ''Dharwad Kannada'' of [[North Karnataka]].

=== Latin ===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary register used in writing from 75 BC to the 3rd century AD, while [[Vulgar Latin]] was the common, spoken variety used across the [[Roman Empire]]. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;[[L.R. Palmer]] The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some literary works with [[Register (sociolinguistics)|low-register language]] from the Classical Latin period give a glimpse into the world of early Vulgar Latin. The works of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], being [[comedy|comedies]] with many characters who were [[Slavery|slave]]s, preserve some early [[basilectal]] Latin features, as does the recorded speech of the freedmen in the ''[[Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter]]. At the third [[Council of Tours]] in 813, [[priest]]s were ordered to preach in the vernacular language—either in the ''rustica lingua romanica'' (Vulgar Latin), or in the [[Old High German|Germanic vernaculars]]—since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin.

===Macedonian===
Macedonian (/ˌmæsɪˈdoʊniən/; македонски, tr. makedonski, pronounced [maˈkɛdɔnski ˈjazik] (About this sound listen)) is a South Slavic language spoken as a first language by around two million people, principally in the Republic of Macedonia and the Macedonian diaspora, with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational region of Macedonia. It is the official language of the Republic of Macedonia and a recognized minority language in parts of Albania, Romania and Serbia.

===Malay===
The [[Malay language]] exists in a Classical variety, a modern standard variety and several vernacular dialects.

===Maltese===
[[Maltese language|Maltese]] has a variety of dialects (including the [[Żejtun dialect]], [[Qormi dialect]] and [[Gozitan]] amongst others) that co-exist alongside Standard Maltese. Literary Maltese, unlike Standard Maltese, features a preponderance of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] vocabulary and grammatical patterns; however, this traditional separation between Semitic and [[romance language|Romance]] influences in [[Maltese literature]] (especially Maltese poetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutmalta.com/language/poetry.html|title=AccountSupport|author=|date=|website=aboutmalta.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catholic liturgy]] on the island) is changing.

===Manchu===
Standard [[Manchu language|Manchu]] was based on the language spoken by the [[Jianzhou Jurchens]] during [[Nurhaci|Nurhaci's]] time, while other unwritten Manchu dialects such as that of [[Aigun]] and [[Sanjiazi]] were also spoken in addition to the related [[Xibe language]].

===Mongolian===
The [[Classical Mongolian language]] was the high register used for religious and official purposes, while the various Mongolian dialects served as the low register, like [[Khalkha Mongolian]], [[Chakhar Mongolian]], [[Khorchin Mongolian]], [[Kharchin Mongolian]], [[Baarin Mongolian]], [[Ordos Mongolian]] and the [[Buryat language]]. The [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] was translated into Classical Mongolian. The [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]] who spoke the [[Oirat language|Oirat Mongol language]] and dialects like [[Kalmyk language]] or [[Torgut Oirat]] used a separate standard written with the [[Clear script]].

The [[Mongolian language]], based on Khalkha Mongolian, now serves as the high register in [[Mongolia]] itself while in [[Inner Mongolia]] a standard Mongolian based on Chakhar Mongolian serves as the high register for all Mongols in China. The Buryat language, which is seen by some as part of the Mongolian language, has been turned into a standard literary form itself in Russia.

===N'Ko===
[[N'Ko language|N'Ko]] is a literary language devised by [[Solomana Kante]] in 1949 as a writing system for the [[Mande languages]] of [[West Africa]]. It blends the principal elements of the mutually unintelligible [[Manding languages]]. The movement promoting N'Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the [[Maninka]] cultural identity in Guinea, and has also strengthened the Mande identity in other parts of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oyler, Dianne White (1994) ''Mande identity through literacy, the N'ko writing system as an agent of cultural nationalism''. Toronto : African Studies Association.&lt;/ref&gt; N'Ko publications include a translation of the [[Qur'an]], a variety of textbooks on subjects such as [[physics]] and [[geography]], poetic and philosophical works, descriptions of traditional medicine, a dictionary, and several local newspapers.

===Persian===
[[Persian language|Persian]] or New Persian has been used continually as the literary language of Iran and Afghanistan, as well as India and Central Asia, for over a millennium. The language written today remains essentially the same as that used by [[Ferdowsi]] despite variant colloquial dialects and forms. Until the 20th century, every educated person from the [[Bosphorus]] to the [[Bay of Bengal]] would be expected to know some Persian. It was the second major vehicle after Arabic in transmitting Islamic culture and has a particularly prominent place in Sufism. It remains a in active use in the [[Indian subcontinent]] among traditionally educated Muslim, although its former position has been occupied to a great degree by [[Urdu]]. There are prominent Persian writers from Modern [[Turkey]], such as [[Rumi]] and [[Uzbekistan]], such as [[Jami]]. The corpus of literary writing in Persian from the Indian subcontinent is greater than that of Iran and [[Central Asia]].

===Serbian===
 {{main article|Slavonic-Serbian}}
[[Slavonic-Serbian]] (''slavenosrpski'') was the literary language of [[Serbs]] in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] used from the mid-18th century to 1825. It was a linguistic blend of [[Church Slavonic]] of the Russian recension, [[vernacular]] Serbian ([[Štokavian dialect]]), and [[Russian language|Russian]]. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was severely attacked by [[Vuk Karadžić]] and his followers, whose reformatory efforts formed modern literary Serbian based on the popular language, known as [[Serbo-Croatian]].

===Tagalog===
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] was the basis of the [[Filipino language]]; both share the same vocabulary and grammatical system and are mutually intelligible. However, there is a significant political and social history that underlies the reasons for differentiating between Tagalog and Filipino.

Modern Tagalog is derived from [[Archaic Tagalog]], which was likely spoken during the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|Classical period]], it was the language of the [[Ma-i|Mai State]], [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo Dynasty]] (according to the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]) and southern [[Luzon]]. It was written using [[Baybayin]], a syllabary which is a member of the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]] family, before the Spanish Romanised the alphabet beginning in the late 15th century. Tagalog was also the spoken language of the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]].

The [[1987 Constitution]] maintains that Filipino is the country’s national language and one of two official languages, alongside English. Today, Filipino is considered the proper term for the language of the Philippines, especially by Filipino-speakers who are not of Tagalog origin, with many referring to the Filipino language as “Tagalog-based". The language is taught in schools throughout the country and is the official language of education and business. Native Tagalog-speakers meanwhile comprise one of the largest linguistic and cultural groups of the Philippines, numbering an estimated 14 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Tagalog/|title=Tagalog - Language Information &amp; Resources|author=|date=|website=www.alsintl.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tamil===
[[Tamil language|Tamil]] exhibits a strong [[diglossia]], characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style and a modern [[colloquial]] form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Schiffman, "[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/handbuk.html Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation]", in Florian Coulmas (ed.), ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1997 at pp. 205 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern literary style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of [[Tamil literature]] and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio.

===Tibetan===
[[Classical Tibetan]] was the high register used universally by all Tibetans while the various mutually unintelligible [[Tibetic languages]] serve as the low register vernacular, like [[Central Tibetan language]] in [[Ü-Tsang]] (Tibet proper), [[Khams Tibetan]] in [[Kham]], [[Amdo Tibetan]] in [[Amdo]], [[Ladakhi language]] in [[Ladakh]] and [[Dzongkha]] in [[Bhutan]]. Classical Tibetan was used for official and religious purposes, such as in Tibetan Buddhist religious texts like the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] and taught and learned in monasteries and schools in Tibetan Buddhist regions.

Now, [[Standard Tibetan]], based on the Lhasa dialect, serves as the high register in China. In Bhutan, the Tibetan [[Dzongkha]] language has been standardised and replaced Classical Tibetan for official purposes and education, in [[Ladakh]], the standard official language learned are now the unrelated languages [[Hindi-Urdu]] and English, and in [[Baltistan]], the Tibetan [[Balti language]] serves as the low register while the unrelated [[Urdu language]] is the official language.

===Uzbek and Uyghur===
The Turkic [[Chagatai language]] served as the high register literary standard for Central Asian Turkic peoples, while the vernacular low register languages were the [[Uzbek language]] and [[Uyghur language|Eastern Turki (Modern Uyghur)]]. The [[Soviet Union]] abolished Chagatai as the literary standard and had the [[Uzbek language]] standardized as a literary language for, and the [[Taranchi]] dialect of Ili was chosen as the literary standard for Modern Uyghur, while other dialects like the Kashgar and Turpan dialects continue to be spoken.

===Yorùbá===
[[File:Samuel Adjai Crowther 1888.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel Crowther]]'s Yorùbá grammar led to [[Standard Yoruba]] becoming a literary language.]]
{{main article|Standard Yoruba}}
[[Standard Yoruba]] is the literary form of the [[Yoruba language]] of [[West Africa]], the standard variety learnt at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel A. Crowther]], native Yoruba and the first African Anglican Bishop in Nigeria, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the [[Oyo State|Ọyọ]] and [[Ibadan]] dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for example the following remark by Adetugbọ (1967, as cited in Fagborun 1994:25): "While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Abẹokuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the Ọyọ-Ibadan dialects".&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has some features peculiar to itself only, for example the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as [[calque]]s from English which originated in early translations of religious works. The first novel in the Yorùbá language was ''[[Ogboju Ode ninu Igbo Irunmale]]'' (''The Forest of A Thousand Demons''), written in 1938 by Chief [[Daniel O. Fagunwa]] (1903–1963). Other writers in the Yorùbá language include: Senator [[Afolabi Olabimtan]] (1932–1992) and [[Akinwunmi Isola]].

It is also the first in the series to be released in 3D.

In this film, Alex ([[Ben Stiller]]), Marty ([[Chris Rock]]), Melman ([[David Schwimmer]]), and Gloria ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]) are still struggling to get home to New York. This time, their journey takes them to Europe, where they are relentlessly pursued by the murderous Monaco-based French [[Animal Control]] officer Captain Chantel Dubois ([[Frances McDormand]]). As a means of getting passage to [[North America]], the animals join a [[circus]], where they become close friends with the animal performers, including the new characters of Gia ([[Jessica Chastain]]), Vitaly ([[Bryan Cranston]]), and Stefano ([[Martin Short]]). Together, they spectacularly revitalize the business and along the way find themselves reconsidering where their true home really is.

''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'' made its world premiere at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 18, 2012. In the United States, it was released on June 8, 2012. It has a 79% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; and is the [[2012 in film|eighth highest-grossing film of 2012]] and the highest-grossing ''Madagascar'' film with a worldwide gross of over $746&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; A spin-off titled ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'' was released on November 26, 2014. A sequel, ''Madagascar 4'', was initially announced for 2018 but it was removed from its schedule due to the studio's restructuring.&lt;ref name="BOMNewDates2017-01-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DeadlineCut500 /&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP: FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
Many days after bidding the [[Adélie penguin|penguins]] goodbye, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Alex|Alex]] the [[lion]] suggests to his friends, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Marty|Marty]] the [[Plains zebra|zebra]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Melman|Melman]] the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]] and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Gloria|Gloria]] the [[hippopotamus]] and the [[lemurs]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#King Julien XIII|King Julien XIII]] the [[ring-tailed lemur]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Maurice|Maurice]] the [[aye-aye]] and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mort|Mort]] the [[Goodman's mouse lemur|mouse lemur]] that they should go to [[Monte Carlo]] to get the penguins and [[chimpanzee]]s, [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Mason and Phil]] and fly back to New York City, which they agree to do.

In Monte Carlo, the penguins and chimpanzees have been saving up their daily winnings from the casino to fly back to Africa and bring their friends home. Alex's interference to kidnap them leads to animal control, led by a vicious big-game hunter named [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Chantel DuBois|Chantel DuBois]], pursuing them around the city, with Alex and the gang barely escaping. With determination, DuBois vows to capture Alex and add his head to her collection of animals' heads she's captured.

In the skies of [[France]], the plane crashes as the authorities close in. They come across a [[circus train]] consisting of [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Stefano|Stefano]] the [[New Zealand sea lion|sea lion]], [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Gia|Gia]] the [[North American jaguar|jaguar]], and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Vitaly|Vitaly]] the [[Siberian tiger|tiger]], and manage to gain entry, claiming that they are circus animals themselves. The team soon learn from Stefano that they are performing in [[Rome]] and [[London]], where they plan to impress a promoter to get them on their first American tour. Before the zoo animals' claim is discredited, the penguins suddenly appear with a deal to purchase the circus themselves; however, the circus animals' show in Rome proves to be a failure.

In route to London, Stefano soon reveals to Alex that Vitaly was the biggest star of them all, but quit due to an accident in one of his stunts; therefore, the friends lost faith in the circus. At a stop in the [[Alps]], Alex convinces the circus to continue pursuing the circus. Marty finds a new passion in being shot out of a cannon along with Stefano, while Melman and Gloria decide to dance on a tightrope. Gia persuades Alex to teach her Trapeze Americano.  In the process, they grow closer.

Meanwhile, DuBois is arrested in Rome while chasing the animals, but escapes and discovers that Alex was the missing lion from the zoo in New York. Once free, DuBois personally reassembles her injured men and they head toward the Alps, forcing the animals to proceed to London despite incomplete rehearsals. Alex finds Vitaly preparing to leave and convinces him to stay by reminding him of how he enjoys performing the impossible. He suggests that he uses [[hair conditioner]] as a safer lubricant to perform his flaming ring jump as well as fix his damaged fur. As a result, Vitaly's stunt is performed perfectly and the show is a spectacular success. After the impressed promoter arranges for an American tour, DuBois shows up with a paper showing that Alex was missing. Though the penguins are able to foil Dubois' plan, Alex is forced to confess that the four of them are just zoo animals trying to get home, disappointing the others who feel used and lied to.

The zoo animals and circus go their separate ways but arrive in New York City at the same time. Realizing how much their adventures have changed them, the zoo animals find that their true home was with the circus. Before they can go back, however, DuBois tranquilizes and captures them, before being discovered by the zoo staff, who believe she is responsible for returning the missing animals. King Julien and the penguins manage to get to the circus and convince the circus animals to rescue their friends.

Back at the zoo, Alex awakens to find that he along with his friends are trapped in larger fence enclosures. DuBois, who was honored by the zoo guards, secretly loads a poison-filled dart into a gun that she hides inside a foam finger in preparation for publicly executing Alex. The circus animals arrive led by Skipper and are able to defeat DuBois and her henchmen. Alex and his friends eventually decide to permanently join the circus to pursue their adventures, while DuBois and her henchmen are sent off in crates bound for Madagascar (just like the zoo animals themselves were in the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]) thanks to the penguins.

'''Media circus''' is a [[colloquial]] [[metaphor]], or [[idiom]], describing a [[news]] event for which the level of media coverage — measured by such factors as the number of [[reporter]]s at the scene and the amount of material broadcast or published — is perceived to be excessive or out of proportion to the event being covered.  Coverage that is [[Sensationalism|sensationalistic]] can add to the perception the event is the subject of a media circus. The term is meant to critique the coverage of the event by comparing it to the [[spectacle]] and pageantry of a [[circus]].  Usage of the term in this sense became common in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="mj1"&gt;{{cite news | title=Gilmore case turning into a circus for media | work=Milwaukee Journal | quote=The worldwide attention that condemned killer Gary Gilmore is receiving has turned his case into a media circus Utah residents are saying | date=1976-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ei1"&gt;{{cite news | title=Only in America - the Gary Gilmore Circus has everything but dancing bears | work=The Evening Independent | date=1976-12-08 | quote=There is most appallingly, an only-in-America spectacle wherein a quest for justice becomes an extravaganza for the fast buck. Come, come, come to the circus.| first=Gene | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be called a [[media feeding frenzy]] or just media frenzy, especially when they cover the media coverage.

==History==
[[File:Tonya harding returning from norway 1994.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tonya Harding]] arriving at [[Portland International Airport]] after the [[1994 Winter Olympics]].]]

Although the idea is older, the term ''media circus'' began to appear around the mid-1970s. An early example is from the 1976 book by author Lynn Haney, in which she writes about a romance in which the athlete [[Chris Evert]] was involved: "Their courtship, after all, had been a '''media circus.'"''&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Haney (1976). [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0399610375&amp;id=ffEIhrn5HPgC&amp;q=%22media+circus%22+date:1970-1977&amp;dq=%22media+circus%22+date:1970-1977&amp;pgis=1 ''Chris Evert, the Young Champion''].&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later ''[[The Washington Post]]'' had a similar courtship example in which it reported, "[[Princess Grace]] herself is still traumatized by the memory of her own ''media-circus'' wedding to [[Prince Rainier]] in 1956."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Post]]'' B1, June 29, 1978. This is the oldest quote the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has listed, although obviously there are older occurrences.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has become increasingly popular with time since the 1970s. Reasons for being critical of the media are varied; at the core of most criticism is that there may be a significant [[opportunity cost]] when other more important news issues get less public attention as a result of coverage of the hyped issue.

Media circuses make up the central plot device in the 1951 movie ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' about a self-interested reporter who, covering a mine disaster, allows a man to die trapped underground. It cynically examines the relationship between the media and the news they report. The movie was subsequently re-issued as ''The Big Carnival'', with "carnival" referring to what we now call a "circus". The movie was based on real-life [[Floyd Collins]] who in 1925 was trapped in a Kentucky cave drawing so much media attention that it became the third largest media event between the two World Wars (the other two being [[Charles Lindbergh#Fame|Lindbergh's solo flight]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brucker, R. and Murray, R. ''Trapped! the Story of Floyd Collins'', University Press of Kentucky, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mega TV''' was Malaysia's first ever [[subscription television|subscription]]-based [[pay television]] service. It was incorporated on 18 October 1994 and began transmissions on 1 November 1995 and was operated by [[Media Prima|TV3]]. It was particularly noted for its failure to break into the pay television market.

Mega TV was transmitted from its headquarters in [[Bandar Utama]], in the northern fringes of [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Selangor]].

== History ==
Cableview Services Sdn Bhd or Mega TV was incorporated on 18 October 1994 by a consortium which consisted of [[TV3 (Malaysia)|Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Berhad]].

Cable-based transmissions was officially inaugurated by the 4th [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Tun Doctor Mahathir Bin Mohamad]] and broadcasts from [[Petaling Jaya]] on 1 November 1995 through a microwave-based broadcast system

Faced with stiff competition from the [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]] satellite television network which was launched seven months later, combined with the failures to expand its content, Mega TV ceased transmission in 2001 as a result, leaving Astro as the one and only pay-TV service provider in Malaysia.

'''Military Miniaturism''' describes a hobby (some people would say it is an art) that covers military themed [[scale model|miniaturism]] of many types including, 
* [[model aircraft|aircraft]]
* [[model figure|figures]], [[tin soldier]]s
* [[ship model|ships]]
* [[model military vehicle|vehicles]]
* [[weapon]]s, [[Fortification|emplacements]] or [[Military equipment|equipment]]

Emphasis on realism, historical accuracy and scale congruity of the miniatures and their painting/finishing are important aspects of this hobby.  Knowledge of history, events and geography also play a role in the development of subjects and themes.  Complexity ranges from the simple assembly and painting of a model kit out of the box to the complete [[scratch building]] of a vehicle, aircraft or ship from materials such wood, plastic, metal or resin.  Miniaturists compete for prizes and recognition among their peers in contests in most countries at various times of the year.   The cost and skills involves mean that this has increasingly become a hobby for grown-ups rather than children, though there are still many kits suitable for completion by youngsters. 

Often the military miniaturist will combine different kinds of miniatures in the same [[diorama]]; for example: vehicles and figures; aircraft and vehicles.

{{for|a sanctioned period of silent contemplation|Moment of silence}}

'''''Minute of Silence''''' ({{lang-ru|'''Минута молчания'''}}) was a joint radio and TV program in the [[Soviet Union]] broadcast on at 6:00 pm on May 9, [[Victory Day (Eastern Europe)|the day of the victory]] of the Soviet Union in the [[Great Patriotic war]]. It was first broadcast on [[Soviet Central Television]] in 1965, 20 years after the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. Aside from the minute of silence itself the main part of the program was a solemn address, commonly known as ''The Minute of Silence'', dedicated to all those who fell fighting the [[Nazi]] invasion of the Soviet Union.

The idea of the program was suggested by [[Irana Kazakova]]. Other people of the team who produced the first version were [[Ekaterina Tarkhanova]], [[Svetlana Volodina]], [[Arkadi Revenko]], Mesyatsev, Khazanov, Levitskaya, and other people assistants, artists, musical editors, etc.&lt;ref name=irana&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.journalist-virt.ru/mag.php?s=200505591&amp;prn=1 |title=An interview with Irana Kazakova |publisher=[[Journalist (Russian magazine)|Journalist]] |date= 2005|issue= 5|page=59 |language=Russian |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was started with the announcement "Attention, Attention! Moscow is speaking and broadcasting!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.09may.ru/minuta_molchanija_text.htm|title=Minute of Silence|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Soviet radio voice [[Yuri Levitan]], famous for his announcements during World War II. The very "minute of silence" was sounded with the toll of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] bells and the clock at the [[Spasskaya Tower]] striking seven in the evening. The address was initially narrated by well-known Soviet radio commenter and actress [[Vera Enyutina]]. The TV version was showing the flame on the background of a wall with the text "To the Memory of the Fallen." Due to its solemnity the address was informally known as "the prayer".&lt;ref name=irana/&gt;

After Enyutina emigrated to the [[United States]] the address was narrated by Levitan, and later by [[Igor Kirillov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/sov/9423/bio/ |title=Vera Enyutina biography |publisher=kino-teatr.ru |language=Russian |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the address was modified during the [[Brezhnev stagnation]] by [[Galina Shergova]] and [[Yevgeny Sinitsyn]], under the orders of the management. In particular, a piece about ''[[Malaya Zemlya]]'' was inserted (removed after [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s death in the May 9, 1983 broadcast).&lt;ref name=irana/&gt;The text was replaced with a new one in 2015, with inserted footage from the first ever minute of silence from that year's Victory Day Parade, plus pictures of some of the many fatalities of the conflict.

Russia's [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] and other networks (like [[Russia 1]]) still broadcast this special program today while [[RT (TV network)|RT]] broadcasts it in English, Spanish and Arabic for the benefit of its international viewers. Since 2002, it is broadcast at 6:55 pm, before that it started at around 6:45 in the evening. (Since 2014, RT only shows the minute itself.)

== Expansion ==
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NetEase North America|url = http://www.netease-na.com/#!/about|website = www.netease-na.com|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.

== Music streaming service ==
{{Main|NetEase Music}}
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://music.163.com/|title = 网易云音乐 听见好时光 (NetEase cloud music to listen to the good times)|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-03|website = 网易云音乐 (NetEase cloud music)|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of the number 163 ==
NetEase's official website address is 163.com. This was attributed to the past where Chinese internet users had to dial "163" to connect to the internet, before the availability of broadband internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117608/chinese-number-websites-secret-meaning-urls|title=The Secret Messages Inside Chinese URLs|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate = February 1, 2016|website = newrepublic.com|publisher = The New Republic|last=Beam|first = Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noumena Studios''' was a [[video game developer]] based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], founded in 2010. In 2010,  [[Silver Style Entertainment]] was closed following the bankruptcy of their parent company TGC. Kalypso Media formed its third development studio Noumena to settle the team and their unfinished project Demonicon. They also retrieved most of TGC assets.&lt;ref name=DEMONICON&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demonicon.de/EN/ |title=''The Dark Eye: Demonicon'' website |publisher=[[The Games Company]] |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2010 and publisher Kalypso Media bought the IP Demonicon and took over 17 developers of the Silver Style Studio and founded the third inhouse Kalypso development studio named Noumena Studios. The team now has 45-50 developers (Source Kalypso Media) and the game was released in 2013. The game was originally in development for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] as well, and these versions of the game were supposed to be released in 2014, however, after the release of PC version, no news of console ports were announced.

STAR-STAR (Association for support of marginalised workers) is a sex worker led support group. It's Executive Board is exclusively made up of sex workers. STAR-STAR was the first sex workers collective in the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="swannet" /&gt;

==Legal situation==
Activities related to prostitution are prohibited in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] by both the  ''Law on Misdemeanours Against the Public Order and Peace'' and the ''Criminal Law 1996''.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swannet" /&gt;

[[Soliciting]] in a public place is prohibited by article 19 of the Law on Misdemeanours. The article also prohibits providing space for an act of prostitution. As restaurants, bars and hotels are defined as public places, owners of such places can be fined if prostitution occurs on the premises. Sex in public is also prohibited.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swannet" /&gt;

Article 191 of the Criminal Law prohibits third party involvement, such as [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]], [[pimping]] and profiting from the prostitution of others.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swannet" /&gt;

Law enforcement is corrupt,&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; and often violent towards sex workers. In a 2007 study reported 82.4% of sex workers had been assaulted by the police.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in the Republic of Macedonia}}
Macedonia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls in Macedonia are subjected to sex trafficking within the country in restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Foreign victims subjected to sex trafficking in Macedonia typically originate from [[Eastern Europe]], particularly Albania, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Ukraine]]. Citizens of Macedonia and foreign victims transiting Macedonia are subjected to sex trafficking in Southern, Central, and Western Europe. Migrants and refugees, particularly women and unaccompanied minors, travelling or being smuggled through Macedonia are vulnerable to trafficking. Students are vulnerable to false employment promises in other European countries. Traffickers frequently bribe police and labour inspectors. Police have been investigated and convicted for complicity in human trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macedonia 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271232.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=22 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 418(a) and (d) of the criminal code prohibit all forms of trafficking and prescribe a minimum penalty of four years imprisonment for trafficking adults and 12 years imprisonment for trafficking children. In December 2015, the government deleted article 191(a) on child prostitution, which had allowed the prosecution of child sex traffickers for a lesser offence, and amended article 418(d). The government investigated one sex trafficking case involving six suspects for sex and labour trafficking of children, compared to zero investigations in 2015.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks the Republic of Macedonia as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14320">'''Quantum refereed game''' in quantum information processing is a class of [[Game theory|games]] in the [[Quantum game theory|general theory of quantum games]].&lt;ref name=general_qg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gutoski|first=G|author2=Watrous J |title=Toward a general theory of quantum games|journal=Proceedings of the thirty-ninth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing|year=2007|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0611234|arxiv=quant-ph/0611234|bibcode=2006quant.ph.11234G}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is played between two players, Alice and Bob, and arbitrated by a referee. The referee outputs the pay-off for the players after interacting with them for a fixed number of rounds, while exchanging [[quantum state|quantum information]].

== Definition ==
An '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-turn quantum referee''' performs &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rounds of interaction with the player Alice and Bob. Each interaction involves receiving some quantum states from Alice and Bob, processing the quantum states together with the "left-over" state from the previous interaction, producing some output state, and sending part of the output state to the players. At the end of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rounds, the referee processes the final state received from the players and decides the pay-off for Alice and Bob.

[[File:QuantumRefereedGames.svg|300px|framed|Quantum Refereed Games]]
Mathematically, an n-turn referee is a [[Multiple round quantum games#n-turn co-strategy|measuring co-strategy]] &lt;math&gt;\{R_a:a\in\Sigma\}&lt;/math&gt; whose input spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal X_1,\cdots, \mathcal X_n&lt;/math&gt; and output spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Y_1,\cdots, \mathcal Y_n&lt;/math&gt; are of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal X_k = \mathcal A_k\otimes \mathcal B_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathcal Y_k = \mathcal C_k\otimes\mathcal D_k&lt;/math&gt;

for [[complex numbers|complex]] [[inner product space|Euclidean spaces]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A_k,\mathcal B_k,\mathcal C_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_k,\ 1\leq k\leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A_k,\mathcal B_k&lt;/math&gt; represent the message sent by the referee to Alice and Bob during turn &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C_k,\mathcal D_k&lt;/math&gt; correspond to their responses. At the end of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; turns, the referee produces an output &lt;math&gt;a\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;

An '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-turn quantum refereed game''' consists of an n-turn referee along with functions &lt;math&gt; V_A, V_B:\Sigma\mapsto\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; that maps each measurement output &lt;math&gt; a&lt;/math&gt; to Alice's and Bob's pay-off.

Individual quantum refereed games may place specific restrictions on strategies Alice and Bob can choose from. For example, in [[Bell's theorem|nonlocal]] games &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleve|first=R|author2=Hoyer P. |author3=Toner B. |author4=Watrous J. |title=Consequences and limits of nonlocal strategies|journal=Proceedings of the 19th Annual IEEE conference on Computational complexity|year=2004|pages=236–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy|pseudo-telepathy]] games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brassard|first=G.|author1-link=Gilles Brassard|author2=Broadbent A. |author2-link= Anne Broadbent |author3=Tapp A. |title=Quantum pseudo-telepathy|journal=Foundations of Physics|year=2005|pages=1877–1907|doi=10.1007/s10701-005-7353-4|volume=35|issue=11|arxiv = quant-ph/0407221 |bibcode = 2005FoPh...35.1877B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alice and Bob are allowed to share entanglement but are forbidden from communicating.  In general, such restrictions may not apply in quantum refereed games.

== Zero-sum quantum refereed game ==
Similar to a classical [[zero-sum game]], a '''zero-sum quantum refereed game'''&lt;ref name=general_qg /&gt; is a quantum refereed game with the additional constraint &lt;math&gt;V_A(a) + V_B(a) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

It is natural to assume Alice and Bob play independent [[Multiple-round quantum games#n-turn strategy|strategies]] in a zero-sum quantum refereed game, since it cannot simultaneously be to both players' advantage to communicate directly with one another or to initially share an [[quantum entanglement|entanglement state]] {reference}. In this case, Alice's and Bob's strategy can be represented by

:&lt;math&gt;A\in \mathcal S_n(\mathcal A_{1\cdots n}, \mathcal C_{1\cdots n})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\in \mathcal S_n(\mathcal B_{1\cdots n}, \mathcal D_{1\cdots n})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S_n(\mathcal X_{1\cdots n},\mathcal Y_{1\cdots n})&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all n-turn strategies having input space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal X_1,\cdots,\mathcal X_n&lt;/math&gt; and output space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Y_1,\cdots, \mathcal Y_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The combined strategy is then &lt;math&gt;A\otimes B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Min-max theorem ===
Define &lt;math&gt;V(a) = V_A(a) = -V_B(a)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R = \sum_{a\in\Sigma} V(a) R_a&lt;/math&gt;, then Alice's expected pay-off is &lt;math&gt;\sum_{a\in\Sigma}V(a)\langle A\otimes B,R_a\rangle = \langle A\otimes B,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

The optimal strategy for Alice then lies in the min-max problem
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{A}\min_{B} \langle A\otimes B,R\rangle = \min_{B}\max_{A} \langle A\otimes B,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The above equality holds because &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; are drawn from [[compact space|compact]] and [[convex set|convex]] sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S_n(\mathcal A_{1\cdots n}, \mathcal C_{1\cdots n})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal S_n(\mathcal B_{1\cdots n}, \mathcal D_{1\cdots n})&lt;/math&gt;. It is called the '''[[min-max theorem]]''' for zero-sum quantum games.

== Quantum Interactive Proof with Competing Provers ==
A quantum interactive proof with two competing provers is a generalization of the single prover [[Interactive Proof System#QIP|quantum interactive proof system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitaev|first=A|author2=Watrous J |title=Parallelization, amplification, and exponential time simulation of quantum interactive proof system|journal=Proceedings of the 32nd AMC Symposium on Theory of Computing|year=2000|pages=608–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watrous|first=J|title=PSPACE has constant-round quantum interactive proof systems|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|year=2003|pages=575–588|doi=10.1016/s0304-3975(01)00375-9|volume=292|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be modelled by zero-sum refereed games where Alice and Bob are the competing provers, and the referee is the verifier. The referee is assumed to be computationally bounded (polynomial size quantum circuit), whereas Alice and Bob can be computationally unrestricted. Alice, Bob and the referee receive a common string, and after fixed rounds of interactions (exchanging quantum information between the provers and the referee), the referee decides whether Alice wins or Bob wins.

=== Classical RG ===
In the classical setting, RG can be viewed as the following problem. Alice, Bob, and the referee is given some statement. Alice is trying to convince the referee that the statement is true while Bob is trying to convince the referee that the statement is false. The referee, who has limited computing power, will look at the proofs provided by Alice and Bob, ask them questions, and at the end of the day decide which player is correct (wins). The goal is for the referee to find an algorithm such that if the statement is true, there is a way for Alice to win with probability greater than 3/4, and if the statement is false, there is a way for Bob to win with probability greater than 3/4.

In the language of complexity theory, a [[promise problem]] &lt;math&gt;L = (L_{\text{yes}}, L_{\text{no}})&lt;/math&gt; has a classical refereed game (classical RG) if there exists a referee described by [[RP (complexity)|polynomial time randomized computation]], such that

:1. for each &lt;math&gt; x\in L_{\text{yes}}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a strategy for Alice to win with probability ≥ 3/4, and

:2. for each &lt;math&gt;x\in L_{\text{no}}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a strategy for Bob to win with probability ≥ 3/4.

It is known that RG = [[EXP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koller|first=D|author2=Megiddo N |title=The complexity of two-person zero-sum games in extensive form|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|year=1992|pages=528–552|doi=10.1016/0899-8256(92)90035-q|volume=4|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feige|first=U|author2=Kilian J |title=Making games short|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth annual ACM Symbosium on Theory of Computing|year=1997|pages=506–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== QRG ===
Quantum interactive proof systems with competing provers is a generalization of the classical RG where the referee is now restricted to polynomial-time generated [[quantum circuit]]s and may exchange quantum information with the players.&lt;ref name=general_qg /&gt; Therefore, QRG can be seen as the following problem. Alice, Bob and the referee is given some statement (it may involve a quantum state). Alice is trying to convince the referee the statement is true while Bob is trying to convince the referee the statement is false. The referee can ask the provers questions via quantum states, receive answers in quantum states, and analyse the received quantum states using a quantum computer. After communicating with Alice and Bob for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rounds, the referee decides whether the statement is true or false. If there is a way for the referee to make a correct decision with probability ≥ 3/4, the game is in QRG.

More formally, QRG denotes the complexity class for all promise problems having quantum refereed games defined as follows. Given a string &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, a promise problem &lt;math&gt;L = (L_{\text{yes}}, L_{\text{no}})&lt;/math&gt; is in QRG if there is a referee represented by a polynomial time generated quantum circuit such that

:1. if &lt;math&gt;x\in L_{\text{yes}}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a strategy for Alice to win with probability ≥ 3/4, and
:2. if &lt;math&gt;x\in L_{\text{no}}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a strategy for Bob to win with probability ≥ 3/4.

It turns out that QRG = EXP — allowing the referee to use quantum circuit and send or receive quantum information does not give the referee any extra power. EXP ⊆ QRG follows from the fact that EXP = RG ⊆ QRG. proved QRG ⊆ EXP by a formulation of QRG using [[semidefinite programs]] (SDP).

==== Semidefinite Program Formulation ====

For a quantum refereed game, at the end of all the interactions, the referee outputs one of the two possible outcomes &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate whether Alice wins &lt;math&gt;(a)&lt;/math&gt; or Bob wins &lt;math&gt;(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Setting &lt;math&gt;V(a) = 1, V(b) = 0&lt;/math&gt; results in a quantum refereed game whose value is the maximum winning probability for Alice.

Using the same notation as the zero sum quantum refereed game as above, the referee is represented by operators &lt;math&gt;\{R_a,R_b\}&lt;/math&gt;, Alice may pick a strategy from &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal S_n(\mathcal A_{1\cdots n},\mathcal C_{1\cdots n})&lt;/math&gt;, and Bob from &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal S_n(\mathcal B_{1\cdots n},\mathcal D_{1\cdots n})&lt;/math&gt;. Define

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_a(A) = \operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal C_{1\cdots n}\otimes\mathcal A_{1\cdots n}}((A\otimes I_{\mathcal D_{1\cdots n}\otimes B_{1\cdots n}})R_a)&lt;/math&gt; , and

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_b(A) = \operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal C_{1\cdots n}\otimes\mathcal A_{1\cdots n}}((A\otimes I_{\mathcal D_{1\cdots n}\otimes B_{1\cdots n}})R_b)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal X}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partial trace]] operator.

The referee outputs &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\langle A\otimes B,R_a\rangle = \langle B,\Omega_a(A)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\langle A\otimes B,R_b\rangle = \langle B,\Omega_b(A)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\{\Omega_a(A),\Omega_b(A)\}&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as a co-strategy that merges Alice's strategy with the referee's.

For any given strategy &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; Alice chooses, the maximum winning probability for Bob is

:&lt;math&gt;\max_B\langle B,\Omega_b(A)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,

which, by the [[Multiple round quantum game#Maximum Output Probabilities|property]] of the [[Multiple round quantum game#Representation of strategy|strategy representation]], is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\min\{p\geq 0:\Omega_b(A)\leq p Q,\ Q\in\text{co-}\mathcal S_n(\mathcal B_{1\cdots n},\mathcal D_{1\cdots n})\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, to maximize Alice's winning probability,  &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum winning probability for Bob, needs to be minimized over all possible strategies. The goal is then to compute

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rl}
\min &amp; p \\
\text{subject to} &amp; \Omega_b(A)\leq pQ, \\
&amp; A\in \mathcal S_n(\mathcal A_{1\cdots n}, \mathcal C_{1\cdots n}),\\
&amp; Q\in\text{co-}\mathcal S_n(\mathcal B_{1\cdots n},\mathcal D_{1\cdots n})
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;.

This minimization problem can be expressed by the following SDP problem:&lt;ref name=general_qg /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rll}
\min &amp; \operatorname{Tr}(P_1) \\
\text{subject to} &amp; \Omega_b(A_n)\leq Q, \\
&amp;\operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal C_k}(A_k) = A_{k-1}\otimes I_{\mathcal A_k} &amp; (2\leq k\leq n),\\
&amp;\operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal C_1}(A_1) = I_{\mathcal A_1},\\
&amp;Q_k = P_k\otimes I_{\mathcal D_k}&amp;(1\leq k\leq n),\\
&amp;\operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal B_k}(P_k) = Q_{k-1}&amp;(2\leq k\leq n),\\
&amp;A_k\in\operatorname{Pos}(\mathcal C_{1\cdots k}\otimes A_{1\cdots k}) &amp; (1\leq k\leq n),\\
&amp;Q_k\in\operatorname{Pos}(\mathcal D_{1\cdots k}\otimes B_{1\cdots k}) &amp; (1\leq k\leq n),\\
&amp;P_k\in\operatorname{Pos}(\mathcal D_{1\cdots k}\otimes B_{1\cdots k}) &amp; (1\leq k\leq n),\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The dimension of the input and output space of this SPD is exponential (from the tensor product states) in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and the SDP has a size polynomial in the dimension of its input and output space. Since there are efficient algorithms that can solve SDP in polynomial-time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=KHACHIYAN|first=L|title=A polynomial time algorithm in linear programming|journal=Soviet Mathematics - Doklady |volume=20|year=1979|pages=191–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Grötschel|first=M |author1-link= Martin Grötschel |author2=Lovász L. |author3=Schrijver, A.|title=Geometric Algorithms and Combinatorial Optimization|publisher=Springer|series= Algorithms and Combinatorics|year=1988|isbn=978-3-642-97883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nesterov|first=Y|author2=Nemirovski A |title=Interior point polynomial algorithms in comvex programming|journal=SIAM Studies in Applied Mathematics |volume=13|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that QRG ⊆ EXP.

'''''Retry''''' is a [[free-to-play]] [[Retrogaming|retro-styled]] [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[video game]] developed by Rovio LVL11 and published by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired by ''[[Flappy Bird]]'', ''Retry'' has similar controls. The game was [[soft launch]]ed in Finland, Canada, and Poland in May 2014. As of 2017 Retry has been taken off the AppStore&lt;ref name="Pocketgamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/RETRY/news.asp?c=59338|title=Angry Birds maker Rovio will publish Retry, a hardcore, retro-styled action game|last=Pocketgamer|first=PG Admin|date=6 May 2014|work=[[Pocketgamer]]|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide iOS and Android release was on October 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/10/22/rovio-launches-retry-first-video-game-experimental-publishing-arm-lvl-11/ Rovio tries again with RETRY, its first game under experimental publishing arm LVL11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The goal of the game is to send an airplane from one hangar to another hangar in different places. There are many obstacles between the two points, including air and moving landscapes.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://o.canada.com/technology/gaming/review-retry-takes-the-concept-behind-flappy-bird-and-makes-it-infinitely-better|title = Review: RETRY takes the concept behind Flappy Bird and makes it infinitely better|last = Rourke|first = Patrick|date = May 13, 2014|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has in-app purchases, and users can pay to make the game ad-free.

The goal of the game is to bring the airplane from one hangar into another hangar without crashing into obstacles (even the ground). In order to move the plane, the players must simply tap the screen. The plane will then move forwards and upwards. Releasing the finger from the screen makes the plane move down. (Similar gameplay has appeared before in old Finnish games, such as ''[[Triplane Turmoil series|Triplane Turmoil]]'' (1996) by Dodekaedron Software and even more similarly in ''Super Sukkula'' (1994) by Lasse Makkonen.)

In every level, there is at least one "retry point", that when landed upon changes the plane's spawn point into that of the retry point for one coin. The game, unlike ''Flappy Bird'', can also let players loop the plane, and even fly backwards. There are also new gameplay elements such as liquid physics, moving obstacles, stars, and currency (for unlocking levels early and acquiring retry points), which can be earned via achievements or playing levels and purchased for real money.

In certain levels, there are elements that can increase the difficulty. The wind can slow down the plane, water can drown the plane (but not crash), and moving terrain. There are also locked blocks in some levels that locks a certain level path, that can only be opened by unlocking the next level pack.

Like all Rovio games, Retry has a 3-star format. The first star is earned by finishing the level, the second star is earned by not crashing a certain number of times, and the third star by not flying more than a certain distance. Stars, not only shows the mastery of each level but are also used to unlock additional level packs.

==Reception==

}}

Patrick O'Rourke of [[canada.com]] described the game as taking "one of the few things that was great about [[Flappy Bird]]", namely the satisfaction of repeatedly retrying the same simple task, and building a full game around the idea. He saw its visuals as paying homage to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] without "completely ripping them off" as Flappy Bird had done, and summarised the game as a "decent pick-up-and-play iOS title".&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

'''Sepak Tekong''' is a traditional children's game from [[Padang, West Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] similar in play to [[hide-and-seek]]. It is played in many regions around Indonesia. The name comes from the [[Minangkabau language]]. The word ''sepak'' means {{lang|ms|menendang}} or {{lang|ms|menyepak}} in Indonesian, which roughly translates to "kick" in English; and ''tekong'' means {{lang|ms|kaleng}} in Indonesian, which translates to the word "can" in English. Sepak Tekong therefore roughly translates to "kicking the can" in English. 

==How to play==
Sepak Tekong is a game usually played by children around eight years of age and above. The ideal number of players is between three and ten people and it is normally played in a house or yard that has various places to hide. Players use either a coconut shell or a small milk can filled with sand as the can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permainan Tradisional Sumatera Barat|last=|first=|publisher=Museum Negeri Propinsi Sumatera Barat "Adityawarman"|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential that the can makes a loud sound when kicked. 

Before the game starts, the first player selects the best place to set the can and chooses the boundaries of where other players can hide. A lottery, called ''hompimpa'', decides who will be the player that guards the can and seeks the players. 

To start the game, all of the children, including the guard and seeker, stand near the can. One player kicks the can as far as possible and then all the players, except the guard and seeker, go into hiding. The guard and seeker sits on the can with eyes closed until everyone else has hidden and called out "ready". The guard and seeker then begins searching for the hidden players. When the guard and seeker finds a hidden player, the guard and seeker says the hider's name. The hider and the guard and seeker race to the can. If the guard and seeker gets to the can first, the hider is declared caught and the guard and seeker continues to look for players that are hiding. If the guard and seeker leaves the can to search and a hider emerges and kicks the can, the players who were caught earlier can hide again.{{confusing|section|reason=What happens if hider gets to can before seeker? What if the kicker is caught?|date=November 2018}}

==Benefits &lt;!-- This entire section may be thought of as violating a "neutral point of view", but this may just be my opinion. --&gt;==
Some argue that Sepak Tekong has many benefits for its players:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salingsapa.com/blog/read/uncategorize/13017/kondisi-permainan-tradisional-yang-mulai-pudar-dari-permainan-anak-anak-negri.html|title=Blog - SalingSapa Berteman Dalam Kebaikan|website=www.salingsapa.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://muntijo.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/permainan-tradisional-sepak-tekong-dan-strategi-perang-gerilya/|title=Permainan Tradisional Sepak Tekong dan Strategi Perang Gerilya|date=2013-08-10|work=Berbubastra|access-date=2018-11-18|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pastiguna.com/permainan-anak-jaman-dulu/|title=permainan anak jaman dulu untuk mengingat sepak tekong - pastiguna|date=2016-09-17|work=Pastiguna|access-date=2018-11-18|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* promotes physical activity
* builds good relationships among players since all players are considered equal
* improves memory because the guard and seeker must memorize the names of the other players
* promotes creativity because players must find a place to hide and consider whether the place can be easily found or not
* builds community since all players must follow the same rules
* encourages cooperation because rules can be changed to accommodate different geography
* forms good sportsmanship since there are winners and losers

==Decline==
Younger generations no longer play traditional games like Sepak Tekong. There are many modern games which are considered simpler and easier to play. Only a few children still know and play this Sepak Tekong today. In addition, Sepak Tekong requires a large space to play and it is difficult to find large spaces because most of the possible playing areas are under construction or have been built upon. In this era, most children do not feel that the game is relevant.{{additional citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''''Serene Velocity''''' is a 1970 American experimental short film directed by [[Ernie Gehr]]. Gehr filmed it in the basement hallway of a [[Binghamton University]] academic building, using a static camera position and changing only the [[focal length]] of the camera. It is recognized as a key work of [[structural film]]making and has been inducted into the U.S. [[National Film Registry]].

==Description==
''Serene Velocity'' lasts twenty-three minutes and is silent. To make the film, Gehr locked his camera down in the center of a hallway, shooting several individual frames at a time. After each set of exposures, he changed the focal length on the lens, zooming in and then out in increasing increments.&lt;ref name="mekas-film-culture"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mekas |first=Jonas |authorlink=Jonas Mekas |year=1972 |title=Ernie Gehr Interviewed by Jonas Mekas, March 24, 1971 |journal=[[Film Culture]] |issue=53–55 |pages=25–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; What begins as a small difference in apparent distance several frames at a time expands to extreme closeups and wide shots jumping back and forth. By the end of the film, the zoom into the end of the hallway reveals a set of double doors with daylight filtering through.&lt;ref name="macdonald-film-quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=Scott |year=1990 |title=Ernie Gehr: Camera Obscura/Lens/Filmstrip |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Ernie Gehr 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Director [[Ernie Gehr]] in 2017]]
In early 1970 Gehr was at SUNY Binghamton while Larry Gottheim was beginning to form a film department.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2015, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Gottheim was impressed with Gehr's earlier short films ''Morning'' and ''Wait'', and the two became acquainted when Gottheim replaced a damaged print of one of Gehr's works.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2015, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; With the encouragement of Gottheim and [[Ken Jacobs]], Gehr taught two courses there during the summer session.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2015, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been interested in making a film that explored "the intervals between frames–activating the screen plane from frame to frame more dynamically".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; One day during the session, Gehr was on his way to the film department's editing rooms in a basement and thought of the hallway as an ideal place to film. A long, plain area appealed to him as a good space to "maximize the tension between representation and abstraction".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, pp. 374–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gehr began shooting test footage in the basement hallway. He tested mid-range and extreme focal lengths in "bars" of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 frames. He decided to use bars of 4 frames, projected at 16 [[frames per second]]. This would have been roughly equivalent to 6 frames at 24 frames per second, but Gehr chose a lower frame rate so that each frame would remain on screen longer, accentuating the optical effects.&lt;ref name="mekas-film-culture"/&gt; He was surprised by the physical effect from watching the footage and felt nauseated afterward.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

The footage for ''Serene Velocity'' was shot over the course of one night. Gehr began filming once it was dark outside, planning to take a break for several hours and finish filming during sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, pp. 375–377.&lt;/ref&gt; He started by alternating between focal lengths of 50 mm and 55 mm. After roughly {{convert|60|ft|m}} of film, he moved each of the lengths apart by 5 mm, to 45 mm and 60 mm, then 40 mm and 65 mm, and so on.&lt;ref name="mekas-film-culture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |last=Feldman |first=Ellen |year=1976 |title=''Serene Velocity'' by Ernie Gehr |work=A History of the American Avant-Garde Cinema |publisher=[[American Federation of Arts]] |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; He marked off lengths in intervals of 5 mm on a piece of tape and gradually moved the lengths farther apart over the course of filming. He manually recorded each frame, and without the use of a [[cable release]] his fingers became swollen from holding the [[shutter button]]. The process took longer than he had expected, and he took only one break to use a restroom and hold his head under water to keep awake.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and interpretations==
[[File:Serene Velocity.jpg|thumb|right|''Serene Velocity'' shows a [[one-point perspective]] view of the hallway that divides it into the ceiling, walls, floor, and doors.]]
Watching ''Serene Velocity'' produces the appearance of motion and other optical effects, positioning it as a cinematic version of [[op art]]. Gehr has noted that the effects of watching the film vary significantly based on which part of the screen the viewer focuses on.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2015, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the screen is divided into five sections: the ceiling's fluorescent lights and exit signs; the doors, water fountains, and ashtrays on the left and right walls; the reflections on the floor; and the doors in the center of the frame. The perspective lines point to the center of the frame, which would normally be the center of interest, but the motion along the margins of the frame draws attention away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perez |first=Gilberto |authorlink=Gilberto Perez |date=October 1999 |title=Film in Review |journal=[[The Yale Review]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing the images as flat, two-dimensional spaces transforms the work into an abstract, flashing sign. Focusing on individual features of the successive images produces the illusion of motion.&lt;ref name="macdonald-film-quarterly"/&gt; The illusion of [[depth perception]] can transform the image into an upright pyramid pointing into or out of the screen.&lt;ref name="cowan-take-one"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cowan |first=Bob |year=1972 |title=Letter from New York |magazine=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Jacobs emphasized this sense of thrusting and described ''Serene Velocity'' as a "sexual metaphor, or sex-become cinema",&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2015, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Hoberman]] described it as a "piston-powered mandala".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |last=Hoberman |first=J. |authorlink=J. Hoberman |year=1995 |title=Ernie Gehr: A Walker in the City |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have often evaluated ''Serene Velocity'' as a [[metacinema]]tic work. [[Noël Carroll]] pointed to the simplified procedure with which it was photographed as an example of [[minimalist]] cinema. Carroll wrote that the film, with its lack of movement, is an argument for "the impression of movement" as the essential characteristic of cinema.&lt;ref name="carroll-jaac"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carroll |first=Noël |authorlink=Noël Carroll |year=2006 |title=Philosophizing Through the Moving Image: The Case of ''Serene Velocity'' |journal=[[The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism]] |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=173–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have drawn parallels with [[Andy Warhol]]'s 1964 film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'', an extended, continuous shot of the [[Empire State Building]]. Both films advance a philosophical argument with a lack of movement and an emphasis on the recording process.&lt;ref name="carroll-jaac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faucher 2008, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilberto Perez]] characterized the building's design as a descendant of [[Bauhaus architecture]], calling it "barren and dehumanizing". He interpreted ''Serene Velocity'' as "neither a celebration–nor exactly a condemnation" of Bauhaus minimalism.&lt;ref name="perez"&gt;Perez 2006, pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Serene Velocity'' received a positive reaction from many of Gehr's contemporaries, including Ken Jacobs, [[Michael Snow]], [[Hollis Frampton]], [[Richard Foreman]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Andrew Noren]]. However, the film received little coverage from the press upon its 1970 release, save for a mention by [[Jonas Mekas]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2005, pp. 378–379.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Bob Cowan wrote in his column for ''[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]]'' that ''Serene Velocity'' was "one of the few really unique films I have seen during the last few years…It is rare that a film, which on the surface seems to be only a technical tour-de-force, can lift one to such emotional heights as it develops from surprise to surprise."&lt;ref name="cowan-take-one"/&gt; ''Serene Velocity'' cemented Gehr's reputation as a [[structural film]]maker. He demurred to the term, stating "I don't know what that word really means–[Labels] stop people from actually seeing, actually experiencing the work."&lt;ref name="mekas-film-culture"/&gt;

In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] named the film "culturally significant" and entered it into the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was preserved in 2006 by [[The Museum of Modern Art]], which enlarged the original [[16 mm]] print to [[35 mm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/works/107462 |title=Ernie Gehr. ''Serene Velocity''. 1970 |publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2008janfeb/gehr.html |title=Ernie Gehr's Marvelous Cinema |publisher=[[Harvard Film Archive]] |access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Laura Poitras]] began making films while taking a course that Gehr taught at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]. The first film Gehr screened was ''Serene Velocity'', and Poitras has identified it as an influence on her work.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2015, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt; For their 2008 short film ''Lossless #4'', Rebecca Baron and Douglas Goodwin used a digital reproduction of ''Serene Velocity'' as source material. They fed it through a [[motion estimation]] algorithm to create a vector representation of the apparent motion in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Baron and Goodwin, pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2012 [[Sight &amp; Sound#The Sight &amp; Sound Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time|''Sight &amp; Sound'' Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time]], Noël Carroll listed ''Serene Velocity'' in his submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/242 |title=Noel Carroll |year=2012 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18349">Television was first introduced to [[Iran]] in 1958, as a privately owned and commercially operated enterprise, before being nationalised, remaining a state-controlled [[monopoly]], first of [[National Iranian Radio and Television]], and following the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, of [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]].

==History==
===Television Iran===
[[File:MohammadReza Pahlavi visits television center of Habiblollah Sabet, There are also Hormoz Sabet, Naser Zolfaghari, Ali Mo'ayyed Sabeti, Nematollah Nasiri.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] with Habib Sabet on visit to television centre]]

On October 3, 1958, Television Iran (TVI) was established, broadcasting from [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="Almanac92"/&gt; A second station, based in [[Abadan]] in the south of the country, was established in 1960.&lt;ref name="Almanac92"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zOJtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Television+Iran%22+%22Abadan%22&amp;dq=%22Television+Iran%22+%22Abadan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi918fZ-s7eAhULCcAKHRHZArIQ6AEILzAB ''Iran Almanac and Book of Facts''], Echo of Iran, 1992, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; Its programming included [[Game show|quiz shows]] and American programmes [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into [[Persian language|Persian]], and appealed to an unsophisticated audience.&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H20Xt157iYUC&amp;lpg=PA811&amp;dq=%22Television%20Iran%22%20%22dubbed%22&amp;pg=PA811#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Television%20Iran%22%20%22dubbed%22&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge History of Iran''], Volume 7, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pages 810-811&lt;/ref&gt;

Habib Sabet, a [[Baha'i]] who was one of Iran's major industrialists, was the founder of the first television station.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/24/obituaries/habib-sabet-is-dead-an-iranian-altruist-and-industrialist-86.html Habib Sabet Is Dead; An Iranian Altruist And Industrialist], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 24 1990, page 30&lt;/ref&gt; The station manager was an [[United States|American]], A. Vance Hallack, who had previously operated the Baghdad Television Station in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b6spAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=A.+Vance+Hallack+Persia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Vance+Hallack%22 ''Journal of the Television Society''], Television Society, 1959, page 515&lt;/ref&gt; Before coming to the Middle East, Hallack had managed [[NBC]]'s [[Colour television|colour]] division.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=th0rAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Vance+Hallack%22+%22Iran%22&amp;dq=%22Vance+Hallack%22+%22Iran%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo8q6avtHeAhVIEawKHY2GAiAQ6AEINTAC ''Broadcasting''], Broadcasting Publications, page 77&lt;/ref&gt; 

At its launch, TVI had the sponsorship of numerous [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] Western companies, [[RCA]], [[General Tire]], [[Pepsi-Cola]], [[Autolite]], [[Squibb Corporation|Squibb]] and [[Volkswagen]], Sabet having opened the first Pepsi-Cola plant in Iran in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b6spAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=A.+Vance+Hallack+Persia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Vance+Hallack%22 ''Newsweek''], Volume 55, 1960, page 198&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1963, it claimed to have lost 70 million [[Iranian rial|rial]]s, and its owners attempted to sell the station to the government, but by then it had already approved plans for its own television network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HmUaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22AFRTS%22+%22Tehran%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22AFRTS%22+ ''Regional Trade Directory: Iran-Pakistan-Turkey''], Madatali Karamali, 1968, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;  

===National Iranian Television===

A separate network, National Iranian Television (NITV), was established in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8jRuAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=National+Iranian+Television+%28NITV%29+in+1966&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%221966%22 ''Basic Facts About Iran''], Ministry of Information, Publications Dept, 1973, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; This catered for a more educated public.&lt;ref name="Cam"/&gt; On October 26, NITV transmitted its first broadcast message, a statement by the [[Mohammad Reza Shah|Shah]]; test programs were run, and complete programming commenced in [[Nowruz]], the Iranian New Year, in March 1967, with the first week’s programs included the broadcasting of the Shah’s birthday celebrations from [[Amjadieh Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Small Media"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s1-r6XOP2CUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=A%20Small%20Media%2C%20Big%20Revolution%3A%20Communication%2C%20Culture%2C%20and%20the%20Iranian%20Revolution&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A Small Media, Big Revolution: Communication, Culture, and the Iranian Revolution''], Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi, Ali Mohammadi, University of Minnesota Press, 1994, pages 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Forces Radio and Television Service===

Until 1976, the [[American Forces Network|American Forces Radio and Television Service]] (AFRTS) broadcast a television service on Channel 7 in Tehran and the surrounding area from its studios in the city.&lt;ref name="CommDev"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mg1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22NIRT+International%22&amp;dq=%22NIRT+International%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimk9fKjsbeAhXJJsAKHRK5CK0Q6AEIKjAA ''Communications and Development Review''], Volume 1, Issues 1-4, Iran Communications and Development Institute, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catering for [[US Armed Forces]] personnel, this was known as AFTV, and was the only television service in the country then carrying programming in English, as all foreign programming on NITV and TVI, including [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] imports, was dubbed in Persian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PjFKAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22AFTV%22+%22Iran%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Persian%22 ''Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers''], Volume 77, SMPTE, 1968, page 512&lt;/ref&gt; In deference to Iranian sensitivities, AFRTS avoided carrying programming that might be construed as offensive on political or religious grounds, instead carrying cowboy or detective movies.&lt;ref name="Zonis"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AG99BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22AFRTS%22%20%22Iran%22&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q=%22AFRTS%22%20&amp;f=false ''Political Elite of Iran''], Marvin Zonis, Princeton University Press, 1976, page 247&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, in that year it was decided by the Iranian government that AFRTS should close down its radio and TV services, which it did on October 25.&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9ybVAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22International%22+%22Iran%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22NIRT%27s+new+international+services%22 ''Iran Almanac and Book of Facts''], Volume 16, Echo of Iran., 1977, page 125&lt;/ref&gt; These would be replaced by similar services, operated by the state broadcaster.&lt;ref name="Intermedia89"/&gt; 

===National Iranian Radio and Television===

In 1971, NITV was merged with [[Radio Iran]] to form a new broadcasting organisation, [[National Iranian Radio and Television]] (NIRT).&lt;ref name="Almanac1974"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FAggAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22American+community%22+%22Tehran%22+%22radio%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%2219+June+1971%22 ''Iran Almanac and Book of Facts''], Echo of Iran, 1974, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; TVI, meanwhile, had been nationalised at the end of April 1969.&lt;ref name="Almanac1969"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dxJIAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Habib+Sabet+TVI&amp;dq=Habib+Sabet+TVI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMqfa5t9HeAhVEGsAKHVKPB90Q6AEINTAD ''Iran Almanac and Book of Facts''], Echo of Iran, 1969, page 461&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the government had come to consider the privately-owned station a competitive threat, and bought out Sabet for the sum of 20 million [[Iranian toman|toman]], against his initial investment of 70 million toman, with the station's building being taken over by the new Educational Television service.&lt;ref name="Small Media"/&gt; 

Prior to 1967, television had covered about 2.1 million people; when NIRT began regular transmissions that year, coverage rose to 4.8 million, and by 1974 had risen to over 15 million, roughly half the total population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pfgKAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Prior+to+1967%2C+television+had+covered+about+2.1+million+people&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%222.1+million+to+4.8+million%22 ''Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications''], Volume 2, Academic Press, 2003, page 617&lt;/ref&gt; The large budget allocations that were provided to NIRT, a reflection of the organisation's role in development, enabled it to use the latest technologies, including microwave delivery systems, to overcome problems of mountainous terrain.&lt;ref name="Small Media"/&gt; 

By 1975–76, 70 percent of the population had television reception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uQtrj-wdGcAC&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22Iran%22+%22color%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22NIRT%22 ''Iran: A Survey of U.S. Business Opportunities''], U.S. Department of Commerce, Domestic and International Business Administration, Bureau of International Commerce, 1977, page 60&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, in 1973, NIRT had already established a total of 14 television production centres with 153 transmitters, covering approximately 88 cities and towns in Iran, accounting for 60 per cent of the population.&lt;ref name="Intermedia73"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Og8dAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22Second+Programme%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22NIRT%22+ ''InterMedia''], International Broadcast Institute, 1973, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, this had increased to fifteen, including two in [[Tehran]], as well as one each in the provincial cities of [[Abadan]], [[Ardebil]], [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Esfahan]], [[Kerman]], [[Kermanshah]], [[Shiraz]], [[Mahabad]], [[Mashad]], Rasht, [[Rezaiyeh]], [[Sanandaj]], [[Tabriz]] and [[Zahedan]].&lt;ref name="Almanac1974"/&gt; 

Earlier, it had aimed for its first television network to reach 65 per cent of the population of Iran, with its second network reaching 50 per cent by the end of 1977, marking the end of the country's Fifth Development Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i0IaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22Second+Programme%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Second+Programme%22 ''CENTO Seminar on Management &amp; Training in Television &amp; Radio Broadcasting''], CENTO, 1975, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, Iran was second only to [[Japan]] in Asia in terms of the development of its broadcasting capabilities.&lt;ref name="Almanac1974"/&gt; This prompted one Western commentator to argue in 1977 that "[if] Iran continues on its present path it will be the first nation in the world to have nationally spread television before a nationally spread press".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IbiSAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=1YuDALQ2C1&amp;dq=Iran%20continues%20on%20its%20present%20path%20it%20will%20be%20the%20first%20nation%20in%20the%20world%20to%20have%20nationally%20spread%20television%20before%20a%20nationally%20spread%20press&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Iranian Media: The Paradox of Modernity''], Gholam Khiabany, Routledge, Sep 2009, page 163&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Colour television]] broadcasts first began in 1975, although reception was largely confined to affluent people able to afford colour sets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DuZtAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Iran%22+%22color%22+%22television%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22color%22+ ''Revolution in Iran: The Politics of Countermobilization''], Jerrold D. Green, Holt McDougal, 1982, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Regular colour broadcasts were introduced in 1976.&lt;ref name="EcoProfile"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aRa1AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22Iran%22+%22color%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22color%22 ''Iran: An Economic Profile''], Jahangir Amuzegar, Middle East Institute, 1977, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; The standard was changed to the French [[SECAM]] in February 1977, resulting in imported television sets becoming unusable.&lt;ref name="Almanac"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9ybVAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22International%22+%22Iran%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22NIRT%27s+new+international+services%22 ''Iran Almanac and Book of Facts''], Volume 16, Echo of Iran., 1977, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Although NIRT had the facilities to broadcast in colour, and used this when broadcasting the [[1974 Asian Games|Asian Games]] held in Tehran in 1974, full broadcasts in colour were delayed until 1978, on account of the ability of local manufacturers to meet demand for colour sets.&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first NIRT television network, known as the First Program, carried general content, of which only 33 per cent was imported, with the second network or Second Program aiming to show more educational and cultural content, of which 60 per cent of its content was imported.&lt;ref name="Small Media"/&gt; 

Although the International Program carried some programming devoted to Iranian culture and education, its output remained broadly similar to that of the AFRTS service it had replaced, with nearly all imported programs from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Zonis"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AG99BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22AFRTS%22%20%22Iran%22&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q=%22AFRTS%22%20&amp;f=false ''Political Elite of Iran''], Marvin Zonis, Princeton University Press, 1976, page 247&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast for eight and a half hours daily,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JkRHAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22NIRT%22+%22international%22++%22English%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22NIRT%22++ ''Overseas Business Reports''], United States.

===Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting===

After the [[1979 Islamic Revolution]], NIRT was renamed as صدا و سيمای جمهوری اسلامی ايران ''Seda va Sima-ye Jomhouri-e Eslami-ye Iran'' ("Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran"), known in English as [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] (IRIB), and under the new Constitution of the Islamic Republic, radio and television were to be "aligned with the course of perfection of the Islamic Revolution and served the promotion of Islamic culture, and to this end benefit from the health collision of different ideas and seriously avoid spreading and propagating destructive and anti-Islamic tenets".&lt;ref name="Shahidi2007p95"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MLLywtI-_n0C&amp;pg=PA95 ''Journalism in Iran: From Mission to Profession ''], Hossein Shahidi, Routledge, 2007, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[1998]], Iran changed from using [[SECAM]] to the [[PAL]] system developed in [[Germany]], and also used in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jdAmAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%221998%22+%22Iran%22+%22PAL%22+%22SECAM%22&amp;dq=%221998%22+%22Iran%22+%22PAL%22+%22SECAM%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxp-Hso9DeAhVJLsAKHZ5nANIQ6AEIODAD ''Iran Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Islamic Republic''], Volume 1, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite television==

As a result of IRIB's monopoly and censorship, satellite television channels, most notably [[Persian language]] ones based in [[Europe]] and [[North America]], have gained popularity in Iran.&lt;ref name="TPP"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2KKPAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=Iran%20revolution%20censorship%20television%20irib&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q=Iran%20revolution%20censorship%20television%20irib&amp;f=false ''Television and Public Policy: Change and Continuity in an Era of Global Liberalization''], David Ward, Routledge, 2009, page 297&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite the passing of a law in 1994 under which the use and ownership of satellite dishes was banned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/27/world/iran-prohibits-satellite-dishes-to-bar-us-tv.html Iran Prohibits Satellite Dishes To Bar U.S. TV], ''[[New York Times]]'', December 27, 1994, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the research centre of IRIB estimates that they were used by up to 70 per cent of Iranian households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran: Regime admits over 40% Iranians view satellite TV despite crackdown|url=http://www.ncr-iran.org/en/news/iran-resistance/14464-iran-regime-admit-over-40-iranians-view-satellite-tv-despite-crackdown|publisher=NCRI|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Wizard of Oz Club, Inc.,''' was founded during 1957 by [[Justin G. Schiller]], a then thirteen-year-old boy.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Michael Patrick, "Introduction", p. c.  In Baum, L. Frank (Hern, Michael Patrick, ed.) (Centennial ed. 2000),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=bpkVEAaUuMkC&amp;pg=PAcviii ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz''].  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The sixteen charter members, some of whom continue to make valuable contributions to the club, were garnered from the mailing list found among the papers of the recently deceased [[Jack Snow (writer)|Jack Snow]], with whom Schiller and the others had discussed the work of [[L. Frank Baum]].

The organization today has hundreds of members from all over the world, including children, adults who were alive when the books were still being published annually, ardent Baumists, Oz collectors, and those interested primarily in the classic [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|MGM movie]].

The society's major publication, ''[[The Baum Bugle]]'', began with Schiller duplicating issues on his parents' mimeograph machine. It is now published three times a year and has been recognized as a [[Academic journal|scholarly journal]] by the [[Modern Language Association]] since 1983. It has reached 159 issues as of Winter 2010, and its issues have more than doubled in size over the years, typically running to forty pages plus full-color covers.

Oz Club members originally organized three major [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] a year in the United States ([[Munchkin Country|Munchkin (east)]], [[Winkie Country|Winkie (west)]], and Ozmopolitan (central). The self-supporting events attracted members in that region of the country. Arriving with car loads of decorations, props, costumes, auction contributions and show-and-tell materials, attendees immersed themselves in a weekend of Ozzy camaraderie. The Convention names usually reflected geographical locations or citizens identified in the Oz books. There are also smaller gatherings, most frequently South Winkie, Quadling, and Gillikin or Ozcanabans. The last group met in the banquet hall of a restaurant in [[Escanaba, Michigan]], home of [[Fred M. Meyer]], a founding member who served for decades as the club's secretary. Meyer also mailed out an annual Christmas card to all members each year, often with ideas for new Oz books, until his health put him at [[emeritus]] status that lasted to the end of his life. As large public Oz festivals grew in popularity, IWOC conventions in the Midwest and East Coast lost much of their support base; fans found the guest speakers attractive and the flexible accommodations more affordable. The Ozmopolitan and Munchkin conventions could not be sustained, although the Winkie Convention, re-branded as OzCon International, remains a robust, vibrant fan event attracting attendees from around the world. The 54th OzCon International is scheduled for August 10-12, 2018, in Pomona, California.

Beginning in 2008, the Oz Club began to hold conventions with programs designed to appeal more broadly to the general public. They are frequently tied to geographic sites of special interest to Oz fans giving members a chance to visit these locations as a group. These national conventions will next be hosted in the Naperville, Illinois area from August 3–6, 2017. Information about all the conventions can be found at ozclub.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find an Oz Event|url=http://ozclub.org/find-an-oz-event/|website=ozclub.org|publisher=The International Wizard of Oz Club, Inc.|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable members of the Club past and present have included [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Willard Carroll]], [[Martha Coolidge]], [[Rachel Cosgrove Payes]], [[Martin Gardner]], [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]], [[Michael Patrick Hearn]], [[Eloise Jarvis McGraw]], [[Bronson Pinchot]] (who organized conventions in the 1970s), [[Edward Wagenknecht]], [[Eric Shanower]], [[John Fricke]], and [[Meinhardt Raabe]].  [[Frank Joslyn Baum]] was appointed the club's first president. Robert Allison Baum, Jr., a great-grandson of the author, currently serves on the board of directors.

The club has published many of Baum's rarer books, including ''Animal Fairy Tales'', ''Aunt Jane's Nieces'', and ''Twinkle and Chubbins''. It published two Oz books by [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]] and one each by [[Rachel Cosgrove]] and the team of [[Eloise Jarvis McGraw]] and [[Lauren Lynn McGraw]]. In 2000, it put out its first new Oz book not linked to the original series: [[Gina Wickwar]]'s ''The Hidden Prince of Oz'', with illustrations by [[Anna-Maria Cool]]. A Wickwar/Cool sequel followed in 2007, ''Toto of Oz.'' That same year it published ''The Collected Short Stories of L. Frank Baum.'' In addition, the Club has published a set of color-printed maps of The Marvelous Land of Oz and Countries Surrounding the Land of Oz, as well as new editions of short stories by L. Frank Baum and Ruth Plumly Thompson. Its best-selling publication is ''Bibliographia Oziana'' by [[Douglas G. Greene]] and Peter E. Hanff, which provides bibliographical descriptions of the original Oz series.

The Club owns a small but fine collection of original artwork and archival materials.

'''''The New Batman Adventures''''' (often shortened as '''''TNBA''''') is an American animated television series based on the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Batman]], and is a continuation of the 1990s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and is the final season of the series. It was produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and aired on [[Kids' WB]] from September 13, 1997 to January 16, 1999. The show lasted for 24 episodes, and was succeeded by ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. According to the reference book ''[[Batman Animated]]'', series writer [[Paul Dini]] originally wanted the new show to be titled ''Batman: Gotham Knights'', but this idea was rejected by the other producers. To better adhere with the prior DVD sets of the original series, the DVD release of this series was titled ''Batman: The Animated Series Volume 4 (From The New Batman Adventures)'' and was given the opening theme from the prior series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories in this series tend to give more focus to Batman's supporting cast, which include fellow crimefighters [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]], among others. The show also features guest stars such as [[Supergirl]], [[Etrigan the Demon]] and [[The Creeper (comics)|The Creeper]]; characters who would later appear with Batman in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In addition, the series takes place around the same time as ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. The 2001 video game ''[[Batman: Vengeance]]'' and its follow-up ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]'' are based on this series.

==Overview==
''The New Batman Adventures'' premiered on Kids' WB just two years after ''Batman: The Animated Series'' ended its original run on [[Fox Kids]]. The animation style was changed significantly from ''BTAS'' due to budgetary issues. The animators decided to make the show look more compatible with the smoother ''Superman: The Animated Series'' with which ''TNBA'' would air in tandem as part of ''[[The New Batman/Superman Adventures]]'' on Kids' WB.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} ''TNBA'' was later given the same opening theme of ''BTAS'' when aired in syndication.

The show had a significant change in focus from the original series, with episodes focusing less on Batman and more on the many characters that inhabited [[Gotham City]].&lt;ref name="WizReturns"&gt;{{cite news | last = Allstetter | first= Rob | date = August 1997 | title = The Dark Knight Returns | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art became more streamlined and darker with simpler color schemes, while the [[Art Deco]] and [[film noir]] imagery from the original series were replaced with a more modern look.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Batman was given a sleeker, brawnier appearance with an overall darker [[Batsuit#DC animated universe|costume]]; the golden ellipse surrounding the bat emblem on his chest and the blue highlights of his cape and cowl were both removed, which resembles his appearance in ''[[Batman: Year One]]''.&lt;ref name="WizReturns"/&gt; His gadgets and vehicles were given a sleeker, redesigned look with a more black color scheme. Bruce Wayne's appearance was also changed from the previous series; his hair was brushed back to highlight his face, with blue eyes instead of black, and his regular business suit was changed from brown to black. [[Kevin Conroy]]'s voice for Batman became more stern, as well as less distinguishable from his voice for Bruce than in the original series. The writers made an effort to keep Batman's dialogue as terse and grim as possible, in order to heighten the contrast between him and the lighthearted supporting cast.&lt;ref name="WizReturns"/&gt;

[[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]'s costume was changed to a look similar to her original outfit from her comic debut in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, which is now a black bodysuit with yellow gloves and boots. Producer [[Paul Dini]] said that Batgirl would appear in every episode of the new series because "[[Kenner Products|Kenner]] wants to do a line of toys, we're taking advantage of the publicity from her being in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', and we just love Batgirl".&lt;ref name="WizReturns"/&gt; [[Melissa Gilbert]] was replaced by [[Tara Strong]] as the voice of Batgirl. Strong would reprise her role over a decade later in another Batman animated television series, ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', and also on the DC Nation short ''Super Best Friends Forever'', ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' and in the animated feature ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', which reunited her with Conroy and [[Mark Hamill]].

[[Tim Drake]] was introduced as the new [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in the episode "Sins of the Father". However, Dini remarked that "the Tim Drake origin in the comics as written now didn't work for us with him having a father and living so close to Wayne Manor. It seemed to work fine in the comics, but we needed our own little family unit of Batman, Robin, Batgirl and occasionally Nightwing – and Alfred of course". For these reasons, the production team came up with their own origin for Tim Drake, though they later realized this new origin was extremely similar to [[Jason Todd]]'s.&lt;ref name="WizReturns"/&gt; Batman made a new suit which is similar to the first one worn by Dick Grayson and identical to Tim Drake's original Robin costume from the comics, but the color scheme was simplified to red, black and yellow, eliminating green entirely. The costume retained the familiar red short-sleeved shirt, as well as the black cape with yellow inner lining. New elements included black sleeves, gloves, trunks and boots with red leggings. The familiar [[domino mask]] had also changed, giving the new Robin a more wide-eyed, innocent look. The original costume worn by Dick Grayson was seen in "Old Wounds" and "Over the Edge".

[[Dick Grayson]], having abandoned his Robin persona as a result of a falling out with Batman, adopted the identity of [[Nightwing]]. Grayson's build became sleeker, with broader shoulders, showcasing his emergence as a mature hero in his own right. The short spiky hair that Grayson wore as Robin had grown longer, styled to flow down the back of the neck. In his civilian guise, he wore it in a ponytail. As Nightwing, he wore a V-shaped mask and an all-black unitard with light blue hawk emblem that borrowed some elements of the comics version from the 1990s. The costume also featured collapsible wings under the arms that allowed Nightwing to glide for short distances.

The designs of most of the villains from Batman's [[rogues gallery]] were also changed considerably, generally developing darker color schemes. Most controversial of the redesigns was that of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], whose white skin now had a bluish-gray tinge, while the eyes had their scleras removed and were replaced by cavernous black spaces with white pupils. The ruby-red lips were gone, focusing more attention on the teeth, and the green-tinged hair was almost completely black. His primary suit colors were changed from purple and yellow to purple and green (similar to his appearance from the Golden Age and Silver Age comics).

[[Harley Quinn]], [[Two-Face]], [[Clayface]] and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] were among the few characters who did not receive any drastic change in appearance or color alterations. Harley Quinn is also the only villain aside from the Joker who appeared in six or more episodes. [[Ra's al Ghul]] and his daughter [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]] also did not receive any drastic re-designs, although their only appearance during this time was in the episode "The Demon Reborn" from ''Superman: The Animated Series''.

The [[Kids' WB]] censors were much more flexible with episode content than the [[Fox Kids]] censors were with ''Batman: The Animated Series''. Producer [[Bruce Timm]] recounted that "when we were at Fox, after every single storyboard, we would get five single-spaced pages of notes on things we couldn't do. On the WB, we usually get maybe two paragraphs of stuff we can't do. At Fox, they were really picky, not just about things you couldn't do, but just in terms of content and story. They had a million opinions about what we should be doing. Nobody bothers us like that at the WB".&lt;ref name="WizReturns"/&gt;

'''''The Triumphs of Oriana''''' is a book of English [[madrigals]], compiled and published in 1601 by [[Thomas Morley]], which first edition&lt;ref&gt;http://eebo.chadwyck.com/search/full_rec?SOURCE=pgimages.cfg&amp;ACTION=ByID&amp;ID=V173820&amp;PAGENO=2&lt;/ref&gt; has 25 pieces by 23 composers (Thomas Morley and [[Ellis Gibbons]] have two madrigals).  It was said to have been made in the honour of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. Every madrigal in the collection contains the following couplet at the end: “Thus sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana: long live fair Oriana” (the word "Oriana" often being used to refer to Queen Elizabeth).

Recently, the attribution of "Oriana" to Elizabeth has come into question.  Evidence has been presented that "Oriana" actually refers to [[Anne of Denmark]], who would become Queen of England alongside James VI of Scotland (later [[James I of England]]) in an apparently failed early attempt to remove Elizabeth in order to restore England to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy L. Smith, "Music and Late Elizabethan Politics: The Identities of Oriana and Diana."  ''Journal of the American Musicological Society,'' vol. 58, pp 508-558 (Fall, 2005). &lt;/ref&gt;  In his book 'The English Madrigalists', [[Edmund Fellowes]], one of the leading madrigal scholars of the 1940s declared this theory to be false.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

'''Tropical Islands Resort''' is a tropical [[theme park]] located in the former [[Brand-Briesen Airfield]] in [[Halbe]], municipality in the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]] in [[Brandenburg]], [[Germany]], 50 kilometres from the southern boundary of [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Germany, a Fantasy Island |author=Scott Vogel |work=Washington Post |date=15 March 2009 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/13/AR2009031301241.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in a former [[airship hangar]] (known as the Aerium), the biggest free-standing hall in the world. The hall belonged to the company [[Cargolifter]] until its insolvency in 2002.

Tropical Islands has a maximum capacity of 8,200 visitors a day. In its first year of operation it attracted 975,000 visitors, according to the operators. The [[Tanjong]] company reported 155,000 visitors in the business year February 2004 to February 2005. Approximately 500 people work at Tropical Islands.

Tropical Islands has a world record for the largest indoor waterpark. It is bigger than [[Canada]]'s [[World Waterpark]] at [[West Edmonton Mall]].

==Location==
Tropical Islands is located approximately 60 kilometres south of the centre of [[Berlin]] and 50 kilometres from the southern boundary of the city. It is close to Briesen/Brand in the south of the municipality of [[Halbe]]. The theme park is on the site of the former Soviet airfield Brand, in the Aerium hangar.

==Access==
It can be reached by taking the A13 autobahn. It  can also be reached by train and the closest railway station is Brand Tropical Islands.

==Background==
In 1938, [[Germany]] began development of [[Brand-Briesen Airfield]] for the [[Luftwaffe]]. The [[Red Army]] overran the site in May 1945, and occupied the site after [[World War II]], adding a second runway and nuclear-resistant command and control facilities for the fighter aircraft regiment.

With the reunification of [[Germany]] in 1989/1990, the [[Soviet Army]] agreed to return all military bases by 1994. Returned to the [[Federal Government of Germany]] in 1992, [[CargoLifter|Cargolifter AG]] bought the former military airfield to construct [[airship]]s. They began development of a new construction hall, 360 metres long, 210 metres wide and 107 metres high, which cost €78 million. At 5.5 million m³ (194 million ft³), it is one of the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest buildings on Earth by volume]], and is the world's largest single hall without supporting pillars inside. The hangar was commissioned as an [[airship hangar]] named ''Aerium'' in November 2000, but the airship it was intended to house – the CL160 – was never built. CargoLifter went bankrupt in mid-2002.

==Concept==
[[File:Innenansicht im Tropical Islands.jpg|thumb|Tropical Islands Dome - Bird’s-eye view –inside-]]

Tropical Islands was built by the [[Malaysia]]n corporation [[Tanjong]] in the former airship hangar known as the Aerium.
The hangar – the third largest free-standing hall in the world – was originally designed to protect large airships from the elements. It was purchased by Tanjong on 11 June 2003 for €17.5 million, of which €10 million was a subsidy from the federal state of Brandenburg. The building permit for constructing the theme park inside the hall was granted on 2 February 2004 and Tropical Islands officially opened on 19 December 2004.

Inside the hall, the air temperature is 26 °C (78°F) and air humidity is around 64%. Tropical Islands is home to the biggest indoor rainforest in the world, a beach, many tropical plants and a number of swimming pools, bars and restaurants. It is open around the clock, every day of the year – except on Christmas Eve &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.travelcircus.de/wasserparks#platz8tropicalislands |title=Wasserpark Check |publisher=Travelcircus |language=German |accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On entering the hall, visitors choose between different basic admission options with different prices. Tropical Islands is divided into two main areas, each with its own admission price. Visitors can move from one area to the other by paying an additional daily charge. Additional charges also apply for areas such as the water slide tower, crazy golf course, African Jungle Lift, evening show and internal accommodation area. The entertainment programme comprises a gala evening show, smaller shows during the day and various events.

==Themed areas==
[[File:Tropical Islands Bali-Pavillon im Tropendorf.JPG|thumb|The Bali Pavilion in the Tropical Village]]

Tropical Islands has a number of different themed areas:
*''The Tropical Village'', featuring copies of traditional buildings from Thailand, Borneo, Samoa and Bali.
*''The Rainforest'', with around 50,000 plants and 600 different species, including some rare plants.
*''The Tropical Sea'', a {{convert|140|m}} pool with an area of {{convert|4400|m2}} and a depth of {{convert|1.35|m}}, designed to look like the waters of a coral island and a {{convert|200|m}} sandy beach.
*''The Bali Lagoon'', with an area of {{convert|1200|m2}} and a depth of less than {{convert|1|m}} in places, with fountains, a current canal, whirlpools and two water slides.
*''The Amazonia'', an outdoor area of over 35.000 square meters with two large pools, a sunbathing area, a beach volleyball and beach soccer field, as well as a kiosk. 

==Further development==
[[File:Wasserfall-Lodge im Tropical Islands.jpg |thumb|Tropical Islands Lodge]]

A 4,000 m² children's play area opened in 2007. In mid-2007, a sauna and spa facility with six separate areas was added, the largest tropical sauna complex in Europe. The design of the saunas is inspired by [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in [[South-East Asia]], including a cave temple on [[Elephanta Island]] in [[India]] and the [[Angkor Wat]] temple in [[Cambodia]]. The bathing area includes a 27-metre high [[water slide]] tower with four slides, a children's play area and a [[crazy golf]] course.

According to figures published by the company, Tropical Islands has spent EUR 23 million on further development and expansion work. The original total investment sum announced was EUR 75 million, including a EUR 17 million subsidy from the federal state of [[Brandenburg]]. The purpose of the subsidy for the development work was to preserve the 501 jobs.

In 2008, a campsite was added close to the Tropical Islands hall.

==Problems==
At first, visitor numbers remained behind original estimates. For a cost-effective operation, 1.25 million visitors per year are required.  In 2005, the resort lost between 10 and 20 million euros. By October 2006 there were about 600,000 visitors. The initial lack of visitors has been attributed to various reasons, including the relatively remote location of Tropical Islands. In addition, in Berlin, South Brandenburg, the direct surrounding area of the resort, the disposable income is below the national average. The target demographic of the resort was extended to attract visitors from further away, including [[Poland]].

By altering the ticket price structure and adding new overnight accommodation, visitors attendance has been improved.  According to the then managing director Ole Bested Hensing, 2008 was the first time Tropical Islands Resort made a profit. It recorded 300,000 overnight stays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-cottbus.de/archiv/Tropical_Islands_erwirtschaftet_Gewinne-134.html ''Tropical Islands erwirtschaftet Gewinne'' auf radio-cottbus.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start there were problems with the plants that were under the light-tight dome. In October 2005, the southern front along the "South Sea" bathing area had a special UV-transparent film made of [[ETFE]] installed. This 20,000 square metre "window" allows daylight. The palms, trees and bushes have grown well since.

The '''wardrobe supervisor''' is responsible for supervising all wardrobe related activities during the course of a [[Theatre|theatrical]] run. The modern title "wardrobe supervisor" has evolved from the more traditional titles of "wardrobe mistress/master" or "mistress/master of the [[wardrobe]]". The wardrobe supervisor may be present at some [[Theatrical production|production]] meetings and fittings, their primary responsibilities generally begin at the load-in stage of a production. At load-in physical custody and responsibility for the [[costume]]s shifts from the [[costume designer]] and shop staff to the wardrobe supervisor.

The wardrobe supervisor supervises all [[Dresser (theater)|dressers]] working on a production. In consultation with the [[production manager]], [[stage manager]] and sometimes the [[theatre director|director]], the wardrobe supervisor helps to coordinate and assign dressers to specific performers and tasks. They help determine where and how costume changes are made. Generally, the wardrobe supervisor decides whether a point in a production requires a quick change [[Theater (structure)#Basic elements of a theater structure|backstage]], or if there is time for a normal change in the dressing room. All dressers report directly to the wardrobe supervisor, who acts as primary liaison between dressers, the costumer, and stage management.

==Duties==
The wardrobe supervisor's primary responsibilities include:
* The care and proper maintenance of all [[costume]]s, shoes, [[undergarments]], hats and costume related personal props such as gloves, jewelry, [[parasols]], [[Fan (implement)|fans]] and pocket books. 
* To ensure the proper labeling, hanging, storage and preset of all costume pieces. 
* To create and execute a proper cleaning schedule for all garments, ensuring that [[laundry]] and [[dry cleaning]] are done on a regular basis between performances. They also coordinate the regular changing of [[dress shields]], the application of garment freshening sprays and providing clean undergarments to the performers. 
* To ensure that all costumes are properly pressed or steamed prior to each performance.
*The wardrobe supervisor also regularly inventories and inspects all costumes and coordinates all costume repairs. The majority of minor costume repairs are done on site at the theatre by either the Wardrobe Supervisor or in the cases of many regional theatres, the onsite wardrobe maintenance crew which is connected to the in house costume shop. Most repairs are considered "emergencies", however, and whenever possible they are done onsite at the theatre before and sometimes during the actual performance. The wardrobe supervisor's space in the theatre, with few exceptions, contains a [[sewing machine]], [[glue gun]], and all sewing supplies necessary for any type of emergency repair that could be required. Most wardrobe supervisors are very qualified [[seamstress]]es in their own right. The rule of thumb is that only in the case of very significant damage is a costume sent back to the shop for repair. The one exception to this rule are shoes. Although most supervisor's maintain a regular schedule for polishing and re-spraying of shoes, for safety reasons, actual shoe repair work is always sent out. 
*At the end of a production run, the wardrobe supervisor oversees all aspects of the costume strike. In the case of rented costumes, they coordinate restoring costumes to original condition. This includes ripping out hems or alterations that may have been done for fitting, and removing any added trim or ornamentation. Sometimes this work is extensive enough that the costumes are returned to either the designer's or theatre's shop for laundering and restoration. Regardless, the wardrobe supervisor is responsible for providing a complete and accurate inventory that ensures all pieces are returned.

A good wardrobe supervisor ensures that costumes look as fresh and new for the last performance as they did on opening night.
