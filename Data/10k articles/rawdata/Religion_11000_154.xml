== Nomenclature of the religions of the tribals of India ==
In the pre-Independence British era, the Indian government had recognized the distinctiveness of the religious beliefs of the Adivasi or the tribal people of India and had categorized it under the term '[[Animism]]'. The term Animism was re-purposed and made popular by the works of British anthropologist Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]].  Census records as early as 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Economics, Development, and the Quest for Alternatives: Essays in Honour of Professor M.A. Oommen|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fTvXY0V4tiYC|publisher = Concept Publishing Company|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 9788170226789|first = K. K.|last = George|first2 = V. Sankaran|last2 = Nair|first3 = Jose|last3 = Jacob|first4 = M. A.|last4 = Oommen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various ethnographic books by the Britishers show that a large chunk of the tribal population were followers of their traditional religion (recognized as Animism). The term 'Animism' was included in the census till 1931 after which, due to unknown reasons, its use was discontinued (some records show that Animism was there in the 1951 census). The post-Independence Indian Government abolished all the terms signifying the distinctiveness of the religious beliefs of the tribal people.&lt;ref name="theothermedia.in"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘Ghar Vapsi’ of the Adivasi is forcible ‘Conversion’ to Hinduism {{!}} The Other Media|url = http://theothermedia.in/?p=1031|website = theothermedia.in|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, tribal religious movements that intended to safeguard the belief system and identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bineet Mundu|url = http://www.tribalzone.net/knowledgebase/bineetmundu.htm|website = www.tribalzone.net|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the tribals continued at a regional level like the [[Donyi-Polo]] movement, [[Gondi people|Gondi]] movement, [[Khasi people|Khasi]] religion, [[Sanamahism|Sanamahi]] movement, Sari Dharam movement, [[Sarnaism|Sarna]] movement etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = tribal people say they do not wish to be classified as hindus - ucanews.com|url = http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/2003/05/22/tribal-people-say-they-do-not-wish-to-be-classified-as-hindus&amp;post_id=22507|website = ucanews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tribal assert for identity in India Census 2011|url = http://www.trust.org/item/20110222110800-0xsbn?view=print|website = www.trust.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a national level movement encompassing all the tribals was lacking. The early post-Independence literate tribals did feel a need for a national level movement in order to safeguard the religious beliefs of the tribals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q4S3-EecZbMC|title=झारखंड के अदिवासियों के बीच: एक एक्टीविस्ट के नोट्स|date=2008-01-01|publisher=भारतीय ज्ञानपीठ|isbn=9788126315673|language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The term 'Adi-Dharam' to denote nationally the belief system of the tribals was very much used among the literate tribals in the early post independence era as is evident from Shri [[Kartik Oraon|Kartik Oraon's]], (a tribal leader and the then State Minister of Aviation and Communication, Govt. of India) book ''Bees Varsh ki Kaali Raat'' (1970s)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Photos from Bees  Varsh Ki Kaali Raat's post - Bees  Varsh Ki Kaali Raat {{!}} Facebook|url = https://www.facebook.com/128139697521577/photos/pcb.128157790853101/128151940853686/?type=3&amp;theater|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he uses the word 'Adi Dharm' to denote the belief system of the tribals nationally.

The issue of the national religious identity of the tribals was powerfully reignited when in 2000, Ram Dayal Munda wrote a paper 'Adi-Dharam: Religious Beliefs of the Adivasis of India'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NEW BOOK: Adi-dharam, the religious beliefs of the Adivasis of India|url = http://adivaani.org/2014/12/21/new-book-adi-dharam-the-religious-beliefs-of-the-adivasis-of-india/|website = adivaani|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muṇḍā"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adi-dharam, Religious Beliefs of the Adivasis of India: An Outline of Religious Reconstruction with Special Reference to the Jharkhand Region|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_TluAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Sarini and Birsa, Chaibasa|date = 2000-01-01|first = Rāmadayāla|last = Muṇḍā}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper he argued for the distinctiveness of the belief system of the tribals and proposed that the term 'Adi Dharam' along with the regional term (Donyi-Polo, Gondi, Sanamahi, Sari, Sarna etc. in brackets) be included in the census survey which would include all the tribals who are still following their traditional belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jharkhand Tribals: Are They Really a Minority?|jstor = 4410103|journal = Economic and Political Weekly|date = 2000-12-30|pages = 4610–4612|volume = 35|issue = 52/53|first = Alexius|last = Ekka}}&lt;/ref&gt; This national identity, according to him, "''will strengthen their'' (the tribals') ''solidarity, which will be helpful for their security and progress"''.

== Distinctiveness of the Adivasi (Tribals) belief system ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
Ram Dayal Munda emphasized  the following points which are common to all the tribal people of India as well as of the whole world, regarding their religious beliefs:-.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Abandoning one religion and going to another is not solution'|url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/52182/abandoning-one-religion-going-another.html|website = Deccan Herald|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Universality, from Theory to Practice: An Intercultural and Interdiscplinary Debate about Facts, Possibilities, Lies and Myths : 25th Colloquium (2007) of the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QjwcT9aehuMC|publisher = Saint-Paul|date = 2009-01-01|isbn = 9783727816505|first = Schweizerische Akademie der Geistes-und Sozialwissenschaften|last = Kolloquium}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, in the Adivasi (Tribal) belief system&lt;ref name="theothermedia.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muṇḍā"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NEW BOOK: Adi-dharam, the religious beliefs of the Adivasis of India|url = http://adivaani.org/2014/12/21/new-book-adi-dharam-the-religious-beliefs-of-the-adivasis-of-india/|website = adivaani|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The socialized form of God is comparatively more intimate. The relationship between the grandparent/ grandchild is most endearing among the Adivasi people. God is bound through this kinship with the human kind. 
# The most distinctive forms of nature (hills, rivers, forest and others) are accepted as the best dwellings of God. The artificial structures – temples, mosques, churches and others – are not needed. 
# They believe in the eternity of the existence of human kind. This is reflected symbolically in the ritual of the return of the soul of the departed in the form of a shadow, prevalent among the Adivasi people in varying degrees. 
# In the Adi-Dharam belief system the individual is comparatively less afflicted with the notions of heaven and hell, merit and sin. A socially approved act is meritorious and an anti-social act is sinful. An individual does not go anywhere to heaven or hell; living within social norms is living in heaven and going against it is hell. 
# The individual has the relatively greater freedom of relating to God directly without the mediation of any go between (priest, pandit, maulvi, padre, etc.). The Adivasi religious performances are accomplished with a minimum of ritualistic paraphernalia. 
# The elements of creation have a symbiotic relationship among each other on the basis of equality and mutuality. The Adi-Dharam system does not have the audacity of declaring human kind to be the best in the entire creation and therefore has the right to control everything.
# Adi-Dharam is self-sprung along with the creation itself. It is timeless, not dependent on any avatar, messiah or paigambar/prophet.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

{{Hinduism}}
'''''Ahoi Ashtami''''' is a [[Hindu festival]] celebrated about 8 days before Diwali on Krishna Paksha Ashtami. According to Purnimant calendar followed in North India, it falls during the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]] and according to Amanta calendar followed in Gujarat, Maharashtra and other southern states, it falls during the month of [[Ashvin]]. However, it is just the name of the month which differs and the fasting of Ahoi Ashtami is done on the same day.

The fasting and puja on Ahoi Ashtami are dedicated to Mata Ahoi or Goddess Ahoi. She is worshipped by mothers for the well-being and long life of their children. This day is also known as Ahoi Aathe because fasting for Ahoi Ashtami is done during Ashtami Tithi which is the eighth day of the lunar month.

== Practices ==
On the day of fasting, after taking morning bath women take a pledge, called Sankalp, to keep the fast for the wellbeing of their children. It is also recited during Sankalp that the fasting would be without any food or the water and the fast would be broken after sighting the stars or the moon according to their family tradition.

Puja preparations are finished before sunset. Women either draw the image of Goddess Ahoi on the wall using [[Ochre|''geru'']] or embroider it on a piece of cloth and hang it on a wall. Any image of Ahoi Mata used for the puja should have Ashtha Koshthak i.e. eight corners due to the festival being associated with Ashtami Tithi. The image includes along with Goddess Ahoi, the images of and young children and ''Syahu'' (i.e. a porcupine). 

Then, the place of worship is sanctified with holy water and Alpana is drawn. After spreading wheat on the floor or on the wooden stool, one water-filled ''kalash'' (pot) is kept at the place of worship. The mouth of the Kalash is covered with an earthen lid.

A small earthen pot, preferably Karwa is kept on the top of the Kalash. Karwa is filled with the water and covered with its lid. The nozzle of the Karwa is blocked with the shoots of the grass. The commonly used shoot is known as Sarai Seenka which is a type of willow. The seven shoots of the grass are also offered to Ahoi Mata and ''syahu''. The shoot of Sarai is sold during the festival especially in the small towns of India. If grass shoots are not available then cotton buds can be used.

The food items which are used in Puja include 8 Puri, 8 Pua and Halwa. These food items are given to a Brahmin along with some money.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.drikpanchang.com/festivals/ahoi-ashtami/info/ahoi-ashtami-puja-vidhi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin tale==
There are many tales related to this observance and one of them is told just after the puja is done as part of the ritual.
  
Once upon a time, there lived a moneylender who had seven sons. One day in the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]], just a few days before Diwali festivities, the moneylender's wife decided to repair and decorate her house for Diwali celebrations. To renovate her house, she decided to go to the forest to fetch some soil. While digging the soil in the forest, she accidentally kills the young one of a porcupine with the spade with which she was digging the soil. The animal then curses her to a similar fate and within a year all her 7 children die.   

The couple unable to tolerate the grief decide to kill themselves en route to a final pilgrimage. They keep walking till they no longer able to and fall unconscious on the ground. God, on seeing this, feels pitiful for then and makes an [[Akashvani (term)|Akashvani]] asking them to go back, serve the holy cow and worship Goddess Ahoi as she was believed to be the protector of the offspring of all living beings. The couple feeling much better, return home.

They follow the divine command. When the day of Ashtami came, the wife drew the face of the young porcupine and observed fast and performed Goddess Ahoi. She honestly repented for the sin which she had committed. Goddess Ahoi was pleased with her devotion and honesty and appeared before her and gave her the boon of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indif.com/nri/kathas/ahoi/ahoi_ashtami_katha_1.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4061">{{Meso myth}}
'''Babylonian religion''' is the religious practice of  [[Babylonia]]. Babylonian mythology was greatly influenced by their [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] counterparts, and was written on clay tablets inscribed with the [[cuneiform script]] derived from Sumerian cuneiform. The myths were usually either written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. Some Babylonian texts were translations into Akkadian from the Sumerian language of earlier texts, although the names of some deities were changed.

Some of the stories of the [[Tanakh]] are believed to have been based on, influenced by, or inspired by the legendary mythological past of the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink= |author=Morris  Jastrow Jr. |title=Babylon |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=51&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Babylon |work= |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology and cosmology==
{{Main|Mesopotamian myths}}
{{Further|Enûma Eliš}}
Babylonian mythology is a set of stories depicting the activities of Babylonian deities, [[hero]]es, and [[mythological creature]]s. These stories served many social, political, ceremonial purposes, and at times tried to explain natural phenomena. 

Babylonian myths were greatly influenced by the [[Sumerian religion]], and were written on clay tablets inscribed with the [[cuneiform]] script derived from [[Sumerian cuneiform]]. The myths were usually either written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. Some Babylonian texts were even translations into Akkadian from the Sumerian language of earlier texts, although the names of some deities were changed in Babylonian texts.

Many Babylonian deities, myths and religious writings are singular to that culture; for example, the uniquely Babylonian deity, [[Marduk]], replaced [[Enlil]] as the head of the mythological pantheon. The ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', a [[creation myth]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] was an original Babylonian work.

[[Image:Detail Ishtar gate.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A relief image, part of the Babylonian [[Ishtar gate]]]]
Tablet fragments from the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian period]] describe a series of festival days celebrating the New Year. The Festival began on the first day of the first Babylonian month, Nisannu, roughly corresponding to April/May in the Gregorian calendar. This festival celebrated the re-creation of the Earth, drawing from the [[Marduk]]-centered creation story described in the Enûma Eliš.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Jane R. "Ancient Mesopotamia: New Perspectives". ABC-CLIO, Inc: Santa Barbara, CA, 2005. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of idols==
In Babylonian religion, the ritual care and worship of the statues of deities was considered sacred; the gods resided simultaneously in their statues in temples and in the natural forces they embodied. An elaborate ceremony of washing the mouths of the statues appeared sometime in the [[Old Babylonian period]].

The pillaging or destruction of idols was considered to be loss of divine patronage; during the Neo-Babylonian period, the Chaldean prince [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]] fled into the southern marshes of Mesopotamia with the statues of Babylon's gods to save them from the armies of [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Jane R. "Ancient Mesopotamia: New Perspectives". ABC-CLIO, Inc: Santa Barbara, CA, 2005. pp. 35-43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early phase==
In a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to take the religion to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;  The publication was delayed until 1919 in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919 after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 [[Shoghi Effendi]], then [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the religion, was the first Bahá'í to visit the area and then came again with his wife, [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]], in 1940-1. They visited the [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]], [[Matopos]], and [[Bulawayo]].&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt;

Early in 1953 Izzat'u'llah Zahrai from Iran attempted to settle in what was then [[South Rhodesia]] but his application for residency was rejected.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; Along with Zahrai, Claire Gung, Eyneddin and Tahirih Ala'i, (some from the United Kingdom),&lt;ref name="momen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/uk.htm |title=British Bahá'í History (1898-1930) |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206045054/http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/uk.htm |archivedate=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Kenneth and Mrs. Roberta Christian, American Bahá'í pioneers, were each credited with being [[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh]] for Southern Rhodesia&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; and were under strict instructions by the Guardian to attempt to spread the religion among the indigenous peoples, not the settlers. However the Christians knew Sylvia and "Sue" (Salvator) Benatar, who though [[Sephardic Jews]], became Bahá'ís after the Christians left Zimbabwe when they came in contact with Larry and Carol Hautz who were succeeding pioneers. Later Mrs. Benatar performed with [[Norman Bailey (bass-baritone)|Norman Bailey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Shulman Benata   | first = Sylvia   | title = Sylvia Schulman Benatar   pianist, South Africa.   | periodical = Arts Dialogue | publisher = The Bahá´í Association For the Arts | volume = pre-publication "Book on the arts"   | issue =    | year = 2003   | url = http://bahai-library.com/bafa/b/benatars.htm   | doi =    | id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hautz' established a motel, service station, and a snake farm for venom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Knoche   | first = Eldon   | title = Hautz left Milwaukee for faith, enterprises in former Rhodesia   | newspaper = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel    | date =  1999-03-04 | url = http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/1999/030499.html | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Bulawayo road just outside Harare. The school was initially for the 20 indigenous children of the staff, but it eventually expanded to a total enrollment of 400.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt;

The first indigenous person to accept the Faith was Morton Ndovi in January 1955 who soon pioneered to [[Bahá'í Faith in Malawi|Malawi]] and then [[Nyasaland]]. Other local people accepted the Faith soon afterwards, and in April that same year the first Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in [[Harare]] (then called Salisbury). The region was gathered together under a regional National Spiritual Assembly of South West Africa in 1956.&lt;ref name="africa"&gt;{{cite web | last =Hassall | first = Graham | title = References to Africa in the Bahá'í Writings | work = Asian/Pacific Collection | publisher = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies  | date = 2003-08-26 | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_africa_bahai_writings  | accessdate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first African woman to become a Baha'i in Zimbabwe was Mabel Chiposi, who accepted the religion in 1957.&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; Wide scale growth in the religion across [[Sub-Sahara]]n Africa was observed to begin in 1950s and extend in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Belial.jpg|thumb|300px|A woodcarving of Belial and some of his followers from a German edition of [[Jacobus de Teramo]]'s book ''[[Consolatio peccatorum, seu Processus Luciferi contra Jesum Christum]]'' (1473).]]

'''Belial''' ({{lang-he|בְּלִיַעַל}}) (also ''Belhor'', ''Baalial'', ''Beliar'', ''Beliall'', ''Beliel'', ''Beliya'al'') is a term occurring in the [[Hebrew Bible]] which later became personified as the devil&lt;ref name="earlychristianwritings.com"&gt;See the reference to "Beliar" in ''The Ascension of Isaiah'', at ''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ascension.html  EarlyChristianWritings.com]'', specifically at 1:8-9, 2:4, 3:11-13, 4:2, 4:14-18, 5:1, 5:15.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Floyd (2000). ''Minor Prophets: Volume 2'', p 46. [[Nahum]] "In late biblical times beliya'al came to designate a mythic personification of evil, and Belial thus became the name of a satanic figure... Two considerations militate against this sort of reading, one historical and the other grammatical. First, the mythic personification of Belial appears to have been a rather late development, and there is no good reason to suppose that beliya'al had assumed this meaning by the time Nahum was composed. There is no evidence of a satanic figure named Belial in biblical or extrabiblical literature from earlier than the third century BCE (T. J. Lewis, "Belial," ABD 1 :655-56), and most scholars would date the final edition of .."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==
''Belial'' (בְלִיַּעַל ''bĕli-yaal'') is a Hebrew word term "used to characterize the wicked or worthless." The [[etymology]] of the word is often understood as "lacking worth",&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Metzger &amp; Coogan (1993) ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', p 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  from two common words: ''beli-'' (בְּלִי "without-") and ''ya'al'' ( יָעַל "to be of value").

Some scholars translate it from Hebrew as "worthless" (''Beli yo'il''), while others translate it as "yokeless" (''Beli ol''), "may have no rising" (''Belial'') or "never to rise" (''Beli ya'al''). Only a few [[Etymology|etymologists]] have assumed it to be an invented name from the start.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=571&amp;letter=B JewishEncyclopedia.com: Belial]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word occurs twenty-seven times in the [[Masoretic Text]], in verses such as {{bibleverse||Proverbs|6:12|KJV}}, where the [[King James Version]] (KJV) translates the Hebrew phrase ''adam beli-yaal'' as "a naughty person".&lt;ref&gt;The Epistles to the Corinthians [Gr. text] with notes and ... - Page 131 Arthur Penrhyn Stanley - 1855 "The fullest description of a man of Belial in the Old Testament is in {{bibleref2|Proverbs|6:12-15|9|Proverbs, vi. 12 – 15}}. : " A naughty person (' Adam Belial'), a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. [13] He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hebrew text the phrase is either "sons of Belial" or simply "sons of worthlessness".&lt;ref&gt;"Reformed" Is Not Enough - Page 148 Douglas Wilson - 2002 "What are we to make of the phrase “sons of Belial”? In every instance of the phrase in the Old Testament, it always refers to members of the covenant whose lives were completely at odds with the terms of it, and whose hollowness was ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Exploring People of the Old Testament: Volume 2 John Phillips - 2006 "Eli's Sons Were Unregenerate (2:12) 1 Samuel 2:12 says, “The sons of Eli were worthless men,” or “sons of Belial.” We would say ... "&lt;/ref&gt; Phrases beginning with "sons of" are a common semitic idiom such as "sons of destruction", "sons of lawlessness".&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the New Testament use of the Old Testament Gregory K. Beale, D. A. Carson - 2007 "... "But as for you, come here, you sons of lawlessness Are you not children of destruction, a lawless seed?" Both phrases involve a Semitic idiom in which a generic personal noun ("son," "man," "master," etc.) followed by an adjectival genitive ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these 27 occurrences, the idiom "sons of Belial" (בְּנֵֽי־בְלִיַּעַל ''beni beliyaal'') appears 15 times to indicate worthless people, including [[Idolatry|idolater]]s (Deuteronomy 13:13), the men of [[Gibeah]] (Judges 19:22, 20:13), the sons of [[Eli (Biblical priest)|Eli]] (1 Samuel 2:12), [[Nabal]], and [[Shimei]]. The [[Geneva Bible]] (1560) uses "wicked," and at Jg 19:22 has the marginal note "''Ebr'' [Hebrew] ''men of Belial: that is, giuen to all wickednes.''" In the KJV these occurrences are rendered with "Belial" capitalised:
* "the sons of Eli were '''sons of Belial''' " (KJV)
In modern versions these are usually read as a phrase:
*"the sons of Eli were '''worthless men''' " (1 Samuel 2:12, NRSV and NIV)
*"the wicked men of the city" (Judges 19:22, NIV)

"Belial" is applied to ideas, words, and counsel,&lt;ref&gt;De 15:9; Ps 101:3; Na 1:11&lt;/ref&gt; to calamitous circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;Ps 41:8&lt;/ref&gt; and most frequently, to worthless men of the lowest sort, such as men who would induce worship of other gods;&lt;ref&gt;De 13:13&lt;/ref&gt; those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah;&lt;ref&gt;Jg 19:22-27; 20:13&lt;/ref&gt; the wicked sons of Eli;&lt;ref&gt;1Sa 2:12&lt;/ref&gt; insolent Nabal;&lt;ref&gt;1Sa 25:17, 25&lt;/ref&gt; opposers of [[God in Judaism|God]]’s anointed, David;&lt;ref&gt;2Sa 20:1; 22:5; 23:6; Ps 18:4&lt;/ref&gt; Rehoboam's unsteady associates;&lt;ref&gt;2Ch 13:7&lt;/ref&gt; Jezebel's conspirators against Naboth;&lt;ref&gt;1Ki 21:10, 13&lt;/ref&gt; and men in general who stir up contention.&lt;ref&gt;Pr 6:12-14; 16:27; 19:28&lt;/ref&gt; Indicating that the enemy power would no longer interfere with the carrying out of true worship by his people in their land, YHWH declared through his prophet: "No more will any worthless person pass again through you. In his entirety he will certainly be cut off."&lt;ref&gt;Na 1:15; see also 1Sa 1:16; 10:27; 30:22; Job 34:18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Temple period==
The term ''belial'' appears frequently in Jewish texts of the [[Second Temple]] period (texts classified by Christians as the Old Testament [[pseudepigrapha]] and [[apocrypha]]).&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; Also a large number of references to Belial are evidenced in the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at [[Qumran]] from 1948.

===Dead Sea Scrolls===
In ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness|The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1QM, Col. XIII (=4Q495 2), 10-12&lt;/ref&gt; one of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]], Belial is the leader of the Sons of Darkness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"You made Belial for the pit, angel of enmity; in darkness is his domain, his counsel is to bring about wickedness and guilt. All the spirits of his lot are angels of destruction, they walk in the laws of darkness; towards it goes their only desire."&lt;ref&gt;''The Dead Sea Scrolls: Study Edition'', Florentino García Martínez and Eibert J.C. Tigchelaar, [[Brill Publishers]], 1999, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Rules of the Community'', God is depicted as saying, "I shall not comfort the oppressed until their path is perfect. I shall not retain Belial within my heart."

The ''War Scroll'' and ''the Thanksgiving hymns'' both delve into the idea that Belial is accursed by God and his people, and shows how the existence of Belial in this world can be attributed to the mysteries of God since we can not know why he permits the dealings of Belial to persist.

In the ''Dead Sea Scrolls'', Belial is further contrasted with God. These are the Angel of Light and the Angel of Darkness. The Manual of Discipline identifies the Angel of Light as God himself. The Angel of Darkness is identified in the same scroll as Belial.

Also in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' is a recounting of a dream of Amram, the father of Moses, who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him. One is Belial who is described as the King of Evil and Prince of Darkness. Belial is also mentioned in the ''Fragments of a Zadokite Work'' (which is also known as The [[Damascus Document]] (CD)), which states that during the [[eschatological]] age, "Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through Isaiah the prophet."&lt;ref&gt;CD 4:13&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Fragments'' also speak of "three nets of Belial" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;CD 4:17-18&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel, as [[Mastema]] is. It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The ''Fragments'' also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a necromancer and wizard.

===Jubilees===
In the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[circumcision|uncircumcised]] [[Gentile]]s are called "sons of Belial".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/15.htm Jubilees 15:32]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs===
Belial is also mentioned in the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]. The author of the work seems to be a [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] because he presents Belial as God's opponent, not as a servant, but does not mention how or why this came to be. Simeon 5:3 says that fornication separates man from God and brings him near to Belial. Levi tells his children to choose between the Law of God and the works of Belial&lt;ref&gt;Levi 19:1&lt;/ref&gt; It also states that when the soul is constantly disturbed, the Lord departs from it and Belial rules over it. Naphtali&lt;ref&gt;2:6, 3:1&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts the Law and will of God with the purposes of Belial. Also, in 20:2, Joseph prophesies that when [[Israel]] leaves [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], they will be with God in light while Belial will remain in darkness with the Egyptians. Finally, the Testament describes that when the Messiah comes, the angels will punish the spirits of deceit and Belial&lt;ref&gt;3:3&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Messiah will bind Belial and give to his children the power to trample the evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;18:12&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|1="For many hath fornication destroyed; because, though a man be old or noble, it maketh him a reproach and a laughing-stock with Beliar and the sons of men."&lt;ref&gt;4:7-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ascension of Isaiah===
In the [[Ascension of Isaiah]], Belial is the angel of [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]] and "the ruler of this world", and identified as [[Samael]] and [[Satan]].&lt;ref name="earlychristianwritings.com"/&gt;

{{quote|And Manasseh turned aside his heart to serve Belial; for the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is Belial, whose name is Matanbuchus.|(Ascension of Isaiah 2:4)&lt;ref name="earlychristianwritings.com"/&gt;}}

==Christianity==
In the [[New Testament]] the word occurs once, when [[Paul the Apostle]] asks:
* "[W]hat concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?" ({{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|6:15|KJV}})

The spelling found in most manuscripts of 2 Corinthians is actually ''Beliar'' (Βελιάρ) not ''Belial'' (Βελίαλ). This is the reading preferred by textual scholars&lt;ref&gt;Metzger&lt;/ref&gt; and the change of -l to -r is attributed to a common change in Aramaic pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Forsyth ''The Old Enemy: Satan and the Combat Myth'' Princeton 1987 Page 201 "The form Beliar(c.g., 2 Cor. 6.15) is due to Syriac pronunciation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marvin R. Vincent]] (1834-1922) Word Studies in the New Testament Part Three - Page 325 - 2004 "The form Beliar, which is preferred by critics, is mostly ascribed to the Syriac pronunciation of Belial, the change of 1 into r being quite common."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Greek [[Septuagint]], later the Old Testament of the early Christian church, generally renders the "sons of Belial" verses in the Hebrew Bible either as "lawless men", by idioms "sons of the pestilence", rather than a personal name "sons of Belial.":
* ''andres paranomoi'' ("lawless men" ἄνδρες παράνομοι) (Deuteronomy 13:13)
* ''huioi loimoi'' ("sons of the plague" υἱοὶ λοιμοὶ) (1 Samuel 2:12)
The Septuagint also avoids Belial in the singular so [[Shimei]] (2 Samuel 16:7) when he cursed [[David]], "Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial" is rendered "you lawless man" (''paranomos''), and [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] to Eli "Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial" is rendered "don't count your maidservant as a daughter of the pest"&lt;ref&gt;[[Septuagint]] 1 Samuel 1:16 μὴ δῷς τὴν δούλην σου εἰς θυγατέρα λοιμήν ὅτι ἐκ πλήθους ἀδολεσχίας μου ἐκτέτακα ἕως νῦν "don't count your maidservant as a daughter of the pest"&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin [[Vulgate]]&lt;ref&gt;Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer - Page 471 Geoffrey Chaucer, Walter W. Skeat - 2008 "Belial signifies worthlessness ; and hence, lawlessness, or evil. But in the Vulgate version of Judges, xix. 22, the word Belial is explained to mean ' absque iugo ' ; which in O. French would become ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaucer name dictionary: a guide to astrological, biblical, ... - Page 169 Jacqueline De Weever - 1995 "The Parson quotes I Kings 2:12: filil Heli filii Belial, "the sons of Helie are the sons of Belial" "&lt;/ref&gt; and Syriac [[Peshitta]] Old Testaments in some cases follow the Greek, in other literalize as Hebrew. The single New Testament use is preserved "Belial" in Latin and Syriac.

===Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)===
In the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)]] of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], Belial was visible along with 666 [[fallen angel]]s when [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] was commanded by [[Jesus]] to show [[Hell]] to his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].

==Rabbinical literature==
The [[Talmud]] and rabbinical interpretation generally follow a non-supernatural view, an allegorical personification of evil, as with rabbinical interpretations of evil. The phrase "sons of Belial" from the [[Torah]] continued to retain currency.&lt;ref&gt;The censor, the editor, and the text: the Catholic Church and the ... - Page 218 Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin - 2007 "Yosef Hacohen does not mention the issue of the printers but writes that the event happened as a result of informants who were "people, sons of Belial from our midst." See the summary in Heller, Printing of the Talmud, 156-63. 49."&lt;/ref&gt;

==English literature==
*[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', Book I

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
BELIAL came last, than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd
With lust and violence the house of God.
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,
And injury and outrage: And when Night
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night
In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores
Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*John Milton, ''Paradise Lost'', Book 2
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
... On th' other side up rose
BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane;
A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd
For dignity compos'd and high exploit:
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear
The better reason, to perplex and dash
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the eare...
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Robert Browning]] (1839), "[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]", eighth stanza:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Or, my scrofulous French novel
   On gray paper with blunt type !
Simply glance at it, you grovel
   Hand and foot in BELIAL's gripe:
If I double down its pages
   At the woeful sixteenth print,
When he gathers his greengages,
   Ope a sieve and slip it in't?
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Occult==
The 17th-Century German [[grimoire]] ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' mentions Belial, as does [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[Goetia]]'' (1904) and [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' (1969). In ''The Satanic Bible'' (''The Book of Belial''), Belial means "without a master", and symbolizes independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment.

In 1937, [[Edgar Cayce]] used the term "sons of belial" and "sons of the law of one" for the first time in one of his deep trance readings given between 1923 and 1945. Cayce was often referred to as the "sleeping prophet" who gave over 2,500 readings to individuals while in a deep trance state.  While his definition of the sons of belial was consistent with the Hebrew meaning of "worthless" individuals focused on self-gratification, Cayce went on to use the term frequently to compare opposing human forces at work in pre-historical times related to the early development of [[Atlantis]].

==Popular culture==

The publishing of any "[[blasphemous libel]]" is a crime in [[New Zealand]] under Section 123 of the [[Crimes Act 1961]] which allows for imprisonment for up to one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329036.html |work=Crimes Act 1961| title=Section 123 Blasphemous libel| publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Section 123 protects all publications and opinions on any religious subject that are expressed in good faith and decent language against prosecution and specifies that prosecution may proceed only with the leave of the [[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney-General]].&lt;ref name=Ahdar&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahdar |first=Rex Tauati |year=2008 |title=The right to protection of religious feelings |journal=Otago Law Review |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=629–656 |url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/OtaLawRw/2008/4.pdf |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Origin of New Zealand blasphemy law==
The New Zealand offence of blasphemous libel originated in England with the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. All English common law offences were received into New Zealand law in 1840. In 1893, the New Zealand ''Criminal Code Act 1893'', based on the work of [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] and developments by George Burbidge in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Canadian ''Criminal Code, 1892'']], omitted the common law offence of blasphemy but retained the offence of blasphemous libel in section 133 with safeguards to prevent overuse and abuse of the law. Queensland followed seven years later with the ''[[Criminal law of Australia#Queensland|Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld)]]'' which abolished common law offences and omitted both blasphemy and blasphemous libel from the code. Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, who was responsible for the development of the [[Blasphemy law in Australia#Queensland|Queensland code]], stated that it did not include those provisions of English law which were “manifestly obsolete or inapplicable to Australia”.

The New Zealand ''Crimes Act 1908'' replaced the ''Criminal Code Act 1893'' and the 1908 Act was in turn replaced by the ''Crimes Act 1961''. Section 133 on blasphemous libel in the ''New Zealand Criminal Code Act 1893'' became Section 150 of the ''Crimes Act 1908'' and then Section 123 of the ''Crimes Act 1961'' with minor updating of the language. Section 6 of the 1893 Act and Section 5 of the 1908 Act abolished common law offences. Section 9 of the ''Crimes Act 1961'' expanded Section 150 of the 1908 Act to abolished all common law offences including blasphemy and blasphemous libel and any possibility of convictions under any Act of the Parliament of England, Great Brittan, or the United Kingdom; removing any ambiguity regarding the continual existence of common law offences in New Zealand. Section 123 of the 1961 Act does not define blasphemous libel or indicate the religion to which the law applies, leaving this to the common law.

== Religion to which the offences relate ==
In England, where the offences originated, the question was considered settled in 1838 by Gathercole's Case. Baron Charles Alderson, speaking for the court, declared that "A person may, without being liable to prosecution for it, attack Judaism, or Mahomedanism, or even any sect of the Christian religion (save the established religion of the country); and the only reason why the latter is in a different situation from the others is, because it is the form established by law, and is therefore a part of the constitution of the country".&lt;ref&gt;R v Gathercole (1838) 2 Lew CC 237 at 254, (1838) 168 ER 1140 at 1145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200203/ldselect/ldrelof/95/9515.htm Select Committee on Religious Offences in England and Wales First Report Appendix 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030905/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200203/ldselect/ldrelof/95/9515.htm |date=30 September 2007 }}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

As New Zealand, and other states and territories within the Realm of New Zealand, have never had an established religion it is doubtful that the offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were received into New Zealand or that Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961 can be applied in New Zealand.

The English blasphemy laws were also received into Australian law and the question of the religion to which the laws relate has been considered by Australian law commissions. Their findings are of direct relevance to New Zealand. In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission stated that "The law of blasphemy is an ancient common law offence constituted by the publication of material which provokes outrage in Christians by insulting, ridiculing or vilifying God, Christ or the Christian religion as practised in the Church of England".&lt;ref name="ALRC report 57"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/lawreform/ALRC/1992/57.html ''Australian Law Reform Commission report 57 – Multiculturalism and the Law, 1992''] [http://www.alrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/alrc57.pdf pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission added that "The common law offence of blasphemy applies only to scurrilous criticism of the fundamental tenets of the Church of England and other Christian denominations of coincident conviction. Such discrimination by the law in favour of a particular religion is itself an indicator of the need for review and possible reform."&lt;ref name="NSW Law Reform Commission"&gt;NSW Law Reform Commission: ''[http://www.lawreform.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/report_74.pdf REPORT 74 (1994) – BLASPHEMY]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in a report titled ''Article 18 – Freedom of religion and belief'' made use of the following definition: "Blasphemy is an ancient English common law offence defined as a publication containing contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ, the Bible or the formularies of the Church of England which are calculated to provoke outrage in the feelings of any sympathiser or believer in Christianity. A person who publishes any blasphemous document is guilty of publishing a blasphemous libel."&lt;ref name="AHREOC Article 18"&gt;Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report ''Article 18 – Freedom of religion and belief''.  [https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/content/pdf/human_rights/religion/article_18_religious_freedom.pdf pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This definition was approved in an obiter statement in Ogle v Strickland (1987) 71 ALR 4, per Justice Lockhart at page 52, who quoted the definition from ''Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law'' 9th edition, 1950, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Position of the Anglican church ==
The New Zealand law of blasphemous libel originated with the English common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel that were intended to protect the tenets of the Church of England, but the Church of England no longer supports the retention of these laws. At a meeting in the chapel of the Houses of Parliament in early 2015, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said that Christians must stand up for religious freedom of atheists and Muslims as much as themselves and that he was opposed to all restrictions on freedom of speech concerning religion which did not constitute hate speech. He thanked the former MP Evan Harris, a humanist, for his efforts to abolish the blasphemy laws in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11390652/Stephen-Fry-has-every-right-to-call-God-an-evil-monstrous-maniac-...-says-Archbishop.html| title=Stephen Fry has every right to call God an evil, monstrous maniac ... says Archbishop| first=John| last=Bingham| publisher=The Telegraph| date=4 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed by The Dominion Post on 8 May 2017, Anglican Archbishop Philip Richardson said the law against blasphemous libel was pointless, saying "My view is, God's bigger than needing to be defended by the Crimes Act". 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/92323066/surprise-as-public-figures-told-new-zealand-still-has-antiblasphemy-laws ''Surprise as public figures told New Zealand still has anti-blasphemy laws''] 9 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. Richardson, known as Bishop of Taranaki and Tikanga Pakeha Archbishop and Primate of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, said that he found it surprising New Zealand still had a blasphemy law in place. In a different interview he added: "It is an archaic and unhelpful law and it should be repealed. Freedom of speech is a fundamental of democracy, and indeed as any parent knows, freedom is a consequence of love."&lt;ref name="ACTfails"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/330374/act's-attempt-to-repeal-blasphemy-law-fails| title=ACT's attempt to repeal blasphemy law fails| date=9 May 2017| publisher=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law Commission reports ==
The New Zealand Law Commission has not given close consideration to the abolition of New Zealand's blasphemy laws. Law Commissions in England, where the laws originated, and Australia have however considered the question and recommended the abolition of all blasphemy laws.
===England===
In England, the continued existence of the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel was controversial. In 1985 the Law Commission published a report on ''Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship'', that recommended the abolition of all blasphemy offences. The report noted that "there is no one agreed definition of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and that it would scarcely be practicable, even if it thought desirable, to amend the common law definition by statute". The authors added that "it is now clear that none of the arguments for retaining a law of blasphemy are sufficiently strong to support this view and each of them is outweighed by other considerations which persuade us that a law of blasphemy is not a necessary part of a criminal code. Moreover, we have no doubt that any replacement offence which might be devised would in practice prove to be unacceptably wide in ambit." The Commission concluded, "that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement".&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission No. 145 ''[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/235882/0442.pdf Criminal Law: Offences against Religion and Public Worship]''. HC 442 1984–85.&lt;/ref&gt; These two offences were subsequently abolished in July 2008.

===Australia===
As Australian blasphemy law shares a common origin with New Zealand blasphemy law, Australian law commission reports are relevant to New Zealand.

In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission produced Report 57 on ''Multiculturalism and the Law'' which "considers the role of the common law offence of blasphemy in federal law". The Commission noted that as blasphemy is not specifically defined in any Australian legislation it must be assumed that the English common law definition of blasphemy applies.

The Commission considered Australia's international obligations under covenants and conventions to which Australia is a party: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression, the enjoyment of one’s culture, the profession and practice of one’s religion and the use of one’s own language in community with other members of one’s ethnic and religious community; and parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), undertake to guarantee the right of everyone to equality before the law and equality in the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of peaceful assembly and association.

The commission noted that blasphemy law provides only limited protection as religious affiliations are many and diverse. Although most Australians describe themselves as Christian, a growing minority (more than 300,000 in 1986) are members of non-Christian religious faiths, particularly Islam, Buddhism and Judaism, and that nearly two million Australians do not subscribe to any religion. The offence of blasphemy, however, protects only the Christian religion, with specific reference to the rituals and doctrines of the Anglican Church. Offences that involve the common law of blasphemy apply only to material that vilifies Christianity. This is not consistent with Australia’s human rights obligations.

The commission proposed that all references to ‘blasphemous’ material in federal law should be removed. The commission reported that "it is argued that extending blasphemy law to cover all religions would raise serious difficulties in defining ‘religions’ and ‘gods’, would have grave consequences for freedom of speech and might contribute to religious conflict. On the other hand, removing all references to blasphemy in federal law would have the effect of removing an apparently preferential position of one religion and moving towards a situation of parity between religions in federal law. For this reason it should be done. In so far as blasphemy causes hurt to a person’s sensibilities, the existing provisions on offensive behaviour and other public order offences are sufficient." The report concluded with the recommendation that the criminal law be amended so that "all references to blasphemy in federal legislation should be removed".&lt;ref name="ALRC report 57"/&gt;

====New South Wales====
In 1994 the New South Wales Law Reform Commission released a [[Blasphemy law in Australia#New South Wales|report on blasphemy]] after considering the law in New South Wales, other Australian states and territories, other jurisdictions in the region, the history of the law, international developments, [[freedom of speech]], and public submissions. After considering possible options, the Commission recommended that all blasphemy law be abolished without replacement. The Commission pointed out that every other law reform agency in Australia and in other common law countries which had considered the question had likewise recommended the abolition of the offence of blasphemy. The report with its conclusions and recommendation is equally applicable to other Australian states and territories.&lt;ref name="NSW Law Reform Commission" /&gt;

== Prosecutions in New Zealand ==
To date the only prosecution for [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] [[defamation|libel]] in New Zealand has been the  case of John Glover, publisher of the newspaper ''[[Maoriland Worker|The Maoriland Worker]]'' in 1922, although the poem was widely available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Troughton |first1=Geoffrey |title=The Maoriland Worker and Blasphemy in New Zealand |journal=Labour History |date=November 2006 |issue=91 |pages=113–129 |doi=10.2307/27516155 |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/91/troughton.html |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324095417/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/91/troughton.html |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown laid a charge of blasphemous libel over the 12 October 1921 issue of ''The Maoriland Worker'' which included two poems by British poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two War Poems|journal=The Maoriland Worker|date=12 October 1921|volume=12|issue=243|page=1|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=MW19211012.1.1&amp;e=-------10--1----0--|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged blasphemy was the closing lines of Sassoon's poem 'Stand-to: Good Friday Morning':

:O Jesus, send me a wound to-day,	 
:And I'll believe in Your bread and wine,	 
:And get my bloody old sins washed white!	

The case was tried in the [[High Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Maoriland Worker | date=23 February 1922 | publisher=Hawera &amp; Normanby Star | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=HNS19220223.2.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury returned a verdict of not guilty with a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]]: "That similar publications of such literature be discouraged".&lt;ref name=Ahdar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Tom | title=Flashback: The day a New Zealander beat blasphemy charges | date=13 May 2017 | publisher=The Dominion Post | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/92363230/flashback-the-day-a-new-zealander-beat-blasphemy--charges | accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Supreme Court was renamed the High Court in 1980. 

In 1998, the Crown decided not to prosecute [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa museum]] for displaying [[Tania Kovats]]' ''[[Virgin in a Condom]]'' and Sam Taylor Woods ''Wrecked'', a contemporary version of Leonardo da Vinci's, [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|''The Last Supper'']], which featured a topless woman at the centre of the table in place of Christ. &lt;ref name=Ahdar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caslon.com.au/blasphemyprofile5.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423064645/http://www.caslon.com.au/blasphemyprofile5.htm| archive-date=23 April 2013| dead-url=yes| title=Blasphemy| publisher=Caslon Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 123(4) of the Crimes Act 1961 requires the leave of the Attorney-General before charges of blasphemous libel can proceed. The Attorney-General usually refuses to pursue prosecutions on the basis of [[free speech]] objections as the right to free speech is protected by the New Zealand [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act 1990]].

== Censorship ==
Apart from the use of Section 123 of the Crimes Act 1961, attempts have been made to censor films and television programmes considered blasphemous using broadcasting standards and film censorship legislation such as the [[Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993]] and the [[Broadcasting Act 1989]]. 

[[File:Film Censor's Office Correspondence - Monty Python's Flying Circus (21875502775).jpg|thumb|Correspondence on whether ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979) should be banned in New Zealand for blasphemy.]]

The British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979) about a fictional Jewish man living at the same time and neighbourhood as Jesus Christ, generated significant international controversy and was banned in several countries including Ireland and Norway. Hundreds of letters were sent to the New Zealand Film Censor's Office to have the film banned in New Zealand as well on the grounds of it being 'blasphemous' against the Christian faith, but the Chief Censor of Films responded by stating that they had found no evidence of blasphemy or sacrilegiousness in the film.

In February 2006, the broadcaster [[CanWest]] screened the “Bloody Mary” episode of the [[South Park]] cartoon series featuring a [[Bloody Mary (South Park)|menstruating Virgin Mary statue]].&lt;ref name=Ahdar/&gt;. The following June, the Broadcasting Standards Authority responded to complaints by upholding CanWest’s right to broadcast the episode finding no breach of the Television Code of Broadcasting Practice. The High Court, considering an appeal by Bishop Denis Browne, in his capacity as the President of the Catholic Bishops Conference, affirmed the Broadcasting Standards Authority's decision in July 2007.

Dismissing the appeal in the High Court, Justice Wild said that he was “not prepared to second-guess the weight that the Authority accorded to the right to freedom of expression, relative to the right to respect for religious beliefs” and was not prepared to accept that the Authority was wrong to hold that the episode did not breach the standard of good taste and decency. Justice Wild noted that the four members of the Authority were unanimous and that the Conference’s sense of outrage was not shared by the wider community.

== New Zealand blasphemy law and the United Nations ==
New Zealand signed the ''[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]'' (ICCPR) on [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights#Parties to the Covenant|12 November 1968]], ratified it on 28 December 1978 and it came into force on 28 March 1979. This covenant is binding on signatory countries. The UN Human Rights Committee adopted ''General Comment 34''&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Committee [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf ''General Comment 34''], adopted July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2011 that stated in paragraph 48 that "Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant … ". 

New Zealand also signed the ''[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'' (ICERD) on the 25 October 1966 and ratified it on 22 November 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-2&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en United Nations Treaty Collection (ICERD)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195652/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-2&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Convention includes an individual complaints mechanism, effectively making it enforceable against its parties, and is monitored by the ''[[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]]'' (CERD). Parties to ICERD undertake to guarantee the right of everyone to equality before the law and equality in the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion and expression. 

New Zealand laws that prohibit "blasphemous libel" and "denigration of religion" contravene international law, are discriminatory, and contravene New Zealand's obligations under both the ICCPR and ICERD.&lt;ref name="ALRC report 57"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/lawreform/ALRC/1992/57.html ''Australian Law Reform Commission report 57 – Multiculturalism and the Law, 1992''] [http://www.alrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/alrc57.pdf pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed repeal of law==
In May 2017 an amendment to the omnibus Statutes Repeal Bill 2016 was tabled to repeal Section 123 of the Crimes Act,&lt;ref name="ACTfails" /&gt; however it was voted down by one vote on the basis that the matter should be considered separately from that bill in order to allow public submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National, Maori Party vote down repeal of blasphemy law |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11862579 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=24 May 2017 |accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 a Crimes Amendment Bill was introduced that would repeal the law against blasphemous libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Justice Minister moves on year and day rule |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1803/S00326/justice-minister-moves-on-year-and-day-rule.htm |newspaper=Scoop |date=28 March 2018 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Rosenkreuz''' (also spelled '''Rosenkreutz''' and '''Christian Rose Cross''') is the legendary, possibly [[Allegory|allegorical]], founder of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian Order]] (Order of the [[Rose Cross]]). He is presented in three [[manifesto]]s that were published early in the 17th century. These were:

*''[[Fama Fraternitatis]]'' (published 1614 in [[Kassel]], Germany) This manifesto introduced the founder, "Frater C.R.C."
*''[[Confessio Fraternitatis]]'' (published 1615 in [[Kassel]], Germany) 
*''[[The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]]'' (published 1616 in [[Strasbourg|Strasbourg, Germany]]).

==Legend==
[[File:Prosphil.jpg|thumb|right|Frater C.R.C. – Christian Rose Cross (symbolical representation)]]
According to [[legend]], Christian Rosenkreuz was a doctor who discovered and learned [[esoteric]] wisdom on a pilgrimage to the Middle East among Turkish, [[Arab]] and [[Persia]]n sages, possibly [[Sufism|Sufi]] or [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] masters, supposedly in the early 15th century (see [[#Symbolism of the numbers in the Manifestos|§&amp;nbsp;Symbolism of the numbers in the Manifestos]]); returned and founded the "Fraternity of the Rose Cross" with himself (Frater C.R.C.) as Head of the Order. Under his direction a Temple, called [[Sanctus Spiritus]], or "The House of the Holy Spirit", was built.

It is described that his body, as discovered by a Brother of the Order, was in a perfect state of preservation 120 years after his death (which occurred in absolute secrecy) – as Rosenkreuz had predicted — in a [[heptagon]]al chamber erected by himself as a storehouse of knowledge. It is described that on the [[Sarcophagus]] in the centre of the Crypt of Christian Rosenkreutz were written, among other inscriptions the words, "Jesus mihi omnia, nequaquam vacuum, libertas evangelii, dei intacta gloria, legis jugum" ("Jesus is everything to me, by no means empty, the freedom of the [[gospel]], the untouched glory of God, the yoke of the law"), testifying to the builder's Christian character.

Rosenkreuz's [[crypt]], according to the description presented in the [[legend]], is located in the interior of the Earth, recalling the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] motto V.I.T.R.I.O.L.:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem ("Visit the interior of the Earth; by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone").

==Biographies==
[[Image:Count of St Germain.jpg|thumb|right|Count of St. Germain by unknown artist]]
According to some researchers, Christian Rosenkreuz was the last descendant of the [[Germelshausen]], a German family which flourished in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Magre (1877–1941). ''Magicians, Seers, and Mystics''&lt;/ref&gt; Their castle stood in the [[Thuringian Forest]] on the Border of [[Hesse]] and they had embraced Albigensian (i.e., [[Catharism|Cathar]]) doctrines, combining Gnostic and Christian beliefs. The whole family was put to death by [[Konrad von Marburg]] except for the youngest son, who was only five years old. He was carried away secretly by a monk who was an Albigensian adept from [[Languedoc]]. The child was placed in a monastery which had already come under the influence of the Albigenses, where he was educated and made the acquaintance of the four other brothers who were later to be associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. His account derives from oral tradition.

Some [[Occultism|occultists]] including [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Max Heindel]]&lt;ref&gt;Max Heindel, ''[http://rosicrucianzine.tripod.com/christian_rosenkreuz.htm Christian Rosenkreuz and the Order of Rosicrucians]'', 1909&lt;/ref&gt; and (much later) [[Guy Ballard]], have stated that Rosenkreuz later reappeared as the [[Count of St. Germain]], a [[courtier]], adventurer and [[Alchemy|alchemist]] who reportedly died on 27 February 1784. Steiner once identified Rembrandt's painting "[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Rembrandt_Man_in_Armour.jpg A Man in Armour]" as a portrait of Christian Rosenkreuz, apparently in a 17th-century manifestation. Others believe Rosenkreuz to be a pseudonym for a more famous historical figure, usually [[Francis Bacon]]. Steiner gave lectures on Rosenkreutz and Rosicrucianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA109/English/AP1978/RosEso_index.html|title=Rosicrucian Esotericism|date=1978|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism of the numbers in the Manifestos==
[[File:Rose_Cross.png|thumb|right|The [[Rose Cross]], the central symbol to all groups embracing the philosophy of the Rosicrucians.]]
The legend presented in the Manifestos has been interpreted symbolically (as were all [[hermeticism|hermetic]] and [[alchemy|alchemical]] texts of those times). They do not directly state Christian Rosenkreuz's years of birth and death, but in two sentences in the [[Confessio Fraternitatis|second Manifesto]] the year 1378&lt;ref&gt;"''from the year of Our Lord 1378 (in which year our Christian Father was born)''", in Confessio Fraternitatis&lt;/ref&gt; is presented as being the birth year of "our Christian Father", and it is stated that he lived for 106 years, which would mean he died in 1484.&lt;ref&gt;"''in these one hundred and six years'' [1484?] ''of his life''", Idem&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of the Order can be supposed in similar terms to have occurred in the year 1407.  However, these numbers (and deduced years) are not taken literally by many students of [[occultism]], who consider them to be allegorical and symbolic statements for the understanding of the [[Initiation|Initiated]]. The justification for this relies on the Manifestos themselves: on the one hand, the Rosicrucians clearly adopted through the Manifestos the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects, and, on the other hand, they directly state, "We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Confessio Fraternitatis]], the second Rosicrucian Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphorical nature of these legends lends a nebulous quality to the origins of Rosicrucianism. The opening of Rosenkreuz's tomb is thought to be a way of referring to the cycles in [[nature]] and to [[cosmos|cosmic]] events; and as well, to the opening of new possibilities for mankind consequent on the advances of the 16th and early 17th centuries. Similarly, Rosenkreuz's pilgrimage seems to refer to the transmutation steps of the [[Philosophers' stone|Great Work]].

Similar legends may be found in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s description of the [[Holy Grail]] as the "Lapis Exillis", guarded by the [[Knights Templar]], or in the [[Philosophers' stone]] of the alchemists, the "Lapis Elixir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ralls, Karen |title=The Templars and the Grail: knights of the quest |publisher=Quest Books/Theosophical Pub. House |year=2003 |page=135 |isbn=0-8356-0807-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist culture''' is exemplified through [[Buddhist art]], [[Buddhist architecture]], [[Buddhist music]] and [[Buddhist cuisine]]. As Buddhism expanded from the [[Indian subcontinent]] it adopted artistic and cultural elements of host countries in other parts of [[Asia]].

==Features of Buddhist culture==

=== Buddhist Economics ===
Economics or the way in which work life is organized and the demands of production are met form an integral part of any culture. Buddhist economics forms an integral part of the Buddhist culture. Buddhist Economics does not work to maximise consumption but human well-being, which lies in a simple, purposeful and dutiful life, in which rightful livelihood is earned. Human beings must remain true to their heritage and avoid materialistic pursuit. Mechanical and redundant work that deprives the soul of meaningful pursuit is looked down upon, while too much leisure also is not approved of. Women becoming part of the active workforce is considered failure of the economic system, as women have to leave looking after the children to indulge in economic way-fare, while the children are untended for.

=== Buddhism and healthcare ===
For Buddhism, mental health is of supreme importance and individuals must strive towards improving this by practicing non-violence and refraining from sexual misconduct and lying. However, Buddhist traditions do acknowledge physical ill-being. Pain and suffering are inevitable like death, for which taking any form of medication are not prohibited. The medicines taken should not be intoxicating or affect the clarity of mind any way. Any physical ill-being must be endured with patience and steadfastness, as any form of physical suffering allows time for self-reflection and spiritual progress. The best way to cure a disease is to improve one’s diet by practicing vegetarianism, reflective of the non-violent way of living. Buddhism also lays great stress on fasting on special days which helps revitalize the physical and spiritual being. Any form of organ transplant has been viewed as a supreme form of generosity as well.

===Buddhist art===
{{Main|Buddhist art}}
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist art}}
''Buddhist art'' originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the centuries following the life of the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of [[Asia]] and the world.
A first, essentially Indian, ''aniconic phase'' (avoiding direct representations of the Buddha), was followed from around the 1st century CE by an ''[[icon]]ic phase'' (with direct representations of the Buddha). From that time, Buddhist art diversified and evolved as it adapted to the new countries where the faith was expanding. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and [[Islam]].

In the earliest form of Buddhist art, the Buddha was not represented in human form but instead was represented using signs and symbols such as footprints or an empty throne. From the fifth century B.C. to the first century B.C., Indian artists would make scriptures which revolved around the themes of the historical life of the Buddha and the previous lives of the Buddha.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/budd/hd_budd.htm|title=Buddhism and Buddhist Art {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Dehejia|first=Author: Vidya|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), is believed to be connected 70 Buddha’s sayings that disfavoured representations of himself after the extinction of his body.{{cn|date=April 2018}} This phase is defined as the aniconic phase of Buddhist art. The iconic phase starts from the 1st century CE whereby the Buddha was given realistic human features and proportions.

===Buddhist architecture===
{{Main|Buddhist architecture}}
''Buddhist religious architecture'' most notably developed in [[South Asia]] in the third century BCE.

Two types of structures are associated with early [[Buddhism]]: [[stupas]] and [[viharas]]. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into [[chaitya]]-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] ([[Maharashtra]]). Viharas were developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalised Buddhist [[monasticism]]. An existing example is at [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], ([[Bihar]]).

The beginnings of the Buddhist school of architecture can be traced back to B.C. 255 when the Mauryan emperor Asoka established Buddhism as the state religion of his large empire and encouraged the use of architectural monuments to spread Buddhism in different places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/buddhism-information/buddhist-architecture.html|title=The Buddhist Architecture, Information on Buddhist Architecture,      Guide to Buddhist Architecture, Buddhist Tourism|website=www.buddhist-tourism.com|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism, which is also the first Indian religion to require large communal and monastic spaces, inspired three types of architecture; the first is the stupa, a significant object in Buddhist art and architecture. The Stupas hold the most important place among all the earliest Buddhist sculptures. On a very basic level, the Stupa is a burial mound for the Buddha. The original stupas contained the Buddha's ashes. Stupas are dome-shaped monuments, used to house Buddhists' relics or to commemorate significant facts of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-asia/beginners-guide-asian-culture/buddhist-art-culture/a/buddhist-monasteries|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of architecture unique to Buddhism is the ''Vihara'', a Buddhist monastery that also contains a residence hall for the monks. The third type is the ''chaitya'', an assembly hall that contains a stupa (without relics). The central hall of the ''chaitya'' is arranged to allow for circumambulation of the stupa within it.

===Buddhist music===
{{Main|Buddhist music}}
''Buddhist music'' prominently includes [[Honkyoku]], [[Buddhist chant]], and [[Shomyo]]. Honkyoku are the pieces of [[shakuhachi]]yoku for enlightenment and alms as early as the 13th century.

[[Buddhist chant]] is the [[chant]] used in or inspired by Buddhism, including many genres in many cultures. It includes:
* [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|Repetition]] of the name of [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] in [[Pure Land Buddhism]].
* Shomyo in [[Japanese music|Japanese]] Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.
* [[Overtone singing|Throat singing]] in [[Music of Tibet|Tibetan]] Buddhist chant (one aspect of [[Music of Tibet|Tibetan Buddhist music]])

Musical chanting, most often in Tibetan or Sanskrit, is an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables.

Shomyo (声明) is a style of Japanese [[Buddhist chant]]; mainly in the Tendai and Shingon sects. There are two styles: ryokyoku and rikkyoku, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.

Many ritual musical instruments are used in association with Buddhist practice including [[singing bowls]], [[bell (instrument)|bells]], [[tingsha]], drums, cymbals, wind instruments and others.

The relationship between Buddhism and music is thought to be complicated since the association of music with earthly desires led early Buddhists to condemn the musical practice, and even observation of musical performance, for monks and nuns. However, in Pure Land Buddhism Buddhist paradises are represented as musical places in which Buddhist law takes the form of melodies. Most Buddhist practices also involve chant in some form, and some also make use of instrumental music and even dance. Music can act as an offering to the Buddha, as a means of memorizing Buddhist texts, and as a form of personal cultivation or meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0136.xml|title=Buddhism and Music - Buddhism - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to purify the hearts of listeners, Buddhist melodies are strong yet soft and pure. Buddhist music plays a central role in everyday cultural practices of Buddhists since it is also played in many ceremonies such as weddings and funerals&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sacredmusicradio.org/buddhist-sacred-music/|title=Buddhist Sacred Music {{!}} Sacred Music Radio|date=2013-08-30|work=Sacred Music Radio {{!}} Peace &amp; Relaxation Through Music|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist music developed when Buddhism spread to Tibet. The Tibetan traditions of Buddhism encouraged the use of song and dance in certain ceremonies. A wide variety of instruments such as specialized types of drums, windpipes, spiral conches, and trumpets were used in larger ceremonies.

Hymns are commonly used in the Buddhist culture in ceremonies for making offerings or inviting the presence of Buddha and Bodhisattvas. Buddhist hymns express the five virtuous qualities that are sincerity, elegance, clarity, depth, and equanimity and it is believed that regularly listening to Buddhist hymns or fanbei can give the following five graces: a reduction in physical fatigue, less confusion and forgetfulness, a reduction in mental fatigue, greater eloquence, and greater ease in expression and communication. Therefore, in the practice of Buddhism, hymns or fanbei have an important role in daily living, for example in repentance ceremonies. They are not designed to try to elevate or excite the emotions of participants or practitioners, but in fact aim to help conserve emotional energy, calm the thinking, lessen desire, and allow practitioners to see their true nature with clarity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Buddhist cuisine===
{{Main|Buddhist cuisine|Vegetarianism in Buddhism}}
Buddhist cuisine is a kind of [[cuisine]] mainly for the believers of [[Buddhism]]. It is known as '''zhāi&amp;nbsp;cài''' (''zhāi'' means "purification" or "discipline", ''cai'' means "cuisine" or "vegetable") in [[China]], and '''shōjin&amp;nbsp;ryōri''' (''shōjin'' means "devotion", ''ryōri'' means "cuisine") in [[Japan]], and by many other names in other countries. Due to the understanding of animals as conscious and suffering beings, many Buddhists do not kill animals and many also do not eat [[meat]] (other than that from those who died naturally, and from species where the consumption of brethren is not troubling to the still living). Certain major Mahayana sutras show the Buddha forcefully denouncing meat-consumption and advocating vegetarianism ([[vegetarianism in Buddhism]]). Some [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhists in [[China]] and [[Vietnam]] also avoid eating strong-smelling plants such as [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[chives]], [[shallot]], and [[leek (vegetable)|leek]], and refer to these as ''wu hun'' (五葷, 'Five Spices'). Buddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], also known as "seitan" or "wheat meat", [[soy]] (such as [[tofu]] or [[tempeh]]), [[agar]], and other [[plant]] products.  Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined [[meat analogue]]s in the world.

Buddhism forbids alcohol and other intoxicants because they may result in violations of others of the "Five Moral Precepts": no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying or partaking of intoxicants. In addition, intoxicants cloud the mind and interfere with the concentration needed to achieve enlightenment.

Some Buddhist sects in China and Vietnam are forbidden onions, garlic, scallions, chives and leeks, which are known as "the five pungent spices". The spices are said to lead to anger (raw) and passion (cooked), and their odour is also said to repel Gods and attract hungry ghosts and demons.

Strict adherence to vegetarianism is the rule for priests, monks, nuns and those who feel they are on the Bodhisattva path - except in some schools and sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clovegarden.com/diet/buddha.html|title=Buddhist Dietary Customs|website=www.clovegarden.com|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist festivals===
{{Main|List of Buddhist festivals|Buddhist holidays}}
[[Japanese festivals]] and [[Barua festivals]] often involve [[Buddhist culture]], as do [[pagoda festival]]s held as [[fairs]] held at [[List of Buddhist temples|Buddhist temples in Myanmar]]. Features of Buddhist [[Tibetan festivals]] may include the traditional [[cham dance]], which is also a feature of some Buddhist festivals in [[India]] and [[Bhutan]]. Many [[festivals of Nepal]] are religious festivals involving Buddhism, as are many [[List of Burmese traditional festivals|Burmese traditional festivals]]. [[Lunar New Year]] festivals of Buddhist countries in East, South and Southeast Asia include some aspects of Buddhist culture, however they are considered cultural festivals as opposed to religious ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3422">The '''culture of Odessa''' is a unique blend of [[Russian culture|Russian]], [[Yiddish culture|Yiddish]], and [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] cultures, and [[Odessa]] itself has played a notable role in Russian and Yiddish folklore.&lt;ref name=Rothstein&gt;Robert A. Rothstein, "How It Was Sung in Odessa: At the Intersection of Russian and Yiddish Folk Culture", ''[[Slavic Review]],'' vol. 60, no. 4 (2001), pp. 781-801 {{doi|10.2307/2697495}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Dialects==
The [[Russian language]] as spoken in Odessa is influenced by [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] in [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], and [[phraseology]]. As a result, many phrases sound inherently and uniquely humorous to Russian speakers and constitute a staple of Odessa humour. Also, the Odessa dialect of Yiddish has plenty of [[Russianism]]s.&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;

==Cultural image of Odessa==
To a significant extent the image of Odessa in [[Russophone]] culture is influenced by ''[[The Odessa Tales]]'' of [[Isaak Babel]]. Odessa is often referred to by the [[collocation]] "Odessa Mama" (Mom Odessa), a term that originated in Russian criminal (''[[blatnoy]]'') subculture.&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt; The reputation of the city as a criminal center originated in [[Imperial Russia]]n times and the early [[Soviet era]], and is similar to the reputation of [[Al Capone]] era [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=sylvester&gt;Roshanna P. Sylvester, " Tales of Old Odessa: Crime and Civility in a City of Thieves" (2005) {{ISBN|0-87580-346-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odessa humor==
Odessa humor is a notable part of both [[Jewish humor]] and [[Russian humor]].{{fact|date=December 2013}}

Since 1972 Odessa has been hosting the annual festival of humor, [[Humorina]]. For this and other reasons  Odessa was known as the "capital of humor" in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=edW4AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0+%D1%8E%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%22&amp;dq=%22%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0+%D1%8E%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%22&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11124">'''[[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]]''' is an important topic in Buddhist thought. The concept may have been of minor importance in early Buddhism, and various interpretations have evolved throughout time. A main problem in Buddhist philosophy is how karma and rebirth are possible, when there is no self to be reborn, and how the traces or "seeds" of ''karma'' are stored throughout time in consciousness.

==Vedic religion==
The concept of ''karma'' originated in the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], where it was related to the performance of rituals{{sfn|Samuel|2010}} or the investment in good deeds{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=78}} to ensure the entrance to heaven after death,{{sfn|Samuel|2010}}{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=78}} while other persons go to the underworld.{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=78}}

==Early Buddhism==
The concept of karma may have been of minor importance in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986}} Schmithausen has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism,{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=13}} noting that "the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology."{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986|p=206-207}} Langer notes that originally karman may have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth.{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26}}{{refn|group=note|Langer: "When I was searching the Sanskrit texts for material, two things become apparent: first, rebirth, central as it is to Indian philosophy, is not found in the earliest texts; and second, rebirth and karman do not appear to be linked together from the beginning. In fact, originally karman seems to have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth, but in the course of time it proved to be more popular than others. One of these ‘other concepts’ linked with rebirth is a curious notion of ‘rebirth according to one’s wish’, sometimes referred to in the texts as kAmacAra. The wish — variously referred to in the texts as kAma or kratu — is directed to a particular form or place of rebirth and can be spontaneous (at the time of death) or cultivated for a long time. This understanding seems to have some affinity with the Buddhist notion that a mental effort, a positive state of mind, can bring about a good rebirth."{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26}}}} Tillman Vetter notes that in early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}} Buswell too notes that "Early Buddhism does not identify bodily and mental motion, but desire (or thirst, ''trsna''), as the cause of karmic consequences."{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=416}} Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka,{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}} which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}}

According to Vetter, the "Buddha at first sought, and realized, [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Ideas and practices|"the deathless"]] (''amata/amrta''{{refn|group=note|Stanislaw Schayer, a Polish scholar, argued in the 1930s that the Nikayas preserve elements of an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs,{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Ray|1999}} and survived in the Mahayana tradition.{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}}{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} According to Schayer, one of these elements is that Nirvana was conceived as the attainment of immortality, and the gaining of a deathless sphere from which there would be no falling back.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=374-377}} According to Falk, in the precanonical tradition, there is a threefold division of reality, the third realm being the realm of nirvana, the "amrta sphere," characterized by prajna. This nirvana is an "abode" or "place" which is gained by the enlightened holy man.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=375}} According to Falk, this scheme is reflected in the precanonical conception of the path to liberation.{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} The nirvanic element, as an "essence" or pure consciousness, is immanent within samsara. The three bodies are concentric realities, which are stripped away or abandoned, leaving only the nirodhakaya of the liberated person.{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} See also Rita Langer (2007), ''Buddhist Rituals of Death and Rebirth: Contemporary Sri Lankan Practice and Its Origins'', p.26-28, on "redeath" (''punarmrtyu'').{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26-28}}}}), which is concerned with the here and now.{{refn|group=note|Tilmann Vetter, ''Das Erwachen des Buddha'', referenced by Bronkhorst.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=3}}}} Only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=3}} Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha "introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=16}} According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=14}}

The doctrine of karma may have been especially important for common people, for whom it was more important to cope with life's immediate demands, such as the problems of pain, injustice, and death. The doctrine of karma met these exigencies, and in time it became an important soteriological aim in its own right.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=125}}

==The Three Knowledges==
The understanding of rebirth, and the reappearance in accordance with one's deeds, are the first two knowledges that the Buddha is said to have acquired at his enlightenment. According to the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha gained full and complete insight into the workings of karma at the time of his enlightenment.{{sfn|Goldstein|2011|p=74}} According to Bronkhorst, these knowledges are later additions to the story,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} just like the notion of "liberating insight" itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} According to Tilmann Vetter, originally only the practice of dhyana, and the resulting calming of the mind may have constituted the liberating practice of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

==Later developments==
According to Vetter, probably in the first centuries after the Buddha's death the following
ideas were introduced or became important:{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=87}}
# all evil deeds must be requited or at least be superseded by good deeds before a person can become released,
# pleasant and unpleasant feelings in a human existence are the result of former deeds,
# evil behavior and its results form a vicious circle from which one can hardly escape,
# Gotama could become Buddha because he did good deeds through countless former lives, devoting their result to the aim of enlightenment,
# by confession and repentance one can (partly) annul an evil deed,
# evil deeds of non-Arhats (as to Arhats see point 1) can be superseded by great merits,
# one can and should transfer merit to others, especially for their spiritual development.

The '''Dharma Realm Buddhist Association''' (shortened to '''DRBA''', Chinese: 法界佛教總會, PY: ''Fajie Fuojiao Zonghui'', formerly known as the Sino-American Buddhist Association) is an international, non-profit [[Buddhist]] organization founded by the Venerable Master [[Hsuan Hua]] in 1959 to bring the orthodox teachings of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] to the entire world. DRBA has branch monasteries in many countries and cities, including [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Seattle]], and [[Vancouver]], as well as in [[Malaysia]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Australia]].

==History==

The Sino-American Buddhist Association was founded in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in 1959. A small temple, the Buddhist Lecture Hall was started. The Venerable Master [[Hsuan Hua]] came over from Hong Kong in 1962 by plane, stopping over at [[Japan]] and [[Hawaii]] before arriving at [[San Francisco]].

From 1962 to 1968 the Venerable Master lectured on the [[Lotus Sutra]], the [[Diamond Sutra]], and the [[Amitabha Sutra]] among many other Buddhist [[Sūtra|sutras]] and texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Text Translation Society|url=http://www.bttsonline.org/|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source is a product listing with no mention of lectures in this date range|date=May 2017}}

In June 1968 he began a 96-day intensive Study and Practice Summer Session for students and faculty from the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. After the session had concluded, many of the participants remained in [[San Francisco]] to continue their studies with the Venerable Master. In that year five Americans (three [[Bhikshu]]s, two [[Bhikshuni]]s) were ordained, marking the beginning of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] in the [[United States]].

In 1970 [[Gold Mountain Monastery]], one of the first Chinese Buddhist temples in the [[United States]] was founded in San Francisco, and a Hundred Day [[Zen|Chan]] Session was begun. [[Vajra Bodhi Sea]], a monthly journal of DRBA about Buddhist topics and teachings, was also founded in 1970.

In 1972 the first Threefold Ordination Ceremony for the transmission of the complete precepts was held at Gold Mountain Monastery.

In 1973 the [[Institute for the Translation of Buddhist Texts]] and Instilling Goodness Elementary School were founded in San Francisco. In the same year, Bhikshus Heng Ju and Heng Yo began a [[Three Steps One Bow]] pilgrimage from [[San Francisco]] to [[Seattle]] to pray for world peace - a hard journey over 1,000 miles. This was the first such pilgrimage in the history of American [[Buddhism]].

The site of the [[City of Ten Thousand Buddhas]] was purchased in 1974, and in November of that year the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua led a delegation to propagate the Dharma in [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Taiwan]] and other places. The delegation lasted for three months, ending on January 12, 1975.

Gold Wheel Monastery was founded in Los Angeles in 1975.

In 1976 the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas completed the second Threefold Ordination Ceremony. [[Developing Virtue Secondary School]]s and Dharma Realm Buddhist University were also founded. The next year Dharma Masters Heng Sure&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeleymonastery.org/teachers.html Heng Sure]&lt;/ref&gt; and Heng Chau began a second Three Steps, One Bow pilgrimage from Gold Wheel Monastery to the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas.

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e13 783-0.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Sabbatai Zevi]] in 1665]]

The '''Dönmeh''' ({{lang-tr|Dönme}}) were a group of crypto-[[Sabbateans]] (commonly referred to as [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]]) in the [[Ottoman Empire]] who converted publicly to [[Islam]], but were said to have retained their beliefs. The movement was centered in [[Salonica]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean McMeekin, The Berlin-Baghdad Express p.75&lt;/ref&gt; The group originated during and soon after the era of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], a 17th-century Jewish [[kabbalah|kabbalist]] who claimed to be the [[Messiah]] and eventually converted to Islam in order to escape punishment by the [[Sultan]] [[Mehmed IV]]. After Zevi's [[religious conversion|conversion]], a number of Jews followed him into Islam and became the Dönmeh.&lt;ref name="Turkay Nefes1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1468-4446.12137 | volume=66 | title=Scrutinizing impacts of conspiracy theories on readers' political views: a rational choice perspective on anti-semitic rhetoric in Turkey | year=2015 | journal=The British Journal of Sociology | pages=557–575 | last1 = Salim Nefes | first1 = Turkay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 20th century, assimilated Dönmeh might have intermarried with other groups and most have assimilated into Turkish society.

==Etymology==
The Turkish word ''dönme'' is from the verbal root ''dön-'' that means 'to turn', i.e., "to convert", but in a pejorative sense. They are also called ''Selânikli'' "person from [[Thessaloniki]]" or ''avdetî'' "religious convert" ({{lang-ar|عودة}} ''‘awdah'' 'return'). Members of the group refer to themselves simply as "the Believers" in Hebrew ({{lang-he|המאמינים}} ''ha-Ma'aminim''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/jewish-history-waiting-for-the-messiah-1.275606 Waiting for the Messiah]&lt;/ref&gt; or "sazanikos," Turkish for "[[carp]]" in honor of the changing outward nature of the fish.&lt;ref name="Maciejko, Pavel 2011"&gt;Maciejko, Pavel (2011). ''The Mixed Multitude: Jacob Frank and the Frankist Movement, 1755–1816.'' Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate explanation of this self-nomenclature is the prophecy that Sabbatai Zevi would deliver the Jews under the sign of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5278-donmeh "Dönmeh"] in Singer, Isidore, ed. (1906). "Jewish Encyclopedia." Jersey City, NJ: Ktav Publishing House. s.v.  (accessed 10 March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
Despite their conversion to Islam, the [[Sabbateans]] secretly remained close to Judaism and continued to practice Jewish rituals covertly. They recognized [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) as the [[Jewish Messiah]], observed certain [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] with similarities to those in Judaism, and prayed in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and later in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]. They also observed rituals celebrating important events in Zevi's life and interpreted Zevi's conversion in a [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] way.

There are several branches of the Dönmeh group. The first is the İzmirli, formed in [[İzmir|İzmir, Turkey]] (''Smyrna''). This was the original [[sect]], from which two others eventually split. The first schism created the sect of the Jakubi, founded by [[Jacob Querido]] (ca. 1650–1690), the brother of Zevi's last wife.&lt;ref name="Maciejko, Pavel 2011"/&gt; Querido claimed to be Zevi's reincarnation and a messiah in his own right. The second split from the İzmirli was the result of claims that [[Berechiah Russo]], known in Turkish as Osman Baba, was truly the next reincarnation of Zevi's soul. These allegations gained following and gave rise to the Karakashi (Turkish), or Konioso (Ladino), branch, the most numerous and strictest branch of the Dönmeh.&lt;ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1974"&gt;Scholem, Gershom (1974). ''Kabbalah.'' New York, NY: Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Missionaries from the Karakashi were active in Poland in the first part of the 18th century and taught [[Jacob Frank]] (1726–1791), the alleged heir of Russo's soul.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Frank went on to create the [[Frankist]] sect, another non-Dönmeh Sabbatean group in [[Eastern Europe]]. Yet another group, the Lechli, of [[Poles|Polish descent]], lived in exile in Salonika (modern Thessaloniki, Greece) and [[Constantinople]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

According to anti-Semite —Islamist and neo-Nazi— conspiracy theorists, several leading members of the [[Young Turk]] movement, a group of [[modernist]] revolutionaries who brought down the Ottoman Empire, were Dönmeh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/print/book/review/the-other-secret-jews |title=The Other Secret Jews |last=Kirsch |first=Adam |date=15 February 2010 |publisher=[[The New Republic]] |accessdate=5 December 2010 |archivedate=5 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ukCn6F22?url=http://www.tnr.com/print/book/review/the-other-secret-jews |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923, some among the Salonika Dönmeh tried to be recognized as non-Muslims to avoid being forced to leave the city.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} After the foundation of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]] in 1922–1923, the Dönmeh strongly supported the Republican, pro-Western reforms of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] that tried to restrict the power of the religious establishment and to modernize society.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In particular, the Dönmeh were instrumental in establishing trade, industry, and culture in the emerging Republic of Turkey, which is partially due to the prominence of [[Rumelia|Rumeli]] immigrants in general, and of Salonika in particular, in the early Republic years.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

An interesting case is the one of Ilgaz Zorlu, a Dönmeh publisher who founded ''Zvi Publishers'' in 2000 and sought recognition as a Jew, but a [[Beth Din]] refused to recognize his Jewishness without a full conversion.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He claimed to have converted in Israel and then filed a lawsuit for changing his religion from Islam to Judaism in his registry records and identification. The court voted in his favor.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;!--The case of Ilgaz Zorlu may be irrelevant to the greater history of the Dönmeh sect; discuss at talk page--&gt;

[[Işık University]], which is the part of the Feyziye Schools Foundation ({{lang-tr|Feyziye Mektepleri Vakfı}}, FMV), and Terakkî schools were founded by the Dönmeh community in Thessaloniki in the last quarter of the 19th century and continued their activities in Istanbul after Greeks captured the city on [[First Balkan War|9 November 1912]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

There is a community of Dönmehs living in [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]] district of İstanbul.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The independent scholar Rifat Bali defines the term "dönme" as follows:

"The term Donme is a Turkish gerund meaning ‘to turn, revolve or return' and, by extension, “to betray” (i.e., ‘go back on’) and ‘to convert’ to another religion. It has come in popular parlance to refer to religious converts in general, and, more specifically, to the seventeenth century followers of the Jewish false messiah Sabbatai Sevi and their descendants, who outwardly converted to Islam but retained their secretive religious practices over the next several centuries, maintaining close communal and blood ties and practicing strict [[endogamy]]. While the great majority of the community’s members abandoned their practices during the first quarter century, their past identity has continued to haunt them within Turkish society, and the term Dönme itself remains one of opprobrium."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Model Citizens of the State: The Jews of Turkey During the Multi-party Period|last = Bali|first = Rifat|publisher = Lexington Books|year = 2012|isbn =|location =|pages = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The Dönmeh ideology of the 17th century revolved primarily around the [[Eighteen Precepts]], an abridged version of the [[Ten Commandments]] in which the admonition against adultery is explained as more of a precautionary measure than a ban, likely included to explain the [[antinomian]] sexual activities of the [[Sabbateans]]. The additional commandments are concerned with defining the kinds of interactions that may occur between the Dönmeh and the Jewish and Muslim communities. The most basic of these laws of interaction was to avoid marriage with either Jews or Muslims and to prefer relations within the sect to those outside of it. In spite of this, they maintained ties with [[Sabbateans]] who had not converted and even with Jewish [[rabbi]]s, who secretly settled disputes within the Dönmeh concerning Jewish law.&lt;ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1974"/&gt;

As far as ritual was concerned, the Dönmeh followed both Jewish and Muslim traditions, shifting between one and the other as necessary for integration into Ottoman society.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Marc. "Globalization, Cosmopolitanism, and the Dönme in Ottoman Salonica and Turkish Istanbul." Journal of World History. 18. no. 2 (2007): 141–170. doi: 10.1353/jwh.2007.0009 (accessed 6 March 2013). [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=390325bd-e0d4-41e9-b6cd-b65afbe9091c%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=126]&lt;/ref&gt; Outwardly Muslims and secretly Jewish [[Sabbateans]], the Dönmeh observed traditional Muslim holidays like [[Ramadan]] but also kept the Jewish Sabbath, [[Brit milah]] and major holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5278-donmeh]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Dönmeh ritual is a combination of various elements of Kabbalah, Sabbateanism, Jewish traditional law, and [[Sufism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Baer, [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/donme-maaminim-minim-shabbetaim-COM_0006730 "Dönme (Ma'aminim, Minim, Shabbetaim),"] Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. University of Maryland. 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Dönmeh [[liturgy]] evolved as the sect grew and spread. At first, much of the Dönmeh literature was written in Hebrew. Later, as the group developed, Ladino replaced Hebrew as the prominent language and became not only the vernacular language, but also the liturgical language. Though the Dönmeh had branched into several sects, all of them held the view that Zevi was the divine messiah and that he had revealed the true "spiritual [[Torah]]"&lt;ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1974"/&gt; which was superior to the practical earthly Torah. The Dönmeh created and celebrated holidays pertaining to various points in Zevi's life and their own history of conversion. Based at least partially in the Kabbalistic understanding of divinity, the Dönmeh believed that there was a three-way connection of the [[Sephirot|emanations]] of the divine, which engendered much conflict with Muslim and Jewish communities alike. The most notable source of opposition from other contemporary religions was the common practice of exchanging wives between members of the Dönmeh.&lt;ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1974"/&gt;

The hierarchy of the Dönmeh was based in branch divisions. The Ismirli lay at the top of the hierarchy, composed of merchant classes and intelligentsia. Artisans tended to be mostly Karakashi while lower classes were mostly Jakubi. Each branch had its own prayer community, organized into a "Kahal," or congregation (Hebrew).&lt;ref name="Scholem, Gershom 1974"/&gt; An extensive internal economic network provided support for lower class Dönmeh in spite of ideological differences between branches.&lt;ref&gt;Weiker, Walter F. (1992). "Ottomans, Turks, and the Jewish Polity: A History of the Jews of Turkey." Lanham, MD: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-Semitic canards and alleged political entanglements ==
Turkish anti-Semitism and the conspiracy theories upon which it relies are centred on the mysterious figure of the Dönmeh.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baer|first=Marc David|date=2013|title=An Enemy Old and New: The Dönme, Anti-Semitism, and Conspiracy Theories in the Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|journal=Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=103, no. 4|pages=523-555|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Marc David Baer, the phenomenon has deep roots in late-Ottoman history, and its legacy of conspiratorial accusations persisted throughout the history of the Turkish Republic and is kept alive there today. Modern anti-Semitism racially essentializes the Jew as a ubiquitous, homogenous unit acting undercover in the guise of diverse global groups, inexorably in pursuit of global political and economic control via secretive channels. As a crypto-Sabbatean sect, the Dönmeh were always an easy target of canards about secret, “crypto-Jewish” political control and social influence, whether charged with setting in motion political upheaval against the status quo, or accused of shaping an oppressive regime’s grip on the status quo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dönmeh’s history of Sabbatean theological and ritual secrecy grounded in Jewish tradition, coupled with public observance of Islam, make accusations of secret Jewish control convenient, according to Baer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; “Secret Jew,” then, takes on a double meaning of being both secretly Jewish and Jews who act secretively to exert control; their secret religious identity in the first place is compatible, for conspiracy theorists, with their secretive influence, especially when they cannot be distinguished from ordinary Turkish Muslims who reside everywhere, and, as Baer argues, when the modern antisemite sees the Jew as necessarily “everywhere.” The Dönmeh’s maneuverings were said to have been at the core of Young Turk Revolution and their overthrow of the Sultan Abdülhamid II, the dissolution of the Ottoman religious establishment, and the founding of a secular republic. Pro-Sultan, religious Muslim political opponents painted these events as a global Jewish and Freemason plot carried out by Turkey’s secret Jews, the Dönmeh, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the chief revolutionary and former member of the [[Committee for Union and Progress]] (CUP), a leading Dönmeh himself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, the crypto-Jewish conspiracy claim has been used throughout modern Turkish history by rightists and Islamists to undermine the legitimacy of incumbent political leadership, and, today, by leftists and secularists seeking to undermine the political legitimacy of Erdogan and the origins of Islamism more broadly. These, like other claims of Jewish aspirations to world-domination, embodied in part by the successes of Zionism, join the ranks as examples of both the enduring nature of such canards in contemporary Turkey, and of their deep-seated relationship with pervasive, worldwide theories of political conspiracy propagated by radically different political elements often simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mehmet Karakaşzade Rüştü== &lt;!--This may be extraneous; discuss at talk page--&gt;
In 1924, Mehmet Karakaşzade Rüştü, a Karakash Dönmeh,{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} made allegations about Dönmehs, branches and wife-swapping rituals to ''[[Vakit]]'' newspaper. He also accused Donmehs of lacking patriotism and not having been assimilated. Discussions spread into other newspapers including the ones owned by Dönmeh groups. [[Ahmet Emin Yalman]], in the newspaper (''Vatan'') he owned, accepted the existence of such groups, but claimed that those groups were no longer following their traditions. Then Karakaşzade Rüştü petitioned the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] to request the abolition of some Dönmehs' ongoing immigration from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] by population exchange.&lt;ref name="Turkay Nefes"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-954X.12016 | volume=61 | title=Political parties' perceptions and uses of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in Turkey | year=2013 | journal=The Sociological Review | pages=247–264 | last1 = Salim Nefes | first1 = Türkay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nefes"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6443.2012.01434.x | volume=25 | title=The History of the Social Constructions of Dönmes (Converts)* | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Historical Sociology | pages=413–439 | last1 = Nefes | first1 = Türkay S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cengiz Sisman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DrANyYkH0mwC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=The+History+of+Naming+the+Ottoman/Turkish+Sabbatians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gQK6Q3F30_&amp;sig=IFT34-UbiC2-aRz9Hj8pVTukHMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5wrxSoSYFMaj8AaH-b2CCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20History%20of%20Naming%20the%20Ottoman%2FTurkish%20Sabbatians&amp;f=false "The History of naming the Ottoman/Turkish Sabbatians"], in ''Studies on Istanbul and Beyond'' ed. by Robert G.

The '''Elim Pentecostal Church''' is a UK-based [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Christian denomination]].

==History==
[[File:Elimpc-002.jpg|thumb|Elim Pentecostal Church Wimbledon]]
[[George Jeffreys (pastor)|George Jeffreys]] (1889–1962), a [[Welsh people|Welshman]], founded the ''Elim Pentecostal Church'' in [[Monaghan]], Ireland in 1915. Jeffreys was an [[Evangelism|evangelist]] with a Welsh [[Congregational church]] background. He was converted at age 15 during the [[1904&amp;ndash;1905 Welsh Revival|Welsh Revival]] of 1904.  [[Alexander Boddy|Alexander A. Boddy]], Vicar of [[All Saints' Church, Monkwearmouth|All Saints]], [[Monkwearmouth]], [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] invited him to preach at his International Pentecostal Convention in Sunderland in May 1913. Between 1915 and 1934, Jeffreys was extremely active as a revivalist, and preached to large crowds throughout the United Kingdom. The church was brought together, first as the '''Elim Evangelistic Band''', but this was changed to '''Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance''' when the Deed Poll was registered in April 1934. The name 'Elim' was taken from the account in the [[Book of Exodus]], chapter 15, verse 27, where the [[Israelites]], leaving the bondage of Egypt under the leadership of [[Moses]], found an oasis called [[Elim (Bible)|Elim]]: ''"Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters."'' This represented a place of refreshing and it was thought appropriate for a revival movement at that time.

Differences of opinion over Jeffreys' open espousal of [[British Israelism]] and disputes on church governance led Jeffreys to withdraw from the Elim Pentecostal Church in 1939 and to form the Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship in [[Nottingham]], which founded other churches throughout England until the 1960s, but that now only continues as a small fellowship. The presidency of Elim then passed to George Kingston, a wealthy businessman who had founded many of the Elim congregations in [[Essex]].

On the night of 23 June 1978, eight British [[missionary|missionaries]] and four young children (including a three-week-old baby) connected with the Elim Mission in [[Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe) were bayoneted to death by [[guerrilla]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946814,00.html|title = Time Magazine: RHODESIA: Savagery and Terror | date=10 July 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the women were [[rape]]d.&lt;ref&gt;The full story is elaborated in Phyllis Thompson, ''The Rainbow or the Thunder'', Sevenoaks: Hodder and Stoughton.&lt;/ref&gt; This brutal massacre in the Vumba and the ministry of Elim in Zimbabwe was commemorated in the 2017 book "The Axe and the Tree" by Stephen Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0857217895/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_NuHYBbPCX3BVR|title=The Axe and the Tree: How bloody persecution sowed the seeds of new life in Zimbabwe|last=results|first=search|date=2017-02-17|publisher=Monarch Books|isbn=9780857217899|edition= 1st New |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I knew one of the young ladies who were killed--&gt;

==Doctrine==
Elim Pentecostal beliefs include: the Bible as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]]; the [[Trinity|three in one as the Godhead]]; the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and his complete humanity and sinless life, [[substitutionary atonement]], [[bodily resurrection]], [[Intercession of Christ|heavenly intercession]], the [[second coming of Jesus]]; the [[Original sin|universal sinfulness of mankind]]; the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in conviction, repentance, regeneration and sanctification according to Acts 2:38; the [[baptism of the Holy Spirit]] "with signs following"; that salvation is received by [[faith alone]] and evidenced by the [[fruit of the Spirit]]. The [[Believer's baptism|baptism of believers]] by [[Immersion baptism|immersion]] and [[The Lord's Supper|Communion]] are held to be ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elim.org.uk/Groups/112249/What_we_believe.aspx ''What we believe''.] Elim Pentecostal Churches.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Elim Pentecostal Church has experienced steady growth and now numbers 600 churches in the United Kingdom and 4367 worldwide, with a weekly attendance of about 55,000 in the U.K &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=8QNCAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 ''Allan H. Anderson: An Introduction to Pentecostalism. Global Charismatic Christianity''.] 2013, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  and almost 320,000 overseas.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Kensington Temple]] of London is the largest church in the denomination. Elim Missions exist in 35 countries with hospitals, orphanages, and schools, although the denomination has churches in 50 countries. The church operates [[Regents Theological College]] in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], where the movement's headquarters are also based.

The authority of governance of the church is rested in the annual Conference. Guidance of the denomination is placed in the National Leadership Team and the General Superintendent between sessions. Chris Cartwright has served as General Superintendent since 2016, superseding John Glass. Elim headquarters is in Malvern, alongside its Bible College. Elim became a founding member of the Pentecostal Churches of the United Kingdom in 1998. It has been a member of the [[Evangelical Alliance]] for many years.

Though the local congregations are commonly and popularly known as ''Elim Pentecostal Churches'', the legal name of the denomination is still ''Elim Foursquare Gospel Alliance'', which is based on the church's stand for four fundamental claims – "''Jesus Christ as the Saviour, Healer, Baptiser in the Holy Spirit, and Coming King''."

==Hymnal==
The standard hymnal of the Elim Church has been the [[Redemption Hymnal]] in the past. Today however, the music and worship is mainly modern and contemporary worship songs with some traditional hymns alongside. Now Elim has its own Worship Department writing songs and training worship teams called 'Elim Sound'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elim.org.uk/Groups/257373/Elim_Sound.aspx|title=Elim Sound|website=www.elim.org.uk|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ERK''' was a [[socialist]] party active in [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkiria]], [[Bukhara]] and [[Turkestan]] from 1919 to 1926. The founding document was written by [[Zeki Velidi Togan|Validov]] as part of the preparations for the{{clarify|date=May 2017|reason=missing words?}} to switch from the{{clarify|date=May 2017|reason=missing words?}} to that of the Bolsheviks in February 1919. This led to the foundation of the [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in March 1919.

The party was established when two groups, simultaneously but independently of each other, decided to organize themselves into independent political formations in the [[Third International]]. The original groups based in [[Tashkent]] and [[Temjassovo]], Bashkiria, were supplemented by activists from [[Bukhara]] and [[Kirghizia]] following a chance meeting in [[Moscow]] in November 1919.  They decided to draw up a 12-point programme. Despite obvious signs that their organizing as a separate party would be unacceptable to the [[Comintern]], they nevertheless met in June 1920, and decided to proceed, taking no account of the programme and regulations of the Third International.

During the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]], their organizational committee met, including [[Validov]] and [[Torokul Dzhanuzakov|Dzhanuzakov]]. A new programme of 27 points was hammered out, and [[Abdulhamid Arifov]] - at that time the [[military commissar]] of the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic]] - replaced Dzhanuzakov on the committee.

The committee met again 7 - 10 January 1921, this time in Bukhara, when they changed the name to ''Turkestan Sosialistlar Tüdesi'' (Circle of Turkestan Socialists) abbreviated to ''Tüde''.{{cn|date=June 2015}}  In April that same year, with representatives from [[Khorezm People's Soviet Republic|Khorezm]], the programme was reduced to 9 points. In 1926 the name was changed to ''Sosialist ERK Firkasi'' (Socialist Party of Turkestan ERK).

The '''etheric plane''' (see also ''[[etheric body]]'') is a term introduced into [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]] to represent the subtle part of the lower [[plane (cosmology)|plane]] of existence. It represents the fourth [higher] subplane of the [[physical plane]] (a [[hyperplane]]), the lower three being the states of [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gaseous]] matter. The idea was later used by authors such as [[Alice Bailey]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Walter John Kilner]] and others.

The term '''aether''' (also written as "ether") was adopted from ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science into Victorian physics (see [[Luminiferous aether]]) and utilised by [[Madame Blavatsky]] to correspond to [[akasha]], the fifth element ([[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]) of [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu metaphysics]]. 

The Greek word ''aither'' derives from an Indo-European [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''aith''- ("burn, shine"). Blavatsky also related the idea to the Hindu ''[[Prana]]'' principle,&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H.P., ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'', 1889&lt;/ref&gt; the [[vitalism|vital]], life-sustaining force of living beings, present in all natural processes of the universe. Prana was first expounded in the [[Upanishads]], where it is part of the worldly, physical realm, sustaining the body and the mind. Blavatsky also tended to use the word "astral" indiscriminately for these supposed subtle physical phenomena. The esoteric concepts of [[Adi (metaphysical plane)|Adi]], the [[Buddhic plane]], the [[causal plane]], and the [[monadic plane]] are also related to that of the etheric plane.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater (1912 - 1937), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=H1H1ZLTmWPsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Textbook+of+Theosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLr7joy8jKAhXKnYMKHUniD00Q6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=plane&amp;f=false A Textbook of Theosophy]'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912 - 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadbeater and Besant&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie. ''Man's life in this and other worlds'', Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; (both belonging to the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar School of Theosophy]]) conceived that the etheric plane constituted four higher subplanes of the [[physical plane]]. According to the Theosophist Geoffrey A. Farthing, Leadbeater used the term, because of its resonance in the physical sciences, to describe his clairvoyant investigations of sub-atomic physics.&lt;ref&gt;Farthing, Geoffrey A., ''[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/metaphys/etheric.htm The Etheric Double:The Far-Reaching Effects of a false Assumption]'', from a booklet in private circulation dated June 1995, reprinted from ''Theosophy World''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Christian Rosicrucians==

Similarly according to the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucian]] writings of American occultist and mystic [[Max Heindel]]&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter III: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng01.htm#Chapter_III The Visible and the Invisible Worlds])'', 1911, {{ISBN|0-911274-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is - in addition to the solids, liquids, and gases which compose the ''Chemical Region'' of the Physical World - a finer grade of [[matter]] called ether that permeates the [[subatomic|atomic]] structure of the earth and its [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It is disposed in four grades of [[density]] and is considered to be a kind of physical matter (the blue haze seen in mountain canyons is said to be in fact ether of the kind known to occult investigators as ''chemical ether''). Associated there is also a type of [[Clairvoyance|spiritual sight]], that man will eventually develop, called ''etheric vision''.&lt;ref&gt;A Student, ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/evw/evweng01.htm Etheric Vision and What It Reveals]'', {{ISBN|0-911274-59-6}}, 110 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Ether is reported to be of four kinds, or grades of density in our planet [[Earth]]; their names (from the lowest or most dense to the highest or most subtle one) and their relation to the human being, from the point of view of these [[Esoteric Christian]] teachings, is as following:&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]] (Chapter I.2, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng01.htm#part2 The Etheric Region of the Physical World])'', 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "Chemical Ether": both positive and negative in manifestation and it is related to the [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] and [[excretion]] processes;
* the "Life Ether": has also a positive and negative pole and it is related to the forces of [[biological reproduction|propagation]];
* the "Light Ether": the positive pole is related to forces which generate [[blood heat]] in the higher species of animal and in the human being and the negative is related to the forces which operate through the [[senses]] (passive functions of sight, hearing, feeling, tasting, and smelling);
* the "Reflective Ether": the medium through which [[Mental body|thought]] makes an impression upon the human [[brain]] and this ether contains pictures which work as reflections of the [[Akashic records|Memory of Nature]] found at the [[Mental plane|World of Thought]].

The FIOE was the sponsor of an initiative known as the Muslims of Europe Charter which was signed by more than four hundred Muslim organizations from all European countries and announced in Brussels in January 2008. A FIOE spokesman describe the document as "a message to government and the rest of society, but also directed at Muslims within Europe," "It describes how we should act as positive citizens in the societies in which we live and not be a threat."&lt;ref&gt; Teresa Küchler and Leigh Philips [http://euobserver.com/news/25444 "400 groups sign charter for European Muslims"], euobserver.com (14 January 2008).

==Ties to Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas==
FIOE has  been described by one analyst as "de facto, the overarching organization for new Western [[Muslim Brotherhood]] groups in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vidino|first1=Lorenzo|title=The New Muslim Brotherhood in the West|date=25 August 2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231151269|page=51|edition=First|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OK_GAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same analyst says that the FIOE founders and main members are new Western Muslim Brotherhood organizations such as the [[Union of Islamic Organisations of France]] the [[Islamic Community of Germany]], and the [[Muslim Association of Britain]] (MAB) and that its board members include new Western Brothers such as  [[Ahmed Jaballah]] and [[Ibrahim El-Zayat]]. In 2005, the FIOE President [[Ahmed Al-Rawi]] told the Wall Street Journal regarding the relationship of FIOE with the Muslim Brotherhood, "We are interlinked with them with a common point of view," he said. "We have a good close relationship.&lt;ref&gt; Ian Johnson, [http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/05363/629642.stm "Islamic group's ties reveal Europe's challenge"], The Wall Street Journal (December 29, 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9626">{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
A '''flamen''' was a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|priest]] of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] who was assigned to one of fifteen deities with official [[Cult (religion)|cults]] during the [[Roman Republic]]. The most important three were the ''flamines maiores'' (or "major priests"), who served the three chief Roman gods of the [[Capitoline Triad#Archaic Triad|Archaic Triad]]. The remaining twelve were the ''flamines minores'' ("lesser priests"). Two of the ''minores'' cultivated deities whose names are now unknown; among the others are deities about whom little is known other than the name. During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]], the cult of a deified emperor (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divus]]'') also had a flamen.

The fifteen Republican flamens were part of the [[College of Pontiffs|Pontifical College]] which administered state-sponsored religion. When the office of flamen was vacant, a [[College of Pontiffs|pontifex]] could serve as a temporary replacement, although only the [[Pontifex Maximus]] is known to have substituted for the [[Flamen Dialis]], one of the ''flamines maiores''.

==History and etymology==
By the time of the religious reformation of [[Augustus]], the origins and functions of many of the long-neglected gods resident in Rome was confusing even to the Romans themselves. The obscurity of some of the deities assigned a flamen (for example [[Falacer]], [[Palatua]], [[Quirinus]] and [[Volturnus]]) suggests that the office dated back to Archaic Rome. Many scholars{{Who|date=May 2010}} assume that the ''flamines'' existed at least from the [[Roman Kingdom|time of the early Roman kings]], before the establishment of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]]. The Romans themselves credited the foundation of the priesthood to [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]].  According to [[Livy]], Numa created the offices of the three ''flamines maiores'' and assigned them each a fine robe of office and a [[curule chair]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:20&lt;/ref&gt; The ''flamines'' were circumscribed by many [[taboo]]s.

The origin of the word ''flamen'' is as obscure as are some of the assigned gods. [[Sophus Bugge]] suggested in 1879 that ''flamen'' is from an older *''flădmen'' and related to the Germanic ''[[blót]]''. Both would be derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *''bhlād(s)men''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0137.html Hellquist, Elof. "blota". ''Svensk etymologisk ordbok'', 1922].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-European studies|Indo-Europeanist]] [[Georges Dumézil]] attempted to link it to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Brahmin|brahman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;'The Sanskrit brahman... must derive, with reverse [[guna]], from *bhelgh-men- or *bholgh-men-. The Latin flamen must derive from a neighboring form, *bhlagh-smen-, which, along with forms having the radical -el- or - ol-, presents the same shift'. Dumézil G.,(1940), ''Mitra-Varuna'', trans. D. Coltman. New York: Zone Books, 1988, p.26;&lt;/ref&gt; This etymology is still controversial.

==Garb==

The official costume of a flamen, allegedly of great antiquity, was a hat called an ''apex'' and a heavy cloak called a ''laena''. The laena was a double-thick wool cloak with a fringed edge, and was worn over the flamen's [[toga]] with a clasp to hold it around his throat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], ''Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil'' iv.262; [[Cicero]] ''Brutus'' 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''apex'' was a leather skull-cap with a chin-strap and a point of olive wood on its top, like a spindle, with a little fluff of wool at the base of the spindle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] ''Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil'' ii.683, viii.664, x.270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flamines maiores==
The three '''flamines maiores''' were required to be [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]s:
*The '''[[Flamen Dialis]]''' oversaw the cult of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the sky deity and ruler of the gods.
*The '''[[Flamen Martialis]]''' oversaw the cult of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war, leading public [[wiktionary:rite|rites]] on the days sacred to Mars. The sacred [[spear]]s of Mars were ritually shaken by the Flamen Martialis when the [[Roman legion|legions]] were preparing for war.
*The '''[[Flamen Quirinalis]]''' oversaw the cult of [[Quirinus]], who presided over organized Roman social life and was related to the peaceful aspect of Mars. The Flamen Quirinalis led public [[wiktionary:rite|rites]] on the days sacred to Quirinus.

A fourth ''flamen maior'' was dedicated to [[Julius Caesar]] as a divinity (''divus'') of the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar's first flamen was [[Mark Antony]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, any deceased emperor could be made ''divus'' by vote of the [[Roman senate|senate]] and consent of his successor, and as a ''divus'' he would be served by a flamen. The flamen's role in relation to living emperors is uncertain; no living emperor is known to have received official divine worship;&lt;ref&gt;Caesar may have been granted an active flamen while living; the evidence is equivocal.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

A flamen could also be represented by a ''proflamen'', or by a member without that title who could act as a substitute for the flamen (''qui vice flaminis fungebatur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aid%3Darx A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890) (eds. William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G. E. Marindin)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flamines minores==
[[File:Ara pacis fregio lato ovest 2 A.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|''Flamines'', distinguished by their pointed ''apices'', as part of a procession on the [[Ara Pacis|Augustan Altar of Peace]]]]

The twelve '''flamines minores''' could be [[plebs|plebeians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seindal|first1=René|title=flamines maiores|url=http://sights.seindal.dk/sight/311_flamines_maiores.html|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the deities whose cult they tended were rather obscure, and only ten are known by name:

* '''Flamen Carmentalis''', the flamen for [[Carmentis]]
* '''Flamen Cerialis''', for [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]
* '''Flamen Falacer''', for [[Falacer]]
* '''Flamen Floralis''', for [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]]
* '''Flamen Furrinalis''', for [[Furrina]]
* '''Flamen Palatualis''', for [[Palatua]]
* '''Flamen Pomonalis''', for [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]]
* '''Flamen Portunalis''', for [[Portunus (mythology)|Portunus]]
* '''Flamen Volcanalis''', for [[Vulcan (god)|Vulcan]]
* '''Flamen Volturnalis''', for [[Volturnus]]

There were two other ''flamines minores'' during the Republican period, but the names of the deities they cultivated are unknown. The ''flamines minores'' seem mostly connected to agriculture or local cults. The change to an urban way of life may explain why these deities lost their importance or fell into oblivion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The ''Floralis'' and ''Pomonalis'' are not recorded in calendars as their festivals were moveable. Some information exists for the ritual roles of the ''Portunalis'' in connection with the cult of the god [[Quirinus]] and ''Volcanalis'' in connexion with the cult of the goddess [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] on the [[Kalends]] of May.&lt;ref&gt;Fest. p.321 L1 s.v. "persillum"; Macrob. ''Sat.'' I,12, 18&lt;/ref&gt; Also preserved is the list of deities invoked by the ''flamen Cerialis'' when he officiated at sacrifices to the goddesses [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]].&lt;ref&gt;The lost treatise ''De jure pontificio'' by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]] had contained the list, which was in turn recorded by [[Varro]] and through [[Servius]] later preserved by [[Augustine]] in the ''De civitate Dei''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars disagree about some differences among ''flamines maiores'' and ''minores''. Some maintain the difference was not substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Latte]], ''Roemische Religionsgeschichte'' 1960, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Others, among them [[Dumézil]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, Consideratons preliminaires, XI&lt;/ref&gt; believe that inherent differences lay in the right of the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auspicia maiora|auspicia maiora]]'' and the ritual of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#inauguratio|inauguration]] that concerned only the ''maiores''&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] 1, 112; [[Aulus Gellius]] 13, 15 quoting Messala ''De Auspicis''; Festus p. 274-275 L2.&lt;/ref&gt; by birth as ''farreati'', that is, as children of parents married through the ritual of [[confarreatio]], which was the form of marriage in turn required for ''maiores''. The ''maiores'' also had the privilege of having ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#calator|calatores]]'', assistants who carried out day-to-day business.&lt;ref&gt;Fest. p. 354 L2; [[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 227 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcsynr0fQIoC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=calator+OR+calatores&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=calator%20OR%20calatores&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The difference would thus be akin to that between magistracies with ''[[imperium]]'' and those with ''[[potestas]]'' only.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

'''Freedom of religion in Ecuador''' is guaranteed by the country's [[Constitution of Ecuador|constitution]], and the government generally respects this right in practice. Government policy contributes to the generally free practice of religion. The United States received no reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice in 2007.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Ecuador}}

The country has an area of 283,561 square kilometres and a population of 15 million (in 2010). The Catholic Episcopal Conference estimates that 85 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, with 35 percent of Catholics actively practicing. Some groups, particularly indigenous people who live in the mountains, follow a syncretic form of Catholicism that combines indigenous beliefs with orthodox Catholic doctrine. The Evangelical Missionary Union estimates that there are one million Protestants.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90252.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Ecuador]. U.S. [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (2007). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the religious groups registered with the Government have very small numbers; these include Anglicans, Baha'is, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and the Unification Church. Other groups present in small numbers are Muslims, Jews, and adherents of Eastern Orthodox religions. There are also followers of Inti, the traditional Inca sun god, and some atheists, but there were no reliable statistics on the size of these smaller groups.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Status of religious freedom==

The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The Government at all levels has sought to protect this right in full and does not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The Constitution grants all citizens and foreigners the right to practice publicly and freely the religion of their choice. The only limits imposed by the Government are "those proscribed by law to protect and respect the diversity, plurality, security, and rights of others." The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on religion.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The Government requires religious groups to be licensed or registered if they engage in proselytizing activity. Religious organizations that do not engage in such activity may still choose to register to obtain a legal identity, which is desirable when entering into contracts. Any religious organization wishing to register with the Government must possess a charter, have nonprofit status, include all names used by the group (to ensure that names of previously registered groups are not used without their permission), and provide signatures of at least 15 members. In addition, groups must file a petition with the Ministry of Government, using a licensed attorney, and pay a $100 registration fee. During the period covered by this report, the Government continued to streamline the registration process for religious groups.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The Government permits missionary activity and public religious expression by all religious groups.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The Government does not generally permit religious instruction in public schools. Private schools have complete liberty to provide religious instruction, as do parents in the home.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Government policy and practice contribute to the generally free practice of religion. Catholics reportedly complained that the Government restricted access for ecological reasons to the Galápagos Islands to the extent that foreign missionaries had difficulty ministering to the 14,500 resident Catholics. There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

On August 27, 2006, two military officers (Ivan Santi Mucushigua and Cervantes Santamaria Cuji) and a civilian (Lucio Cirilo Dahua) allegedly killed Balti Cadena, a traditional healer (yachak), and injured one of his sons, near the Amazonas Military Fort in Puyo, Pastaza Province. The Public Prosecutor, in a civilian court, charged the two military officers with murder. At the end of the reporting period, the officers were held at the Amazonas Military Fort and had appealed to the Superior Court of Puyo. Press reports added that at least four traditional healers have been killed in the past 10 years in the same area.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

There were no reports of forced religious conversion.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Societal abuses and discrimination==

There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Many religious groups increased their outreach efforts to their counterparts during the period covered by this report.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}
The '''Gaudiya Math''' (pronounced ''matt'', [[IAST]]: ''Gauḍīya Maṭha'') is a [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] [[matha]] (monastic organisation)  formed on 6 September 1920,&lt;ref name=bio1997&gt;Devamayī dāsi, "A Divine Life: Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda" in ''Prabhupada Saraswati Thakur: The Life &amp; Precepts of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Saraswatī,'' Mandala Publishing, Eugene, Oregon: 1997, pp. 24, 26, 49. {{ISBN|978-0-945475-10-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; about 30 months after [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] took ''[[sannyasa]]'', the renounced order of life. On 7 March 1918,&lt;ref name=bio1997 /&gt; the same day he took ''sannyasa,'' he established the Sri Chaitanya Math in [[Mayapura]] in West Bengal, later recognised as the parent body of all the Gaudiya Math branches.&lt;ref name=bio1997 /&gt; Its purpose was to spread [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], the philosophy of the medieval [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], through preaching and [[publishing]].

From the beginning of Chaitanya's ''[[bhakti]]'' movement in Bengal, devotees, including [[Haridasa Thakur]] and others, whether [[Islam|Muslim]] or [[Hinduism|Hindu]] by birth, have been participants. This openness and disregard for the traditional [[caste]] system received a boost from the "broad-minded vision" of [[Bhaktivinoda Thakura]],&lt;ref name=Sherbow2004&gt;{{cite journal

The Gaudiya Math had established 64 branches.&lt;ref name=bio1997 /&gt; Most were in India, but preaching centres were maintained for a time in [[Burma]], [[England]] and [[Germany]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The first European preaching center was established in [[London]] in 1933 (London Glouster House, Cornwall Garden, W7 South Kensington) under the name Gaudiya Mission Society of London'. Lord Zetland, the English Secretary of State, was the president of this society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrindavan.org/English/Books/GM/GMI.html|title=Gaudiya Math - Part I|author=|date=|website=www.vrindavan.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second European preaching center was opened by [[Bhakti Hridaya Bon Swami|Swami B.H. Bon Maharaj]] in [[Berlin]] (W30 Eisenacherstr. 29).

Soon after the [[Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati]]'s death (1 January 1937), a dispute began and the original Gaudiya Math mission divided into two administrative bodies which continued preaching on their own, up to the present day. In a settlement they divided the 64 Gaudiya Math centers into two groups. [[Sri Chaitanya Math]] Branch were headed by Srila Bhakti Vilasa Tirtha Maharaj. [[Gaudiya Mission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|gaudiyamission.org|Gaudiya Mission official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; were headed by Ananta Vasudev Prabhu, who became known as Srila Bhakti Prasad Puri Maharaj after accepting [[sannyasa]] for short duration.

Many of the disciples of [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] did not agree with the spirit of these newly created two fractions, or were simply inspired to expand the mission of their guru on their own enthusiasm, started their own missions. Many of these autonomous missions are still known as Gaudiya Math. Some of the other new missions are:

* '''Sri Gaudiya Vedanta Samiti''' established by [[Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Goswami]] (1940)&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|gaudiya.com|Sri Gaudiya Vedanta Samiti official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math''' established by Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Goswsmi (1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|scsmath.com|Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math''' established by Srila Bhakti Dayita Madhav Goswami (1953)&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|sreecgmath.org|Sri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]]''' established by [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] (1966)&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|iskcon.org|[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sri Gopinatha Gaudiya Math''' established by Srila Bhakti Pramode Puri Goswami (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|gopinathgaudiyamath.com|Sri Gopinatha Gaudiya Math official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''International Pure Bhakti Yoga Society''' established by Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|purebhakti.com|International Pure Bhakti Yoga Society official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some are very large missions, and some are smaller branches started by individual Vaisnavas. What they hold in common is that they are autonomous branches of the tree of the Gaudiya Math. Almost all of them have published books and periodicals and opened one or more temples.

The '''Gomti''', '''Gumti''' or '''Gomati''' [[River]] is a [[tributary]] of the [[Ganges]]. 
According to [[Hindu mythology]], the river is the daughter of the Hindu sage [[Vashistha|Vashist]]; bathing in the Gomti on [[Ekadashi]] (the eleventh day of the two [[lunar phase]]s of the [[Hindu calendar]] month) can wash away sins.&lt;ref name="RIB Expedition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gomati River Expedition 2011|url=http://ribexpedition.com/expeditions/index.php/3-gomati-the-forgotten-river|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' one of Hinduism's major religious works, the Gomti is one of India's transcendental rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://srimadbhagavatam.com/sb/5/19/17-18/en1 | title = Bhaktivedanta VedaBase: Srimad Bhagavatam 5.19.17-18 | date = 2010-01-04 | accessdate = 2010-01-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/675F3dhlg?url=http://srimadbhagavatam.com/sb/5/19/17-18/en1 | archivedate = 2012-04-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rare [[Gomti Chakra]] is found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Magic SEA Underground: Magical Uses Of Gomti Chakra (Cat’s Eye Shell)|url = http://liewsp1-magicsea.blogspot.in/2013/06/magical-uses-of-gomti-chakra-cats-eye.html|website = liewsp1-magicsea.blogspot.in|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:The banks of river Gomati in Jaunpur.jpg|thumb|alt=Wooded riverbank at twilight|300px|The banks of the Gomti in Jaunpur]]
The Gomti, a monsoon- and groundwater-fed river, originates from Gomat Taal (formally known as Fulhaar jheel) near Madho Tanda, [[Pilibhit]], [[India]]. It extends {{convert|960|km|mi}} through [[Uttar Pradesh]] and meets the Ganges near Saidpur, Kaithi, {{convert|27|km}} from [[Varanasi district]].

It meets a small river, the Gaihaaee,{{convert|20|km|mi}} from its origin. The Gomti is a narrow [[stream]] until it reaches Mohammadi Kheri, a [[tehsil]] of [[Lakhimpur Kheri district]] (about 100&amp;nbsp;km from its origin), where it is joined by [[Tributary|tributaries]] such as the Sukheta, Choha and Andhra Choha. The river is then well-defined, with the Kathina tributary joining it at [[Mailani]] and Sarayan joining it at a village in [[Sitapur district]]. A major tributary is the Sai River, which joins the Gomti near [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]]. The Markandey Mahadeo temple is at the [[confluence]] of the Gomti and the Ganges.

After {{convert|240|km|mi}} the Gomti enters [[Lucknow]], meandering through the city for about {{convert|12|km|mi|0}} and supplying its water. In the Lucknow area, 25 city drains pour untreated sewage into the river. At the downstream end, the Gomti [[Barrage (dam)|barrage]] converts the river into a lake.

In addition to Lucknow, [[Lakhimpur Kheri]], [[Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh|Sultanpur]] [[Kerakat]] and [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]]  are the most prominent of the 15 towns in the river's [[Drainage basin|catchment basin]]. The river cuts the [[Sultanpur district]] and [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]] in half, becoming wider in the city.

=={{anchor|Pollution and degradation}}Pollution==
[[File:Gomati River.JPG|thumb|300px|left|alt=The Gomti and its floodplain, winding through an undeveloped area|The Gomti in [[Sitapur district]]]]
The Gomti River is polluted at several points of its course through the {{convert|940|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[alluvial plain]]s in [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-28/lucknow/28356526_1_river-water-aquatic-life-raw-water | title =  Aiming for a scrubbed clean look | date = 2010-01-28| accessdate= 2010-01-28 | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of pollution are industrial waste and [[effluent]] from sugar factories and distilleries and residential wastewater and sewage.

The river and its tributaries, such as Kukrail Drainage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ballotboxindia.com/ap/kukrail-nala-lucknow/5182050549/|title=Kukrail Nala Lucknow a Major tributary of river Gomti  - Research and analysis|date=2016-07-12|newspaper=Kukrail Nala Lucknow a Major tributary of river Gomti  - Research and analysis|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; collect large amounts of human and industrial pollutants as they flow through an area of about 18 million people. High pollution levels threaten the Gomti's aquatic life. On 25 July 2008, the foundation stone of a {{convert|345|e6litre|USgal|adj=on}}-capacity [[sewage treatment]] plant was laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.oneindia.in/2008/07/25/foundation-laid-for-countrys-largest-stp-to-clean-gomti-in-up-1216972984.html | title =  Foundation laid for country's largest STP to clean Gomti in UP | date = 2008-07-25| accessdate= 2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant, promoted as Asia's largest, failed; in 2014 it was reportedly running at 10 percent of capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/asias-biggest-sewage-treatment-plant-running-at-10-pc-capacity/|title=Asia’s biggest sewage treatment plant running at 10 pc capacity|date=2014-12-03|newspaper=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond the plant (near Bharwara) untreated sewage and solid waste entered the river. The plant was intended to intercept the 23 major natural drains entering the Gomti.

[[File:Gomti riverfront- Reclaimed riverbed and flood plain.jpg|alt=Gomti riverfront construction - riverbed and floodplain|thumb|Gomti riverfront reclaimed riverbed and floodplain]]
The Gomti has been stressed, particularly in and around Lucknow, for decades.  There are three major issues:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ballotboxindia.com/ap/gomti-river-riverfront-lucknow/5182018549/|title=Gomti River and Riverfront Lucknow - Analysis on Restoration and Development|date=2016-02-10|newspaper=Gomti River and Riverfront Lucknow - Analysis on Restoration and Development|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Embankments - High embankments were built around the river to  protect the population of Lucknow after a major flood during 1970s, altering the Gomti's natural [[floodplain]]. 
# Pollution - The Gomti has 40 natural drains, of which 23 are major. The drains, which carried surplus water into the river during the monsoon and recharged the underground water table, were reduced to carry residential and industrial sewage into the river.
# Development - The river's floodplains and fertile land were covered with residential areas, such as Gomti Nagar and Triveni Nagar. The Gomti began receding during the late 1970s, and was under major stress in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although government agencies planned major projects, such as the Bharwara sewage treatment plant and mechanical dredging, most were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/River-linking-urgent-as-Gomti-gasps-for-water/articleshow/43836247.cms|title=River linking urgent as Gomti gasps for water - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gomti rises by 10–12 meters during the monsoon, and in 2008 a major flood was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-flood-waters-enter-parts-of-lucknow-1185886|title=Flood waters enter parts of Lucknow {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2008-08-26|newspaper=dna|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2012, the newly-elected government and the Lucknow Development Authority began a feasibility study with the [[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee]] to build a river-front similar to [[Sabarmati Riverfront]] in Ahmedabad. The LDA submitted the report, warning about the negative consequences of reducing the Gomti to less than 250 meters wide. At 250 meters wide (with walls on both sides), the river's velocity would increase by 20 percent and its bed-shear stress by 30 percent. Current embankments would have to be raised by 1.5 meters, and the high flood level (HFL) would increase by 1.25 meters. Two bridges would be threatened with collapse under flood conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
The plan was given to the irrigation department, which signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT Roorkee in December 2015 to conduct a similar study on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ballotboxindia.com/es/Contacting-IIT-Roorkee-for-relevant-information/5181159616549/|title=Contacting IIT Roorkee for relevant information|website=Contacting IIT Roorkee for relevant information|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riverfront-development project is seen as a political showdown&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; between the state government and the ruling party, whose similar construction in Ahmedabad over the [[Sabarmati River]] has been projected as a showcase of development in the state of [[Gujarat]]. Many noted environmentalists and river-system experts vehemently opposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sandrp.wordpress.com/2014/09/17/riverfront-development-in-india-cosmetic-make-up-on-deep-wounds/|title=Riverfront Development in India: Cosmetic make up on deep wounds|last=Sandrp|date=2014-09-17|website=SANDRP|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; that project as well.
Both projects are seen as a template for similar interference with river systems across India, including the [[Yamuna]], the [[Hindon River|Hindon]] and the [[Varuna River|Varuna]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Flooding==
Monsoon flooding leads to several problems when the water recedes, including the danger posed by drying potholes and pits (which host disease causing mosquitoes such as [[malaria]] and [[dengue]]).

'''Hyperreligiosity''' is a psychiatric disturbance in which a person experiences intense religious beliefs or experiences that interfere with normal functioning.  Hyperreligiosity generally includes [[delusions|abnormal beliefs]] and a focus on religious content, which interferes with work and social functioning.  Hyperreligiosity may occur in a variety of disorders including [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=D. M.|last2=Novelly|first2=R. A.|last3=Walker|first3=P.

[[Image:Bouguereau-Linnocence.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]'s ''L'Innocence'':  Women, young children and lambs are all symbols of innocence.]]
[[File:Prud'hon, Pierre Paul - Venus Bathing or Innocence - c. 1810.JPG|thumb|''Innocence'' by [[Pierre Paul Prud'hon]], circa 1810]]
'''Innocence''' is a lack of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], with respect to any kind of [[crime]], or wrongdoing. In a [[Criminal law|legal context]], innocence is to the lack of [[guilt (law)|legal guilt]] of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.

==In relation to knowledge==
Innocence can imply lesser [[experience]] in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale.  In contrast to ''[[ignorance]]'', it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong.  This connotation may be connected with a popular [[false etymology]] explaining "innocent" as meaning "not knowing" (Latin ''noscere'' (To know, learn)). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix ''in-'' and the Latin ''nocere'', "[[to harm]]".

People who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior.  From this meaning comes the usage of ''innocent'' as a noun to refer to a child under the [[Age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]], or a person, of any age, who is severely [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]]. “Nonetheless, the word, innocence, is used to describe childhood innocence as a notion created and controlled by adults. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau describes 'childhood as a time of innocence' where children are 'not-knowing' and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, this is not the case anymore as technology advances, this has given children in the contemporary world a platform where they are referred to as 'digital natives', where they are seen more knowledgeable than adults &lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Danah, 1977-. It's Complicated: the Social Lives of Networked Teens. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, because of digital media and internet, young people have become well-informed of the world around and have a better understanding.

==Pejorative meaning==
In some cases, the term "innocence" has a [[pejorative]] meaning, where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience.  Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]], innocence is often also used to imply naiveté or lack of personal experience.

==Symbolism==
The [[domestic sheep|lamb]] is a commonly used symbol of innocence's nature. In [[Christianity]], for example, [[Jesus]] is referred to as the "Lamb of God", thus emphasizing his sinless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Freemasonry: Its Symbolism, Religious Nature, and Law of Perfection'' (March 10, 2003)|isbn=978-0766142015|publisher=By [[Chalmers I. Paton]] (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other symbols of innocence include [[child]]ren, [[virginity|virgins]], [[acacia]] branches (especially in [[Freemasonry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Numismatist'' (1903)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Numismatist.html?id=WpEUAAAAYAAJ|publisher=By [[American Numismatic Association]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-sexual nudity, songbirds and the color [[white]] (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge'' (1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_Americana.html?id=r8BPAAAAMAAJ|publisher=By [[Encyclopedia Americana|Encyclopedia Americana Corporation]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of innocence==
A "loss of innocence" is a common theme in [[fiction]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], and [[Literary realism|realism]]. It is often seen as an integral part of [[coming of age]]. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Saul|last=Levitt |url=http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/interpret.html |title=Interpretation of American Pie - analysis, news, Don McLean, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=Missamericanpie.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; poetry like [[William Blake]]'s collection [[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]] and novels like ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', and ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.

By contrast, the [[I ching|''I Ching'']] urges a recovery of innocence - the name given to Hexagram 25 - and "encourages you to ''actively practice innocence''".&lt;ref&gt;B. B. Walker trans, ''The I Ching or Book of Changes'' (1993) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Innocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the "loss" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stems from this discourse. It was during the 19th century when childhood became synonymous with "innocence", however not all children were considered to be innocent during that time, as it was highly dependent on the colour of one's skin. The term innocence being connected to "white childhood" was a way to racialize childhood and exclude the non-whites not only from "innocence" but from childhood as well.

==In psychoanalysis==
The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] tradition is broadly divided between those (like [[W. R. D. Fairbairn|Fairbairn]] and [[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]]) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or [[psychological trauma]]; and those (like [[Freud]] and [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]) who see the child as ''developing'' innocence - maturing into it - as a result of surmounting the [[Oedipus complex]] and/or the depressive position.&lt;ref&gt;N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. xiv-xv&lt;/ref&gt;

More eclectically, [[Eric Berne]] saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the cliches of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and "the sweet phrases of charming innocence".&lt;ref&gt;E. Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In a rather different formulation, [[Christopher Bollas]] used the term 'Violent Innocence' to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;S. Cavanagh, ''Skin, Culture and Psychoanalysis'' (2013) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; - something akin to what he calls "the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sidelights==
*In ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'', a woman looks back in laughing envy at the innocence that had previously allowed her to submerge herself in the position of the 'woman-in-love'.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ivy Compton-Burnett]] had one character conclude dourly of another two that "you are both of you innocent though it is an innocence rooted in your wishes for your own lives".&lt;ref&gt;I. Compton-Burnett, ''The Last and the First'' (1971) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic influences on Western art''' refers to the influence of [[Islamic art]], the artistic production in the [[Islamic world]] from the 8th to the 19th century, on [[Christian art]]. During this period, the frontier between [[Christendom]] and the Islamic world varied a lot resulting in some cases in exchanges of populations and of corresponding art practices and techniques. Furthermore, the two civilizations had regular relationships through diplomacy and trade that facilitated cultural exchanges.  Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen.  [[Islamic glass|Glass production]], for example, remained a [[Jewish]] speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in [[Coptic art|Coptic Egypt]] continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.

Islamic decorative arts were highly valued imports to Europe throughout the Middle Ages; largely because of unsuspected accidents of survival the majority of surviving examples are those that were in the possession of the church.  In the early period textiles were especially important, used for church vestments, shrouds, hangings and clothing for the elite.  Islamic pottery of everyday quality was still preferred to European wares.  Because decoration was mostly ornamental, or small hunting scenes and the like, and inscriptions were not understood, Islamic objects did not offend Christian sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=3–8, and throughout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early centuries of Islam the most important points of contact between the Latin West and the Islamic world from an artistic point of view were Southern Italy and Sicily and the Iberian peninsula, which both held significant Muslim populations.  Later the [[Italian maritime republic]]s were important in trading artworks. In the  [[Crusades]] Islamic art seems to have had relatively little influence even on the [[Crusader art]] of the [[Crusader kingdom]]s, though it may have stimulated the desire for Islamic imports among Crusaders returning to Europe.

Numerous techniques from [[Islamic art]] formed the basis of art in the [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture]] of [[Norman Sicily]], much of which used Muslim artists and craftsmen working in the style of their own tradition.  Techniques included inlays in [[mosaic]]s or [[metal]]s, [[ivory carving]] or [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], sculpture of hard stones, and bronze [[Foundry|foundries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aubé|2006|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Iberia the [[Mozarabic art and architecture]] of the Christian population living under Muslim rule remained very Christian in most ways, but showed Islamic influences in other respects; much what was described as this is now called [[Repoblación art and architecture]]. After the [[Reconquista]]  [[Mudéjar]] styles produced by Muslim or [[Morisco]] artists now under Christian rule showed clear Islamic influence in many ways.

==Middle Ages==
[[File:hispanomoresque.JPG|thumb|right|350px|[[Hispano-Moresque]] dish, approx 32cm diameter, with Christian monogram "[[Christogram|IHS]]", decorated in cobalt blue and gold lustre, [[Valencia]], c.1430-1500.]]
Islamic art was widely imported and admired by European elites during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sumay/hd_sumay.htm The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline] Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards.  Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|Fleming|1982|pp=256–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted [[tile]]s, from as early as 862-3 (at the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] of [[Kairouan]] in modern [[Tunisia]]), which also spread to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|Fleming|1982|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[John Ruskin]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]] contains "three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world.&amp;nbsp;... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, paras 25 and 29]; discussed pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56 here [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzI3Pf0TSn4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Ruskin+Orientalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TF5qlcqm2M&amp;sig=PwSUx7Ghq5kozj-Y7AIWLOxPlk8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3AqjTfWYOpG4hAfP2tDWCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruskin%20Orientalism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the [[Balkans]], all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian [[Crusade]]rs equally ruled Islamic populations. [[Crusader art]] is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the [[Mozarabic art]] of Christians in [[Al Andaluz]] seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at [[Moissac]] in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the [[lintel]] above, and also in having ''Christ in Majesty'' surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their [[Divan (furniture)|diwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=206–209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calligraphy]], ornament and the [[decorative arts]] generally were more important than in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dalu &amp; Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 9, 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hispano-Moresque]] pottery wares of Spain were first produced in Al-Andaluz, but Muslim potters then seem to have emigrated to the area of Christian [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], where they produced work that was exported to Christian elites across Europe;&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, chapters 6 &amp; 7&lt;/ref&gt; other types of Islamic luxury goods, notably silk textiles and carpets, came from the generally wealthier&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], ''An Unfinished History of the World'', 224-226, 2nd edn. 1981, Pan Books, {{ISBN|0-330-26458-3}}; [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]], ''Civilization &amp; Capitalism, 15-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life'', William Collins &amp; Sons, London 1981, p. 440: "If medieval Islam towered over the Old Continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific for centuries on end, it was because no state (Byzantium apart) could compete with its gold and silver money&amp;nbsp;..."; and Vol 3: ''The Perspective of the World'', 1984, {{ISBN|0-00-216133-8}}, p. 106: "For them [the Italian maritime republics], success meant making contact with the rich regions of the Mediterranean - and obtaining gold currencies, the dinars of Egypt or Syria,&amp;nbsp;...

===Decorative arts===
[[File:Late Medieval Trade Routes.jpg|thumb|Map showing the main trade routes of late medieval Europe.]]
A wide variety of portable objects from various [[decorative arts]] were imported from the Islamic world into Europe during the Middle Ages, mostly through Italy, and above all Venice.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Mack's book; see Chapter 1 especially.&lt;/ref&gt;  In many areas European-made goods could not match the quality of Islamic or Byzantine work until near the end of the Middle Ages.  Luxury textiles were widely used for clothing and hangings and also, fortunately for art history, also often as shrouds for the burials of important figures, which is how most surviving examples were preserved.  In this area [[Byzantine silk]] was influenced by [[Sassanian]] textiles, and Islamic silk by both, so that is hard to say which culture's textiles had the greatest influence on the [[Cloth of St Gereon]], a large [[tapestry]] which is the earliest and most important European imitation of Eastern work.  European, especially Italian, cloth gradually caught up with the quality of Eastern imports, and adopted many elements of their designs.

Byzantine pottery was not produced in high-quality types, as the Byzantine elite used silver instead.  Islam has many [[hadith]]ic injunctions against eating off precious metal, and so developed many varieties of fine pottery, often influenced by the [[Chinese porcelain]] wares which had the highest status among the Islamic elites themselves — the Islamic only produced porcelain in the modern period.  Much Islamic pottery was imported into Europe, dishes ("bacini") even in Islamic [[Al-Andaluz]] in the 13th century, in [[Granada]] and [[Málaga]], where much of the production was already exported to Christian countries.  Many of the potters migrated to the area of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], long reconquered by the Christians, and production here outstripped that of Al-Andaluz.  Styles of decoration gradually became more influenced by Europe, and by the 15th century the Italians were also producing lustrewares, sometimes using Islamic shapes like the [[albarello]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Chapters 6 and 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Metalwork forms like the zoomorphic jugs called [[aquamanile]] and the bronze [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] were also introduced from the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Michell|1976|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mudéjar art in Spain===
{{Main article|Mudéjar}}
Mudéjar art is a style influenced by Islamic art that developed from the 12th century until the 16th century in the Iberia's Christian kingdoms. It is the consequence of the ''{{Lang|es|convivencia}}'' between the Muslim, Christian and Jewish populations in medieval Spain.  The elaborate decoration typical of Mudéjar style fed into the development of the later [[Plateresque]] style in Spanish architecture, combining with late Gothic and Early Renaissance elements.

===Pseudo-Kufic===
[[File:Limoges enamel ciborium pseudo Kufic circa 1200.jpg|thumb|Master Alpais' [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], circa 1200 with rim engraved with Arabic script, [[Limoges]], [[France]], 1215-30. Louvre Museum MRR 98.]]
{{Main article|Pseudo-Kufic}}
The [[Arabic]] [[Kufic]] script was often imitated in the West during the Middle-Ages and the Renaissance, to produce what is known as [[pseudo-Kufic]]: ''"Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration"''.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous cases of pseudo-Kufic are known in European religious art from around the 10th to the 15th century. Pseudo-Kufic would be used as writing or as decorative elements in textiles, religious [[halos]] or frames. Many are visible in the paintings of [[Giotto]].&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"/&gt;

Examples are known of the incorporation of Kufic script such as a 13th French Master Alpais' [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] at the [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;ref group="N"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en |work=Louvre museum website |author=Muriel Barbier |title=Master Alpais' ciborium – Master G.

===Architecture===
====Arab-Norman culture in Sicily====
{{Main article|Arab-Norman culture}}
Christian buildings such as the [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], incorporated Islamic elements, probably usually created by local Muslim craftsmen working in their own traditions. The ceiling at the Cappella, with its wooden vault arches and gilded figurines,  has close parallels with Islamic buildings in [[Fes|Fez]] and [[Fustat]], and reflect the ''[[Muqarnas]]'' ([[stalactite]]) technique of emphasizing three-dimensional elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleinhenz|Barker|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=spKxJeHJgTAC&amp;pg=PA835 835]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[diaphragm arch]], [[Late Antique]] in origin, was widely used in Islamic architecture, and may have spread from Spain to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bony|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 306]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Saracen style" ====
[[File:The Liwan or Sanctuary of the Mosque of Ibn-Tuloon (1878) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|left|The Liwan or Sanctuary of the Mosque of Ibn-Tuloon (1878)&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Ebers, Georg. "Egypt: Descriptive, Historical, and Picturesque." Volume 1. Cassell &amp; Company, Limited: New York, 1878. p 213&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Scholars of the 18&amp;ndash;19th century, who generally preferred [[Classical art]], disliked what they saw as the "disorder" of [[Gothic art]] and perceived similarities between Gothic and Islamic  architecture.  They often overstated the case that Gothic art fully originated in the Islamic art of the [[Mosque]], to the point of calling it "[[Saracens|Saracenical]]". [[William John Hamilton]] commented on the [[Seljuks]] monuments in [[Konya]]: "The more I saw of this peculiar style, the more I became convinced that the Gothic was derived from it, with a certain mixture of Byzantine (...) the origin of this Gotho-Saracenic style may be traced to the manners and habits of the Saracens"&lt;ref group="N"&gt;William John Hamilton (1842) ''Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=s8tJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA206 p.206]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schiffer|1999|p=141 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fhcYwZIGd94C&amp;pg=PA141]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century English historian [[Thomas Warton]]  summarized:
{{quote|"The marks which constitute the character of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Saracen]]ical architecture, are, its numerous and prominent [[buttress]]es, its lofty [[spire]]s and [[pinnacle]]s, its large and ramified windows, its ornamental niches or [[Canopy (building)|canopies]], its sculptured saints, the delicate lace-work of its fretted roofs, and the profusion of ornaments lavished indiscriminately over the whole building: but its peculiar distinguishing characteristics are, the small cluttered pillars and pointed arches, formed by the segments of two interfering circles"|[[Thomas Warton]] ''Essays on Gothic architecture''&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Thomas Warton (1802), ''Essays on Gothic architecture'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=FCoBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA119 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Pointed arch ====
{{Further information|Gothic architecture|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman architecture}}

[[File:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|thumb|upright|Ambulatory of [[Basilique Saint-Denis]], origin of Gothic architecture in France. Facade and choir 1135-44, nave from 1231 onwards]]

The [[pointed arch]] originated in the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] empires, where it mostly appears in early [[Church architecture|Christian church buildings]], although engineering works such as the Byzantine [[Karamagara Bridge]] also showed it fully developed at an early stage.&lt;ref name="Warren 61-63"/&gt; The priority of the Byzantines in its use is also evidenced by slightly pointed examples in [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe|Sant'Apollinare in Classe]], [[Ravenna]], and the [[Hagia Irene]], [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Warren 61-63"/&gt; The pointed arch was subsequently adopted and widely used by Muslim architects, becoming the characteristic arch of Islamic architecture.&lt;ref name="Warren 61-63"&gt;{{Citation |last = Warren |first = John | year =  1991 |title = Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture |periodical = Muqarnas |volume = 8 |pages = 59–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bony, it has spread from Islamic lands, possibly through [[Sicily]], then under Islamic rule, and from there to [[Amalfi]] in [[Italy]], before the end of the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Bony 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bony|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner p.342"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleiner|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PT342 342]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pointed arch reduced architectural thrust by about 20% and therefore had practical advantages over the semi-circular [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] arch for the building of large structures.&lt;ref name="Bony 17"/&gt;

Oleg Grabar refers to unspecified speculation that the [[Rose window]] may have Islamic origins as unlikely. "While not excluded on purely chronological grounds since its earliest known instance is in the [[Ummayad]] palace at [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]], this conclusion seems highly suspect to me... that both cultures were frequently operating on practically the same kind of 'track' is further suggested by the visual and aesthetic similarities between the ornamental values of flamboyant vaults and Islamic architectural decoration. It is not very likely that a direct impact of one on the other can be demonstrated, and we are certainly dealing with parallel growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grabar|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_CS4n8kca9cC&amp;pg=PA387 387]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Islamic architecture, the Gothic style was influenced by Roman architecture.&lt;ref name="Bony, 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bony|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 12]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Templar churches====
[[File:Seal of Templars.jpg|thumb|Seal of the Knights Templar featuring a domed building, whether from a dome from Al-Aqsa, the Dome of the Rock or the aedicula of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]]]
In 1119, the [[Knights Templar]] received as headquarters part of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in Jerusalem, considered by the crusaders the [[Temple of Solomon]], from which the order took its common name.
The typical [[round church]]es built by the Knights across Western Europe, such as the London [[Temple Church]], are probably inspired in the shape of Al-Aqsa or its neighbor [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[God and Enchantment of Place]]: Reclaiming Human Experience'', [[David Brown (theologian)|David Brown]], Oxford University Press, 2004, page 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic elements in Renaissance art==
[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 015.jpg|thumb|[[Pseudo-Kufic]] script in the [[Virgin Mary]]'s [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], detail of ''Adoration of the Magi'' (1423) by [[Gentile da Fabriano]]. The script is further divided by [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s like those on [[Mamluk]] dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Pseudo-Kufic===
Pseudo-Kufic is a decorative motif which resembles Kufic script and occurs in many [[Italian Renaissance painting]]s.  The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic in early Renaissance works is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13th&amp;ndash;14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=52, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"In Renaissance art, pseudo-Kufic script was used to decorate the costumes of [[Old Testament]] heroes like David"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tsiIvJ16AU0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Pseudo-Kufic&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=en Freider. p.84]&lt;/ref&gt; Mack states another hypothesis: {{quote|Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Oriental carpets===

{{Main article|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Verrocchio Madonna with Saint John the Baptist and Donatus 1475 1483.jpg|thumb|[[Verrocchio]]'s ''Madonna with Saint John the Baptist and Donatus'' 1475-1483 with small-pattern Holbein Islamic carpet at her feet.]]
[[Carpet]]s of [[Middle-Eastern]] origin, either from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Levant]] or the [[Mamluk]] state of [[Egypt]] or [[Northern Africa]], were used as important decorative features in [[paintings]] from the 13th century onwards, and especially in religious painting, starting from the Medieval period and continuing into the Renaissance period.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.73-93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=73–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such carpets were often integrated into Christian imagery as symbols of luxury and status of Middle-Eastern origin, and together with [[Pseudo-Kufic]] script offer an interesting example of the integration of Eastern elements into European painting.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.73-93"/&gt;

[[Transylvanian rugs|Anatolian rugs were used in Transylvania]] as decoration in Evangelical churches.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Ionescu| first1=Stefano| title=Antique Ottoman Rugs in Transylvania| date=2005| publisher=Verduci Editore| location=Rome| edition=1st| url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/01.pdf| accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic costumes===
[[Image:Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti 001.jpg|thumb|15th-century [[Mamluks]] depicted in ''The Arrest of St. Mark from the Synagogue'', [[Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti]], 1499.]] 
Islamic individuals and costumes often provided the contextual backdrop to describe an evangelical scene. This was particularly visible in a set of Venetian paintings in which contemporary [[Syrian]], [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and especially [[Mamluk]] personages are employed anachronistically in paintings describing [[Biblical]] situations.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.161"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example in point is the 15th century ''[[:File:Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti 001.jpg|The Arrest of St. Mark from the Synagogue]]'' by [[Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti]] which accurately describes contemporary (15th century) Alexandrian Mamluks arresting [[Saint Mark]] in an historic scene of the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.161"/&gt; Another case is [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''[[:File:Gentile Bellini 001.jpg|Saint Mark Preaching in Alexandria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornament===
A Western style of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] based on the Islamic [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] developed, beginning in late 15th century [[Venice]]; it has been called either [[moresque]] or [[Arabesque (European art)|western arabesque]] (a term with a complicated history).  It has been used in a great variety of the [[decorative arts]] but has been especially long-lived in book design and [[bookbinding]], where small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.  It is seen in gold tooling on covers, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harthan|1961|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Renaissance ornament styles it was disseminated by [[ornament print]]s which were bought as patterns by craftsmen in a variety of trades.  Peter Furhring, a leading specialist in the history of ornament, says that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns.  These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fuhring|1994|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elaborate book bindings with Islamic designs can be seen in religious paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=125–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[:File:San Zeno Altarpiece.jpg|Saint John the Baptist and Zeno]]'', [[John the Baptist|Saint John]] and [[Zeno of Verona|Zeno]] hold exquisite books with covers displaying Mamluk-style center-pieces, of a type also used in contemporary Italian book-binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Maya civilization}}

'''Jacawitz''' ({{IPA|/χäkäˈwits/}}) (also spelt '''Jakawitz''', '''Jakawits''', '''Q'aq'awits''' and '''Hacavitz''') was a mountain [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|god]] of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of highland [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.369.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage and was a companion of the sun god [[Tohil]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.370.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that he received [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.370.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''jacawitz'' means "mountain" in the lowland [[Maya languages|Maya language]], and the word ''q'aq'awitz'' of the highland Maya means "fire mountain", which suggests that Jacawitz was mainly a fire deity, much like Tohil. In the [[Mam language]], the similar word ''xq'aqwitz'' means "yellow wasp" and the wasp was an important symbol of the deity and its associated lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, pp.198-199.n.553.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ch'ol language|Cholan languages]], ''jacawitz'' means "first mountain", linking the god with the first mountain of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.211.n.585.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the K'iche' epic [[Popul Vuh]], the first people gathered at the mythical place [[Tollan]] to receive their gods, and Mahucutah, one of the gathered K'iche' lords, received Jacawitz.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.198.&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-9th century Stela 8 at the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] lowland Maya site of [[Seibal]] describes a visitor to the city named Hakawitzil. This is an early spelling of Jacawitz and [[Mayanist]]s [[Linda Schele]] and Peter Mathews have proposed that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the [[Founding myth|foundation legends]] of the K'iche'.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.190-193.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being mentioned frequently in the Popul Vuh, Jacawitz is also mentioned in the K'iche' document ''Título de los Señores de Totonicapán''.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, pp.173, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacawitz was one of a triad of K'iche' deities, the other two being Tohil and the goddess [[Awilix]], all three were sometimes collectively referred to as Tohil, the principal member of the triad.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.228.n.646.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a trinity of deities was an ancient one in Maya culture, dating back to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.61.n.65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple of Jacawitz==
The Ahaw K'iche' were the founding lineage of the K'iche' Maya, although they later lost power to the Kaweq lineage; as they lost status within the kingdom, so did their patron god.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.369. van Akkeren, Ruud 2002, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple of Jacawitz at the K'iche' capital of [[Q'umarkaj]] was one of the three tallest buildings in the city, although it faced away from the main plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.268.n.821.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is a large mound south of the plaza, its stonework has been stripped away making its original form uncertain, although a 19th-century plan of the city recorded it as a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003, 2007, p.269.n.823.&lt;/ref&gt; This pyramid temple was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace on the south side and a long building on the east.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.367.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jakawitz temple complex has not yet been investigated archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.367.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century drawings by Miguel Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 2001a, p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lashkar-e-Omar''' (The Army of Omar)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/terroristoutfits/LeO.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is a Pakistani [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] terrorist organisation.  The group, formed in January 2002, is a mixture of elements from three other terrorist groups: [[Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami]], [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]], and [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]].  It also includes members of the [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda]].  Its reported mission is to attack [[United States|Americans]] in Pakistan.  The current leader is [[Qari Abdul Hai]], also known as Qari Asadullah alias Talha.

Several events have been linked to the group.  It was reportedly behind a grenade attack on a church in [[Islamabad]] on 17 March 2002, which resulted in five deaths and 41 injuries.  Two of the deaths were of a wife and daughter of a US diplomat.  A couple of months later on 8 May a suicide bomber detonated outside a [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotel in [[Karachi]].  Again in Karachi 10 people were killed when the US consulate was attacked on 14 June.  Finally on 28 October 2002, a church in [[Bahawalpur]] in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], was attacked by six gunmen, killing 17 Christians and a police officer.  Some of its members are also allegedly connected to the murder of US journalist [[Daniel Pearl]].

This article lists the '''longest church buildings in the world''' as measured by various criteria.

==Scope==
The term ''[[wiktionary:church|church]]'' is open to interpretation and debate. However, for the purposes of this article, it will be used to mean any [[church (building)|building]] which was built for the primary purpose of Christian worship, for any recognised denomination of Christianity. This includes all [[cathedral]]s (the seat of a [[bishop]]), [[basilica]]s, and other types of churches. It does '''not''' include temples of other religions, e.g. [[mosque]]s, [[synagogue]]s. It does include at least one building, [[Hagia Sophia]], which was built as a church but later became a mosque (and is now a museum).

The "Saint's day" is marked with numerous cultic displays, some liturgical, others deriving from popular piety...To the faithful, shrines represent a memorial to an original extraordinary event which has given rise to persistent devotion, or a witness to the piety and gratitude of a people that has received many benefits&lt;/ref&gt; This list is organized accorded to the level of approval, type of revelation, and chronology and includes a brief line about the revelation, its recipient, which church official approved of it, and an except from a church document about it being approved.

===Jesus===

====Helfta, Thuringia (13th century)====

The visions of Jesus to Saint [[Mechtilde of Hackeborn]] were approved by Pope [[Benedict XVI]].

:However, the Lord reassured her, making her realize that all that had been written was for the glory of God and for the benefit of her neighbour (cf. ibid., II, 25; V, 20).&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20100929.html Pope Benedict XVI, September 29, 2010 General Audience]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eisleben, Thuringia (13th century)====

The visions of Jesus to Saint [[Gertrude the Great]] were approved by Benedict XVI.

:On 27 January 1281, a few days before the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, towards the hour of Compline in the evening, the Lord with his illumination dispelled her deep anxiety. With gentle sweetness he calmed the distress that anguished her, a torment that Gertrude saw even as a gift of God, "to pull down that tower of vanity and curiosity which, although I had both the name and habit of a nun alas I had continued to build with my pride, so that at least in this manner I might find the way for you to show me your salvation" (ibid., II, p. 87). She had a vision of a young man who, in order to guide her through the tangle of thorns that surrounded her soul, took her by the hand. In that hand Gertrude recognized "the precious traces of the wounds that abrogated all the acts of accusation of our enemies" (ibid., II, 1, p. 89), and thus recognized the One who saved us with his Blood on the Cross: Jesus. &lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20101006.html Pope Benedict XVI, October 6, 2010 General Audience]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uppland, Sweden (13th century)====
The visions of Jesus to Saint [[Bridget of Sweden]] were, according to Benedict XVI, approved by Pope [[John Paul II]].

:The value of St Bridget's Revelations, sometimes the object of criticism Venerable John Paul II explained in his Letter Spes Aedificandi: “The Church, which recognized Bridget's holiness without ever pronouncing on her individual revelations, has accepted the overall authenticity of her interior experience” (n. 5).&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20101027.html Pope Benedict XVI, Oct 27, 2010 General Audience]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paray, France (1673-1675)====
The apparitions of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] to Saint [[Margaret Mary Alacoque]] were approved by Pope [[Pius XI]].

:For when Christ manifested Himself to Margaret Mary, and declared to her the infinitude of His love, at the same time, in the manner of a mourner, He complained that so many and such great injuries were done to Him by ungrateful men - and we would that these words in which He made this complaint were fixed in the minds of the faithful, and were never blotted out by oblivion...&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19280508_miserentissimus-redemptor.html Pope Pius XI, Miserentissimus Redemptor n. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Krakow, Poland (1931-1938)====
The apparitions of the [[Divine Mercy]] to Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]] were approved by Pope John Paul II.

:Today, therefore, in this Shine, I wish solemnly to entrust the world to Divine Mercy. I do so with the burning desire that the message of God’s merciful love, proclaimed here through Saint Faustina, may be made known to all the peoples of the earth and fill their hearts with hope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20020817_shrine-divine-mercy.html Pope John Paul II, Dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy n. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary===

====Guadalupe, Mexico (1531)====
The five apparitions of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] of Extremadura to Saint [[Juan Diego]] were approved by Pope John Paul II.

:Dear Brothers in the episcopate and dear sons and daughters, how deep is my joy that the first steps of my pilgrimage, as Successor of Paul VI and John Paul I, bring me precisely here. They bring me to you, Mary, in this shrine of the people of Mexico and of the whole of Latin America, the shrine in which for so many centuries your motherhood has been manifested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/homilies/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19790127_messico-guadalupe.html Pope John Paul II, Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rue du Bac, France (1830)====
The three apparitions of the [[Miraculous Medal]] to Saint [[Catherine Labouré]] were approved by [[Pope Pius XII]].

:In many ways the nineteenth century was to become, after the turmoil of the Revolution, a century of Marian favors. To mention but a single instance, everyone is familiar today with the "miraculous medal." This medal, with its image of "Mary conceived without sin," was revealed to a humble daughter of Saint Vincent de Paul whom We had the joy of inscribing in the catalogue of Saints, and it has spread its spiritual and material wonders everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_02071957_le-pelerinage-de-lourdes.pdf Pope Pius XII, Le Pelerinage de Lourdes n. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lourdes, France (1858)====
The eighteen apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] to Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]] were approved by Pope Pius XII.

:A few years later, from February 11 to July 16, 1858, the Blessed Virgin Mary was pleased, as a new favor, to manifest herself in the territory of the Pyrenees to a pious and pure child of a poor, hardworking, Christian family. "She came to Bernadette," We once said. "She made her her confidante, her collaboratrix, the instrument of her maternal tenderness and of the merciful power of her Son, to restore the world in Christ through a new and incomparable outpouring of the Redemption."&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_02071957_le-pelerinage-de-lourdes.pdf Pope Pius XII, Le Pelerinage de Lourdes n. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Knock, Ireland (1879)====
The vision of [[Our Lady of Knock]] to Dominick Byrne, Margaret Byrne, Mary Byrne, Patrick Byrne, Judith Campbell, John Curry, John Durkan, Hugh Flatley, Patrick Hill, Mary McLoughlin, Catherine Murray, Bridget Trench and Patrick Walsh was approved by Pope John Paul II.

:Here I am at the goal of my journey to Ireland : the Shrine of Our Lady at Knock. Since I first learnt of the centenary of this Shrine, which is being celebrated this year, I have felt a strong desire to come here, the desire to make yet another pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Mother of Christ, the Mother of the Church, the Queen of Peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/homilies/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19790930_irlanda-knock.html Pope John Paul II, Visit to the Shrine of Knock]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fatima, Portugal (1917)====
The six apparitions of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] to Servant of God [[Lucia Santos]] and Saints [[Francisco and Jacinta Marto]] were approved by Pope John Paul II.

:In her motherly concern, the Blessed Virgin came here to Fátima to ask men and women "to stop offending God, Our Lord, who is already very offended". It is a mother's sorrow that compels her to speak; the destiny of her children is at stake. For this reason she asks the little shepherds:  "Pray, pray much and make sacrifices for sinners; many souls go to hell because they have no one to pray and make sacrifices for them".&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/travels/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20000513_beatification-fatima.html Pope John Paul II, Beatification of Francisco and Jacinta n. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episcopal approval==

====Laus, France (1664-1718)====
The apparitions of [[Our Lady of Laus]] to Venerable Benedicta Rencurel were approved by Bishop Jean-Michel de Falco.

:I recognize the supernatural origin of the apparitions and the events and words experienced and narrated by Benedicta Rencurel.  I encourage all of the faithful to come and pray and seek spiritual renewal at this shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_recognizes_marian_apparitions_in_france Bishop Jean-Michel de Falco, May 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Green Bay, Wisconsin (1859)====
The three apparitions of [[National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help|Our Lady of Good Help]] to Adele Brise were approved by Bishop David Ricken.

:It remains to me now, the Twelfth Bishop of the Diocese of Green Bay and the lowliest of the servants of Mary, to declare with moral certainty and in accord with the norms of the Church that the events, apparitions and locutions given to Adele Brise in October of 1859 do exhibit the substance of supernatural character, and I do hereby approve these apparitions as worthy of belief (although not obligatory) by the Christian faithful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shrineofourladyofgoodhelp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/decree_Shrine-of-Our-Lady-of-Good-Help-SIGNED.pdf#page=4&amp;zoom=auto,-99,730 Bishop David Ricken, Decree on the Authenticity of the Apparitions of 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kibeho, Rwanda (1981-1989)====
The apparitions of [[Our Lady of Kibeho]] to Alphonsine Mumureke, Nathalie Mukamazimpaka, and Marie Claire Mukangango were approved by Bishop Augustin Misago.

:Yes, the Virgin Mary appeared at Kibeho on November 28th, 1981 and in the months that followed. There are more reasons to believe in the apparitions than to deny them. Only the three initial testimonies merit being considered authentic; they were given by Alphonsine Mumureke, Nathalie Mukamazimpaka, and by Marie Claire Mukangango.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kibeho-sanctuary.com/index.php/en/apparitions/approval Bishop Augustin Misago, Approval of the Apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Kibeho]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''naming and blessing of a child''' (commonly called a '''baby blessing''') in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is a non-saving [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinance]], usually performed during [[sacrament meeting]] soon after a child's birth in fulfillment of the commandment in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]: "Every member of the church of Christ having children is to bring them unto the elders before the church, who are to lay their hands upon them in the name of Jesus Christ, and bless them in his name."&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;C 20:70.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the practice is twofold: to give a baby an official name and to provide an opportunity to give a blessing for the child's spiritual and physical welfare. This practice is usually only performed for infants, though older children may also receive the blessing; adult or teenaged [[converts]] to the church do not receive a comparable ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Don S. Browning and Bonnie Miller-McLemore, ''Children and Childhood in American Religions'' (2009, {{ISBN|0813546958}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Hammarberg, ''The Mormon Quest for Glory: The Religious World of the Latter-Day Saints'' (2013) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
To offer the blessing, [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] holders—often including priesthood leaders, family members and close friends—gather in a circle and hold the child in their arms or place their hands on the child's head if the child is older. One of them performs the blessing. Typically, this consists of the following:

*Addressing Heavenly Father
*Stating that the blessing is being given by the authority of the Melchizedek priesthood
*Giving a name
*Adding a blessing on the child as directed by the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]]

The blessing is closed in the name of Jesus Christ.

After the blessing has been performed, a certificate is provided that details the date of the blessing and who officiated; it is signed by the presiding officer of the [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] or [[Branch (Mormonism)|branch]]. A membership record is created for children who receive this blessing: they are counted as members of the church and described as "children of record". They remain on the church rolls unless they reach adulthood without being baptized or a request for name removal is received from their legal guardians. Children who were blessed in the church become confirmed members of the church when they receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, normally soon after their eighth birthday.

Naming and blessing of a child usually occurs in the monthly [[fast and testimony meeting]], but may be performed in any sacrament meeting or at a private event attended by the bishop or one of his counselors.&lt;ref name = handbook/&gt;

==Policies and restrictions==
Babies who are born out of wedlock may receive a name and a blessing.&lt;ref name = handbook&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 16.2.&lt;/ref&gt; When one of the child's parents is a non-member, the bishop must receive verbal permission from both parents before the child can be blessed.&lt;ref name = handbook/&gt; If a newborn infant is critically ill, a Melchizedek priesthood holder may bless the child without previous authorization of the bishop.&lt;ref name = handbook/&gt; As of 2015, a natural or adopted child of a parent living in a same-sex relationship, whether the couple is married or cohabiting, may not receive a name and a blessing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 16.13 (2015 amendment).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural aspects ==
It is common for this blessing to be an occasion for family members to gather. In some families, it is also traditional for the baby or older child to be dressed in white clothing similar to a [[christening gown]], but this is not required.

"'''Pallas Athena'''" is a song written by [[David Bowie]] in 1993 for the album ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''.

The name is taken from the Greek goddess, [[Athena]], who is famously depicted in [[Athens|Athenian]] statues under the form of [[Athena|Pallas Athena]]. Hence, the name of the song is a suggestion of religion and icons and sets the mood for a dark piece concerning the power that religion has over man.

The lyrics are rather sparse, but the phrase beginning the piece, "God is on top of it, that's all," delivered as though from an African-American preacher, is ominous and intimidating, accompanied with the sound of strings delivering a sorrowful melody. The piece develops into a [[techno]] dance piece, using string sounds to hold the ominous mood while overlaid atop bass and drums. David Bowie's saxophone playing is amplified into a scream-like sound, which solos, along with [[Lester Bowie]] on trumpet. A lyric, "We are, we are, we are, we are praying," is repeated through the close of the song in a somber, monk-like fashion. Ultimately, the song restates Bowie's interest in how man relates with God.

Bowie used to play a [[drum'n'bass]] version of the song during his 1997 ''[[Earthling (album)|Earthling]]'' tour, and a live version recorded at Paradiso, Holland 10 June 1997 was released as a single under the name Tao Jones Index, a very limited edition only available on 12" vinyl. Bowie played as Tao Jones Index during his performance in a dance tent at Phoenix Festival in 1997. It is a pun based on his birth name, David Jones, and his then recent bond offering to the [[Dow Jones]] Index. [[Tao]], a [[Chinese character]] pronounced "dao," not only stands for the Chinese equivalent to Bowie's first initial, "D", but also has heavy religious implications through its correlation to [[Taoism]], therefore contributing to the religious overtones of "Pallas Athena." The Chinese character 道 means "the way" (the path, the route). 
 
It was announced in March 2010 that a digital download EP would be made available in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbowie.com/news/index.php?id=20100326|title=BowieNet (March 26, 2010) |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2161">[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] '''peak sanctuaries''' are widespread throughout the island of [[Crete]] ([[Greece]]).  Most scholars agree that peak sanctuaries were used for religious rites.  In all peak sanctuaries, human and animal clay figurines have been found.  Clay body parts, also called votive body parts, are also found in most peak sanctuaries.  These open-air sanctuaries are found high in the [[:Category:Mountains_of_Crete|mountains]] of Crete.

==Eastern and east-central peak sanctuaries==
Most peak sanctuaries are found in east and east-central Crete.

* [[Petsofas]] is the only Minoan site with clay weasel and tortoise figurines
* [[Traostalos]]
* [[Kalamafki]] (also Kalamaki)
* [[Ziros Korphi tou Mare]]
* [[Xykephalo]]
* [[Vigla (disambiguation)|Vigla]] (also Viglos)
* [[Zou Prinias]]
* [[Plagia]]
* [[Etiani Kephala]]
* [[Minoan Modi|Modi]]
* [[Thylakas]]
* [[Maza, Crete|Maza]]
* [[Karfi]]

==Central Crete peak sanctuaries==
* [[Mount Juktas|Iouktas]] is probably the earliest of the peak sanctuaries.
* [[Tylissos]] (also Pyrgos Tylissos, ''not'' the same site as Pyrgos)
* [[Gonies Philioremos]]

==Western Crete peak sanctuaries==
* [[Vrysinas]] 
* [[Spili Vorizi]]
* [[Atsipades]] in the Korakias mountains was fully excavated in the 1980s. Its many hundred clay figurines and other ceramics have been analysed in detail and will be presented in a forthcoming publication.

Its common English-language name came about because of a resemblance to [[rue]] (which is not related). The plant's seeds are especially noteworthy because they have seen continual use for thousands of years in the rites of many cultures.&lt;ref name="herbdictionaryforreligioususes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Herb Dictionary: apsand seed|url=http://www.auntyflo.com/herb-dictionary/aspand-seed|website=Aunty Flo dot com herb-dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant has remained a popular tool in both [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] and spiritual practices for so long that some historians believe the plant may be the ancient "[[soma (drink)|soma]]"&lt;ref name="Torn 1995"&gt;Karel van der Torn, ed., "Haoma," ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible.'' (New York: E.J. Brill, 1995), 730.&lt;/ref&gt; (a medicinal aid that is mentioned in a variety of ancient Indo Iranian texts but whose [[Botanical identity of Soma-Haoma|exact identity has been lost to history]]).

It is a perennial plant which can grow to about 0.8&amp;nbsp;m tall,&lt;ref name=cdfa&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/IPC/encycloweedia/weedinfo/peganum.htm |title=''African rue or Harmel'' |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=www.cdfa.ca.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; but normally it is about 0.3&amp;nbsp;m tall.&lt;ref name=nevada&gt;

''Peganum harmala'' is of Asian Origin and grows in the [[Middle East]] and in part of [[South Asia]] mainly in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. It was first planted in the [[United States]] in 1928 in [[New Mexico]] by a farmer wanting to manufacture the dye "[[Persian red]]" from its seeds.&lt;ref name=nevada/&gt; Since then, it has spread invasively to [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PEHA |title=PLANTS Profile for ''Peganum harmala'' (harmal peganum) / USDA PLANTS |accessdate=2008-01-18 |date=2008-01-17 |publisher=[[USDA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because it is so drought tolerant, African rue can displace the native saltbushes and grasses growing in the salt-desert shrub lands of the Western U.S."&lt;ref name=nevada/&gt;

==Traditional use==
In Turkey, dried capsules from this plant are strung and hung in homes or vehicles to protect against "the [[evil eye]]".&lt;ref name=herbdictionaryforreligioususes/&gt;&lt;ref name=againsttheevileye&gt;{{cite web|title=Esphand Against the Evil Eye in Zoroastrian Magic|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/aspand.html|website=Lucky Mojo dot com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used for protection against Djinn in Morocco (see Légey "Essai de Folklore marocain", 1926).

In [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]], as well as some countries in the Middle East, including [[Azerbaijan]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and [[Jordan]], dried capsules mixed with other ingredients are placed onto red hot [[charcoal]], where they explode with little popping noises in a way similar to American [[popcorn]]. When they burst a fragrant smoke is released. This smoke is wafted around the head of those afflicted by or exposed to the gaze of strangers while a specific prayer is recited. This tradition is still followed by members of many religions, including Christians, Muslims, and some Jews. The burning is often accompanied by a prayer which mentions the [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi prayer "Bi Haq [[Shah Naqshband]]" (By the right of [[Shah Naqshband]]). Shah Naqshband was the [[eponymous]] founder of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order. The prayer is often mistaken to be from a Zoroastrian king, however this is erroneous as there is no historic figure named Shah Naqshband other than the Naqshbandi founder and the prayer Bi Haq Shah Naqshband is commonly used by Naqshbandis.&lt;ref name=herbdictionaryforreligioususes/&gt;&lt;ref name=againsttheevileye/&gt; Burning esfand seeds is also commonly found in [[Persian wedding]]s.

It is known in Persian as "Esphand" and in Pashto as "Spilani".

In [[Yemen]], the Jewish custom of old was to bleach wheaten flour on [[Passover]], in order to produce a clean and white [[unleavened bread]]. This was done by spreading whole wheat kernels upon a floor, and then spreading stratified layers of African rue (''Peganum harmala'') leaves upon the wheat kernels; a layer of wheat followed by a layer of Wild rue, which process was repeated until all wheat had been covered over with the astringent leaves of this plant. The wheat was left in this state for a few days, until the outer kernels of the wheat were bleached by the astringent vapors emitted by the Wild rue. Afterwards, the wheat was taken up and sifted, to rid them of the residue of leaves. They were then ground into flour, which left a clean and white batch of flour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]], Questions &amp; Responsa ''Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', vol. I, ''responsum'' # 171, Jerusalem 1979; ''ibid''., vol. III, ''responsum'' # 13 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used as an [[anthelmintic]] (to expel parasitic worms). Reportedly, the [[ancient Greeks]] used the powdered seeds to get rid of [[tapeworms]] and to treat recurring fevers (possibly malaria).&lt;ref&gt;

Some scholars identify harmal with the entheogenic ''[[Soma (drink)|haoma]]'' of pre-[[Zoroastrian]] Persian religions.&lt;ref name="Torn 1995"/&gt;

==Ayahuasca analog==
''Peganum harmala'' seeds have been used as an [[ayahuasca]] analog, as they contain some of the same [[alkaloid]]s as ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeKorne |first1=Jim |title=Psychedelic Shamanism, Updated Edition: The Cultivation, Preparation, and Shamanic Use of Psychotropic Plants |date=2011 |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn=9781583942901|pages=154-155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into other potential uses==
Several scientific laboratories have studied possible uses for ''Peganum harmala'' through studies in laboratory animals ([[in vivo]]) and in cells ([[in vitro]]).

===Fertility===
In very large quantities (dosages exceeding those commonly used for medicinal, therapeutic, or spiritual purposes), it can reduce [[spermatogenesis]] and male fertility in rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Dwairi QA, Banihani SM |title=Histo-functional effects of Peganum harmala on male rat's spermatogenesis and fertility |journal=Neuro Endocrinol.

===Antiprotozoal===
[[File:Harmaline Harmine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Harmine]], a compound present in ''Peganum harmala'', [[fluoresce]]s under [[ultraviolet]] light]]
''Peganum harmala'' has been shown to have antibacterial and anti-protozoal activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Al-Shamma A, Drake S, Flynn DL, etal |title=Antimicrobial agents from higher plants.

One of the compounds found in ''P. harmala'', [[vasicine]] (peganine), has been found to kill ''[[Leishmania donovani]]'', a protozoan parasite that can cause potentially fatal visceral [[leishmaniasis]].&lt;ref name=Misra2008&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Misra P, Khaliq T, Dixit A, etal |title=Antileishmanial activity mediated by apoptosis and structure-based target study of peganine hydrochloride dihydrate: an approach for rational drug design |journal=J.

"The beta-carboline alkaloids present in medicinal plants, such as ''Peganum harmala'' and ''[[Eurycoma longifolia]]'', have recently drawn attention due to their antitumor activities.

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Samoa–Apia''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Samoa–Apiana}}; [[Samoan language|Samoan]]: ''Puleaga'' ''Fa'aAkiepikopo Samoa–Apia'') consists of [[Western Samoa|the Independent State of Samoa]].

==History==
In 1842, the Propaganda Fide created the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Central Oceania]] that included New Caledonia, Tonga, Samoa and Fiji Islands. This lost territory with establishment by [[canonical erection]] by the [[Holy See]] on August 20, 1850, of the [[Vicariate Apostolic of the Navigators' Archipelago]], entrusted to the [[Society of Mary (Marists)]]. On January 4, 1957, the Vatican changed the name of the Vicariate Apostolic to Samoa and the Tokelau Islands.

The vicariate apostolic was elevated to the Diocese of Apia on June 21, 1966, and made suffragan to the metropolitan see of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Suva|Suva, Fiji]]. On August 10, 1974, the name of the diocese was changed to Diocese of Apia o Samoa and Tokelau; and it was changed again on December 3, 1975 to the Diocese of Samoa and Tokelau.

On September 10, 1982, the diocese was elevated to the dignity of an archdiocese taking the name of the See city, [[Apia]].  Simultaneously, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Samoa-Pago Pago|Diocese of Samoa–Pago Pago]] was created from a portion of the former Diocese of Samoa Tokelau and made suffragan to the metropolitan see of Apia.&lt;ref name=hierarchy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsaap.html|title=Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia|publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy|accessdate=2013-05-21|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The format of group adult learning such as that in a [[Bahá'í study circle]], the normal setting of a Ruhi Institute meeting, has occurred in previous contexts, such as in the United States [[Chautauqua]] developments in the 1870s, "using ideals of democracy, participation, and equality."&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye&gt;{{cite journal

Moreover, the Bahá'í community has used the term "institute" in various ways over time. A 1927 report in ''Bahá'í News'' refers to an "institute", the "Institute of World Unity" held at Green Acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The ''institute'' or ''training institute'' served the needs of the thousands who began entering the religion in areas where large-scale expansion was taking place. Such places needed a physical facility to which group after group of newly enrolled believers would be invited to attend courses that helped them deepen their knowledge of the principles of the Faith. Over the years, both in conjunction with and independent of these institutes, various courses —e.g., weekend institutes, five-day institutes, and nine-day institutes — were developed for the purpose of promulgating the ''fundamental verities'' of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Universal House of Justice | authorlink = Universal House of Justice | author2 = Department of the Secretariat | title = Extracts From Messages Written By The Universal House Of Justice On The Four Year Plan Related To Training Institutes | booktitle =  | page = 1 | publisher = The Bahá'í Community of Guelph | date = December 1998 | location =  | url = http://cluster9.org/heading.php?body=docs_body.htm&amp;head=docs_head.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725181347/http://cluster9.org/heading.php?body=docs_body.htm&amp;head=docs_head.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Growth of religion#Bahá'í Faith|Growth of the religion]] into viable communities has presented challenges to Bahá’í institutions.

Bahá'í leadership envisioned a holistic process of education reflecting on "civilization and progress – that is to say, government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and handicrafts, sciences, great inventions and discoveries and elaborate institutions, which are the activities essential to man” and "the education of all members of society."&lt;ref name= Mortensen&gt;{{cite thesis

A key component of their work was founded on the basic tenet that the essence of humankind is spiritual and that helping individuals acquire spiritual attributes would lead to the advancement of civilization.&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p47}}

From these roots the Ruhi Foundation (named after [[Farzam Arbab]]’s father and Dr. [[David Ruhe]],&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p47}}) evolved as part of a wider process of community building among the Bahá’ís&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p47}} in Colombia centered first in the town of Puerto Tejada, near [[Cali, Colombia|Cali]]&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;{{rp|p83}} in the [[Cauca Department|department of Cauca]]. The Ruhi Institute eventually fell under the guidance of the [[Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assembly]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Colombia]]. Since 1992 it has been registered as the “Ruhí Foundation,” a legally independent non-profit organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Molineaux, P. (1996). [http://www.bcca.org/services/lists/noble-creation/fundaec2.html Projects of FUNDAEC]. Cali, Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruhi courses appeared in a wide range of study circles in various other countries. Early participants provided feedback to the authors and then over several years the first official release of books took place.&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p48}} As a result, materials include examples from several cultures which helps diverse participants relate to some of the cultural content of the materials.&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p51}} Since the late 1990s the Ruhi institute process has developed as an additional way to advance communities.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;{{rp|p78}}

The current head of the religion, the [[Universal House of Justice]], has noted the progress of the work since the early 2000s.&lt;ref name= Mortensen/&gt;{{rp|p4}} They mentioned that “the great majority of National Spiritual Assemblies have chosen to adopt the course materials devised by the Ruhi Institute.”&lt;ref name= Mortensen/&gt;{{rp|pp4–5}} Especially in recent years, its training programs have been adopted by an increasing number of localities worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Learning about Growth - The Story of the Ruhi Institute and Large-scale Expansion of the Bahá'í Faith in Colombia | last = Ruhi Institute | first = | publisher= Palabra Publications | year = 1991 | location = Cali, Colombia | url =https://www.scribd.com/doc/52215606/Learning-About-Growth-The-Story-of-the-Ruhi-Institute-and-Large-scale-Expansion-of-the-Baha-i-Faith-in-Colombia | pages =55 |ref=harv}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting a "culture of learning" among its participants.&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p47}} By 2012 the Ruhiresources.org web site—operated by volunteers who are Ruhi tutors—allowed Ruhi tutor-created materials to be freely shared.&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p51}}

==Principals, goals and methods==
The goal of the Ruhi Institute courses is to "evoke a transformative learning experience through a learner-centered, experiential, and collaborative approach facilitated by a tutor rather than an instructor, a teacher, or an expert."&lt;ref name= Mortensen/&gt;{{rp|p38}} Academics have identified the practice as an instance of [[praxeology]].&lt;ref name=KhanAgency/&gt;&lt;ref name=HansonAgency/&gt; The tutor roles "refer to functions we perform at a given time and not to positions we (sic) hold in the community.'"&lt;ref name= Mortensen/&gt;{{rp|p38}} Indeed Ruhi restructures societal norms, roles, and goals of education "…to re-vision societal images and systems of education as part of the design of new systems of learning and human development that are consonant with the emerging global world-view."&lt;ref name=KhanAgency/&gt; The courses are designed to be run with organically developed groups of learners, using "critical reflection, interactive thinking, activities designed to transform theory into practical action".&lt;ref name= Mortensen/&gt;{{rp|p6}} Tutors who facilitate courses are to reflect on their motives and encouraged to perform their role as virtuous service.&lt;ref name= Mortensen/&gt;{{rp|p40}} Tutoring is not a position of authority but a service to the community - an explicit factor in training of tutors, seeking to foster “beautiful behaviors”&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p49}} to function as "friends teaching friends".&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p49}} The course "applies the concept of 'being and doing' and incorporates 'action and reflection' as a key learning strategy."&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p46}} Priorities folded into the process of the courses and their refinement include "Projecting a systemic, global world-view"; "ensuring the right to learn and the right to know"; "nurturing the development of diversity"; "providing the competencies to make interdependence a social reality"; (and) "providing for social and cultural evolution."&lt;ref name=KhanAgency/&gt;

Any group that goes through a course would be encouraged to pursue a service project as a means of putting their learning into action &lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p51}}&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;{{rp|pp83–4}} Such projects typtically comprise organizing devotional meetings, developing skills in raising the quality of discourses on social concerns, and becoming a teacher of children. Community service is framed by the contexts the individuals bring to the group and their sense of purpose about it - and through several courses the suggested projects grow in complexity.&lt;ref name=HansonAgency/&gt; Some have grown into their own local NGOs.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;{{rp|p84}} The transcending goal is spiritual and moral empowerment to serve the society and the Faith by cultivating attributes such as a "humble posture of learning, dedication to the application of the teachings, a responsibility for one’s own personal growth, and growth of the Bahá’í community."&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|p50}} The progress of individuals in learning virtues like humility, patience and tact advanced amidst a feeling of empowerment.&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye/&gt;{{rp|pp52–3}} A kind of citizenship.

The materials prepared by the Ruhi Institute focus on the [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] by assisting participants to understand the texts on three different levels. The first level is that of basic comprehension — understanding the meanings of the words and sentences. The second level relates to the application of the texts to various real-world situations. Finally, the third level deals with the implications of the various quotations on other aspects of Bahá'í belief and action.

===Results===
The goal of a universal sense of active and observable citizenship in the Faith has remained elusive.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite journal | author=David A.

A published case study compared developments in three instances of Bahá'ís fostering development among indigenous cultures - a [[Bahá'í Faith in Panama#Efforts among the Guaymí|Guaymí cultural center in Panama]], a [[Bahá'í Faith in the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Kivu|regional socio-economic development committee of Kivu, Zaire]], and the specific original development of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Colombia#Ruhi Institute|Bahá'í Ruhi Institute in Colombia]]:&lt;ref name=HansonAgency/&gt; "They demonstrate the importance of evolutionary guiding images, of the conceptual support of actions, evolutionary competence, the contribution of second-order actions and the purposeful design of the system of interactive dimensions that operate on individual and societal levels to the design of human systems.… (by those) who are so often considered marginal, irrelevant, and ignorant of the challenges of an interdependent world society."&lt;ref name=HansonAgency/&gt; The reviewers saw two implications - "The motivating force which empowered participants, provided a vision, and nurtured evolutionary competence was in every case a powerfully felt commitment to Bahá'í religious beliefs" and each of the three was "designed and carried forward by the efforts of a small group of highly motivated individuals whose leadership style is characterized by such evolutionary values as cooperation, service, interdependence, humility, and the like."&lt;ref name=HansonAgency/&gt;

==Three cycles of main courses==
The Ruhí Institute's sequence of courses “has been conceived in terms of three cycles, each one concerned with the spiritual and moral empowerment of the believers from a particular perspective”&lt;ref name=walking&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ruhi Institute |year=2003|edition=reprint |title=Book 7: Walking Together on a Path of Service |series=Ruhi Institute | publisher=Palabra Publications |publication-place=West Palm Beach, Florida |isbn=1-890101-07-9 |url=http://www.ruhiresources.org/book-7/book-7-walking-together-on-a-path-of-service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first cycle is "centered on the practice of the freedom the individual has to undertake acts of service within the framework of the teachings of the Faith and the guidance provided by its institutions"&lt;ref name=walking /&gt;
* The second cycle is dedicated to the individual and the community.
* A third cycle is planned and would cover the individual and society.

===Main sequence of courses: first cycle===
Minding this is an area of active effort, as of 2016 there are currently eight books in the Institute's main sequence of courses, with more courses in development.  Each book is broken up into three units each with many sections. Tutors are encouraged to apply the arts, using music, games, crafts, and such during the training. Each book has one or more practices that can be done outside of the meeting. Also encouraged throughout the books is the practice of memorizing passages and prayers.

It is suggested to take the books in their numbered order.

====Book 1: Reflections on the Life of the Spirit====
[[File:Ruhi 1.jpg|110px|right]]
This first and shortest book of the sequence is divided into three units with different themes:
#Understanding the Bahá'í Writings
#Prayer
#Life and Death

This book can be used as an introduction to people investigating the Faith, or as a study of fundamental principles by people already familiar with the teachings.

One practice for this book is to visit two people, and study a prayer with them.{{clear|left}}

====Book 2: Arising to Serve====
The second book in the sequence involves community life and teaching. Units include:
#The Joy of Teaching
#Deepening Themes
#Introducing Bahá'í Beliefs

This book aims at developing specific acts of service. Providing tools to raise up human resources capable of fostering the growth of the Bahá'í Community with efficiency and love.

One practice for this book is to visit a few people and practice one of the deepening themes learned in the second unit.

====Book 3: Teaching Children's Classes, Grade 1====
The third book in the sequence is designed to develop the capabilities needed to conduct children's classes. The units include:
#Some Principles of Bahá'í Education
#Lessons for Children's Classes, Grade 1

====Book 4: The Twin Manifestations====
The fourth book in the sequence is taken to acquire a thorough understanding of the lives of the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]].
#The Greatness of this Day
#The Life of the Báb
#The Life of Bahá'u'lláh

This book reviews the importance of the Bahá'í revelation, and retells many of the famous stories of the two founding prophets of the Bahá'í Faith.

One practice is to visit at least one friend, and share a simple illustrated presentation about the life of the Báb and then do the same later for the life of Bahá'u'lláh.

====Book 5: Releasing the Powers of Junior Youth====
The fifth book in the sequence trains individuals to facilitate Junior Youth groups, which are for ages 11–15. Individuals who complete the book and as the praxis go on to facilitate a Junior Youth group are called animators, thus named because they animate the endeavors of the junior youth. After completing book five, the animators use a separate strand of books to work with the junior youth. Ruhi Book 5's main units are:
#Life's Springtime
#An Age of Promise
#Serving as an Animator

====Book 6: Teaching the Cause====
The sixth book in the sequence is a continuation of the theme of the second book, which is teaching.

==Branch sequences==
Branching out from some of the main sequences of courses are some branch courses.&lt;ref&gt;Universal House of Justice. [http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/#d=20111212_001&amp;f=f1-2 Letter to all National Spiritual Assemblies] (12 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 only books 3 and 5 have branch courses.

=== Book 3 Branch Courses for children's class teachers ===
#Teaching Children's Classes, Grade 2
#Teaching Children's Classes, Grade 3

=== Book 5 Branch Courses for Junior Youth (aged 12 to 15) ===
In the program for spiritual empowerment of junior youth, various topics are discussed in the youth groups. The materials focus on forming a strong moral identity and developing the capacities of youth, such as language skills, the power of expression, and rational thinking. Also included are subjects with which adolescents often struggle, preparing them to make difficult choices and adapting to social change. The courses are being developed around the world  &lt;ref name="dlp"&gt;[http://www.devlp.org/its-materials DL Publicaciones (DLP), Colombia: Materials].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ruhi.org"&gt;Ruhi Institute. ''[http://www.ruhi.org/materials/list.php?link_id=5_1#jy Junior youth spiritual empowerment program]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The material has been developed by: Development Learning Press, Colombia; Ruhi Institute, Colombia; The Badi Foundation, [[Macau]]; William Mmutle Masetlha Foundation, [[Zambia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Flagellation#As a religious practice}}

'''Self-flagellation''' is the act of hitting oneself with a whip as part of a religious ritual.

==Christianity==
{{Main|Mortification of the flesh}}
[[File:Striding_flagellant.jpg|thumb|''Magdarame'' (penitents) during [[Holy Week]] in the Philippines]]
''The Flagellation'' refers in a Christian context to the [[Flagellation of Christ]], an episode in the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] prior to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]]. The practice of [[mortification of the flesh]] for religious purposes was utilized by some Christians throughout most of Christian history, especially in Catholic monasteries and convents. In addition, [[Martin Luther]], the founder of the [[Lutheran Church]], regularly practiced self-flagellation as a means of mortification of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wall|first=James T. |title=The Boundless Frontier: America from Christopher Columbus to Abraham Lincoln|publisher=[[University Press of America]]|language=English |page=103|quote=Though he did not go to the ends that had Luther— including even self-flagellation— the methods of ritualistic observance, self-denial, and good works did not satisfy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Congregationalist]] writer [[Sarah Osborn]] also practiced self-flagellation in order "to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God".&lt;ref name="Rubin1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Julius H.|title=Religious Melancholy and Protestant Experience in America|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780195083019|page=115|quote=In the many letters to her correspondents, Fish, Anthony, Hopkins, and Noyes, Osborn examined the state of her soul, sought spiritual guidance in the midst of her perplexities, and created a written forum for her continued self-examination. She cultivated an intense and abiding spirit of evangelical humiliation--self-flagellation and self-torture to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became "quite common" for members of the [[Tractarian]] movement within the [[Anglican Communion]] to practice self-flagellation using a [[discipline (mortification)|discipline]].&lt;ref name="Yates1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yates|first=Nigel|title=Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780198269892|page=60|quote=Self-flagellation with a small scourge, known as a discipline, became quite common in Tractarian circles and was practised by Gladstone among others.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, a group of Roman Catholics, known as the [[Flagellant]]s, took this practice to its extreme ends. The Flagellants were later condemned by the Roman Catholic Church as a cult in the 14th century because the established church had no other control over the practice than excommunication.

==Shia Islam==
[[File:Zanjerzani in Kermanshah 01.jpg|thumb|Zanjerzani in Iran]]
Although [[Tatbir]] is forbidden by many Shia [[marja'|marājiʿ]], many [[Shia]] communities worldwide march in massive parades every year on the [[Day of Ashura]] to commemorate the [[Battle of Karbala]] and the [[martyrdom]] of Imam [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], while hitting themselves on the chest or slashing themselves with chains called zanjerzani.

Though it is uncommon, some Shia communities hit themselves on the back with chains and sharp objects such as knives. This happens in many countries including [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvk4VT35qgQ |title=Video of self-flagellation with knives and chains at mosque in Atlanta, Georgia, USA |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]]. However, use of knives and sharp blades for flagellation is strictly forbidden in Shia Islam by their [[mujtahid]]een (persons accepted as original authority in Islamic law).

'''Sikhism in the area of present-day Pakistan''' has an extensive heritage and history, although [[Sikh]]s form a small community in [[Pakistan]] today. Most Sikhs live in the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], a part of the larger [[Punjab region]] where the religion originated in the Middle Ages, and Peshawar in the [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] province. [[Nankana Sahib]], the birthplace of [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], is located in the Punjab province.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Sikh community became a powerful political force, with Sikh leader [[Ranjit Singh]] founding the first [[Sikh empire]], which had its capital in [[Lahore]], the second-largest city in Pakistan today. Significant populations of Sikhs inhabited the largest cities in the Punjab such as Lahore, [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Faisalabad]]. After the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s [[Human migration|migrated]] to [[India]] while many [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in [[Pakistan]].

In the decades following Pakistan's independence in 1947, the Sikh community began to re-organise, forming the [[Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] (PGPC) to represent the community and protect the holy sites and heritage of the Sikh religion in Pakistan. The Pakistani government has begun to allow Sikhs from India to make [[pilgrimage]]s to Sikh places of worship in Pakistan and for Pakistani Sikhs to travel to India.

According to the [[Government of Pakistan]]'s [[National Database and Registration Authority]] (NADRA), there were 6,146 Sikhs registered in Pakistan in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/430059/over-35000-buddhists-bahais-call-pakistan-home/  Over 35,000 Buddhists, Baha’is call Pakistan home By Irfan GhauriPublished: September 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, including the US Department of State, claim the Sikh population in Pakistan to be as high as 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1176521&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90233.htm |title=Pakistan |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistani Sikh diaspora===
Many Pakistani Sikhs have emigrated and continue to emigrate to countries like the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and [[Canada]]. According to the UK's 2001 census, there were 346 Pakistani Sikhs in the UK. There is also a growing Pakistani Sikh expatriate community in the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=6891&amp;More=Y |title=Ethnic group by religion, April 2001: Census update |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the independence of India and Pakistan==
[[File:Samadhi Ranjeet Singh.jpg|thumb|Gurdwara Dera Sahib]]
Prior to independence in 1947, Sikhs were spread all across Northern [[Pakistan]], specifically the [[Punjab region]] and played an important role in its economy as farmers, businessmen, and traders. [[Lahore]], the capital of Punjab, was then and still is today the location of many important Sikh religious and historical sites, including the [[Samadhi of Ranjit Singh]]. The nearby town of [[Nankana Sahib]] has nine [[gurdwara]]s, and is the birthplace of Sikhism's founder, [[Guru Nanak Dev]]. Each of Nankana Sahib's gurdwaras are associated with different events in Guru Nanak Dev's life. The town remains an important site of pilgrimage for Sikhs worldwide.

==Independence of Pakistan (1947)==
[[File:Panja Sahib.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Exterior of [[Panja Sahib]] Gurdwara in Hasan Abdal]]
The largest Sikh population in Pakistan is found in [[Peshawar]], in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], where the [[Pashtun law]] of "[[nanawatai|nanawati]]" (protection) spared the scale of violence which had raged across the [[Indus River]] in Punjab. Despite the longstanding tensions between the Sikh and Muslim communities in South Asia, the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]s were tolerant towards the religious minority of Sikhs.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiauncut.blogspot.com/2006/02/jaziya.html India Uncut, India "Jaziya"] 4 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There are small pockets of Sikhs in Lahore and Nankana Sahib in Punjab. The Sikhs and Hindus of West [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] provinces of Pakistan migrated to India after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. These Sikh and Hindu refugee communities have had a major influence in the culture and economics of the Indian capital city of Delhi. Today, segments of the populations of [[East Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] states and [[Delhi]] in India can trace their ancestry back to towns and villages now in Pakistan, including former Indian Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The villagers are proud of the link between Gah and the prime minister of India.|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-129405-In-Manmohan-Singhs-village-Gah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singh’s ancestral village, Gah, is located 25 kilometres west of Chakwal city and attracted journalists like moths to a flame following the former PM’s rise to power.|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1116453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an influx of Sikhs refugees from [[Afghanistan]] in Pakistan due to the turbulent civil war and conflicts that have ravaged neighboring Afghanistan.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhreview.org/december2001/terror.htm "The Heart-rending Story of Afghani Sikhs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310105155/http://www.sikhreview.org/december2001/terror.htm |date=10 March 2006 }} 4 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, like Pakistan, has had very small Sikh and Hindu populations. There has been a massive exodus of refugees from Afghanistan into Pakistan during the past 30 years of turmoil up to the reign of the [[Taliban]] and the subsequent [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 2001. Due to Pakistan's porous borders with Afghanistan, large numbers of Afghanistan's minority communities, based mainly around the cities of [[Kabul]], [[Kandahar]], and [[Jalalabad]] have fled, and some Sikhs have joined their kinsmen in Peshawar and Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Many of the Sikhs displaced from the Tirah Valley have adopted Pashtun traditions and culture.|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-killing-of-the-sikhs/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25,000 Sikhs in the province – mostly in Buner, Swat, DI Khan, Bara, Khyber, Kurram and Orakzai agencies.|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/685962/-thinking-about-the-big-move-the-sikh-way-of-life-changing-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pakistani Sikh community in modern times==
[[File:Sikh Articles of Faith.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kanga (Sikhism)|Kanga]], [[Kara (Sikhism)|Kara]] and [[Kirpan]] - three of the five articles of faith endowed to the Sikhs.]]

Until today, [[Sikh]] have mainly kept a low profile within the monolithic [[Muslim]] population of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030412/windows/main1.htm Tribune, India "Maryada may be in danger, but Sikhs are special in Pakistan"] 4 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Though, Pakistan maintains the title of Islamic state, the articles twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two in chapter two of its constitution guarantees religious freedom to the non-Muslim residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html |title=[Chapter 1: Fundamental Rights&amp;#93; of [Part II: Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy&amp;#93; |publisher=Pakistani.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence in 1947, relations between Pakistan's minorities and the Muslim majority have remained fairly and politically stable. From 1984 to 2002, Pakistan held a system of separate electorates for all its national legislative assemblies, with only a handful of parliamentary seats reserved for minority members. Minorities were legally only permitted to vote for designated minority candidates in general elections. The regime of former President General [[Pervez Musharraf]] had professed an agenda of equality for minorities and promotion and protection of minority rights, however, the implementation of corrective measures has been slow. Considerable amount of Sikhs are found in neighbourhood called ''Narayanpura'' of [[Karachi]]'s [[Gazdarabad|Ranchore Lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sikhs of Narayanpura welcoming people from all walks of life to attend their celebrations such as Joti-Jot and the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak.|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1143743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ranchore Line’s Narayanpura, an area where the Sikhs and the Hindus live together|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/801343/praying-together-tensions-high-as-the-guru-granth-sahib-divides-two-minorities/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical and holy sites of Sikhs are maintained by a Pakistani governmental body, the [[Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]], which is responsible for their upkeep and preservation.

===The emergence of the Sikh community within Pakistan===
After the independence of Pakistan and the migration of nearly all Sikhs to India the Sikh community's rights were diminished as their population decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/events/partition1.htm "Partition Of The Punjab - 1947"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029003934/http://allaboutsikhs.com/events/partition1.htm |date=29 October 2006 }} 12 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani Constitution states that Sikhism is a monotheistic religion. Recently the Sikh community within Pakistan has been making every effort possible to progress in Pakistan. For example, [[Hercharn Singh]] became the first Sikh to join the [[Pakistan Army]]. For the first time in the 58-year history of Pakistan there has a Sikh been selected into Pakistan's army.  CR Dutta  was one of the few Hindu officers in 1947 who opted for Pakistan and fought for Pakistan in 1965 war. Prior to Harcharan Singh's selection in the Pakistani army no individual person who was a member of the Hindu or the Sikh community were ever enrolled in the army, however; the Pakistani Christian community has prominently served in the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] and some had even reached into to the ranks of Major Generals in the army, Air Vice Marshals in the [[Pakistan Air force]] and rear Admiral in the [[Pakistan Navy]]. It has received various awards for gallantry and valor. Moreover, members of the tiny Parsi community have some representation in the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2005/12/20/nat12.htm "First Sikh officer in Pakistan Army"] 20 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  First time in the history of Pakistan as well as in the history of Lahore a Sikh person has been appointed as a traffic Sub Inspector. Dr. Gulab Singh who is just 25 years old, is a practising [[homeopathic]] doctor and he is from the same place as Harcharan Singh (Nankana Sahib). Gulab Singh is fluent in [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], and little bit of [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1093275 "Sikh appointed Sub Inspector in Pakistan"] 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent Sikhs are Inspector Amarjeet Singh of [[Pakistan Rangers]] and Lance-naik Behram Singh of [[Pakistan Coast Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prominent Sikhs within Pakistan, those who have crossed difficult barriers to succeed in their life and careers.|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1143743}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gurdwara-School inner front.JPG|thumb|Gurudwara in Layallpur Faisalabad]]

In yet another contribution to the Pakistani Sikh community, Pakistan Government enacted the [[Anand Karaj|Sikh marriage]] act, Anand Marriage act, in November 2007. This Sikh marriage act allows not only the Sikhs in Pakistan, but also Sikhs living in anywhere in the world to register in Pakistan with the Sikh marriage act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/india-rejected-separate-sikh-marriage-act-which-pak-enacted-4-yrs-ago/840000/ |title=Pakistan passes Anand Karaj }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topnews.in/pakistan-minister-gives-assurances-enacting-sikh-marriage-act-27314 "Pakistan Minister gives assurances for enacting Sikh Marriage Act"] 24 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Many pilgrim Sikhs couples from abroad have reaffirmed their marriage vows in Pakistan under the [[Anand Karaj|Sikh marriage]] act.

==Notable Sikh==
===Politics===
[[Ramesh Singh Arora]] became the first Sikh member of [[Provincial Assembly of the Punjab]] of [[Pakistan]] after he was nominated by the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] (PML (N)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiadespatch.org/2013/05/17/sikh-nominated-to-provincial-assembly-in-pakistan/]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Sikh, Dr. [[Suran Singh]] has been nominated to the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly]] by the [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] following the 2013 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suran Singh, minister of Minorities for the province and a member of the ruling PTI|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-killing-of-the-sikhs/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The first Pakistani Sikh musician also emerged on the music industry in 2009, [[Jassi Lailpuria]], launched his first song on independence day entitled, [[Sohna Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author="" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy0S6iqLwXw |title=Sohna Pakistan by Jassi Lailpura |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}} {{Unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Sikh named Taranjeet Singh is an VJ, anchor and host on [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ceremony also featured a concert and speeches from at least 10 "youth icons", PTV host Taranjeet Singh|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/389974/young-workers-50000-internships-for-students-under-youth-policy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taranjeet Singh from PTV shared their experiences with the youth|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/09/29/city/lahore/asian-youth-peace-festival-kicks-off/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rupinder Singh Magon ([[Rup Magon]]) from the band [[Josh (band)|Josh]] is also a superstar in Pakistan and is very popular among the youth of the country although he lives in Canada but travels to Pakistan a lot for Concerts and TV engagements. He, along with his bandmate [[Qurram Hussain]], was part of [[Coke Studio (Pakistan)|Coke Studio]] as well, which is a big achievement.

The university held 30,000 students and administration during the 2nd century. This provided the Han Dynasty with well-educated bureaucrats.  It was replaced by the [[Guozijian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr99-00/english/panels/ed/papers/711e01.pdf  A Consultant Report to The University Grants Committee of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt; The first nationwide government school system in China was established in 3 CE under [[Emperor Ping of Han]], with the Taixue located in the capital of [[Chang'an]] and local schools established in the [[Zhou (political division)|prefectures]] and in the main cities of the smaller [[xian|counties]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, 193&amp;ndash;194.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was built in the 14th and 15th centuries. The two areas of main interest are the courtyard, which retains a multitude of ''[[yeseria]]''s (carved plasterwork), and above all, the basement that was possibly a Jewish liturgical [[bathing|bath]] or [[mikveh]], whose function was spiritual purification and preparation for some important event in the life of a Jew.  During restorations of adjacent rooms, Almagra style hydraulic plastering has been uncovered, as well as a cistern, all of which support the theory about its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|author=consorcio de toledo|title=Rutas Patrimonio Desconocido|url=consorciotoledo.org/patrimonio/wp-content/uploads/Rutas-2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of great relevance for its archaeological study is a piece of wood used as a lintel for access to the basement, where it can observe the work of carving with floral motifs, based on tympanums and scrolls, accompanying an epigraphic repertoire whose transcription says: "''Thanks I give you, because you have answered my prayers''";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|author=Council of Europe|title=Mística Judía|url=http://www.toledo-turismo.com/en/salones-isl%C3%A1micos_152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text related to verses 21 of [[Psalm 18]]: "''Here is the door of Yahveh, through which the righteous come in.''" 21 "''thanks I give you, because you have answered my prayers, and it has been my salvation''", which welcomes all those who are faithful and pure at the interior of the house.

[[Image:John Bauer 1915.jpg|thumb|260px|''Look at them, troll mother said. Look at my sons! You won't find more beautiful trolls on this side of the moon.'' (1915) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]
A '''troll''' is a class of being in [[Norse mythology]] and [[Scandinavian folklore]]. In [[Old Norse]] sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.

Later, in [[Scandinavia]]n folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianized]], and are considered dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them.

Trolls are sometimes associated with particular landmarks, which at times may be explained as formed from a troll exposed to sunlight. Trolls are depicted in a variety of media in modern popular culture.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse nouns ''troll'' and ''tröll'' (variously meaning "fiend, demon, [[werewolf]], [[jötunn]]") and Middle High German ''troll, trolle'' "fiend" (according to [[philology|philologist]] [[Vladimir Orel]] likely borrowed from Old Norse) developed from [[Proto-Germanic]] neuter noun *''trullan''. The origin of the Proto-Germanic word is unknown.&lt;ref name="OREL-410-411"&gt;Orel (2003:410-411).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Old Norse verb ''trylla'' 'to enchant, to turn into a troll' and the [[Middle High German]] verb ''trüllen'' "to flutter" both developed from the Proto-Germanic verb *''trulljanan'', a derivative of *''trullan''.&lt;ref name="OREL-410-411"/&gt;

==Norse mythology==
In Norse mythology, ''troll'', like ''thurs'', is a term applied to ''[[Jötunn|jötnar]]'' and is mentioned throughout the Old Norse corpus. In Old Norse sources, trolls are said to dwell in isolated mountains, rocks, and caves, sometimes live together (usually as father-and-daughter or mother-and-son), and are rarely described as helpful or friendly.&lt;ref name="ORCHARD1997167"&gt;Orchard (1997:167).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' describes an encounter between an unnamed troll woman and the 9th-century [[skald]] [[Bragi Boddason]]. According to the section, Bragi was driving through "a certain forest" late one evening when a troll woman aggressively asked him who he was, in the process describing herself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
&lt;small&gt;[[Old Norse]]:&lt;/small&gt;
:''Troll kalla mik''
:''trungl sjǫtrungnis,''
:''auðsug [[jötunn|jǫtuns]],''
:''élsólar bǫl,''
:''vilsinn [[Völva|vǫlu]],''
:''vǫrð nafjarðar,''
:''hvélsveg himins –''
:''hvat's troll nema þat?''&lt;ref name="LINDOW-22"&gt;Lindow (2007:22).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
&lt;small&gt;Anthony Faulkes translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:'Trolls call me
:moon of dwelling-Rungnir,
:giant's wealth-sucker,
:storm-sun's bale,
:seeress's friendly companion,
:guardian of [[grave|corpse-fiord]],
:swallower of heaven-wheel;
:what is a troll other than that?'&lt;ref name="FAULKES-132"&gt;Faulkes (1995:132).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
&lt;small&gt;[[John Lindow]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:They call me a troll,
:moon of the earth-[[Hrungnir]] [?]
:wealth sucker [?] of the giant,
:destroyer of the storm-sun [?]
:beloved follower of the seeress,
:guardian of the "nafjord" [?]
:swallower of the wheel of heaven [the sun].
:What's a troll if not that?&lt;ref name="LINDOW-22"/&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bragi responds in turn, describing himself and his abilities as a skillful [[skald]], before the scenario ends.&lt;ref name="FAULKES-132"/&gt;

There is much confusion and overlap in the use of Old Norse terms ''jötunn'', ''troll'', ''þurs'', and ''risi'', which describe various beings. [[Lotte Motz]] theorized that these were originally four distinct classes of beings: lords of nature (''jötunn''), mythical magicians (''troll''), hostile monsters (''þurs''), and heroic and courtly beings (''risi''), the last class being the youngest addition. On the other hand, Ármann Jakobson is critical of Motz's interpretation and calls this theory "unsupported by any convincing evidence".&lt;ref name="JAKOBSSON06"&gt;Ármann Jakobsson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Ármann highlights that the term is used to denote various beings, such as a jötunn or mountain-dweller, a witch, an abnormally strong or large or ugly person, an evil spirit, a ghost, a ''[[Black people|blámaðr]]'', a magical boar, a heathen demi-god, a demon, a [[brunnmigi]], or a [[berserker]].&lt;ref name="JAKOBSSON08"&gt;Ármann Jakobsson (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandinavian folklore==
[[File:Theodor Kittelsen - Skogtroll, 1906 (Forest Troll).jpg|thumb|200px|Skogtroll (''Forest Troll''), by [[Theodor Kittelsen]], 1906.]]
Later in Scandinavian folklore, trolls become defined as a particular type of being.&lt;ref name= "SIMEK335"&gt;Simek (2007:335).&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous tales are recorded about trolls in which they are frequently described as being extremely old, very strong, but slow and dim-witted, and are at times described as man-eaters and as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight.&lt;ref name="KVEDELUND-SEHMSDORF-301-313"&gt;Kvedelund, Sehsmdorf (2010:301—313).&lt;/ref&gt; However, trolls are also attested as looking much the same as human beings, without any particularly hideous appearance about them, but living far away from human habitation and generally having "some form of social organization" — unlike the ''rå'' and ''näck'', who are attested as "solitary beings". According to [[John Lindow]], what sets them apart is that they are not Christian, and those who encounter them do not know them. Therefore, trolls were in the end dangerous, regardless of how well they might get along with Christian society, and trolls display a habit of ''bergtagning'' ('kidnapping'; literally "mountain-taking") and overrunning a farm or estate.&lt;ref name="LINDOW-1978-33-35"&gt;Lindow (1978:33—35).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindow states that the etymology of the word "troll" remains uncertain, though he defines trolls in later Swedish folklore as "nature beings" and as "all-purpose otherworldly being[s], equivalent, for example, to [[fairy|fairies]] in [[Anglo-saxons|Anglo]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] traditions". They "therefore appear in various migratory legends where collective nature-beings are called for". Lindow notes that trolls are sometimes swapped out for cats and "little people" in the folklore record.&lt;ref name="LINDOW-1978-33-35"&gt;Lindow (1978:33—35).&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scandinavian folk belief that [[lightning]] frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of the god [[Thor]]'s role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and jötnar in modern Scandinavia is sometimes explained as a result of the "accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes".&lt;ref name="LIGHTNING"&gt;See Lindow (1978:89), but noted as early as Thorpe (1851:154) who states "The dread entertained by Trolls for thunder dates from the time of paganism, Thor [ . . . ] being the deadly foe of their race".&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the absence of trolls in regions of Scandinavia are described in folklore as being a "consequence of the constant din of the church-bells". This ring caused the trolls to leave for other lands, although not without some resistance; numerous traditions relate how trolls destroyed a church under construction or hurled boulders and stones at completed churches. Large local stones are sometimes described as the product of a troll's toss.&lt;ref name="THORPE-1851-158-154-156"&gt;Thorpe (1851:158, 154—156).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, into the 20th century, the origins of particular Scandinavian landmarks, such as particular stones, are ascribed to trolls who may, for example, have turned to stone upon exposure to sunlight.&lt;ref name="KVEDELUND-SEHMSDORF-301-313"/&gt;
[[File:John Bauer - The Princess and the Trolls - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|The Princess and the Trolls –''[[Changeling|The Changeling]]'', by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]], 1913.]]
Lindow compares the trolls of the Swedish folk tradition to [[Grendel]], the supernatural [[mead hall]] invader in the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', and notes that "just as the poem ''Beowulf'' emphasizes not the harrying of Grendel but the cleansing of the hall of Beowulf, so the modern tales stress the moment when the trolls are driven off."&lt;ref name="LINDOW-1978-33-35"/&gt;

Smaller trolls are attested as living in burial mounds and in mountains in Scandinavian folk tradition.&lt;ref name="MACCULLOCH33"&gt;MacCulloch (1930:223—224).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Denmark]], these creatures are recorded as ''troldfolk'' ("troll-folk"), ''bjergtrolde'' ("mountain-trolls"), or ''bjergfolk'' ("mountain-folk") and in Norway also as ''troldfolk'' ("troll-folk") and ''tusser''.&lt;ref name="MACCULLOCH33"/&gt; Trolls may be described as small, human-like beings or as tall as men depending on the region of origin of the story.&lt;ref name="MACCULLOCH34"&gt;MacCulloch (1930:219—223, 224).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norwegian tradition, similar tales may be told about the larger trolls and the [[Huldrefolk]] ("hidden-folk") yet a distinction is made between the two. The use of the word ''[[Trow (folklore)|trow]]'' in Orkney and Shetland, to mean beings which are very like the Huldrefolk in Norway may suggest a common origin for the terms. The word ''troll'' may have been used by pagan Norse settlers in Orkney and Shetland as a collective term for supernatural beings who should be respected and avoided rather than worshiped. ''Troll'' could later have become specialized as a description of the larger, more menacing Jötunn-kind whereas ''Huldrefolk'' may have developed as the term for smaller trolls.&lt;ref name="Narváez2"&gt;Narváez (1997:118).&lt;/ref&gt;

John Arnott MacCulloch posited a connection between the Old Norse [[vættir]] and trolls, suggesting that both concepts may derive from spirits of the dead.&lt;ref name="MACCULLOCH30"&gt;MacCulloch (1930:228 &amp; 231).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the '''Urim and Thummim''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ʊər|ɪ|m|...|ˈ|θ|ʌ|m|ɪ|m}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «yūr´ĭm» and «thum´ĭm»&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''Interpreters''') usually refers to a set of [[seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]] bound by silver bows into a set of spectacles, that movement founder [[Joseph Smith]] said he found buried in the hill [[Cumorah]] with the [[golden plates]].

==History==
Smith said that in 1823 an [[angel Moroni]] told him of the existence, with the plates, of "two stones in silver bows" fastened to a breastplate, which the angel called the [[Urim and Thummim]] and which he said God had prepared for translating the plates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith–History]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/34-35#34 1:34–35].&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith]], described them as crystal-like "two smooth three-cornered diamonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Lucy Mack |authorlink = Lucy Mack Smith |title= [[The History of Joseph Smith by His Mother]] |year= 1853 |accessdate= 2006-02-02 |page= 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Cowdery]] said the stones were "transparent".&lt;ref&gt;March 1831 letter of A.W.B. [Abram W. Benton], in ''Evangelical Magazine and Gospel Advocate'' (April 9, 1831) 2:120. (Concerning the 1830 trial of Smith in South Bainbridge, New York, Benton stated: "Oliver Cowdery, one of the three witnesses to the book, testified under oath, that said Smith found with the plates, from which he translated his book, two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates".)&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and his early Mormon contemporaries seem to have used the terms "[[seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]]" and "Urim and Thummim" interchangeably.&lt;ref name = ldstranslation&gt;[http://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation "Book of Mormon Translation"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Smith always referred to the [[Book of Mormon]] "interpreters" as the Urim and Thummim, he may or may not have intended to make a distinction between that device and the seer stones that he used in receiving revelations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Van Wagoner]] and Steven Walker, "Joseph Smith: 'The Gift of Seeing," ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''15''':2 (Summer 1982): 59–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church has suggested that Smith and his contemporaries "seem to have understood the term more as a descriptive category of instruments for obtaining divine revelations and less as the name of a specific instrument".&lt;ref name = ldstranslation/&gt;

[[File:Joseph Smith receiving golden plates.jpg|left|175px|thumb|An 1893 engraving of Joseph Smith receiving the [[Golden Plates]] and the [[Urim and Thummim]] from the [[angel Moroni]]. The [[sword of Laban]] is shown at the bottom.]]
In 1827, Smith said that he had been visited again by the angel who had previously revealed the location of the golden plates, along with other items such as the Urim and Thummim, and that these objects were buried in a nearby hillside. Smith said that after translating the Book of Mormon, he returned the plates and the Urim and Thummim to the angel, whom he identified as the resurrected [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]]. Smith reportedly told [[Orson Pratt]] that the Lord gave him the Urim and Thummim when he was an inexperienced translator but that as he grew in experience, he no longer needed such assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Days' Meeting at Brigham City," ''[[Millennial Star]]'' '''36''' [1874]:498–99).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|LDS Bible Dictionary]] defines the ''Urim and Thummim'' as "an instrument prepared of God to assist man in obtaining [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] from the Lord and in translating languages."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lds.org/scriptures/bd/urim-and-thummim?lang=eng&amp;letter=u Urim and Thummim]," ''Bible Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Book of Mormon, the prophets [[Book of Ether|the Brother of Jared]] and [[Book of Mosiah|Mosiah]] both used devices called "interpreters" to receive revelation for their people, and the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] declares that these "interpreters" were the Urim and Thummim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/17/1#1|title=Doctrine and Covenants 17|website=scriptures.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Latter Day Saints believe that the Urim and Thummim of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon were the functional equivalent of the [[Urim and Thummim]] mentioned in the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;There are seven references to the Urim and Thummim in the Masoretic Text (the basis of most English translations of the Old Testament): {{Bibleverse||Exodus|28:30|}}, {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|8:8|}}, {{Bibleverse||Numbers|27:21|}}, {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|33:8|}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|28:6|}}, {{Bibleverse||Ezra|2:63|}}, {{Bibleverse||Nehemiah|7:65|}}. The Septuagint version (the pre-Christian Greek translation of the Old Testament) and some English translations of {{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|14:41|}} also references them.&lt;/ref&gt; It could be speculated that there were three different sets of Urim and Thummim: the one of the Old Testament (Exodus 28:30) and two mentioned in the Book of Mormon (one used by the [[Jaredites]] and the other by [[King Mosiah I|King Mosiah]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?lang=eng|title=Mosiah 8|website=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation that has been made is that the one used by Smith is the one originally possessed by the Jaredites.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;C 10:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bruce R. McConkie]], ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'' (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), pp. 818–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|ae|Yasht}}s''' (''{{lang|ae|Yašt}}'') are a collection of twenty-one hymns in the [[Avesta|Younger Avestan]] language. Each of these hymns invokes a specific [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] divinity or concept. ''Yasht'' chapter and verse pointers are traditionally abbreviated as ''Yt.''

==Overview==
The word ''yasht'' derives from Middle Persian 𐭩𐭱𐭲 yašt (“prayer, worship”) probably from [[Avestan]] ''𐬫𐬀𐬱𐬙𐬀‎'' (yašta, “honored”), from ''𐬫𐬀𐬰‎'' (yaz, “to worship, honor”), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*yeh₂ǵ-''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Degener|first=Almuth|date=2007-06|title=Cheung, Johnny: Etymological Dictionary of the Iranian Verb|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10783-008-9057-2|journal=Indo-Iranian Journal|volume=50|issue=2|pages=199–201|doi=10.1007/s10783-008-9057-2|issn=0019-7246}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''*Hyaǵ-''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringe|first=Don|date=2001|title=Review of “Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben” by Helmut Rix, et al.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/dia.18.1.15rin|journal=Diachronica International Journal for Historical Linguistics. Founded by E.F.K. Koerner, General Editor, 1984–2001|volume=18|issue=1|pages=184–187|doi=10.1075/dia.18.1.15rin|issn=0176-4225}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and several hymns of the ''[[Yasna]]'' liturgy that "venerate by praise" are—in tradition—also nominally called ''yasht''s. These "hidden" Yashts are: the ''[[Barsom]] Yasht'' (''Yasna'' 2), another ''[[Haoma|Hom]] Yasht'' in ''Yasna'' 9-11, the ''Bhagan Yasht'' of ''Yasna'' 19-21, a hymn to [[Ashi]] in ''Yasna'' 52, another [[Sarosh]] ''Yasht'' in ''Yasna'' 57, the praise of the (hypostasis of) "prayer" in ''Yasna'' 58, and a hymn to the [[Ahurani]] in ''Yasna'' 68. Since these are a part of the primary liturgy, they do not count among the twenty-one hymns of the ''Yasht'' collection.

All the hymns of the ''Yasht'' collection "are written in what appears to be prose, but which, for a large part, may originally have been a (basically) eight-syllable verse, oscillating between four and thirteen syllables, and most often between seven and nine."&lt;ref name="Kellens_1989_38"&gt;{{harvnb|Kellens|1989|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the ''[[yazata]]''s that the individual ''Yasht''s praise also have a dedication in the [[Zoroastrian calendar]]. The exceptions are [[Drvaspa]] and [[Vanant]].

Notes:
{|
|-
|valign="top"|a.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|names|a|none}}
|The ''Yasht''s did not originally have titles. These were assigned at some time during the [[Common Era]], and hence reflect the [[Middle Persian]] forms of the divinities' names.
|-
|valign="top"|b.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|nominal|b|none}}
|Several ''Yasht''s are—despite their names—hymns to other divinities or concepts.
*''Yasht'' 5 is nominally to [[Aban|the waters]] but primarily addresses [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], who is (also) a divinity of the waters.
*''Yasht'' 15 is nominally to Raman (''Rama Kshathra'') but praises the "good" Vayu{{ref_label|vayu|i|none}}
*''Yasht'' 16 is nominally to [[Daena]] "insight, revelation" but actually invokes [[Chista]] "Wisdom". Chista and Daena are very closely associated with one another.
*''Yasht'' 18, nominally to [[Arshtat]], is actually an ode to ''[[khvarenah]]'', the "(divine) glory".
*''Yasht'' 19, nominally to [[Zam]], the "Earth", has very little to do with the earth. See [[Zam]] for details.
|-
|valign="top"|c.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|yt_1_4|b|none}}
|''Yasht''s 1–4 are "mediocre, meaningless texts, composed in incoherent language; they probably result from a very late expansion of the Yašt collection."&lt;ref name="Kellens_1989_38"/&gt;
|-
|valign="top"|d.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|yt_9|d|none}}
|''Yasht'' 9 to [[Drvaspa]] has a number of verses that are originally from ''Yasht'' 5, the hymn to the waters.{{sfn|Kellens|1989|p=39}}
|-
|valign="top"|e.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|yt_11_12|e|none}}
|''Yasht''s 11 and 12 are respectively hymns to [[Sraosha]] and [[Rashnu]], but are to some extent also an extension of ''Yasht'' 10, the hymn to [[Mithra]]. Sraosha and Rashnu are both attendants of Mithra.
|-
|valign="top"|f.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|yt_5|f|none}}
|There is also a "hidden" ''Yasht'' to [[Aban|the waters]] at ''Yasna'' 38.
|-
|valign="top"|g.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|yt_5_17|g|none}}
|''Yasht'' 5 (in praise of [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]]) and ''Yasht'' 17 (to [[Ashi]]) share a number of verses.&lt;!--Boyce 1983:1003--&gt; It is not possible to determine which of the two is the original.
|-
|valign="top"|h.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|yt_20|h|none}}
|The Avesta has two hymns that were later titled ''Hom Yasht''. The original is part of the ''[[Yasna]]'' liturgy and hence not counted as a ''Yasht''. The other, ''Yasht'' 20, is a duplicate of the three verses of ''Yasna'' 9-11.
|-
|valign="top"|i.&amp;nbsp;{{note_label|vayu|i|none}}
|[[Vata-Vayu|Vayu]], divinity of wind and atmosphere, is a dual divinity: part benevolent and part malign.
