Typically, a scholarly article has a section in which the authors acknowledge entities such as funding, technical staff, colleagues, etc. that have contributed materials or knowledge or have influenced or inspired their work. Like a [[citation index]], it measures influences on scientific work, but in a different sense; it measures institutional and economic influences as well as informal influences of individual people, ideas, and artifacts.
Unlike the [[impact factor]], it does not produce a single overall metric, but analyses the components separately. However, the total number of acknowledgements to an acknowledged entity can be measured and so can the number of citations to the papers in which the acknowledgement appears. The ratio of this total number of citations to the total number of papers in which the acknowledge entity appears can be construed as the impact of that acknowledged entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |doi=10.1145/1088622.1088627 |title=Automatic acknowledgement indexing: expanding the semantics of contribution in the CiteSeer digital library |book-title=Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Knowledge capture |conference=K-CAP '05 |pages=19–26 |year=2005 |last1=Councill |first1=Isaac G. |last2=Giles |first2=C.

[[File:Angel f-artificial intelligence.svg|thumb|right|200px|Angel_F]]
'''Angel_F''' is a fictional child [[artificial intelligence]] that has been used in worldwide art performances focused on the issues of digital liberties, [[intellectual property]] and on the evolution of language and behaviour in information society. The character was created by [[Salvatore Iaconesi]] in 2007 as a hack to the '''Biodoll''' art performance by Italian artist '''Franca Formenti'''. 

The project revolves around the story of the technological sensual relationship between the Biodoll, a digital prostitute, and professor '''[[Derrick de Kerckhove]]''', culminating in the birth of the young artificial intelligence. The digital child morphed from a [[spyware]] program capturing internet users' browsing activities in order to gather text to feed an algorithmic language generating system (thus letting the "child" learn how to speak) and became a digital personality used by the artists for both online and real-world performances.

The project was later joined by '''Oriana Persico''' who curated communication and part of the theoretical approaches of the action.

The Angel_F project has been featured in books, magazines, national televisions, and has been invited to many worldwide conferences and events, both academic and artistic. 

On one occasion, in October 2007, Angel_F attended the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) in Rio de Janeiro as the only digital being invited to speak: the young artificial intelligence was featured with a video message concerning the struggles for digital liberties, privacy, knowledge sharing and access to networks and technologies.

==History==

Angel_F is an acronym which stads for ''Autonomous Non Generative E-volitive Life_Form''. The project was born in 2007 and resulted from the fusion of two contemporary art performances.

Franca Formenti, an Italian artist living in Varese, invented the Biodoll  &lt;ref name="bazzichelli"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bazzichelli | first1 = Tatiana | title = [[Networking. La rete come arte]] | publisher = [[Costa &amp; Nolan]] | year= 2006 | isbn = 88-7437-047-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; character in 2002 which began making its appearances first on the network and later in the physical world by using what were called "clones": young women, prostitutes, pornographic starlets, transsexuals and models interpreting the role of a digital prostitute. The Biodoll was an art performance focused on research emerging from the network of new forms of sexualities, and on the analysis of changes brought on by this transformation to the concepts of private and public spaces, privacy, and the possibility of creating multiple fluid identities through language and digital media. At the time the Biodoll character claimed a role in professor Derrick de Kerckhove's life, narratively seducing him and alluring him into joining in the performance, becoming the Biodoll's favourite lover.

The theme of fertility has always been central to the Biodoll performance: the digital prostitute was a wombless clone but desired giving birth to a son, the '''Bloki'''.

In a process starting in 2006 and ending in February 2007, Salvatore Iaconesi (xDxD.vs.xDxD) used his '''Talker''' &lt;ref name="pagliarini"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pagliarini | first = Luigi | first2 = Elisa |last2=Frauenfelder |first3=Clementina |last3=Gily |first4=Domenico |last4=Jervolino |first5=Iginio Sisto |last5=Lancia |first6=Francesca |last6=Marone |first7=Alberto |last7=Oliviero |first8=Santa |last8=Palumbo |first9=Dunia |last9=Pepe |first10=Rocco |last10=Pititto |first11=Franco |last11=Rubinacci |first12=Francesca |last12=Serra |first13=Rosetta |last13=Zan | title = Intelligenza Polimorfa on Scienze cognitive e aperture pedagogiche. Nuovi orizzonti nella formazione degli insegnanti | publisher = Franco Angeli | year = 2007 | location = Rome | isbn = 978-88-464-9547-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; linguistic artificial intelligence to animate the digital child conceived with prof. Derrick de Kerckhove: ''Angel_F''.

Iaconesi and Persico met in November 2006 and immediately started collaborating on the birth of Angel_F.

Angel_F was designed as a synthetic digital being composed through narrative, technological and [[cognitive psychology]] layers. The objective was to create iconic characteristics that resulted in being evocative and able to mimic human life up to a level in which bringing up a symbolic dialogue was possible. On the other side, the artificial identity was to implement and expose the cultural, emotional and relational ways that were typical of networked [[Ecology#Ecosystem|social ecosystems]], among those technologies, systems and infrastructures that entered and shaped people's daily lives.

The young '''[[Artificial life|digital being]]''' mimicked the evolution of a human baby: initially conceived inside the website of its digital mother it emulated the birth of a child by using the metaphor of a virus developing inside a website, taking progressively more space in the domain's databases and interfaces. Content was produced through the software by using small browser-based spyware techniques, through which Angel_F could [[Inference|infer]] the list of major portals that had been visited by the website's users.

The Biodoll website was invaded by this growing presence and, thus, Angel_F was born.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) component of Angel_F was derived from another project, Talker,&lt;ref name="talker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iaconesi |first=Salvatore |title=Talker |url=http://www.artisopensource.net/talkers/index2.html |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620081106/http://www.artisopensource.net/talkers/index2.html |archivedate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through which internet users could build up the AI's linguistic network by feeding it their text and web clips. Angel_F used this component to generate sentences and phrases, publishing them on the interface and on selected blogs.

The parallel between the growth of the AI and that of a child kept building up and, just as children learn how to speak and act by observing their parents and the people around them, Angel_F used its spyware and AI components to learn, to navigate websites and web portals using '''[[web crawler]]''' based techniques, and to interact with other people by using the contents hosted and generated in its database to create surreal dialogues in blogs and websites.

A virtual school was created, called '''Talker Mind''',&lt;ref name="talkermind"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iaconesi |first=Salvatore |title=Talker Mind |url=http://www.artisopensource.net/talker_mind/ |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620083741/http://www.artisopensource.net/talker_mind/ |archivedate=20 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to narratively continue the AI's growth. Five professors ([[Massimo Canevacci]], [[Antonio Caronia]], [[Carlo Formenti]], [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] and [[Luigi Pagliarini]]) fed their texts and academic articles to Angel_F, simulating virtual asynchronous lessons by using a multi-blog structure.&lt;ref name="blogart"&gt;{{cite web|last=Agricola de Cologne |first=Wilfred |title=a+b blogart? |url=http://www.javamuseum.org/blog/?page_id=41 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212161016/http://www.javamuseum.org/blog/?page_id=41 |archivedate=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[peer-to-peer]] system was also created at the time, named '''Presence'''. Its interface resembled the one of [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit videogames]] and the peer to peer users travelled in a starry space and were able to perform standard [[Instant messaging|Instant Messaging]] tasks, such as [[Online chat|chat]] and [[file sharing]]. The interactions were possible both among humans and digital beings. Angel_F was the first user of the Presence peer to peer system.

Angel_F entered the physical world as a baby-stroller mounted laptop computer that was used to let the digital child join events and conferences held worldwide.

The first public space performance was held in [[Milan]], when the Biodoll distributed a generative ''free press'' publication &lt;ref name="bloki1"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Bloki FreePreXXX | date = 20 February 2007 | url = http://www.digicult.it/2007/biodoll.asp | accessdate = 4 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091023080104/http://www.digicult.it/2007/biodoll.asp| archivedate= 23 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the '''Bloki FreePreXXX''', its text was generated algorithmically and inserted into a prepared graphic layout).

The second performance was held in [[Rome]], at the '''[[Forte Prenestino]]''' on June 14, 2007, with a massive playroom created through computational graphics that people could interact with and that were generated by the AI.

Angel_F performed all over the world, both in artistic contexts and in academic ones. It was also used for the communication strategy of several activist groups on the themes of intellectual property and digital freedoms.

On '''June 22, 2007''' Angel_F presented the closing remarks for an '''Ipotesi per Assurdo''' &lt;ref name="ipotesi"&gt;{{cite web | last = Iaconesi | first = Salvatore | title = Ipotesi per Assurdo | url = http://www.slideshare.net/xdxd/ipotesi-per-assurdo | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorello"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cortiana | first = Fiorello | title = Condividi la Conoscenza | url = http://db.formez.it/ArchivioNews.nsf/7fab7a7a86803f49c1256ae800400917/e0fe4b680b8434cac12572f700334708/Testo/M2/condividi_conoscenza3_programma.pdf?OpenElement&amp;ei=7-TJSp_AO86OsAb085ThDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHk5FlR8u4tI39Rv-PQAro3_D_0KQ&amp;sig2=oDMREwxxZ76tCx919Tpuww | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Absurd Hypothesis) with Salvatore Iaconesi and Oriana Persico at the [[IULM| IULM University in Milan]], discussing the possibilities for an ecosystemic, sustainable reinvention of corporations.

On '''July 28, 2007''', hundreds of people at '''LiberaFesta''' (Free Party) in Rome listened to Angel_F in a speech discussing new politics and ''hacker ethics''.

On '''October 2007''', Angel_F was presented live at the ''FE/MALE 2'' event, as an example of an atypical family during a public debate on new sexualities and social change.

Again in '''October 2007''', Angel_F made a series of public performances [[Florence]]'s '''Festival della Creatività''' (Festival of Creativity), an institutional event held periodically to showcase Italy's and other countries' best technological projects. During the festival Derrick de Kerckhove publicly recognized the little AI as his digital son.&lt;ref name="derickpapa"&gt;{{cite web | last = de Kerckhove | first = Derrick | title = Festival della Creatività | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD3UVluoF0c | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''October 2008''', Angel_F was used at a public event on a European scale called '''Freedom not Fear''' discussing privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="fnf"&gt;{{cite web | title = Freedom Not Fear | url = http://www.artsblog.it/post/2428/incursione-digitale-di-angel_f-e-del-super-avatar-al-freedom-not-fear-in-esclusiva-per-i-lettori-di-artsblog | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately ('''July 2009''') Angel_F has been seen with its digital father Derrick de Kerckhove to protest against Italy's harsh politics on freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="angelino"&gt;{{cite web | title = Blogger Strike in Piazza Navona | url = http://www.artsblog.it/post/3645/angelino-is-watching-you | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case of censorship saw Angel_F involved, when it was not allowed to post its contribution to the '''DFIR''' (Dialogue Forum for Internet Rights) held in ''Rome'' on '''September 2007''' in preparation for Rio de Janeiro's Internet Governance Forum (IGF) edition.&lt;ref name="vetere"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vetere |first=Guido |title=L'identità di Angel_F |url=http://guidovetere.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2007/09/angel_f.html |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114081406/http://guidovetere.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2007/09/angel_f.html |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case quickly turned into a collaboration among the involved parties &lt;ref name="dicorinto"&gt;[[:it:Arturo Di Corinto|Arturo di Corinto]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Angel_F was invited to the global event in Brazil where it was the only present digital being: on that occasion Angel_F contributed a videomessage, in the digital freedoms workshop, which suggested some ideas for action to the [[United Nations]] and to all the parties involved in the global ''IGF'' organization.

==Background==

Angel_F mixes real technologically advanced systems with a poetic, narrative approach. In the performance real and not-real are constantly intermixed, and the concepts, techniques and characteristics of the whole project have been analyzed multiple times in several international academic events and research projects.

Angel_F's authors coined the term '''[[NeoRealismo Virtuale]]''' (Virtual NeoRealism) to identify the practices created and used in the project. Its intent is to describe and represent the contemporary world in its hybrid analog/digital form, with digital technologies progressively interacting and integrating to the physical world, even on the level of personal identity and private/public space definitions.

The '''Glocal &amp; Outsiders conference''' &lt;ref name="kera"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kera | first = Denisa | title = Glocal and Outsiders | url = http://glocaloutsiders.wordpress.com/ | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in '''[[Prague]]''' at the ''[[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Sciences]]'' in '''2007''' was the first academic presentation of the Angel_F project, together with the ''Biodoll''.

By '''December 2007''' several international associations,&lt;ref name="frontiere"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontiere Digitali |url=http://tv.frontieredigitali.net/convegni/liberazione-2007/angel_f-liberafesta-roma-luglio-2007 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723132210/http://tv.frontieredigitali.net/convegni/liberazione-2007/angel_f-liberafesta-roma-luglio-2007 |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arcoiris"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arcoiris TV |url=http://www.arcoiris.tv/modules.php?name=Lettere&amp;op=esteso&amp;id=3328 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723054811/http://www.arcoiris.tv/modules.php?name=Lettere&amp;op=esteso&amp;id=3328 |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific researchers had been involved with Angel_F, eventually producing the system and process used to set up the ''Talker Mind'' digital school for the AI with Angel_F's professors.

On '''March 2008''' the [[Tecnológico de Monterrey]] university in [[Mexico City]] organized the '''Computer Art Congress 2''' &lt;ref name="cac2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Computer Art Congress | url = http://europia.org/CAC2/ | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; international event, featuring Angel_F's project among with the ones by scientific researchers worldwide.&lt;ref name="cac2book"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Zreik | first1 = Khaldoun | last2 = Reyes García | first2 = Everardo | first3 = Marc |last3=Veyrat |first4=Daniel |last4=Bouillot |first5=Jacques |last5=Ibanez Bueno |first6=Oriana |last6=Persico |first7=Salvatore |last7=Iaconesi | title = Angel_f, in Computer art congress: CAC 2 | publisher = Europia | year = 2008 | location = Mexico City | id = {{Listed Invalid ISBN|978-2-909285-45-0}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''July 2008''', the project was presented in [[Austria]] at the ''[[Planetary Collegium]]'''s '''[[Planetary_Collegium#The_Consciousness_Reframed_Conferences|Consciousness Reframed 9]]''' conference, together with the ''NeoRealismo Virtuale''.&lt;ref name="cr9"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ascott | first1 = Roy | last2 = Bast | first2 = Gerald | last3= Fiel | first3= Wolfgang  | first4 = Roy |last4=Ascott |first5=Gerald |last5=Bast |first6=Wolfgang |last6=Fiel |first7=Margarete |last7=Jahrmann |first8=Ruth |last8=Schnell |first9=Oriana |last9=Persico |first10=Salvatore |last10=Iaconesi | title = Technologically-aware ecosystems in Art and Society, New realities: Being Syncretic | publisher = Springer | year = 2008 | location = New York | isbn = 978-3-211-78890-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of 2009, the project continues, both artistically and academically.

A book is about to be published in '''November 2009''' by ''Castelvecchi Editore'' in Italy, titled '''Angel F. Diario di una intelligenza artificiale''' &lt;ref name="angel"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Iaconesi | first1 = Salvatore | last2 = Persico | first2 = Oriana | title = Angel F.

[[File:Jakob Jordaens 016.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Jacob Jordaens]], ''The Bean King''. Oil on canvas, ca. 1640- 1645.]]

A '''bean-feast''' was an informal term for a celebratory meal or party, especially an annual summer dinner given by an employer to his or her employees, probably derived from a tradition in the [[Low Countries]] at [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bean-Feast |volume=3 |page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, colloquially, it describes any festive occasion with a meal and perhaps an outing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beanfeast From Merriam Webster Unabridged Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word, and its shorter form "beano," are fairly common in Britain, less known in the United States. An alternative derivation refers the name to the eating of a dish of beans and bacon, and seems to trace to 1725, when Daniel Day of [[Wapping]], London began to entertain friends near his estate at [[Fairlop]] in [[Essex]] on the first Friday in July.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qlJEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 ''Beauties of England and Wales''], Volume 10, Issue 3, Part 1, By Britton, pub. T. Maiden, 1815&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the beanfeast often took the form of a trip to some beauty spot, where the meal was provided. (e.g. ..''I want a feast, I want a bean feast. Cream buns and doughnuts and fruitcake with no nuts, so good you could go nuts. '' - Veruca Salt, [[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]])

It is derived from the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] feast, at which a [[king cake]] or pie with a special object or "favour" buried in it was a great feature. This remains a common custom in much of Europe and former European colonies; in the US mainly in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tI0eemYCDFgC&amp;pg=PA48 ''Mardi Gras, Gumbo, and Zydeco: Readings in Louisiana Culture''], eds Marcia G. Gaudet, James C. McDonald, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere the favour took various forms, including metal tokens and small pottery figures.  In the Low Countries a bean was usual.  The '''bean king''' for the rest of the night was the person who had the slice of cake containing the bean.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  The king (or queen) was given a paper crown to wear, and appointed various court officials.  When the king took a drink, all the party shouted "the king drinks". The subject was often painted by [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painters]], especially [[Jacob Jordaens]] and [[Jan Steen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/48341/?lng= Hermitage Museum]; [https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-feast-of-the-bean-king/MwEBgGg74T1f2g]; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hTBv607RId8C&amp;pg=PT45 ''Beans: A History''], Ken Albala, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brownian motion''' or '''pedesis''' (from {{lang-grc|πήδησις}} {{IPA|/pέːdεːsis/}} "leaping"&lt;!--not to be confused with πέδησις "braking"--&gt;) is the random motion of [[particle]]s suspended in a [[fluid]] (a [[liquid]] or a [[gas]]) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving [[molecule]]s in the fluid.&lt;ref name=Feynman-41&gt;

This pattern of motion typically alternates random fluctuations in a particle's position inside a fluid sub-domain with a relocation to another sub-domain.  Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume.  This pattern describes a fluid at [[thermal equilibrium]], defined by a given [[temperature]]. Within such fluid there exists no preferential direction of flow as in [[transport phenomena]].  More specifically the fluid's overall [[Linear momentum|linear]] and [[Angular momentum|angular]] momenta remain null over time.  It is important also to note that the [[Kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] of the molecular Brownian motions, together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations [[Equipartition theorem|sum up to the caloric component]] of a fluid's [[internal energy]].

This motion is named after the botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]], who was the most eminent microscopist of his time. In 1827, while looking through a microscope at pollen of the plant ''[[Clarkia pulchella]]'' immersed in water, the triangular shaped pollen burst at the corners, emitting particles which he noted jiggled around in the water in random fashion. He was not able to determine the mechanisms that caused this motion. [[Atomic theory|Atoms and molecules]] had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and [[Albert Einstein]] published [[Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|a paper in 1905]] that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first big contributions to science. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]] in 1908. Perrin was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1926 "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter". The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.

The [[Many-body problem|many-body interactions]] that yield the Brownian pattern cannot be solved by a model accounting for every involved molecule. In consequence only probabilistic models applied to [[Statistical ensemble|molecular populations]] can be employed to describe it.  Two such models of the [[statistical mechanics]], due to Einstein and Smoluchowski are presented below.  Another, pure probabilistic class of models is the class of the [[stochastic process]] models.  There exist both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which in extreme ("taken to the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]") may describe the Brownian Motion (see [[random walk]] and [[Donsker's theorem]]).

==History==

The Roman [[Lucretius]]'s scientific poem "[[On the Nature of Things]]" (c. 60 BC) has a remarkable description of Brownian motion of dust particles in verses 113–140 from Book II. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms:
[[File:PerrinPlot2.svg|thumb|Reproduced from the book of [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]], ''Les Atomes'', three tracings of the motion of colloidal particles of radius 0.53&amp;nbsp;µm, as seen under the microscope, are displayed. Successive positions every 30 seconds are joined by straight line segments (the mesh size is 3.2&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perrin |first=Jean |year=1914 |title=Atoms |url=https://archive.org/stream/atomsper00perruoft#page/115/mode/1up |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

"Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [i.e., spontaneously]. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible."

Although the mingling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents, the glittering, tumbling motion of small dust particles is, indeed, caused chiefly by true Brownian dynamics.

While [[Jan Ingenhousz]] described the irregular motion of [[coal]] [[dust]] particles on the surface of [[ethanol|alcohol]] in 1785, the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1827. Brown was studying [[pollen]] grains of the plant ''[[Clarkia pulchella]]'' suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.

The first person to describe the mathematics behind Brownian motion was [[Thorvald N. Thiele]] in a paper on the method of [[least squares]] published in 1880. This was followed independently by [[Louis Bachelier]] in 1900 in his PhD thesis "The theory of speculation", in which he presented a stochastic analysis of the stock and option markets. The Brownian motion model of the [[stock market]] is often cited, but [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] rejected its applicability to stock price movements in part because these are discontinuous.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] (in one of his [[Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|1905 papers]]) and [[Marian Smoluchowski]] (1906) brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists, and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. Their equations describing Brownian motion were subsequently verified by the experimental work of [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]] in 1908.

==Statistical mechanics theories==

=== Einstein's theory ===
There are two parts to Einstein's theory: the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the [[mean squared displacement]] of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities.&lt;ref name=Eistein1956&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance to [[Avogadro's law]] this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as [[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's constant]], and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom since the latter is obtained by dividing the mass of a mole of the gas by Avogadro's constant.

[[File:Diffusion of Brownian particles.svg|thumb|300px|The characteristic bell-shaped curves of the diffusion of Brownian particles. The distribution begins as a [[Dirac delta function]], indicating that all the particles are located at the origin at time t=0, and for increasing times they become flatter and flatter until the distribution becomes uniform in the asymptotic time limit.]]

The first part of Einstein's argument was to determine how far a Brownian particle travels in a given time interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=BROWNIAN MOTION|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance because of the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo, roughly of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; collisions per second.&lt;ref name=Feynman-41/&gt; Thus Einstein was led to consider the collective motion of Brownian particles.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

He regarded the increment of particle positions in time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in a one dimensional (''x'') space (with the coordinates chosen so that the origin lies at the initial position of the particle) as a random variable (&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;) with some probability density function &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\Delta)&lt;/math&gt;. Further, assuming conservation of particle number, he expanded the density (number of particles per unit volume) at time &lt;math&gt;t + \tau&lt;/math&gt; in a Taylor series,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho(x,t) + \tau \frac{\partial\rho(x)}{\partial t} + \cdots = \rho(x, t+\tau) ={}&amp; \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \rho(x - \Delta, t) \cdot \varphi(\Delta) \, \mathrm{d} \Delta = \mathbb{E}_\Delta[\rho(x, t + \tau)]
\\
={}&amp; \rho(x, t) \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \varphi(\Delta) \, d \Delta -
 \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial x} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \Delta \cdot \varphi(\Delta) \, \mathrm{d} \Delta 
\\
&amp;{}+
 \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial x^2} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\Delta^2}{2} \cdot \varphi(\Delta) \, \mathrm{d} \Delta + \cdots
\\
={}&amp; \rho(x, t) \cdot 1 + 0 +
 \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial x^2} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\Delta^2}{2} \cdot \varphi(\Delta) \, \mathrm{d} \Delta + \cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equality in the first line is by definition of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The integral in the first term is equal to one by the definition of probability, and the second and other even terms (i.e. first and other odd moments) vanish because of space symmetry. What is left gives rise to the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial x^2} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\Delta^2}{2\, \tau} \cdot \varphi(\Delta) \, \mathrm{d} \Delta + \text{higher-order even moments}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where the coefficient after the Laplacian, the second moment of probability of displacement &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, is interpreted as [[mass diffusivity]] ''D'':

:&lt;math&gt; D = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\Delta^2}{2\, \tau} \cdot \varphi(\Delta) \, \mathrm{d} \Delta &lt;/math&gt;

Then the density of Brownian particles ρ at point ''x'' at time ''t'' satisfies the [[diffusion equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=D\cdot \frac{\partial^2\rho}{\partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that N particles start from the origin at the initial time t=0, the diffusion equation has the solution

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,t)=\frac{N}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression (which is a [[normal distribution]] with the mean &lt;math&gt; \mu=0&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2=2Dt&lt;/math&gt; usually called Brownian motion &lt;math&gt; B_t&lt;/math&gt;) allowed Einstein to calculate the [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] directly. The first moment is seen to vanish, meaning that the Brownian particle is equally likely to move to the left as it is to move to the right. The second moment is, however, non-vanishing, being given by

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x^2}=2\,D\,t.&lt;/math&gt;

This expresses the mean squared displacement in terms of the time elapsed and the diffusivity. From this expression Einstein argued that the displacement of a Brownian particle is not proportional to the elapsed time, but rather to its square root.&lt;ref name=Eistein1956/&gt; His argument is based on a conceptual switch from the "ensemble" of Brownian particles to the "single" Brownian particle: we can speak of the relative number of particles at a single instant just as well as of the time it takes a Brownian particle to reach a given point.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of Einstein's theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities, such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval. This result enables the experimental determination of Avogadro's number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces. The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium.

In his original treatment, Einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment, but the same conclusion can be reached in other ways.

Consider, for instance, particles suspended in a viscous fluid in a gravitational field. Gravity tends to make the particles settle, whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them, driving them into regions of smaller concentration. Under the action of gravity, a particle acquires a downward speed of ''v'' = ''μmg'', where ''m'' is the mass of the particle, ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity, and ''μ'' is the particle's [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|mobility]] in the fluid. [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] had shown that the mobility for a spherical particle with radius ''r'' is &lt;math&gt;\mu=\tfrac{1}{6\pi\eta r}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''η'' is the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the fluid. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, and under the hypothesis of isothermal fluid, the particles are distributed according to the [[Barometric formula|barometric distribution]]

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\rho_0e^{-\frac{mgh}{k_BT}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ−ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the difference in density of particles separated by a height difference of ''h'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] (namely, the ratio of the [[universal gas constant]], ''R'', to Avogadro's number, ''N''), and ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].  Avogadro's number is to be determined.

[[File:Brownian motion gamboge.jpg|thumb|The equilibrium distribution for particles of [[gamboge]] shows the tendency for granules to move to regions of lower concentration when affected by gravity.]]
[[Dynamic equilibrium]] is established because the more that particles are pulled down by [[gravity]], the greater the tendency for the particles to migrate to regions of lower concentration. The flux is given by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's law]],

:&lt;math&gt;J=-D\frac{d\rho}{dh},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' = ρ''v''. Introducing the formula for ρ, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{Dmg}{k_BT}.&lt;/math&gt;

In a state of dynamical equilibrium, this speed must also be equal to ''v'' = ''μmg''. Notice that both expressions for ''v'' are proportional to ''mg'', reflecting that the derivation is independent of the type of forces considered. Similarly, one can derive an equivalent formula for identical [[charged particle]]s of charge ''q'' in a uniform [[electric field]] of magnitude ''E'', where ''mg'' is replaced with the [[electrostatic force]] ''qE''.  Equating these two expressions yields a formula for the diffusivity, independent of ''mg'' or ''qE'' or other such forces:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\overline{x^2}}{2t}=D=\mu k_BT=\frac{\mu RT}{N}=\frac{RT}{6\pi\eta rN}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the first equality follows from the first part of Einstein's theory, the third equality follows from the definition of [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]] as ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R / N'', and the fourth equality follows from Stokes's formula for the mobility. By measuring the mean squared displacement over a time interval along with the universal gas constant ''R'', the temperature ''T'', the viscosity ''η'', and the particle radius ''r'', Avogadro's number ''N'' can be determined.

The type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by Einstein was not new. It had been pointed out previously by [[J. J. Thomson]]&lt;ref name=Electricity&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Thomson |first=J. J.
 |year=1904
 |title=Electricity and Matter
 |pages=80–83
 |publisher=Yale University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his series of lectures at Yale University in May 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a [[concentration gradient]] given by Fick's law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion "gives us a method of determining Avogadro's Constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules, or of the way in which they act upon each other".&lt;ref name=Electricity/&gt;

An identical expression to Einstein's formula for the diffusion coefficient was also found by [[Walther Nernst]] in 1888&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Nernst |first=Walther

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expressed the diffusion coefficient as the ratio of the [[osmotic pressure]] to the ratio of the [[Friction|frictional force]] and the velocity to which it gives rise. The former was equated to the [[Van 't Hoff factor|law of van 't Hoff]] while the latter was given by [[Stokes's law]]. He writes &lt;math&gt;k'=p_0/k&lt;/math&gt; for the diffusion coefficient ''k′'', where &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is the osmotic pressure and ''k'' is the ratio of the frictional force to the molecular viscosity which he assumes is given by Stokes's formula for the viscosity. Introducing the [[ideal gas law]] per unit volume for the osmotic pressure, the formula becomes identical to that of Einstein's.&lt;ref&gt;

At first, the predictions of Einstein's formula were seemingly refuted by a series of experiments by Svedberg in 1906 and 1907, which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the predicted value, and by Henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than Einstein's formula predicted.&lt;ref&gt;See P. Clark 1976, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; But Einstein's predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein's theory constituted empirical progress for the [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory of heat]]. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of [[thermal equilibrium]]. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory's account of the [[Second law of thermodynamics|second law]] of [[thermodynamics]] as being an essentially statistical law.&lt;ref&gt;See P. Clark 1976 for this whole paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; starts from the same premise as that of Einstein and derives the same probability distribution ρ(''x'', ''t'') for the displacement of a Brownian particle along the ''x'' in time ''t''. He therefore gets the same expression for the mean squared displacement: &lt;math&gt;\overline{(\Delta x)^2}&lt;/math&gt;. However, when he relates it to a particle of mass ''m'' moving at a velocity ''u'' which is the result of a frictional force governed by Stokes's law, he finds
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{(\Delta x)^2}=2Dt=t\frac{32}{81}\frac{\mu^2}{\pi\mu a}=t\frac{64}{27}\frac{\frac{1}{2}\mu^2}{3\pi\mu a},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ'' is the viscosity coefficient, and ''a'' is the radius of the particle. Associating the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;\mu^2/2&lt;/math&gt; with the thermal energy ''RT''/''N'', the expression for the mean squared displacement is 64/27 times that found by Einstein. The fraction 27/64 was commented on by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] in his necrology on Smoluchowski: "The numerical coefficient of Einstein, which differs from Smoluchowski by 27/64 can only be put in doubt."&lt;ref&gt;See p. 535 in {{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to answer the question of why a Brownian particle should be displaced by bombardments of smaller particles when the probabilities for striking it in the forward and rear directions are equal. 
If the probability of ''m'' gains and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' losses follows a [[binomial distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;P_{m,n}=\binom{n}{m} 2^{-n},&lt;/math&gt;

with equal ''a priori'' probabilities of 1/2, the mean total gain is

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{2m-n}=\sum_{m=\frac{n}{2}}^n (2m-n)P_{m,n}=\frac{n n!}{2^n \left [ \left (\frac{n}{2} \right )! \right ]^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n'' is large enough so that Stirling's approximation can be used in the form
:&lt;math&gt;n!\approx\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n\sqrt{2\pi n},&lt;/math&gt;
then the expected total gain will be{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{2m-n}\approx\sqrt{\frac{2n}{\pi}},&lt;/math&gt;
showing that it increases as the square root of the total population.

Suppose that a Brownian particle of mass ''M'' is surrounded by lighter particles of mass ''m'' which are traveling at a speed ''u''. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be ''mu''/''M''. This ratio is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000&amp;nbsp;cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.

These orders of magnitude are not exact because they don't take into consideration the velocity of the Brownian particle, ''U'', which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger ''U'' is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. Could such a process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, &lt;math&gt;MU^2/2&lt;/math&gt;, will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, &lt;math&gt;mu^2/2&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1906 Smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes collisions with ''M''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;''m'' where ''M'' is the test particle's mass and ''m'' the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid. It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right. It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of Δ''V''. If ''N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of collisions from the right and ''N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' the number of collisions from the left then after ''N'' collisions the particle's velocity will have changed by Δ''V''(2''N''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''N''). The [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] is then simply given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{N}{N_R} = \frac{N!}{N_R!(N-N_R)!}&lt;/math&gt;

and the total number of possible states is given by 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the probability of the particle being hit from the right ''N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' times is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_N(N_R)=\frac{N!}{2^NN_R!(N-N_R)!}&lt;/math&gt;

As a result of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively describe Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid many of the assumptions cannot be made. For example, the assumption that on average there occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible Δ''V''s instead of always just one in a realistic situation.

===Other physics models using partial differential equations===
The [[diffusion equation]] yields an approximation of the time evolution of the [[probability density function]] associated to the position of the particle going under a Brownian movement under the physical definition. The approximation is valid on [[Langevin equation|short]] timescales.

The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself is best described using [[Langevin equation]], an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the [[thermal fluctuations]] of the solvent on the particle.

The displacement of a particle undergoing Brownian motion is obtained by solving the [[diffusion equation]] under appropriate boundary conditions and finding the [[root mean square|rms]] of the solution. This shows that the displacement varies as the square root of the time (not linearly), which explains why previous experimental results concerning the velocity of Brownian particles gave nonsensical results. A linear time dependence was incorrectly assumed.

At very short time scales, however, the motion of a particle is dominated by its inertia and its displacement will be linearly dependent on time: Δ''x'' = ''v''Δ''t''. So the instantaneous velocity of the Brownian motion can be measured as ''v'' = Δ''x''/Δ''t'', when Δ''t'' &lt;&lt; ''τ'', where ''τ'' is the momentum relaxation time. In 2010, the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with an optical tweezer) was measured successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Main|Wiener process}}
[[File:2D Random Walk 400x400.ogv|thumb|right|300px|An animated example of a Brownian motion-like [[random walk]] on a [[torus]]. In the [[scaling limit]], random walk approaches the Wiener process according to [[Donsker's theorem]].]]
In [[mathematics]], Brownian motion is described by the '''Wiener process'''; a continuous-time [[stochastic process]] named in honor of [[Norbert Wiener]]. It is one of the best known [[Lévy process]]es ([[càdlàg]] stochastic processes with [[stationary process|stationary]] [[independent increments]]) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, [[economy|economics]] and [[physics]].
[[File:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|A single realisation of three-dimensional Brownian motion for times 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2]]

The Wiener process ''W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is characterized by four facts{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}:
#''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
#''W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[almost surely]] continuous
#''W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' has independent increments
#&lt;math&gt;W_t-W_s\sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s)&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq s \le t&lt;/math&gt;).
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[normal distribution]] with [[expected value]] ''μ'' and [[variance]] ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The condition that it has independent increments means that if &lt;math&gt;0 \leq s_1 &lt; t_1 \leq s_2 &lt; t_2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;W_{t_1}-W_{s_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_{t_2}-W_{s_2}&lt;/math&gt; are independent random variables.

An alternative characterisation of the Wiener process is the so-called ''Lévy characterisation'' that says that the Wiener process is an almost surely continuous [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] with ''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and [[quadratic variation]] &lt;math&gt;[W_t, W_t] = t&lt;/math&gt;.

A third characterisation is that the Wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; random variables. This representation can be obtained using the [[Karhunen–Loève theorem]].

The Wiener process can be constructed as the [[scaling limit]] of a [[random walk]], or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as [[Donsker's theorem]]. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is [[scale invariance|scale invariant]].

The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself can be described approximately by a [[Langevin equation]], an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the [[thermal fluctuations]] of the solvent on the Brownian particle. On long timescales, the mathematical Brownian motion is well described by a Langevin equation. On small timescales, [[inertia]]l effects are prevalent in the Langevin equation. However the mathematical ''Brownian motion'' is exempt of such inertial effects. Note that inertial effects have to be considered in the Langevin equation, otherwise the equation becomes singular.{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} so that simply removing the [[inertia]] term from this equation would not yield an exact description, but rather a singular behavior in which the particle doesn't move at all.{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}

===Lévy characterisation===
The French mathematician [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]] proved the following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-valued stochastic process ''X'' to actually be ''n''-dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, Lévy's condition can actually be used as an alternative definition of Brownian motion.

Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a continuous stochastic process on a [[probability space]] (Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;'''P''') taking values in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the following are equivalent:

# ''X'' is a Brownian motion with respect to '''P''', i.e., the law of ''X'' with respect to '''P''' is the same as the law of an ''n''-dimensional Brownian motion, i.e., the [[push-forward measure]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;('''P''') is [[classical Wiener measure]] on ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;+∞);&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).
# both
## ''X'' is a [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] with respect to '''P''' (and its own [[natural filtration]]); and
## for all 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;−''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;''t'' is a martingale with respect to '''P''' (and its own [[natural filtration]]), where ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[Kronecker delta]].

===Riemannian manifold===
[[File:BMonSphere.jpg|thumb|Brownian motion on a 2-sphere]]
{{Technical|section|date=June 2011}}

The [[Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|infinitesimal generator]] (and hence characteristic operator) of a Brownian motion on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is easily calculated to be ½Δ, where Δ denotes the [[Laplace operator]]. In [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and [[edge detection]]. This observation is useful in defining Brownian motion on an ''m''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g''): a '''Brownian motion on''' ''M'' is defined to be a diffusion on ''M'' whose characteristic operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; in local coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''m'', is given by ½Δ&lt;sub&gt;LB&lt;/sub&gt;, where Δ&lt;sub&gt;LB&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] given in local coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\mathrm{LB}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\det(g)}} \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \left(\sqrt{\det(g)} \sum_{j=1}^m g^{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where [''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt;]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in the sense of [[Invertible matrix|the inverse of a square matrix]].

==Narrow escape==
The '''[[narrow escape problem]]''' is a ubiquitous problem in biology, biophysics and cellular biology which has the following formulation: a Brownian particle ([[ion]], [[molecule]], or [[protein]]) is confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. The narrow escape problem is that of calculating the mean escape time. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a [[singular perturbation]] problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12923">A '''center of origin''' (or '''center of diversity''') is a geographical area where a group of organisms, either domesticated or wild, first developed its distinctive properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i0510e.pdf |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |year=2009|page=Article 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also considered centers of diversity. Centers of origin were first identified in 1924 by [[Nikolai Vavilov]].

==Plants==
Locating the origin of crop plants is basic to [[plant breeding]].  This allows one to locate wild relatives, related species, and new genes (especially dominant [[genes]], which may provide resistance to diseases).
Knowledge of the origins of crop plants is important in order to avoid [[genetic erosion]], the loss of germplasm due to the loss of ecotypes and landraces, loss of habitat (such as rainforests), and increased urbanization. Germplasm preservation is accomplished through [[gene banks]] (largely seed collections but now frozen stem sections) and preservation of natural habitats (especially in centers of origin).

A Vavilov Center (of Diversity) is a region of the world first indicated by [[Nikolai Vavilov]] to be an original center for the domestication of plants.&lt;ref name="cornell2000"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cornell and Polish research scientists lead effort to save invaluable potato genetic archive in Russia |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/July00/Vavilov.bpf.html |author=Blaine P.

Vavilov argued that plants were not domesticated somewhere in the world at random, but that there were regions where domestication started. The center of origin is also considered the center of diversity.

Vavilov centers are regions where a high diversity of [[crop wild relative]]s can be found, representing the natural relatives of domesticated crop plants. Later in 1935 Vavilov divided the centers into 12, giving the following list:

# Chinese center
# Indian center
# Indo-Malayan center
# Central Asiatic center
# Persian center
# Mediterranean center
# Abyssinian center
# South American center
# Central American center
# Chilean center
# Brazilian-Paraguayan center
# North American center

==Importance==

In 2016, researchers linked the origins and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that foreign crops were 68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean, and their usage has greatly increased in the last fifty years.&lt;ref name=Khouryorigins&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Achicanoy, H.A. |author3=Bjorkman, A.D. |author4=Navarro-Racines, C. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Flores-Palacios, X. |author7=Engels, J.M.M. |author8=Wiersema, J.H. |author9=Dempewolf, H. |author10=Sotelo, S. |author11=Ramírez-Villegas, J. |author12=Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P. |author13=Fowler, C. |author14=Jarvis, A. |author15=Rieseberg, L.H. |author16=Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.

The '''Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities''' ('''CRASSH''') is an interdisciplinary research centre within the [[University of Cambridge]] for collaboration between researchers from the [[arts]], [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].  The Centre is independent of any university department but works with both the School of Arts and Humanities, and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Founded in 2001, CRASSH celebrated its 10th anniversary by welcoming professor [[Simon Goldhill]] as its new director and moving from Mill Lane, to the Alison Richard Building at 7 West Road, as well as inaugurating a new series of public lectures, which in 2011 were on [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1804/ The Idea of the University] and in 2012 [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/11 Understanding Society].

==New Building: 7 West Road==
At beginning of 2012, CRASSH moved into the new [[Alison Richard]] building at the West Road gateway to the University’s [[Sidgwick Site]], the main base for humanities and social science teaching and research at Cambridge. The building was designed by [[Nicholas Hare Architects]] and received a commendation at the 2013 [[Civic Trust Awards]]. The move into [http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/page/1006/new-building.htm 7 West Road]  provides in-house space for larger conferences, but also creates greater interaction with old and new constituencies. The Centre’s relocation puts CRASSH alongside the major regional studies centres and POLIS, the Department of Politics and International Studies. The building is also home to [[Edmund de Waal]]'s first piece of public sculpture, A Local History, a commission of three vitrines filled with porcelain and sunk into the pavement outside the building.

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
{{aquatic layer topics}}
A '''chemocline''' is a [[Cline (hydrology)|cline]] caused by a strong, vertical [[chemistry]] gradient within a body of [[water]]. A chemocline is analogous to a [[thermocline]], the border at which warmer and cooler waters meet in an ocean, sea, lake, or other body of water. (In some cases, the thermocline and chemocline coincide.)

Chemoclines most commonly occur where local conditions favor the formations of anoxic bottom water &amp;mdash; deep water deficient in [[oxygen]], where only [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] forms of life can exist. The [[Black Sea]] is the classic example of such a body, though similar bodies of water (classified as [[meromictic]] lakes) exist across the globe. [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] life is restricted to the region above the chemocline, anaerobic below. Photosynthetic forms of anaerobic [[bacteria]], like green phototrophic and [[purple sulfur bacteria]], cluster at the chemocline, taking advantage of both the sunlight from above and the [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) produced by the anaerobic bacteria below.

In any body of water in which oxygen-rich surface waters are well-mixed ([[holomictic]]), no chemocline will exist. To cite the most obvious example, the Earth's global ocean has no chemocline.

==Types of clines==
* [[Thermocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[temperature]]
* [[Halocline]]  - A cline based on difference in water [[salinity]]
* [[Pycnocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[density]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36362">'''Cognitive biology''' is an emerging science that regards natural [[cognition]] as a [[biological function]].&lt;ref&gt;p133 in Lyon and Keijzer (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theoretical assumption that every [[organism]]—whether a single cell or [[multicellular]]—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a [[sensory-motor coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Duijn, et al. (2006). "Principles of minimal cognition: Casting cognition as sensorimotor coordination."&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007). “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; And since by [[Darwinian theory]] the [[species]] of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Spetch and Friedman (2006), "Comparative cognition of object recognition.".&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems,&lt;ref&gt;Baluška and Mancuso (2009). Deep evolutionary origins of neurobiology: Turning the essence of ‘neural’ upside-down.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013a) and visit the Comparative Cognition Society to enjoy their publication, ''[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
While [[cognitive science]] endeavors to explain human thought and the [[conscious mind]], the work of cognitive biology is focused on the most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large&lt;ref&gt;[1]See for examples Byrne, et al. (2009), “Elephant cognition in primate perspective.”&lt;/ref&gt; and small,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Ben Jacob, et al. (2006). "Seeking the foundations of cognition in bacteria.”&lt;/ref&gt; both plant&lt;ref&gt;As one example, see Calvo and Keijzer  (2009), "Cognition in plants."&lt;/ref&gt; and animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ ''Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews'']&lt;/ref&gt; “Mounting evidence suggests that even [[bacteria]] grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007), “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; Without thinking or [[Perception|perceiving]] as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], then finds an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is due to the lack of a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a ''[[science]]'' of cognitive biology has yet to be established.&lt;ref&gt;There is no mention of cognitive biology, for example, in Frankish and Ramsey (2012), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science''. Nor is cognitive biology mentioned in Margolis, et al.(2012), ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prolegomena]]&lt;ref&gt;At the 2007 meeting of the International Society for the History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, a paper was presented with the apt title: “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.” See Lyon and Opie (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Goodwin and Ladislav Kováč, discussed below.&lt;/ref&gt; have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.

Although the two terms are sometimes used synonymously,&lt;ref&gt;See p135, 136, and 150 in Huber and Wilkinson (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive biology should not be confused with the [[Santiago Theory of Cognition|biology of cognition]] in the sense that it is used by adherents to the Chilean School of Biology of Cognition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inteco.cl/biology/&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the Santiago School, the biology of cognition is based on the work of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana (1970), “Biology of Cognition.”&lt;/ref&gt; who crafted the doctrine of [[autopoiesis]]. Their work began in 1970 while the first mention of cognitive biology by [[Brian Goodwin]] (discussed below) was in 1977 from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977), "Cognitive biology." A copy of this four page paper is difficult to find. However, an eight page paper—Goodwin (1978), “A cognitive view of biological process,”—is easy to procure and uses his own 1977 paper as a reference. A study of the other references in the ’78 paper suggests a unique perspective without mention of Maturana or Varela.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'Cognitive biology' first appeared in the literature as a paper with that title by [[Brian Goodwin|Brian C. Goodwin]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977) "Cognitive biology."&lt;/ref&gt; There and in several related publications&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 1976a, 1976b, and 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin explained the advantage of cognitive biology in the context of his work on morphogenesis. He subsequently moved on to other issues of structure, form, and complexity with little further mention of cognitive biology. Without an advocate, Goodwin’s concept of cognitive biology has yet to gain widespread acceptance. 
 
Aside from an essay regarding Goodwin’s conception by [[Margaret Boden]] in 1980, the next appearance of ‘cognitive biology’ as a phrase in the literature came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, [[Ladislav Kováč]]. His conception, based on natural principles grounded in bioenergetics and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kováč’s continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian.

By the 1990s, breakthroughs in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a cornucopia of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Yet aside from the theorists already mentioned, no one was addressing cognitive biology except for Kováč.
 
=== Kováč’s cognitive biology ===

Ladislav Kováč's “Introduction to cognitive biology” (Kováč, 1986a) lists ten ‘Principles of Cognitive Biology.’ A closely related thirty page paper was published the following year: “Overview: Bioenergetics between chemistry, genetics and physics.” (Kováč, 1987). Over the following decades, Kováč elaborated, updated, and expanded these themes in frequent publications, including  "Fundamental principles of cognitive biology" (Kováč, 2000), “Life, chemistry, and cognition” (Kováč, 2006a), "Information and Knowledge in Biology: Time for Reappraisal” (Kováč, 2007) and "Bioenergetics: A key to brain and mind" (Kováč, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Although many of his publications are difficult to find, this URL has them all: &lt;http://www.biocenter.sk/lkpublics.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic usage ==

=== University seminar ===
The concept of cognitive biology is exemplified by this seminar description:&lt;ref&gt;The seminar, titled "Cognitive Biology," was presented by Professor William Bechtel in the autumn of 2013 by the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. The [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/ seminar description] was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session featured the presentation of a paper titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]" The paper’s author and host of the seminar sessions was [[William Bechtel]], a philosopher of science who has written extensively on the philosophy and history of cognitive science. See for example Bechtel, W., Abrahamsen, A. and Graham, G. (1998), ‘The life of cognitive science’, in ed. W. Bechtel and G. Graham, A Companion to Cognitive Science (Malden, MA and Oxford: Blackwell Publishers Ltd.), pp. 1–104. A more recent example: Abrahamsen, A. and Bechtel, W. (2012). History and core themes. In K. Frankish and W. Ramsey, The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{Cquote|Cognitive science has focused primarily on human cognitive activities. These include perceiving, remembering and learning, evaluating and deciding, planning actions, etc. But humans are not the only organisms that engage in these activities. Indeed, virtually all organisms need to be able to procure information both about their own condition and their environment and regulate their activities in ways appropriate to this information. In some cases species have developed distinctive ways of performing cognitive tasks. But in many cases these mechanisms have been conserved and modified in other species. This course will focus on a variety of organisms not usually considered in cognitive science such as bacteria, planaria, leeches, fruit flies, bees, birds and various rodents, asking about the sorts of cognitive activities these organisms perform, the mechanisms they employ to perform them, and what lessons about cognition more generally we might acquire from studying them.&lt;ref&gt;In the preceding paragraph, neither mention nor definition of cognitive biology is made. Rather, context is established through the initial three sentences and an excellent description of cognitive biology is presented thereafter. The original seminar description was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session features a talk by Professor Bechtel titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== University workgroup ===
The [[University of Adelaide]] has established a "Cognitive Biology" workgroup using this operating concept:
{{Cquote|Cognition is, first and foremost, a natural biological [[phenomenon]] — regardless of how the engineering of artificial intelligence proceeds. As such, it makes sense to approach cognition like other biological phenomena. This means first assuming a meaningful degree of continuity among different types of organisms—an assumption borne out more and more by [[comparative biology]], especially [[genomics]]—studying simple model systems (e.g., [[microbes]], worms, flies) to understand the basics, then scaling up to more complex examples, such as mammals and [[primates]], including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Members of the group study the biological literature on simple organisms (e.g., [[nematode]]) in regard to cognitive process and look for [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in more complex organisms (e.g., crow) already well studied. This comparative approach is expected to yield simple cognitive concepts common to all organisms. “It is hoped a theoretically well-grounded toolkit of basic cognitive concepts will facilitate the use and discussion of research carried out in different fields to increase understanding of two foundational issues: '''what cognition is''' and '''what cognition does''' in the biological context.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt; (Bold letters from original text.)
 
The group’s choice of name, as they explain on a separate webpage, might have been ‘[[embodied cognition]]’&lt;ref&gt;This option perpetuates a bias established by the original interdisciplinary grouping that formed the [[cognitive sciences]] in the 1970s: [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]]. Clarification of cognition was slow in coming, even as computers and robots became more efficient. Some argued that a cognitive agent had to be embodied to interface with the world, thus excluding stationary computers. So a new member was added to the cognitive sciences, i.e., the science of [[embodied cognition]]. Both robot frogs and biological frogs were valid subjects for experiment.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘biological cognitive science.’&lt;ref&gt;Such a name implies that this is just another cognitive science, one among equals.&lt;/ref&gt; But the group chose ‘cognitive biology’ for the sake of (i) emphasis and (ii) method. For the sake of emphasis, (i) “We want to keep the focus on biology because for too long cognition was considered a function that could be almost entirely divorced from its physical instantiation, to the extent that whatever could be said of cognition almost by definition had to be applicable to both organisms and machines.” (ii) The method is to “assume (if only for the sake of enquiry) that cognition is a biological function similar to other biological functions—such as respiration, nutrient circulation, waste elimination, and so on.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013b). “Why Cognitive Biology?” http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/why/.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The method supposes that the genesis of cognition is biological, i.e., the method is ''[[biogenic substance|biogenic]]''. The host of the group’s website has said elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;See also Lyon and Opie (2007) “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; that cognitive biology requires a biogenic approach, having identified ten principles of biogenesis in an earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;More detail can be found in Lyon (2006), “The biogenic approach to cognition.”.&lt;/ref&gt; The first four biogenic principles are quoted here to illustrate the depth at which the foundations have been set at the [[Adelaide]] school of cognitive biology:

#“Complex cognitive capacities have evolved from simpler forms of cognition. There is a continuous line of meaningful descent.”
#“Cognition directly or indirectly modulates the physico-chemical-electrical processes that constitute an organism .”
#“Cognition enables the establishment of reciprocal causal relations with an environment, leading to exchanges of matter and energy that are essential to the organism’s continued persistence, well-being or replication.”
#“Cognition relates to the (more or less) continuous assessment of system needs relative to prevailing circumstances, the potential for interaction, and whether the current interaction is working or not.”&lt;ref&gt;See Lyon (2006), pps 15-20 for the principles quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group offers courses titled “Neurobiology of Consciousness” and “Cognitive Neurobiology.”&lt;ref&gt;Courses from the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) [[Magdeburg]], Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Its website lists the papers generated from its lab work, focusing on the neural correlates of perceptual consequences and visual attention. The group’s current work is aimed at detailing a dynamic known as ‘[[multistable perception]].’ The [[phenomenon]], described in a sentence: “Certain visual displays are not perceived in a stable way but, from time to time and seemingly spontaneously, their appearance wavers and settles in a distinctly different form.”&lt;ref&gt;Research at the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) Magdeburg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A final example of university commitment to cognitive biology can be found at [[Comenius University]] in Bratislava, Slovakia. There in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Bratislava Biocenter is presented as a consortium of research teams working in biomedical sciences. Their website lists the Center for Cognitive Biology in the Department of Biochemistry at the top of the page, followed by five lab groups, each at a separate  department of bioscience. The webpage for the Center for Cognitive Biology &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biocenter.sk/welcome1a.html&lt;/ref&gt; offers a link to "Foundations of Cognitive Biology," a page that simply contains a quotation from a paper authored by Ladislav Kováč, the site’s founder. His perspective is briefly discussed below.

== Cognitive biology as a category ==

The words ‘cognitive’ and ‘biology’ are also used together as the name of a category. The category of ''cognitive biology'' has no fixed content but, rather, the content varies with the user. If the content can only be recruited from ''[[cognitive science]]'', then cognitive biology would seem limited to a selection of items in the main set of sciences included by the interdisciplinary concept—[[cognitive psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; These six separate sciences were allied “to bridge the gap between brain and mind” with an [[interdisciplinary]] approach in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating scientists were concerned only with human cognition. As it gained momentum, the growth of cognitive science in subsequent decades seemed to offer a big tent to a variety of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See first page of Von Eckardt, Barbara. What is cognitive science?. MIT press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, for example, considered evolutionary epistemology a fellow-traveler. Others appropriated the keyword, as for example Donald Griffin in 1978, when he advocated the establishment of [[cognitive ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Donald R. "Prospects for a cognitive ethology." Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1.04 (1978): 527-538.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, breakthroughs in [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cell biology|cell]], [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary]], and [[developmental biology]] generated a [[cornucopia]] of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were [[problematic]]. For example, the decision to append ''cognitive'' to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the [[Computational biology|computational]] and [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. (1996). Cognition = life: Implications for higher-level cognition. Behavioural Processes 35: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt; approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of [[simulated]] v. [[embodied cognition|embodied]]&lt;ref&gt;Ziemke, Tom (2003). What's that thing called embodiment. In Proceedings of the 25th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 1305-1310). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.
 
One solution is to consider ''cognitive biology'' only as a subset of ''cognitive science''. For example, a major publisher’s website&lt;ref&gt;[55] ''WIRES'' (Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews) (2013). Wiley Online Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/&lt;/ref&gt; displays links to material in a dozen domains of major scientific endeavor. One of which is described thus: “Cognitive science is the study of how the mind works, addressing cognitive functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, reasoning and problem solving, decision-making and consciousness.” Upon its selection from the display, the ''Cognitive Science'' page offers in nearly alphabetical order these topics: ''Cognitive Biology'', Computer Science, Economics, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience. Linked through that list of topics, upon its selection the ''Cognitive Biology'' page offers a selection of reviews and articles with biological content ranging from [[cognitive ethology]]&lt;ref&gt;For consideration of cogbio v cogetho, see p23 in Kamil (1998), “On the Proper Definition of Cognitive Ethology”.&lt;/ref&gt; through [[evolutionary epistemology]]; cognition and art; [[evo-devo]] and cognitive science; [[animal learning]]; genes and cognition; cognition and animal welfare; etc.

A different application of the ''cognitive biology'' category is manifest in the 2009 publication of papers presented at a three-day interdisciplinary workshop on “The New Cognitive Sciences” held at the [[Konrad Lorenz Institute]] for Evolution and Cognition Research in 2006. The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from “Animals as Natural Geometers” and “Color Generalization by Birds” through “Evolutionary Biology of Limited Attention” and “A comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking” as well as “Neuroethology of Attention in Primates” and ten more with less colorful titles. “[O]n the last day of the workshop the participants agreed [that] the title ‘Cognitive Biology’ sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of the cognitive and the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.”&lt;ref&gt;Tommasi, et al., page x in Preface. See pps 3-11 for a discussion of cognitive science and biology.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al. (2009), ''Cognitive Biology: Evolutionary and Developmental Perspectives on Mind, Brain and Behavior.''
 
A final example of categorical use comes from an author’s introduction to his 2011 publication on the subject, ''Cognitive Biology: Dealing with Information from Bacteria to Minds''. After discussing the differences between the cognitive and biological sciences, as well as the value of one to the other, the author concludes: “Thus, the object of this book should be considered as an attempt at building a new discipline, that of ''cognitive biology'', which endeavors to bridge these two domains.”&lt;ref&gt;Author’s italics, p2 in Auletta (2011), Cognitive biology: dealing with information from bacteria to minds.&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a detailed methodology illustrated by examples in biology anchored by concepts from [[cybernetics]] (e.g., self-regulatory systems) and [[quantum information theory]] (regarding probabilistic changes of state) with an invitation "to consider system theory together with information theory as the formal tools that may ground biology and cognition as traditional mathematics grounds physics.”&lt;ref&gt;Auletta (2011), p61. See also, for examples, pps 335 &amp; 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Image histogram}}

In [[image processing]] and [[photography]], a '''color histogram''' is a representation of the distribution of colors in an [[image]].  For digital images, a color histogram represents the number of [[pixel]]s that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges, that span the image's [[color space]], the set of all possible colors.

The color histogram can be built for any kind of color space, although the term is more often used for three-dimensional spaces like [[RGB color space|RGB]] or [[HSV color space|HSV]].  For [[monochromatic image]]s, the term '''intensity histogram''' may be used instead.  For multi-spectral images, where each pixel is represented by an arbitrary number of measurements (for example, beyond the three measurements in RGB), the color histogram is ''N''-dimensional, with N being the number of measurements taken. Each measurement has its own wavelength range of the light spectrum, some of which may be outside the visible spectrum.

If the set of possible color values is sufficiently small, each of those colors may be placed on a range by itself; then the histogram is merely the count of pixels that have each possible color.  Most often, the space is divided into an appropriate number of ranges, often arranged as a regular grid, each containing many similar color values.  The color histogram may also be represented and displayed as a smooth [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined over the color space that approximates the pixel counts.

Like other kinds of [[histogram]]s, the color histogram is a [[statistic]] that can be viewed as an approximation of an underlying continuous [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of colors values.

==Overview==

Color histograms are flexible constructs that can be built from images in various [[color space]]s, whether [[RGB color space|RGB]], [[rg chromaticity]] or any other color space of any dimension.  A histogram of an image is produced first by discretization of the colors in the image into a number of bins, and counting the number of image pixels in each bin.  For example, a Red–Blue chromaticity histogram can be formed by first normalizing color pixel values by dividing RGB values by R+G+B, then quantizing the normalized R and B coordinates into N bins each. A two-dimensional histogram of Red-Blue chromaticity divided into four bins (''N''=4) might yield a histogram that looks like this table:

A histogram can be N-dimensional. Although harder to display, a three-dimensional color histogram for the above example could be thought of as four separate Red-Blue histograms, where each of the four histograms contains the Red-Blue values for a bin of green (0-63, 64-127, 128-191, and 192-255).

The histogram provides a compact summarization of the distribution of data in an image. The color histogram of an image is relatively invariant with translation and rotation about the viewing axis, and varies only slowly with the angle of view.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Shapiro|Shapiro, Linda G.]] and Stockman, George C. "Computer Vision" Prentice Hall, 2003 {{ISBN|0-13-030796-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;    By comparing histograms signatures of two images and matching the color content of one image with the other, the color histogram is particularly well suited for the problem of recognizing an object of unknown position and rotation within a scene. Importantly, translation of an RGB image into the illumination invariant rg-chromaticity space allows the histogram to operate well in varying light levels.

1.What is a histogram?

A histogram is a graphical representation of the number of pixels in an image. In a more simple way to explain, a histogram is a bar graph, whose X-axis represents the tonal scale(black at the left and white at the right), and Y-axis represents the number of pixels in an image in a certain area of the tonal scale. For example, the graph of a luminance histogram shows the number of pixels for each brightness level(from black to white), and when there are more pixels, the peak at the certain luminance level is higher.

2.What is a color histogram?

A color histogram of an image represents the distribution of the composition of colors in the image. It shows different types of colors appeared and the number of pixels in each type of the colors appeared. The relation between a color histogram and a luminance histogram is that a color histogram can be also expressed as “Three Luminance Histograms”, each of which shows the brightness distribution of each individual Red/Green/Blue color channel.

==Characteristics of a color histogram==

A color histogram focuses only on the proportion of the number of different types of colors, regardless of the spatial location of the colors. The values of a color histogram are from statistics. They show the statistical distribution of colors and the essential tone of an image.

In general, as the color distributions of the foreground and background in an image are different, there might be a bimodal distribution in the histogram.

For the luminance histogram alone, there is no perfect histogram and in general, the histogram can tell whether it is over exposure or not, but there are times when you might think the image is over exposed by viewing the histogram; however, in reality it is not.

==Principles of the formation of a color histogram==

The formation of a color histogram is rather simple. From the definition above, we can simply count the number of pixels for each 256 scales in each of the 3 RGB channel, and plot them on 3 individual bar graphs.

In general, a color histogram is based on a certain color space, such as RGB or HSV. When we compute the pixels of different colors in an image, if the color space is large, then we can first divide the color space into certain numbers of small intervals. Each of the intervals is called a bin. This process is called color quantization. Then, by counting the number of pixels in each of the bins, we get the color histogram of the image.

The concrete steps of the principles can be viewed in Example 2.

==Examples==

===Example 1===

Given the following image of a cat (an original version and a version that has been reduced to 256 colors for easy histogram purposes), the following data represents a color histogram in the RGB color space, using four bins. Bin 0 corresponds to intensities 0-63, bin 1 is 64-127, bin 2 is 128-191, and bin 3 is 192-255.

[[File:Symcamera2.jpg|framed|right]]

[[File:Symcamera3.jpg|framed|right]]

Application in camera:

Nowadays, some cameras have the ability of showing the 3 color histograms when we take photos. 

We can examine clips(spikes on either the black or white side of the scale) in each of the 3 RGB color histograms. If we find one or more clipping on a channel of the 3 RGB channels, then this would result in a loss of detail for that color.

To illustrate this, consider this example:

1.	We know that each of the three R, G, B channels has a range of values from 0-255(8 bit). So consider a photo that has a luminance range of 0-255.

2.	Assume the photo we take is made of 4 blocks that are adjacent to each other and we set the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of original photo to be 10, 100, 205, 245. Thus, the image looks like the first figure on the right. 

3.	Then, we over expose the photo a little, say, the luminance scale of each block is increased by 10. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of new photo is 20, 110, 215, 255. Then, the image looks like the second figure on the right.

There is not much difference between figure 8 and figure 9, all we can see is that the whole image becomes brighter(the contrast for each of the blocks remain the same).

4.	Now, we over expose the original photo again, this time the luminance scale of each block is increased by 50. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of new photo is 60, 150, 255, 255. The new image now looks like the third figure on the right.

Note that the scale for last block is 255 instead of 295, for 255 is the top scale and thus the last block has clipped! When this happens, we lose the contrast of the last 2 blocks, and thus, we cannot recover the image no matter how we adjust it.

To conclude, when taking photos with a camera that displays histograms, always keep the brightest tone in the image below the largest scale 255 on the histogram in order to avoid losing details.

==Drawbacks and other approaches==

The main drawback of histograms for classification is that the representation is dependent of the color of the object being studied, ignoring its shape and texture. Color histograms can potentially be identical for two images with different object content which happens to share color information. Conversely, without spatial or shape information, similar objects of different color may be indistinguishable based solely on color histogram comparisons. There is no way to distinguish a red and white cup from a red and white plate.  Put another way, histogram-based algorithms have no concept of a generic 'cup', and a model of a red and white cup is no use when given an otherwise identical blue and white cup. Another problem is that color histograms have high sensitivity to noisy interference such as lighting intensity changes and quantization errors. High dimensionality (bins) color histograms are also another issue. Some color histogram feature spaces often occupy more than one hundred dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Xiang-Yang Wang, Jun-Feng Wu1 and Hong-Ying Yang "Robust image retrieval based on color histogram of local feature regions" Springer Netherlands, 2009 ISSN 1573-7721&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the proposed solutions have been color histogram intersection, color constant indexing, cumulative color histogram, quadratic distance, and color [[correlogram]]s. Although there are drawbacks of using histograms for indexing and classification, using color in a real-time system has several advantages. One is that color information is faster to compute compared to other invariants. It has been shown in some cases that color can be an efficient method for identifying objects of known location and appearance.

Further research into the relationship between color histogram data to the physical properties of the objects in an image has shown they can represent not only object color and illumination but relate to surface roughness and image geometry and provide an improved estimate of illumination and object color.&lt;ref&gt;Anatomy of a color histogram;  Novak, C.L.; Shafer, S.A.; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1992. Proceedings CVPR '92., 1992 IEEE Computer Society Conference on 15–18 June 1992 Page(s):599 - 605 {{doi|10.1109/CVPR.1992.223129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, Euclidean distance, histogram intersection, or cosine or quadratic distances are used for the calculation of image similarity ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Integrated Spatial and Feature Image Systems: Retrieval, Analysis and Compression; Smith, J.R.; Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Columbia University, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these values do not reflect the similarity rate of two images in itself; it is useful only when used in comparison to other similar values. This is the reason that all the practical implementations of content-based image retrieval must complete computation of all images from the database, and is the main disadvantage of these implementations.

Another approach to representative color image content is two-dimensional color histogram. A two-dimensional color histogram considers the relation between the pixel pair colors (not only the lighting component).&lt;ref&gt;Effectiveness estimation of image retrieval by 2D color histogram; Bashkov, E.A.; Kostyukova, N.S.; Journal of Automation and Information Sciences, 2006 (6) Page(s): 84-89&lt;/ref&gt; A two-dimensional color histogram is a two-dimensional array. The size of each dimension is the number of colors that were used in the phase of color quantization. These arrays are treated as matrices, each element of which stores a normalized count of pixel pairs, with each color corresponding to the index of an element in each pixel neighborhood. For comparison of two-dimensional color histograms it is suggested calculating their correlation, because constructed as described above, is a random vector (in other words, a multi-dimensional random value). While creating a set of final images, the images should be arranged in decreasing order of the correlation coefficient.

The correlation coefficient may also be used for color histogram comparison. Retrieval results with correlation coefficient are better than with other metrics.&lt;ref&gt;Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Color Histogram Correlation; Bashkov, E.A.; Shozda, N.S.; Graphicon proceedings, 2002 Page(s):  [http://www.graphicon.ru/2002/pdf/Bashkov_Zhozda_Re.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intensity histogram of continuous data==

The idea of an intensity histogram can be generalized to continuous data,
say audio signals represented by real functions or images represented by functions with two-dimensional [[Function domain|domain]].

Let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]]), then the cumulative histogram operator &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;H(f)(y) = \mu\{x : f(x)\le y\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lebesgue measure]] of sets.
&lt;math&gt;H(f)&lt;/math&gt; in turn is a [[real function]].
The (non-cumulative) histogram is defined as its [[derivative]].
:&lt;math&gt;h(f) = H(f)'&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''committee''' (or "commission") is a body of one or more persons that is subordinate to a [[deliberative assembly]]. Usually, the assembly sends matters into a committee as a way to explore them more fully than would be possible if the assembly itself were considering them. Committees may have different functions and their type of work differ depending on the type of the organization and its needs.

==Purpose==
A [[deliberative assembly]] may form a committee (or "commission") consisting of one or more persons to assist with the work of the assembly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 489|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For larger organizations, much work is done in committees.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committees can be a way to formally draw together people of relevant expertise from different parts of an organization who otherwise would not have a good way to share information and coordinate actions. They may have the advantage of widening viewpoints and sharing out responsibilities. They can also be appointed with experts to recommend actions in matters that require specialized knowledge or technical judgment.

=== Functions ===
Committees can serve several different functions:
;Governance:  In organizations considered too large for all the members to participate in decisions affecting the organization as a whole, a smaller body, such as a [[board of directors]], is given the power to make decisions, spend money, or take actions. A ''governance committee'' is formed as a separate committee to review the performance of the board and board policy as well as nominate candidates for the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.guidestar.org/Articles.aspx?path=/rxa/news/articles/2012/need-to-improve-a-governance-committee.aspx|title = So You Need (to Improve) a Governance Committee?|date = April 2012|accessdate = 2015-12-17|website = guidestar.org|publisher = [[GuideStar]]|last = Walker|first = Dick|last2 = Bauser|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; {{Anchor|Coordination committee|Coordination subcommittee}} Coordination and administration: A large body may have smaller committees with more specialized functions. Examples are an audit committee, an elections committee, a finance committee, a fundraising committee, and a program committee. Large [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] or [[academic conference]]s are usually organized by a coordinating committee drawn from the membership of the organization.
; {{Anchor|Research committee|Research subcommittee}} Research and recommendations: Committees may be formed to do research and make recommendations on a potential or planned project or change.  For example, an organization considering a major [[capital investment]] might create a temporary working committee of several people to review options and make recommendations to upper management or the board of directors.
;Discipline:{{Anchor|Disciplinary committee|Research subcommittee}}A committee on discipline may be used to handle disciplinary procedures on members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;As a tactic for indecision: As a means of [[public relations]] by sending sensitive, inconvenient, or irrelevant matters to committees, organizations may bypass, stall, or disacknowledge matters without declaring a formal policy of inaction or indifference. However, this could be considered a [[Dilatory motions and tactics|dilatory tactic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power and authority ===
Generally, committees are required to report to their parent body. Committees do not usually have the power to act independently unless the body that created it gives it such power.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Procedures==
When a committee is formed, a [[chairman]] (or "chair" or "chairperson") is designated for the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a vice-chairman (or similar name) is also appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for the committee chairman to organize its meetings. Sometimes these meetings are held through [[videoconferencing]] or other means if committee members are not able to attend in person, as may be the case if they are in different parts of the country or the world.

The chairman is responsible for running meetings. Duties include keeping the discussion on the appropriate subject, recognizing members to speak, and confirming what the committee has decided (through voting or by [[unanimous consent]]). Using ''[[Roberts Rules of Order|Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'' (RONR), committees may follow informal procedures (such as not requiring [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] if it's clear what is being discussed).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 162|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|ref = harv|display-authors = etal|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170811000000/http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|archivedate = 2017-08-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of formality depends on the size and type of committee, in which sometimes larger committees considering crucial issues may require more formal processes.

[[Minutes]] are a record of the decisions at meetings. They can be taken by a person designated as the [[secretary]]. For most organizations, committees are not required to keep formal minutes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, some bodies require that committees take minutes, especially if the committees are public ones subject to [[Freedom of information laws by country|open meeting laws]].

Committees may meet on a regular basis, such as weekly or more often, or meetings may be called irregularly as the need arises. The frequency of the meetings depend on the work of the committee and the needs of the parent body.

When the committee completes its work, it provides the results in a report to its parent body. The report may include the methods used, the facts uncovered, the conclusions reached, and any recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the committee is not ready to report, it may provide a partial report or the assembly may discharge the committee of the matter so that the assembly can handle it. Also, if members of the committee are not performing their duties, they may be removed or replaced by the appointing power.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the committee continues to exist after presenting its report depends on the type of committee. Generally, committees established by the [[bylaws]] or the organization's rules continue to exist, while committees formed for a particular purpose go out of existence after the final report.

=== Commit (motion) ===
{{infobox motion
| name = Commit (RONR)
| class = S
| inorder = No
| seconded = Yes
| debatable = Yes, although debate on the motion must be confined to its merits only, and cannot go into the main question except as necessary for debate of the immediately pending question.
| amendable = Yes
| voterequired = Majority
| reconsidered = Yes, if committee has not begun consideration of the question. A negative vote on this motion can be reconsidered only until such time as progress in business or debate has made it essentially a new question.
}}
In [[parliamentary procedure]], the motion to '''commit''' (or '''refer''') is used to refer another motion—usually a main motion—to a committee.

A motion to commit should specify to which committee the matter is to be referred, and if the committee is a special committee appointed specifically for purposes of the referred motion, it should also specify the number of committee members and the method of their selection, unless that is specified in the bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any proposed amendments to the main motion that are pending at the time the motion is referred to a committee go to the committee as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Once referred, but before the committee reports its recommendations back to the assembly, the referred motion may be removed from the committee's consideration by the motion to discharge a committee.

=== Recommit ===
In the [[United States House of Representatives]], a motion to recommit can be made with or without instructions.  If the motion is made without instructions, the bill or resolution is simply sent back to the committee. If the motion is made with instructions and the motion is agreed to, the chairman of the committee in question will immediately report the bill or resolution back to the whole House with the new language.  In this sense, a motion to recommit with instructions is effectively an amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Megan S.|title=The Motion to Recommit in the House of Representatives|date=January 6, 2016|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44330.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variations for full assembly consideration ===
In ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR), the motion to commit has three variations which do not turn a question over to a smaller group, but simply permit the assembly's full meeting body to consider it with the greater freedom of debate that is allowed to committees. These forms are to go into a [[committee of the whole]], to go into a quasi committee of the whole, and to consider informally. Passing any of these motions removes the limitations on the number of times a member can speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]'' has informal consideration, but does not have "committee of the whole" and "quasi committee of the whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title=TSC |pages=232, 233, 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discharge a committee ===
{{infobox motion
 | name = Discharge a committee (RONR)
 | class = B
 | inorder = No
 | seconded = Yes
 | debatable = Yes; debate can go into question in hands of the committee
 | amendable = Yes
 | reconsidered = Negative vote only
 }}In ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'', the motion to '''discharge a committee''' is used to take a matter out of a committee's hands before the committee has made a final report on it. A committee can use this motion to discharge a subcommittee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote required is a [[majority vote]] if the committee has failed to report at the prescribed time or if the assembly is considering a partial report of the committee.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, it requires a majority vote with [[previous notice]]; or a [[two-thirds vote]]; or a [[majority of the entire membership]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Under ''The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure'', the assembly that has referred a motion or a matter to a committee may, by a majority vote, withdraw it at any time from the committee, refer it to another committee, or decide the question itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title=TSC |pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
=== Executive committee ===
Organizations with a large board of directors (such as international [[labor union]]s, large corporations with thousands of stock holders or national and international organizations) may have a smaller body of the board, called an ''executive committee'', handle its business. The executive committee may function more like a board than an actual committee.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, an executive committee can only be established through a specific provision in the charter or [[bylaws]] of the entity (i.e. a board cannot appoint an executive committee without authorization to do so).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Members of the executive committee may be elected by the overall [[Suffrage|franchised]] membership or by the board, depending on the rules of the organization. However formed, an executive committee only has such powers and authority that the governing documents of the organization give it. In some cases, it may be empowered to act on behalf of the board or organization, while in others, it may only be able to make recommendations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Conference committee===
Governments at the national level may have a ''conference committee''. A conference committee in a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] is responsible for creating a compromise version of a particular [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] when each house has passed a different version.

[[United States congressional conference committee|A conference committee in the United States Congress]] is a temporary panel of negotiators from the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Unless one chamber decides to accept the other's original bill, the compromise version must pass both chambers after leaving the conference committee. The committee is usually composed of the senior members of the standing committees that originally considered the legislation in each chamber.

Other countries that use conference committees include France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bicameralism|last = Tsebelis|first = George|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1997|isbn = 9780521589727|location = Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages = 178–179|last2 = Money|first2 = Jeannette|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eL_eT6JMTzIC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, conference committees have been unused since 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=1297&amp;param=190|title = Reviving Conference Committees|date = Autumn 2008|accessdate = 2015-12-21|website = revparl.ca|publisher = [[Canadian Parliamentary Review]]|last = Hays|first = Hon. Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Different use of term ====
In organizations, the term "conference committee" may have a different meaning. This meaning may be associated with the conferences, or [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], that the organization puts together. The committees that are responsible for organizing such events may be called "conference committees".

===Standing committee===
A ''standing committee'' is a subunit of a political or deliberative body established in a permanent fashion to aid the parent assembly in accomplishing its duties.  A standing committee is granted its scope and powers over a particular area of business by the governing documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing committees meet on a regular or irregular basis depending on their function, and retain any power or oversight originally given them until subsequent official actions of the governing body (through changes to law or by-laws) disbands the committee.

==== Legislatures ====&lt;!-- merged in from very short [[standing committee]] stub --&gt;
Most governmental legislative committees are standing committees. The phrase is used in the [[legislature]]s of the following countries:
* [[Australia]]
** [[Australian House of Representatives committees]]
** [[Australian Senate committees]]
* [[Canada]]
** [[List of committees of the Canadian House of Commons]]
** [[Standing committee (Canada)]]
* [[China]]
** [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]
* [[Iceland]]
** [[List of standing committees of the Icelandic parliament]]
* [[India]]
** [[Standing committee (India)]]
* [[Malaysia]]
** [[Dewan Rakyat committees]]
** [[Dewan Negara committees]]
* [[United Kingdom]]
** [[Public bill committee]]
* [[United States]]
** [[Standing committee (United States Congress)]]
Under the laws of the United States of America, a standing committee is a [[Congressional committee]] permanently authorized by [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate]] rules. The [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946]] greatly reduced the number of committees, and set up the legislative committee structure still in use today, as modified by authorized changes via the orderly mechanism of rules changes.

==== Examples in organizations ====
Examples of standing committees in organizations are an audit committee, an elections committee, a finance committee, a fundraising committee, a governance committee, and a program committee. Typically, the standing committees perform their work throughout the year and present their reports at an [[Annual general meeting|annual meeting]] of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 502}}&lt;/ref&gt; These committees continue to exist after presenting their reports, although the membership in the committees may change.

=== Nominating committee ===
A ''nominating committee'' (or [[nomination]]s committee) is a group formed for the purpose of nominating candidates for office or the board in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 433}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may consist of members from inside the organization. Sometimes a governance committee takes the role of a nominating committee. Depending on the organization, this committee may be empowered to actively seek out candidates or may only have the power to receive nominations from members and verify that the candidates are eligible.

A nominating committee works similarly to an [[electoral college]], the main difference being that the available candidates, either nominated or "written in" outside of the committee's choices, are then voted into office by the membership. It is a part of governance methods often employed by corporate bodies, business entities, and social and sporting groups, especially clubs. The intention is that they be made up of qualified and knowledgeable people representing the best interests of the membership. In the case of business entities, their directors will often be brought in from outside, and receive a benefit for their expertise.

In the context of nominations for awards, a nominating committee can also be formed for the purpose of nominating persons or things held up for judgment by others as to their comparative quality or value, especially for the purpose of bestowing awards in the arts, or in application to industry's products and services. The objective being to update, set, and maintain high and possibly new standards.

=== Steering committee ===
A ''steering committee'' is a committee that provides guidance, direction and control to a project within an organization.&lt;ref name="Mcleod2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mcleod|title=Management Information Systems | edition = 10 | year = 2008|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-81-317-1949-7|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from the [[steering]] mechanism that changes the steering angle of a vehicle's wheels.

Project steering committees are frequently used for guiding and monitoring [[information technology|IT]] projects in large organizations, as part of [[project governance]]. The functions of the committee might include building a business case for the project, planning, providing assistance and guidance, monitoring the progress, controlling the project scope and resolving conflicts.

As with other committees, the specific duties and role of the steering committee vary among organizations.

=== Special committee ===
{{See also|Select committee}}{{Anchor|Special committee|Ad hoc committee|Select committee|Working committee}}A ''special committee'' (or working, select, or [[ad hoc]] committee) is established to accomplish a particular task or to oversee a specific area in need of control or oversight.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are research or coordination committees in type or purpose, and are temporary. Some are a sub-group of a larger society with a particular area of interest which are organized to meet and discuss matters pertaining to their interests. For example, a group of astronomers might be organized to discuss how to get the larger society to address [[near earth object]]s. A subgroup of engineers and scientists of a large project's development team could be organized to solve some particular issue with offsetting considerations and trade-offs. Once the committee makes its final report to its parent body, the special committee ceases to exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Subcommittee===
A committee that is a [[subset]] of a larger committee is called a ''subcommittee''. Committees that have a large workload may form subcommittees to further divide the work. Subcommittees report to the parent committee and not to the general assembly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee of the whole===
{{main|Committee of the whole}}
When the entire assembly meets as a committee to discuss or debate, this is called a "[[committee of the whole]]". This is not an actual committee but a procedural device that is more commonly used in legislative bodies.

=== Central Committee ===
{{Main|Central Committee}}

'''[[Central Committee]]''' was the common designation of a standing administrative body of [[Communist party|communist parties]], analogous to a [[board of directors]], whether ruling or non-ruling in the [[20th century]] and of surviving communist states in the [[21st century]]. In such party organizations the committee would typically be made up of delegates elected at a [[party congress]]. In those [[communist state|states]] where it constituted the state power, the Central Committee made decisions for the party between congresses, and usually was (at least nominally) responsible for electing the [[Politburo]]. In non-ruling Communist parties, the Central Committee is usually understood by the party membership to be the ultimate decision-making [[authority]] between Congresses once the process of [[democratic centralism]] has led to an agreed-upon position

In [[genetics]], two [[organism]]s that differ in only one [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] and a linked segment of chromosome are defined as '''congenic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Congenic | title = Congenic - definition from Biology-Online.org | work = Biology-Online.org dictionary | publisher = Biology-Online.org |  access-date = 25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, organisms that are [[Coisogenic strain|coisogenic]] differ in one locus only and not in the surrounding chromosome. Unlike congenic organisms, coisogenic organisms cannot be bred and only occur through spontaneous or targeted mutation at the locus.

==Generating congenic strains==
Congenic strains are generated in the laboratory by mating two inbred strains (usually rats or mice), and back-crossing the descendants 5–10 generations with one of the original strains, known as the ''recipient'' strain. Typically selection for either phenotype or genotype is performed prior to each back-cross generation. In this manner either an interesting phenotype, or a defined chromosomal region assayed by genotype, is passed from the ''donor'' strain onto an otherwise uniform ''recipient'' background.  Congenic mice or rats can then be compared to the pure recipient strain to determine whether they are phenotypically different if selection was for a genotypic region, or to identify the critical genetic locus, if selection was for a phenotype.

Speed congenics can be produced in as little as five back-cross generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Markel P |title=Theoretical and empirical issues for marker-assisted breeding of congenic mouse strains |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=280–284 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9354790 |doi=10.1038/ng1197-280 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Shu P |author3=Ebeling C |display-authors=3 |last4=Carlson |first4=George A. |last5=Nagle |first5=Deborah L. |last6=Smutko |first6=John S. |last7=Moore |first7=Karen J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the selection at each generation of offspring that not only retain the desired chromosomal fragment, but also 'lose' the maximum amount of background genetic information from the donor strain. This is also known as ''marker-assisted'' congenics, due to the use of genetic markers, typically [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] markers, but now, more commonly, [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] markers (SNPs). The process can be further aided by the [[superovulation]] of females, to produce many more eggs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40054">Preserving [[parchment]] becomes more difficult when [[pigments]], [[inks]], and illumination are added into the equation.  Pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638573|title=Printing on Parchment or Vellum|year=1992|last1=Jenkins|first1=Penny|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of restoring [[illuminated manuscript]]s should be to make them resilient to damage while altering them as little as possible.  Each individual manuscript, and even each individual page, must be considered as a separate object with different aspects that must be taken into consideration.  This in turn will help determine the best course of [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] or [[art conservation|conservation]] treatment.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Guiffrida, Barbara|title=The Repair of Parchment and Vellum in Manuscript Form|journal=The New Bookbinder|volume= 3|year= 1983|pages=21–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best ways to become familiar with the variety of issues caused by various materials is to learn about how such manuscripts were made in the past and how they were subsequently treated in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nancy. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn16/wn16-1/wn16-108.html “The Conservation of Medieval Manuscript Illuminations and the Question of Compensation.”] ‘’WAAC Newsletter’’16(1), January 1994: 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inks and pigments==

The best distinction between inks and pigments is that ink is a colored liquid while pigments are colored particles suspended in a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Kunjappu, Joy (March 2003). [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/March/inkchemistry.asp ”Ink Chemistry.”]. Chemistry World. rsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas colored by pigments usually have multiple layers of pigments and other mediums.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The most important aspect of preserving pigments and inks is to identify their composition.  Some techniques are not suitable for certain pigments and will do further harm.&lt;ref name="utexas1"&gt;[http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/pdfs/a-baker-04-pigments.pdf Common Medieval Pigments.]. (PDF). Retrieved on 2012-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some examples of issues with pigments===

*[[Iron gall ink]] – very popular black ink; corrosive; can become brittle and fade.&lt;ref&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/ 15, 1996.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lead white – darkens when exposed to air; reacts with verdigris and orpiment; generally stable to light.
*[[Orpiment]] – loses color quickly with exposure to [[ozone]]; decays slowly in water; dissolves in [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]; reacts with lead- and copper-based pigments (such as lead white and verdigris); can corrode bindings; will not easily adhere to parchment and tend to flake off; cannot readily be consolidated with gelatin.
*[[Ultramarine]] – very stable to light but very unstable with [[acids]]; becomes [[friable]] and will crumble if outer skin is scraped, although this is hard to see at first without the aid of a microscope and can be made worse with the application of [[gelatin]] or other liquid consolidators.
*[[Verdigris]] – reacts with lead white and orpiment; decays parchment; tends to become friable and is not easily treated with gelatin or other liquid consolidators; [[chelate|chelating]] agents such as [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] appear to prevent further degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638574|title=Some Aspects of Degradation Phenomena of Paper Caused by Green Copper-Containing Pigments|url=http://web.me.com/elandbas/papier_sem-4/groenvraat_files/IPC%2082%2007%2001.pdf|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume= 7|pages=3–7|year=1982 |author1=Banik, Gerhard |author2=Ponahlo, Johann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===

Identifying specific pigments is no easy task.  Descriptions may be wrong or misleading and choosing the wrong treatment may cause irreversible damage.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Brown, Michelle P. “Pigments and their Uses in Insular Manuscripts”, in: ''Roger Powell: The Compleat Binder''; edited by John L. Sharpe. (Bibliologia; 14: Elementa ad librorum studia pertenentia''), 1996, pp. 136–45 {{ISBN|2503504345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different ways to identify pigments: invasive and non-invasive.

;Invasive
These tests alter the manuscript in some way, usually by removing some pigment to test a sample.  They are generally reliable but results are not always clear.&lt;ref name="utexas1"/&gt;

;Non-Invasive

These tests do not alter the manuscript and are much better for conservation purposes than the invasive methods of identification.  Some methods include:

*[[Microscopes]]
*Observation under [[Ultra violet|UV]], [[Infrared|IR]], and [[visible light]]
*[[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence (XRF)]]
*[[PIXE|Particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE-α)]]
*[[Raman spectroscopy]]

;Raman spectroscopy

Raman spectroscopy analyzes the [[molecular vibration]]s of the pigments and uses this data to map out its chemical makeup.&lt;ref &lt;ref name=r2/&gt; This works on the notion that every substance interacts with radiation in different ways, and these differing ways if measured can help identify the substance without having to take a sample. Unlike other non-invasive identification techniques the results of Raman spectroscopy are much more certain.  It is even possible to analyze a pigment beneath a glaze or other treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638581|title=Laser Raman Spectroscopy: a tool for non-destructive pigment analysis of manuscripts|year=1992|last1=Porter|first1=Cheryl|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of parchment==

Parchment is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic.]]  As such, environmental conditions such as [[relative humidity|humidity]] must be kept under control.  Pigments add another layer to the problem, forcing a preservationist to fit environmental conditions to two different (and possibly conflicting) sets of ideal limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638571|title=Rediscovering Parchment: the nature of the beast|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems can occur when parchment is exposed to high humidity for a long period of time. For example, [[collagen]] in the pages could dissolve and stick together.&lt;ref&gt;Mowery, J. Franklin. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/bp10-12.html “The Conservation of a Thirteenth Century Armenian Manuscript.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ''The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL''] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/ 10, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are further compounded by the fact that pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile.  Pressing an illuminated manuscript pushes the pigment down, altering the image itself and likely causing damage (such as a relief effect to the other side of the page) so it is very important to not put any pressure upon images on parchment, especially when it is wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638576|title=The Vellum of the Book of Kells|year=1992|last1=Cains|first1=Anthony|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fact also has to be taken into account when cleaning dirt from the image and when encapsulating or framing illuminated parchment for an exhibition.  There must be enough room between the image and the protective surface (such as [[Perspex]]) that the image will not be subject to rubbing if the parchment should expand with rising humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638579|title=Alternative Methods of Mounting Parchment for Framing and Exhibition|year=1992|last1=Pickwoad|first1=Nicholas|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of repair==

===Consolidation===

Consolidation is a process that can either strengthen the bond between pigment and parchment or add protection to pigments and other finishes from [[aqueous]] treatments.  Strengthening the bond between pigments and parchment help prevent the pigments from flaking and pulling away.  The challenge comes with achieving the best consolidation results while altering the object as little as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Maheux, Anne F., and Wanda McWilliams. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-03.html “The Use of the Ultrasonic Mister for the Consolidation of a Flaking Gouache Painting on Paper.] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/ 14, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The material used for consolidation should be appropriate for the pigments, the parchment, and any other aspects that may be affected by the application.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soluble [[nylon]] was used until the mid-1970s when concerns over the material’s stability emerged.  Parchment size was then favored until the mid-1990s when leaf [[gelatin]] gained popularity.  This is not to say that gelatin is always the best consolidant to use; no consolidation technique should be used without first considering the pigments and other materials involved, though.  For example, gelatin causes white lead to become [[friability|friable.]]  This problem is compounded by the flexible nature of parchment.  One solution to this particular problem is to use some form of a cellulose ether such as [[methylcellulose]], instead of gelatin.  Again, this is not necessarily the right choice for every situation.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

There are a few basic requirements for any consolidation agent:
*It has to cause a strong bond to form between the pigment and parchment;
*A strong bond also has to be formed between the layers of pigments and any loose particles;
*There has to be little alteration of the chemicals, including appearance;
*It cannot cause the parchment to lose flexibility.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

====Ultrasonic mister====

One device recently used in consolidation techniques is the ultrasonic mister.  Created in 1991 by Stefan Michalski, this device lends itself well to consolidating materials that react badly with liquids.  Gelatin is the preferred consolidant.

The ultrasonic mister is usually used in conjunction with a paper suction table to direct the mist at the media and prevent [[distortion]].  This is not the best treatment for illuminated manuscripts that have printing on both sides, though.  In this case it is better to forgo the suction table and instead use the lowest setting on the mister and to monitor the process carefully.

Problems may arise if condensed mist falls onto the parchment from the nozzle so it is advisable that the device be placed on the floor or a similarly low level to coax mist to drain back into the mister instead of falling upon the parchment.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Flattening and crease removal===

Traditional methods of removing creases and flattening parchment through humidifying have been detrimental to the state of any pigments, causing them to come off the parchment slightly.  This is because the parchment and pigments take on and give off moisture at different rates, causing them to expand and contract at varying rates and thus loosening the pigment from the surface.  This results in flaking, cupping, and cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638572|title=A Conditioning Chamber for Parchment and Other Materials|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gore-Tex===

The question becomes whether flattening creased parchment to some extent will cause more or less damage to the image than would be caused by not removing the crease.  Sometimes not flattening the parchment in some respect will lead to the further degradation of an image.  In these cases some form of hydration is necessary.  Due to the nature of pigments, though, it is desirable to avoid direct contact with liquid water.  This can be accomplished with [[Gore-Tex]].

Gore-Tex now has controllable pore size and can block out many liquids, including liquid water and many conservation chemicals.  Water vapor can still pass through the pores, though, so it is possible to hydrate the parchment and remove a crease without introducing liquid water to the pigmented image.  This can be achieved by sandwiching a manuscript in Gore-Tex in varying ways to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638574|title=The Conservation of Parchment Objects Using Gore-Tex Laminate|year=1992|last1=Singer|first1=Hannah|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending===

Repairing a tear in a parchment with images or text on it is more of a challenge than mending a piece of parchment that does not have any such issues.  Care must be taken to not cover up or obscure in any way the image or the text.  Materials such as [[Goldbeater's skin]] can be made transparent enough to do this but great care still needs to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1995.9638409|title=Leafcasting with Dermal Tissue Preparations: a new method for repairing fragile parchment, and its application to the Codex Eyckensis|year=1995|last1=Wouters|first1=Jan|last2=Peckstadt|first2=An|last3=Watteeuw|first3=Lieve|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=19|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
The ethics of illuminated manuscript preservation involve the potential for adversely altering the source material during the course of the repair work. In order to ensure the integrity of the manuscript, great care must be taken during any preservation activity. Risk assessments should be made to determine the potential impact of preservation work on the manuscript, and weigh that against the potential benefits of the restoration work itself.

==In Depth on Conservation Challenges==
The Illuminated Book: Conserving an Art Form

The term illuminated manuscript comes from two sources, both of which originated in Medieval Latin.  The first is manuscriptus, a combination of manu ‘by hand’ and scriptus ‘written’.  The second is the Latin word illuminare, which translates to ‘adorned’.  It is this second term that immediately catches attention, letting readers know that this particular manuscript is special, illuminated or ‘adorned.’  An illuminated manuscript is a book, usually religious in nature, that has been intricately decorated with paints, inks, and metal leaf such as gold and silver.  This can include full page illustrations, intricate initials at the beginning of paragraphs and chapters, and embellishment to particularly important areas of text.  A surprising number of these books have survived the years to exist in the modern era; mostly thanks to their value and, in many cases, religious significance.  Nonetheless, the very embellishments that allowed these books to survive are the reason that today’s conservators find illuminated manuscripts more challenging to maintain than their plain counterparts.  This is important not just to conservators, but to the historians who rely on them to trace the economic trends and artistic evolution in a time that is commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, or more properly known as the Migration Period (476–800 C.E.).  Thousands of illuminated manuscripts have survived the ages, yet many are slowly being lost today because they are not being properly conserved.  Illuminated manuscripts are some of the hardest books to conserve, but every effort must be made to preserve them not only for their own beauty and value but for their historical significance as some of the only surviving written records of an era.

Part of the complexity of illuminated manuscripts lies in their historical context.  An illuminated manuscript is, in simple terms, a decorated book.  They usually contain both painted illustrations, embellished text, and illumination with gold and other precious metals.  With the advent and propagation of Christianity in medieval Europe, illustrated books rapidly became a way to convey religious teachings in a time when most of the population was illiterate.  Because of this purpose, most of the illuminated manuscripts to have survived the ages are religious in nature.  In most cases, rich patrons or churches would commission the creation of their own copies of various religious scriptures.  These were most commonly complete copies of the Bible or a subsection, such as individual books of the Old Testament, collections of 150 psalms, or collections of the first four books of the New Testament (Anderson 9).  In later cases, when more people could read, books of hours were also widely called for.   All of these books were created by either nuns or monks, usually in a scriptorium connected to their church or abbey.  Outside of the church, there were some examples of secular texts being illuminated.  Astronomical treatises and copies of classical writers were some of the first examples, emerging as the trend of owning personal copies of religious texts spread among the wealthy.  Later, histories and chronicles became more popular, coinciding with the gradual spread of knowledge and the founding of universities throughout Europe in the latter part of the Middle Ages (Anderson 13).  These books were still most often produced by church scribes and illuminators; however, they were commissioned by private citizens or universities rather than the church.  Without the illuminated manuscripts historians have to study today, much of this information about the gradual return of wealth and learning in the Migration Period would be difficult or even impossible to accurately trace and date.
There were many reasons for the creation of illuminated manuscripts, and these varied with each commission.  However, the most common were either for teaching purposes or as shows of wealth.  Because most common people were illiterate, they could only relate to stories of church doctrine through pictures rather than reading the words.  Illustrating religious texts allowed people to see the stories that church leaders read to them, and to create a personal connection outside of the oral tradition.  In this instance, illuminated manuscripts served the same purpose as stained glass windows in churches.  They allowed the faithful to see the stories of their faith, lending them substance that might be absent from the spoken word.  They could also serve as reminders of religious faith when a church service was not in progress.  The second reason for the creation of illuminated manuscripts was as a show of wealth.  In the case of church manuscripts, the books could both tell religious stories and remind the people of the power and wealth of the church.  In the case of private commissions, the patron was able to demonstrate their wealth by purchasing lavish volumes for their personal libraries and chapels.  This also served to demonstrate their fidelity to and strengthen their ties with the church, whose support and influence with the common people played a major part in keeping the upper class in power.  Because all but the very smallest of local churches had at least a plain copy of the bible, the range from completely unadorned manuscripts to the lavish and intricate designs embellished with rich gold leaf seen in the more famous versions of the art are clearly represented.  Where each book fell on this range closely reflected the wealth and influence of its owner, whether that was an upper-class individual or a town.  While this influence is also represented in buildings and other archeological evidence such as coinage and works of art, the prevalence of illuminated manuscripts from different areas and time periods provides a sort of historical litmus test to the prosperity of the region.

Before the invention of the printing press, making even the simplest book was a painstaking process.  The paper was made by hand, the leather was prepared in tanneries, the binding threads were hand spun, and the inks were ground with a mortar and pestle.  Even with all the materials assembled, the book still had to be stitched and glued together, then painstakingly written by hand by a scribe.  Even so, hundreds of thousands of books were produced between the transition from papyrus scrolls to codices and the advent of the printing press.  The initial transition that sparked this production occurred over time between the first and fifth centuries A.D.  The transition from scrolls to codices began from a common tool used by merchants, the wax tablet.  These tablets were simple panels covered in wax, which could be written in with a pointed stylus and then wiped clean again for reuse.  They were normally kept together by rings passed through holes in their sides (Anderson 17).  Once the format of a rectangular codex protected by hard or stiff covers had become a commonly known alternative to the scroll form previously used, it rapidly gained popularity for its durability and versatile applications.  Over time, they became the standard form of written information.  Gradually the intricate designs of tooled covers and decorated pages evolved to appeal to wealthy clients, and the books became an art form in and of themselves.  Of these carefully created books, only about five percent were deemed important enough to be decorated with illustrations and illumination (Anderson 7).  

To understand the challenges conservators face when dealing with these intricately decorated books, it is first necessary to understand how they were made.  Bookbinders used some of the same techniques used today to create hand bound books.  Sheets were folded in half, so that each one would form two pages.  These were then nested one inside the other to create a gathering.  These gatherings could include as many pages as the bookbinder chose, however there were usually relatively few to prevent the gathering from becoming too bulky.  An alternative method was to fold a very large sheet of paper repeatedly to create many pages, then slit three of the four sides with a knife to create a sheaf of pages (Hamel 39).  Many gatherings were sown together though pre-punched holes known as sowing stations.  The pattern of sowing stations and the use of the thread was what determined the structure of the binding.  Because scribes and artists often needed access to the entire sheets of paper to do their work, books from this time period were often prepared in loose bindings that could be easily undone to free a sheet of paper (Hamel 40).  For both illuminated and unadorned books, these loose bindings cause problems for conservators when they have not been properly and firmly bound after the writing and decorating was completed.  Entire gatherings of pages can come loose, needing to be carefully re-stitched into their correct locations.  Because of the wide variance in materials used in the bindings of books from the era that illuminated manuscripts were made, it is possible to trace some back to specific binderies, meaning that the materials can be analyzed to understand what trade was going on in that area at the time.  For example, if a lavish cover was inlayed with lapis lazuli, if would be possible to infer that the bindery was able to source materials from as far east as Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Certain kinds of leather can also be traced back to specific geographical regions, as some breeds of cow and goat were only found in specific areas at this time.

The pages used in books from this period also pose their own concerns.  There were three main materials used for the pages of books in this time period: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper (Alexander 35).  Papyrus was the primary writing material of the ancient world, and was created by beating stalks of the papyrus reed together until the fibers in the plant formed a tight, almost woven structure.  Because it did not provide a stable surface for paint, this sort of paper was very rarely used for illuminated manuscripts.  As for the paper most people would recognize today, the first true example was created in China around 105 A.D. using beaten, strained, and dried vegetable fibers such as tree bark.  However, this paper was very expensive and generally had to be imported at the time that illuminated manuscripts were being widely made, so it appears less often than the third alternative, parchment (Permanence/Durability of the Book 11).  It is worth noting that those manuscripts with paper pages are much harder to conserve, and the acids present in the plant fibers naturally cause it to yellow and break down over time.  This process is irreversible, but can be slowed and limited by controlling the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of the paper.  Turning to the final option, we reach the most common form of page used in illuminated manuscripts.  Parchment and vellum are both made of very fine, prepared and treated animal skins that have been dried in a manner which leaves them flexible.  The difference between them is that vellum is usually made with either goat, pig, or calf skin, while parchment is made from sheep skin (Langwell 44).  Parchment provides an ideal surface for illumination, and was even placed into books which used other page materials in patches to allow for a good painting or illuminating surface (Alexander 35).  This prevalent use of parchment provides some of the historical significance of illuminated manuscripts.  The different kinds of hide used can be DNA tested with modern equipment, and often tell historians what area the book is from and sometimes where the hide was sourced from, mapping trade routes and patterns otherwise lost to history.  There is one key conservation problem with parchment and vellum that was discovered even while it was being widely used: if is very susceptible to water damage.  Not only does it mold quickly in high humidity environments, but early forms of ink that were commonly used on papyrus could simply be washed off without leaving a trace.  It is believed that “Iron gall inks were devised to overcome this disadvantage,” however even these inks can be wiped off fairly thoroughly if they are scrubbed (Langwell 43).

The issue of proper inks used on parchment also carries over to the paints used in the illustrations.  This set of problems is truly unique to decorated books, and is the beginning of just what sets them apart as conservation challenges as opposed to their plain counterparts.  In particular, the brilliant blue color of paint that is seen in many of the finest examples of the art is a challenge.  Made from ground lapis lazuli this was the most expensive color of paint, as it was sourced from far away Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Any book bearing this color would have been especially costly, and helps to map the economic structure of Migration Period Europe through the supply chain used to create it and the person wealthy enough to afford it.  Unfortunately, this particularly precious color is also the most difficult for conservators.  It is prone to flaking and cupping, a form of contraction which causes the paint to crack and curve outwards in many little flakes, giving the appearance of tiny shingles that have been flipped upside-down.  This means that even the slightest friction can catch the raised edges and cause the paint to flake off.  It must be carefully consolidated with a nonreactive adhesive, without damaging other surrounding decoration (Clarkson 47).  Many other paints used at the time were also poisonous.  The compositions of many paints were discovered using Raman spectroscopy, a noninvasive method of analysis that bounces light off of a given pigment and reads back the compositions based on witch wavelengths are absorbed and reflected (De 75).  Using this and other spectroscopic methods, it has been determined that the very common red pigment found in these books was created from red lead, or, more dangerously, the highly toxic compound cinnabar.  Another variant of this common color was vermillion, created using heated mercury and sulfur.  Yellow was often made using poisonous orpiment, or arsenic sulfide, and white was almost invariably created using lead.  While there are some organic alternatives, such as yellow made from saffron, it is unknown if even a single illuminated manuscript does not contain toxic materials.  These compounds can pose a danger to conservators, researchers, or those putting the books of display if they are aerated and should be carefully consolidated and never abraded.  While many other paints and inks were used by the artist decorating the books, these examples convey both the wide ranges of the colors used and the dangers they posed. This added level of difficulty is a good example of what makes illuminated manuscripts harder to deal with than plan books.  It is also worth noting that while the paints were a finishing measure for the book the painter did not actually do any designing.  An earlier drawling would have set out the pattern and clearly labeled with colors should go where in places that would be covered with paint.  These patterns and labels are visible using various imaging techniques.  Some scribes also wrote or made small drawings in the margins of the books, often providing historians with a window into the life on the average man in the Migration Period. These little annotations are some of the only surviving records of everyday life from the time commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Complaints about long work hours and little drawings of people and monsters can be seen both in the margins and in some cases under the paint of the illustrations.  

The tradition of illustrating texts goes all the way back to the cradle of civilization, evolving through Egypt and the cultures of the Mediterranean.  However, it was far less common for books and papers to be embellished with precious metals, and this aspect of illuminated manuscripts adds another facet of difficulty for conservators that is not found elsewhere.  In the middle ages, gold was the symbol of royalty, a clear sign of wealth and status.  Yet for all of that, it was actually fairly common.  Indeed, by the late middle ages the most common use for gold was in coinage (De 65).  Because of this, using small quantities of the precious metal in a book was not prohibitively expensive.  Gold, and all other metals used for illumination, was hammered into incredibly thin sheets, allowing a tiny amount of gold to cover a large area.  This thin sheet was then adhered to the pages using the particular illuminator’s formula of adhesive.  This variation in adhesives mean that if any work needs to be done by a conservator, several tests must be undergone to ensure that no modern consolidation or adhesive will react with, damage, or loosen the old glue.  While this is an issue for conservators, in rare cases a glue can be traced to a specific bindery, thus placing the book in its correct area and context, making it far more useful to historians.  Another challenge for conservators lies in the fact that the gold used in books was not always pure.  Alloys of gold can be subject to corrosion, with can cause darkening of the metal, reaction with the adhesives and other paint, and staining of the paper.  This is an inherent vice of illuminations done with pure silver as well.  Regardless of the care and treatment, silver corrodes and darkens over time.  While modern conservators have ways of limiting this though control of humidity, older books have often seen their illumination corrode to the point that to attempt to clean it would simply remove the metal entirely.

Conservation in the modern era does not only face issues with the objects themselves.  While a corroded book is one issue, how to display that book to the public is another, potentially more complex problem.  From a conservator’s point of view, to best protect a book it should be placed in a controlled, dark environment, then swaddled in padding with plenty of circulating air and tightly controlled relative humidity.  Once old damage has been repaired, the goal is to keep new damage from occurring.  However, most illuminated manuscripts belong to museums and libraries.  Moreover, these beautiful works are the pride of the collection in most cases, and any curator will naturally want their most enticing items on display to woo the visiting public.  In addition, part of the cultural value of the books is what they can teach us about the missing part of history commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Historians will often want to study and run tests on the books in hopes of learning something about the time and place they were made, such as what trade was present.  Thus comes one of the great ethical issues in the field of conservation, the problem of preservation versus access.  The question most often faced by conservators is how to display a book to the least damage for the longest time.  The light that enables visitors to see the books also breaks down the lignin structures in paper pages, fades paints, and embrittles leather.  The cradle that holds the book open for viewing may also strain the spine. These are only two of the myriad issues that must be addressed when dealing with these fragile books.  Even more arise when tests need to be run or a historian wants to handle a book.  Removing a sliver of paint for analysis by a mass spectrometer may reveal information about trade routes, but it also damages the book.  Likewise, inspecting the drawings and inscriptions in the margins provides a unique historical window, but a careless historian might touch the page and damage fragile and flaking paint.  Not all institutions have the funds to properly care for their collections either.  While a few famous examples claim the spotlight in major institutions, small museums, libraries, and religious centers put their own, smaller treasures on display to the public without the expertise of a conservator to aid them.

The complex challenges of illuminated manuscripts make them a uniquely troublesome medium for conservation.  Their illumination, adhesives, paints, inks, papers, and even their very bindings can pose issues ranging from toxic chemicals to lost pages.  Some of these issues are universal to book conservation.  The troubles with ink on parchment pages and of loose bindings can be found in any book contemporary to the Medieval and Migration Periods.  Yet illuminated manuscripts take these usual issues and add to them with poisonous paint, corroding metals, and uniquely challenging materials such as the luxuriously expensive yet eternally flaking lapis lazuli paint.  Illuminated manuscripts are also problematic because of their popularity amongst displays.  For these reasons and many others, illuminated manuscripts are clearly more challenging to conservators than their plainer contemporaries.  Hidden away in private collections and small institutions, some of these books are gradually falling into disrepair.  This fact is all the more important when you look past the aesthetic and monetary value of these books and realize that they are some of the only surviving written pieces from a time when there is so little historical information available that textbooks call it the Dark Ages.  In the future, as technology evolves, it may be possible to gradually bring the economy and social system of the Migration Period into the light by carefully analyzing these books.  This is why it is so important that they survive in the modern age; and why the difficulty of their care matters to everyone, weather they see a beautiful artwork or a historical road map in the glittering pages.
 
==Digital preservation==
Manuscript preservation may also take the form of digital archiving, which is particularly useful for vulnerable manuscripts and fragments susceptible to deterioration such as the burnt fragments extant from the [[Cotton library#Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] which have now been recorded using multispectral imaging by the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name=bl2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Andrew|title=Fragmentarium and the burnt Anglo-Saxon fragments|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/09/fragmentarium-and-the-burnt-anglo-saxon-fragments.html|website=British Library: Medieval Manuscripts|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fragmentarium]] (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments) is an online database which, since September 2017, preserves and collates fragments of medieval manuscripts making them available to researchers, collectors and historians worldwide. It is an international collaboration of major libraries and collections including the [[British Library]], [[Harvard]], [[Stanford]], [[Yale]] and the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragmentarium - An international scholarly network that enables libraries, collectors, researchers and students to upload medieval manuscript fragments and to describe, transcribe and assemble them online.|url=http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/newsletter/archive/issue-18.html#fragmentarium|website=E-Codices|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17297">'''Conservation development''', also known as '''conservation design''', is a controlled-growth [[land use]] development that adopts the principle for allowing limited [[sustainable development]] while protecting the area's natural environmental features in perpetuity, including preserving [[Open space reserve|open space]] landscape and vista, protecting [[Arable land|farmland]] or natural [[habitat]]s for wildlife, and maintaining the character of rural communities.&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide To Creating Open Space Networks |last=Arendt |first=Randall G. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington |isbn=978-1-55963-489-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conservation development is usually defined as a project that dedicates a minimum of 50 percent of the total development parcel as [[Open space reserve|open space]].

Conservation Development differs from other land protection approaches by aiming to protect land and environmental resources on parcels slated for immediate development—to protect land here and now. In contrast, a [[green belt]] approach typically aims to protect land from future development, and in a region beyond areas currently slated for development. It seeks to offer a gradient between urban regions and open countryside, beyond what a line on a map—typically a highway—currently provides. This approach seeks to avoid the dichotomy of economic urbanism on one side of such a street while on the other lies completely protected woodlands and farm fields, devoid of inclusion in that economy. Addressing the theoretical illusion that humanity walled off is better-off, Conservation Development recognizes that design of how we live is far more important than we allot credit; that instead of walling off a problem we need to face that problem and drastically lower our impact on the sites where we live, and indeed raise the performance of our communities toward a level where such walls are no longer considered first response requirements.

== History ==
Conservation development was formulated in the early 1980s by a British-trained planner Randall Arendt. He pulled together several concepts from the 1960s. He combined the idea of cluster and open space design with Ian McHarg's "design with nature" philosophy.&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doyle |first=Donna L. |title=Planning for Greener Development: Conservation Development and Landon Bay East |journal=FES Outstanding Graduate Student Paper Series |year=2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation development ==
Conservation development seeks to protect a variety of ecological resources and services such as biodiversity, productive farmland, [[ecosystem services]], scenic landscapes and historic and cultural resources.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; This is achieved by identifying the ecologically sensitive and valuable areas. The protected lands can be under an easement to prevent development on it. Housing is then built around the protected areas. Density, lots sizes, types of housing and amount of protected area is dependent on the type of conservation development.

While not a prevalent type of development, it's estimated that conservation development takes up between 2.5%-10% of the total US real estate development.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; Conservation development is usually applied to rural, exurban or suburban residential subdivisions, though it does have a few urban applications (Doyle 4). 

While there are several types of conservation developments, they all have several features in common.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; All developments have conservation land set aside, either held by a conservation organization or protected by a conservation easement. These developments must have ongoing stewardship for the protected portion of the parcel.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; Secondly, the development finances the projected area. Third, each development begins by surveying the land's ecological features and resources. A decision can then be made about where to build and what areas need to be protected. Lastly, these developments also use a variety of design features to reduce some of the negative impacts inherent in development. Examples include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact stormwater management systems]], and landscape design.

== Types ==
Milder cites four principal conservation development techniques found in the United States.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; The first two he groups together as having a "conservation with development" philosophy. Conservation is the main goal with development as a means to that end. The latter two types fall under the "development with conservation" ethos. These two types of projects are done through private developers whose goal is turn a profit at the end of the day, but in a "conservation-friendly matter".&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; Table 1 provides an excellent summary of the different conservation development techniques.

=== Conservation buyer projects ===
The first type he calls conservation buyer projects. In this situation, a land trust buys the property and places the ecologically important areas under a conservation easement. They then resell the land, including the easement, to a conservation buyer. The buyer cannot build on the easement, but may do so on the remaining, unprotected portion. This technique usually results in a few houses being built on the piece of land, resulting in a low density.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; According to a study undertaken by Milder &amp; Clark, 98.4% of the total land receives protection, the highest amongst the four conservation development types.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milder|first=Jeffery C.|author2=Story Clark|title=Conservation Development Practices, Extent and Land-Use Effects in the United States|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2001|volume=25|issue=4|pages=697–707|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01688.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation and limited development projects ===
The second type identified by Milder is called conservation and limited development projects (CLDP). They are often carried out by land trusts, and occasionally by conservation-minded developers or landowners. Real estate is developed for sale on an open market, and the profit is used to finance conservation of the nearly land. Milder &amp; Clark found that 93.5% of the total land area is protected under this type of development.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt; Recent studies done on the effectiveness of CLDPs in protecting, restoring and managing threatened resources reveal that it is significantly more effective at doing so, in comparison to conservation subdivisions and conventional development.

=== Conservation subdivisions ===
Conservation subdivisions are the third and best-known type of conservation development. This is a development that "sets aside a major portion of the site as conservation land" and clusters housing on the remaining portion.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; The houses are built on lots smaller than usual, meaning the density of the development nears the maximum allowed by zoning. Unlike conservation and limited development projects, a homeowners' association manages the protected land. These associations may lack knowledge and have different goals regarding the lands' management, which may result in a less than ideally managed conservation. As a result of this and other factors, a study found that on average only 57.1% of the total land area is protected from development.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt;

=== Conservation-oriented planned development projects ===
The final type identified by Milder is called conservation-oriented planned development projects. These are large-scale development projects found in suburban and exurban areas. The scale of the projects means large tracts of land can be protected. They typically have densities nearing the zoned maximum and feature of a mix of housing types and land uses. The resulting percentage of protected land is 71.3.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt;

== Advantages ==
The biggest advantage of conservation development is that it can protect species and ecosystems, preventing further habitat fragmentation and loss. By surveying the land and identifying the primary conservation areas where ecosystems are most at risk, communities are created without huge disruption to the environment.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt; Conservation development also provides for secondary conservation areas, which provide corridors for animals to hunt, mate and travel through.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

However, any development will have some impact on the land. But by studying it, there are ways in which this can be mitigated. A developer can have native vegetation planted. Wildlife friendly native species could be introduced,&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; while invasive species are monitored and controlled.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|Stormwater management]] systems are also used to "promote natural flow patterns and infiltration", considered a very important factor in minimizing a development's impact.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt;

There are several benefits from an economic standpoint. Conservation development allows developers to make themselves distinct in a competitive housing market.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; A developer can use an environmentally oriented marketing strategy, highlighting the benefits of the development to possible buyer with a green thumb.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; A final advantage of conservation development is that homes in these developments tend appreciate faster than their conventional counterparts.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt;

Pejchar et al. and Arendt cite a number of economic benefits that accrue to municipalities through conservation development. They include fewer public costs on maintenance and infrastructure, protecting open space without losing tax revenues, and avoiding the loss of ecological services like landscape stabilization, flood control and clean water.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; A municipality also experiences a reduced demand for public green space since it has been provided free of charge by the development.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

Lastly, there are a few social and recreational advantages to conservation development.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; With the smaller lots that accompany these houses, homeowners are likely to move into public green space and engage with their neighbours. Community events such as picnics or parties are more common. The protected green space also provides excellent recreational activities, such as hiking, jogging, or simply observing nature. It's hopeful that with this experience, people can reconnect with nature and develop a land ethic.&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
There are several drawbacks to conservation development. The first problem encountered is the perceived risk by both developers and homebuyers.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; In protecting sensitive areas, developers and homeowners see a risk in the possible elimination of desired sites to build homes. This might be a large enough risk to discourage developers. This could be a place for government intervention, which could provide tax breaks to developers building a development this way.

Conservation subdivisions and conservation-oriented planned development projects have been "criticized for protecting land at too small a scale to provide meaningful conservation benefits, while simultaneously promoting "leapfrog" development".&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; This pushes sprawl further from the city and contributes to a more fragmented rural area.

== Implications ==
This type of planning is becoming increasingly more relevant as "land conversion for housing development is a leading cause of habitat loss and fragmentation".&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; With a loss or fragmentation of a species' habitat, it results in the endangerment of a species and pushes them towards premature extinction.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Without biodiversity, we lose the many benefits we derive from it, including economic and ecological services, genetic information, and recreational pleasure, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Land conversion also contributes to the reduction of agriculturally productive land,&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; already shrinking due to climate change.

'''Cultural transmission''', also known as '''cultural learning''', is the process and method of passing on socially learned information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-47829-6_1885-1|title=Encyclopedia of Animal Cognition and Behavior|last=Jones|first=Nick A. R.|last2=Rendell|first2=Luke|date=2018|publisher=Springer, Cham|pages=1–9|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-47829-6_1885-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a species, [[cultural transmission]] is greatly influenced by how adults [[socialization|socialize]] with each other and with their young. Differences in cultural transmission across species have been thought to be largely affected by external factors, such as the physical environment, that may lead an individual to interpret a traditional concept in a novel way. The environmental stimuli that contribute to this variance can include [[climate]], [[migration pattern]]s, conflict, suitability for survival, and [[endemic]] [[pathogen]]s. Cultural transmission can also vary according to different social learning strategies employed at the species and or individual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rendell|first=Luke|last2=Fogarty|first2=Laurel|last3=Hoppitt|first3=William J.E.|last4=Morgan|first4=Thomas J.H.|last5=Webster|first5=Mike M.|last6=Laland|first6=Kevin N.|title=Cognitive culture: theoretical and empirical insights into social learning strategies|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2010.12.002|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=15|issue=2|pages=68–76|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural transmission is hypothesized to be a critical process for maintaining behavioral characteristics in both humans and nonhuman animals over time, and its existence relies on innovation, imitation, and communication to create and propagate various aspects of animal behavior seen today.

== Definition ==
Culture is defined as "all group-typical behavior patterns, shared by members of animal communities, that are to some degree reliant on socially learned and transmitted information".&lt;ref name=Laland&gt;Kevin N. Laland and Vincent M. Janik.  Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution Vol. 21 No. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, culture is not passed on genetically from parents to offspring, but rather learned through experience and participation, which makes the [[evolution]] of [[cultural transmission]] greatly reliant on intra-species traditions. The likelihood of larger groups within a species developing and sharing these '''[[wikt:intraspecies|intra-species]]''' traditions with peers and offspring is much higher than that of one individual spreading some aspect of animal behavior to one or more members. This is why cultural transmission has been shown to be superior to individual learning, as it is a more efficient manner of spreading traditions and allowing members of a species to collectively inherit more [[adaptive behavior (ecology)|adaptive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Best.  Adaptive Behavior 1999 7: 289.&lt;/ref&gt; This process by which offspring within a species acquires his or her own culture through mimicry or being introduced to traditions is referred to as '''[[enculturation]]'''. The role of cultural transmission in cultural evolution, then, is to provide the outlet for which organisms create and spread traditions that shape patterns of animal behavior visibly over generations.

== History of study ==

=== Dawkins's meme theory ===

Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] made groundbreaking headway into the field of cultural transmission with his 1976 book entitled ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', which focused heavily on the move to evolution being understood primarily by genetic influence. Dawkins coined the term [[meme]], the primary unit of cultural transmission or imitation, to explain an overarching mechanism of how animal behavior is shared and spread to lead to cultural evolution. The use of the word meme was an intentional phonetic derivation of the similar sounding word "[[gene]]", which Dawkins asserts to be the primary unit of selection as it lends itself to pathways of biological evolution:

{{quote|"We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme." (Dawkins)}}

The [[analogy]] between the gene and meme proposed by Dawkins as units of evolutionary biology serves to reinforce the idea that there is a particular pathway of transfer associated with each unit that lends itself either to the evolution of genotypic, phenotypic, and/or behavioral patterns within animal groups. Dawkins asserts that in order for cultural evolution to take place, there needs to be (1) variation within the memes present, (2) the capacity for meme replication between two or more parties, and (3) fitness advantages and/or disadvantages with each meme that lead to the selection or rejection of one meme over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dawkins, R.|title=[[The Selfish Gene]]|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, these three criteria in the context of genes are also necessary for genetic evolution. However, with the meme unit, cultural transmission has a distinct feature of being capable of taking place by individuals developing varying interpretations of the meme without exactly "copying" it to pass it on. These interpretations lead to the creation of new memes, which are themselves subject to a cyclic process of selection, rejection, or modification.

=== Whiten's ''Culture in Chimpanzees'' ===

Andrew Whiten, professor of Evolutionary and Developmental Psychology at the [[University of St. Andrews]], contributed to the greater understanding of cultural transmission with his work on [[chimpanzee]]s. In ''Cultural Traditions in Chimpanzees'', Whiten created a compilation of results from seven long-term studies totaling 151 years of observation analyzing behavioral patterns in different communities of chimpanzees in Africa (read more about it below). The study expanded the notion that cultural behavior lies beyond linguistic mediation, and can be interpreted to include distinctive socially learned behavior such as stone-handling and [[Hundredth monkey effect|sweet potato washing]] in [[Japanese macaque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whiten |first=Andrew |author2=[[Jane Goodall|J. Goodall]] |author3=W. C. McGrew |author4=T. Nishida |author5=V. Reynolds |author6=Y. Sugiyama |author7=C. E. G. Tutin |author8=R. W. Wrangham |author9=[[Christophe Boesch|C. Boesch]] |year=1999|title=Cultures in chimpanzees|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|issue=6737|pages=682–685|doi=10.1038/21415|pmid=10385119|volume=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture in primates"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boesch|first=Christophe|authorlink=Christophe Boesch|editor=Jaan Valsiner |title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|url=http://www.biolinguagem.com/imagens/bioimagens/Boesch,%202011%20-%20culture%20in%20primates.pdf|pages=678|year=2012|publisher=OUP|isbn=9780195396430|chapter=31. Culture in primates. A - Culture as it Happens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivedi|first=Bijal P.|date=February 6, 2004|title="Hot Tub Monkeys" Offer Eye on Nonhuman "Culture"|journal=[[National Geographic Channel]] October 28, 2010/[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0206_040206_tvmacaques.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The implications of their findings indicate that chimpanzee behavioral patterns mimic the distinct behavioral variants seen in different human populations in which cultural transmission has generally always been an accepted concept.

=== Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman models ===
[[Population geneticist]]s [[Cavalli-Sforza]] &amp; [[Marcus Feldman|Feldman]] have also been frontrunners in the field of cultural transmission, describing behavioral "traits" as characteristics pertaining to a culture that are recognizable within that culture.&lt;ref name=Pagel&gt;{{cite book|author=Pagel, Mark D.|authorlink=Mark Pagel|title=Encyclopedia of Evolution|year=2002|ISBN= 0195122003|volume=1|pp=222–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a quantifiable approach, Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman were able to produce mathematical models for three forms of cultural transmission, each of which have distinct effects on socialization: vertical, horizontal, and oblique.
* '''[[Vertical transmission]]''' occurs from parents to offspring and is a function which shows that the probability that parents of specific types give rise to an offspring of their own or of another type. Vertical transmission, in this sense, is similar to genetic transmission in biological evolution as mathematical models for gene transmission account for variation. Vertical transmission also contributes strongly to the buildup of between-population variation.&lt;ref name=Pagel/&gt;
* [[Horizontal transmission]] is cultural transmission taking place among peers in a given population. While horizontal transmission is expected to result in faster within-group evolution due to the relationship building between peers of a population, it is expected to result in less between-group variation than the vertical transmission model would allow for.
* Oblique transmission is cultural transmission being passed from one generation to another younger generation, such as is done by teaching, and the result of reproducing information across generations is a rapid loss of variation within that specific population. Unlike vertical transmission, oblique transmission doesn't need to occur strictly between parent and offspring; it can occur between less-related generations (e.g. from grandparent to grandchild), or from an individual to a non-related younger individual of the same species.

== Mechanisms ==

=== Social learning ===
{{Main article|Social learning in animals}}
Culture can be transmitted among animals through various methods, the most common of which include [[imitation]], [[teaching]], and [[language]]. Imitation is one of the most prevalent modes of cultural transmission in non-human animals, while teaching and language are much less widespread. In a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Thornton, A.|author2=Malapert, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Experimental evidence for social transmission of food acquisition techniques in wild meerkats|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=78|issue=2|pages=255–264|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.04.021|url=http://www.wildcognitionresearch.com/files/ThorntonSocialTransmission2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on food acquisition techniques in [[meerkat]]s (''Suricata suricatta''), researchers found evidence that meerkats learned foraging tricks through imitation of [[conspecific]]s. The experimental setup consisted of an apparatus containing food with two possible methods that could be used to obtain the food. Naïve meerkats learned and used the method exhibited by the "demonstrator" meerkat trained in one of the two techniques. Although in this case, imitation is not the clear mechanism of learning given that the naïve meerkat could simply have been drawn to certain features of the apparatus from observing the "demonstrator" meerkat and from there discovered the technique on their own.

=== Teaching ===

Teaching is often considered one mechanism of social learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caro|first=T. M.|last2=Hauser|first2=M. D.|date=1992-06-01|title=Is There Teaching in Nonhuman Animals?|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/417553|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=67|issue=2|pages=151–174|doi=10.1086/417553|issn=0033-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occurs when knowledgeable individuals of some species have been known to teach others.  For this to occur, a teacher must change its behavior when interacting with a naïve individual and incur an initial cost from teaching, while an observer must acquire skills rapidly as a direct consequence.  There is evidence for teaching in populations of ants (where a knowledgeable individual leads a naïve one to a food source through "[[tandem running]]") and meerkats (where adults gradually teach pups scorpion-handling skills and monitor their performance).  Teaching is arguably the social learning mechanism that affords the highest fidelity of information transfer between individuals and generations, and allows a direct pathway through which local traditions can be passed down and transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology|author1=N.B.Davis|author2=J.R. Krebs|author3=S.A. West|year=2012|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In various animals ==

=== Chimpanzees ===
In 1999, Whiten et al. examined data from 151 years of [[chimpanzee]] observation in an attempt to discover how much cultural variation existed between populations of the species.  The synthesis of their studies consisted of two phases, in which they (1) created a comprehensive list of cultural variant behavior specific to certain populations of chimpanzees and (2) rated the behavior as either customary – occurring in all individuals within that population; habitual – not present in all individuals, but repeated in several individuals; present – neither customary or habitual but clearly identified; absent – instance of behavior not recorded and has no ecological explanation; ecological – absence of behavior can be attributed to ecological features or lack thereof in the environment, or of unknown origin.  Their results were extensive: of the 65 categories of behavior studied, 39 (including [[Personal grooming|grooming]], [[Tool use by animals|tool usage]] and [[courtship behavior]]s) were found to be habitual in some communities but nonexistent in others.

Whiten et al. further made sure that these local traditions were not due to differences in [[ecology]], and defined cultural behaviors as behaviors that are "transmitted repeatedly through social or observational learning to become a population-level characteristic".&lt;ref name=Whiten&gt;{{cite journal|author1=SA, Whiten|author2=J. Goodall|author3=W. C. McGrew|author4=T. Nishida|author5=V. Reynolds|author6=Y. Sugiyama|author7=C. E. G. Tutin|author8=R. W. Wrangham|author9=C. Boesch|lastauthoramp=y|title=Cultures in chimpanzees|year=1999|journal=Nature|volume=399|issue=6737|pages=682–685|doi=10.1038/21415|pmid=10385119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight years later, after "conducting large-scale controlled social-diffusion experiments with captive groups", Whiten et al. stated further that "alternative foraging techniques seeded in different groups of chimpanzees spread differentially...across two further groups with substantial fidelity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Whiten|author2=A. Spiteri|author3=V. Horner|author4=K.E. Bonnie|author5= S.P. Lambeth|author6=S.J. Schapiro|author7= F.B.M. de Waal|title=Transmission of Multiple Traditions within and between Chimpanzee Groups|journal=Current Biology|volume=17|issue=12|date=19 June 2007|pages=1038–1043|ISSN=0960-9822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.031|pmid=17555968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding confirms not only that nonhuman species can maintain unique cultural traditions; it also shows that they can pass these traditions on from one population to another.  The Whiten articles are a tribute to the unique inventiveness of wild chimpanzees, and help prove that humans' impressive capacity for culture and cultural transmission dates back to the now-extinct common ancestor we share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=Whiten/&gt;

Similar to humans, [[social structure]] plays an important role in cultural transmission in chimpanzees. Victoria Horner conducted an experiment where an older, higher ranking individual and a younger, lower ranking individual were both taught the same task with only slight aesthetic modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Horner, Victoria|author2=Darby Proctor|author3=Kristin E Bonnie|author4=Andrew Whiten|author5=Frans B M de Waal|lastauthoramp=y|year=2010|title=Prestige Affects Cultural Learning In Chimpanzees|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=5|pages=1–5|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010625|pmid=20502702|pmc=2873264|url=http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/publications/articles/Horner_etal_2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; She found that chimpanzees tended to imitate the behaviors of the older, higher ranking chimpanzee as opposed to the younger, lower ranking individual when given a choice. It is believed that the older higher ranking individual had gained a level of 'prestige' within the group. This research demonstrates that culturally transmitted behaviors are often learned from individuals that are respected by the group.

The older, higher ranking individual's success in similar situations in the past led the other individuals to believe that their fitness would be greater by imitating the actions of the successful individual. This shows that not only are chimpanzees imitating behaviors of other individuals, they are choosing which individuals they should imitate in order to increase their own fitness. This type of behavior is very common in human culture as well. People will seek to imitate the behaviors of an individual that has earned respect through their actions. From this information, it is evident that the cultural transmission system of chimpanzees is more complex than previous research would indicate.

Chimpanzees have been known to use tools for as long as they have been studied. Andrew Whiten found that chimpanzees not only use tools, but also conform to using the same method as the majority of individuals in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whiten, Andrew|author2=Victoria Horner|author3=Frans B M de Waal|title=Conformity To Cultural Norms Of Tool Use In Chimpanzees|journal=Nature|volume=437|issue=7059|year=2005|pages=737–740|doi=10.1038/nature04047}} MEDLINE with Full Text.&lt;/ref&gt; This conformity bias is prevalent in human culture as well and is commonly referred to as peer pressure.

The results from the research of Victoria Horner and Andrew Whiten show that chimpanzee social structures and human social structures have more similarities than previously thought.

=== Birds ===

In an experiment looking at [[Bird vocalisation|vocal behavior in birds]], researchers Marler &amp; Tamura&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. Marler|author2=M. Tamura|title=Culturally transmitted patterns of vocal behavior in sparrows|year=1964|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3650|pages=1483–6|url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/bard/pdf/week_09_marler_tamura_culturally_transmitted_patterns_of_vocal_behavior_in_sparrows_science_1964.pdf|pmid=14208581|doi=10.1126/science.146.3650.1483}}&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of song [[dialect]]s in a [[sparrow]] species. Located in the eastern and southern parts of North America, ''[[White-crowned sparrow|Zonotrichia leucophrys]]'' is a species of white-crowned song-birds that exhibit learned vocal behavior. Marler &amp; Tamura found that while song variation existed between individual birds, each population of birds had a distinct song pattern that varied in accordance to geographical location. For this reason, Marler &amp; Tamura called the patterns of each region a "dialect".

By raising male [[sparrow]]s in various types of acoustic settings and observing the effects of their verbal behavior, Marler &amp; Tamura found that sparrows learned song "dialects" in about the first 100 days of life from older males. In this experimental setting, male birds in acoustic chambers were exposed to recorded sounds played through a [[loudspeaker]]. Using this setup in the laboratory, Marler &amp; Tamura also saw that alien dialects could be taught, and that after learning the dialect, the sparrow's verbal behavior were unaffected by the additional acoustic experiences, like the exposure of other dialects and songs from different species. It was also shown that white-crowned sparrows selectively learn songs of conspecifics. Marler &amp; Tamura note that this case of cultural transmission is interesting in that it requires no social bond between the learner and the emitter of sound, given all emitted sounds originated from a loudspeaker in their experiments.

=== Dolphins ===
By using a "process of elimination" approach, researchers Krutzen et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michael Krutzen|author2=Janet Mann|author3=Michael R. Heithaus|author4=Richard C. Connor|author5=Lars Bejder|author6=William B. Sherwin|lastauthoramp=y|title=Cultural transmission of tool use in bottlenose dolphins|journal=PNAS|date=June 21, 2005|volume=102|issue=25|doi=10.1073/pnas.0500232102|pages=8939–8943|pmid=15947077|pmc=1157020}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported evidence of culturally transmitted tool use in [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops'' sp.). It has been previously noted that tool use in foraging, called "sponging" exists in this species. "Sponging" describes a behavior where a dolphin will break off a marine sponge, wear it over its rostrum, and use it to probe for fish. Using various genetic techniques, Krutzen et al. showed that the behavior of "sponging" is vertically transmitted from the mother, with most spongers being female. Additionally, they found high levels of genetic relatedness from spongers suggesting recent ancestry and the existence of a phenomenon researchers call a "sponging eve".

In order to make a case for cultural transmission as the mode of behavioral inheritance in this case, Krutzen et al. needed to rule out possible genetic and ecological explanations. Krutzen et al. refer to data that indicate both spongers and nonspongers use the same habitat for foraging. Using mitochondrial [[DNA]] data, Krutzen et al. found a significant non-random association between the types of mitochondrial DNA pattern and sponging. Because mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally, this result suggests sponging is passed from the mother.

In a later study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K. Bacher|author2=S. Allen|author3=A.K. Lindholm|author4=L. Bejder|author5=M. Krutzen|title=Genes or culture: are mitochondrial genes associated with tool use in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.)?|journal=Behavioral Genetics|volume=40|issue=5|pages=706–14|pmid=20582623|doi=10.1007/s10519-010-9375-8|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one more possible explanation for the transmission of sponging was ruled out in favor of cultural transmission. Scientists from the same lab looked at the possibility that 1.) the tendency for "sponging" was due to a genetic difference in diving ability and 2.) that these genes were under selection. From a test of 29 spongers and 54 nonspongers, the results showed that the coding mitochondrial genes were not a significant predictor of sponging behavior. Additionally, there was no evidence of selection in the investigated genes.

=== Matrilineal whales ===

In the cases of three species of [[matrilineal]] cetaceans, including [[pilot whale]]s, [[sperm whales]], and [[killer whale]]s, [[mitochondrial DNA]] nucleotide diversities are about ten times lower than other species of whale.&lt;ref name=Whitehead&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitehead | first1 = Hal | year = 1998 | title =  Cultural Selection and Genetic Diversity in Matrilineal Whales| url = | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = | pages = 1708–1711 | doi=10.1126/science.282.5394.1708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead found that this low mtDNA [[nucleotide]] diversity yet high diversity in matrilineal whale culture may be attributed to cultural transmission, since learned cultural traits have the ability to have the same effect as normal maternally inherited mtDNA. The feeding specializations of these [[toothed whale]]s are proposed to have led to the divergence of the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] "resident" and "transient" forms of killer whales off Vancouver Island, in which resident killer whales feed on fish and squid, and transient whales feed on marine mammals. Vocalizations have also been proven to be culturally acquired in killer and sperm whale populations, as evidenced by the distinct vocalization patterns maintained by members of these different species even in cases where more than one species may occupy one home range. Further study is being done in the matrilineal whales to uncover the cultural transmission mechanisms associated with other advanced techniques, such as [[Animal migration|migration]] strategies, new foraging techniques, and babysitting.&lt;ref name=Whitehead/&gt;

=== Black rat ===
In the [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), social transmission appears to be the mechanism of how [[Optimal foraging theory|optimal foraging]] techniques are transmitted. In this habitat, the rats’ only source of food is pine seeds that they obtain from pine cones. Terkel et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Terkel|title=Cultural transmission in the black rat: pine cone feeding|year=1996|journal=Advances in the Study of Behavior|volume=24|pages=119–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the way in which the rats obtained the seeds and the method that this strategy was transmitted to subsequent generations. Terkel et al. found that there was an optimal strategy for obtaining the seeds that minimized energy inputs and maximized outputs. Naïve rats that did not use this strategy could not learn it from [[trial and error]] or from watching experienced rats. Only young offspring could learn the technique. Additionally, from [[cross-fostering]] experiments where pups of naïve mothers were placed with experienced mothers and vice versa, those pups placed with experienced mothers learned the technique while those with naïve mothers did not. This result suggests that this optimal foraging technique is socially rather than genetically transmitted.

=== Fish ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:French grunts.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
Evidence for cultural transmission has also been shown in wild fish populations. Scientists Helfman and Schultz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G.S. Helfman|author2=E.T. Schultz|title=Social transmission of behavioural traditions in a coral reef fish |year=1984|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=32|issue=2|pages=379–384|url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=eeb_articles|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(84)80272-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted translocation experiments with [[French grunt]]s (''Haemulon flavolineatum'') where they took fish native to a specific schooling site and transported them to other sites. In this species of fish, the organism uses distinct, traditional migration routes to travel to schooling sites on coral reefs. These routes persisted past one generation and so by relocating the fish to different sites, Helfman and Schultz wanted to see if the new fish could relearn that sites' migration route from the resident fish.  Indeed this is what they found: that the newcomers quickly learned the traditional routes and schooling sites. But when residents were removed under similar situations, the new fish did not use the traditional route and instead use new routes, suggesting that the behavior could not be transmitted once the opportunity for learning was no longer there.

In a similar experiment looking at mating sites in [[Bluehead wrasse|blueheaded wrasse]] (''Thalassoma bifasciatum''), researcher Warner found that individuals chose mating sites based on social traditions and not based on the resource quality of the site. Warner found that although mating sites were maintained for four generations, when entire local populations were translocated elsewhere, new sites were used and maintained.

== Controversies and criticisms ==
A popular method of approaching the study of [[animal culture]] (and its transmission) is the "ethnographic method," which argues that culture causes the geographical differences in the behavioral repertoires of large-brained mammals.  However, this significantly downplays the roles that [[ecology]] and [[genetics]] play in influencing behavioral variation from population to population within a species.  Behaviors stemming from genetic or environmental effects are not reliant on socially learned and transmitted information; therefore, they are not cultural.

Culture is just one source of adaptive behavior an organism exhibits to better exploit its environment.  When behavioral variation reflects differential [[phenotypic plasticity]], it is due more to ecological pressures than cultural ones.  In other words, when an animal changes its behavior over its lifespan, this is most often a result of changes in its environment.  Furthermore, animal behavior is also influenced by evolved predispositions, or genetics.  It is very possible that "[[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between distance between sites and 'cultural difference' might reflect the well-established correlation between genetic and geographical distances".&lt;ref name=Laland/&gt;  The farther two populations of a species are separated from each other, the less genetic traits they will share in common, and this may be one source of variance in culture.

Another argument against the "ethnographic method" is that it is impossible to prove that there are absolutely no ecological or genetic factors in any behavior. Though culture has long been thought to arise and remain independent of genetics, the constraints on the propagation and innovation of cultural techniques inevitably caused by the genome of each respective animal species has led to the theory of [[gene-culture coevolution]], which asserts that "cognitive, affective, and moral capacities" are the product of an evolutionary dynamic involving interactions between genes and culture over extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Gintis.  Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 2011 366, 878–888&lt;/ref&gt; The concept behind gene-culture [[coevolution]] is that, though culture plays a huge role in the progression of animal behavior over time, the genes of a particular species have the ability to affect the details of the corresponding culture and its ability to evolve within that species.

We do not know every possible genetic or environmental effect on behavior that exists, nor will we ever.  In other words, it is impossible to reject the notion that genes and ecology influence all behaviors, to a degree.  Culture can also contribute to differences in behavior, but like genes and environments, it carries different weight in different behaviors.  As Laland and Janik&lt;ref name=Laland/&gt; explain, "to identify cultural variation, not only is it not sufficient to rule out the possibility that the variation in behavior constitutes unlearned responses to different selection pressures [from the environment], but it is also necessary to consider the possibility of genetic variation precipitating different patterns of learning." Gene-culture coevolution, much like the interaction between cultural transmission and environment, both serve as modifiers to the original theories on cultural transmission and evolution that focused more on differences in the interactions between individuals.

Some scientists believe the study of animal culture should be approached in a different way. Currently, the question being asked is, "is this behavior learned socially (and hence is a result of culture alone), or is it a product of genes and/or environment?"  However, it is impossible to find an absolute answer to this question, nor does one in all likelihood exist.  Therefore it seems as though scientists should focus on examining how much variance in a behavior can be attributed to culture.  Performing field experiments is an excellent way to try to answer this question: translocating individuals between populations or populations between sites could help biologists distinguish between culture, ecology and genetics.  For example, if a newly introduced animal shifts its behavior to [[Mimicry|mimic]] that of others in its new population, genetic difference as an effect on behavior can be ruled out.

== Unanswered questions and future areas of exploration ==
In the study of social transmissions, one of the important unanswered questions is an explanation of how and why maladaptive social traditions are maintained. For example, in one study on social transmission in [[guppy|guppies]] (''Poecilia reticulata''), naïve fish preferred taking a long, energetically costly route to a feeder that they had learned from resident fish rather than take a shorter route. These fish were also slower to learn the new, quicker route compared to naïve fish that had not been trained in the long route. In this case, not only is the social tradition maladaptive, but it also inhibits the acquisition of adaptive behavior.

The '''Cygnus Loop''' (radio source W78, or [[Sharpless catalog|Sharpless]] 103) is a large [[supernova remnant]] (SNR) in the [[constellation]] [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], an emission nebula measuring nearly 3° across.&lt;ref name=Murdin&gt;{{ cite book

==Visual components:  the Veil Nebula==
{{main|Veil Nebula}}

The visual portion of the Cygnus Loop is known as the Veil Nebula, also called the Cirrus Nebula or the Filamentary Nebula. Several components have separate names and identifiers,&lt;ref name="seds-veil"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the "Western Veil" or "Witch's Broom", the "Eastern Veil", and Pickering's Triangle.

===NGC 6960===
NGC 6960, the ''Western Veil'', is the western part of the remnant, also known as the "Witch's Broom", located at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|45|58.1}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+30|35|43}}.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6960" /&gt;  As the western-most NGC object in the nebula (first in [[right ascension]]), its number is sometimes used as an NGC identifier for the nebula as a whole.

===NGC 6992, NGC 6995, and IC 1340===
These three luminous areas make up the ''Eastern Veil''.  NGC 6992 is an HI shell located along the north-eastern edge of the loop at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|56|19.0}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+31|44|34}}.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6992"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NGC 6995 is located farther south at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|57|10.7}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+31|14|07}},&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6995"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate=2010-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pickering's Triangle===
Also known as Pickering's Wedge, or Pickering's Triangular Wisp, this segment of relatively faint nebulosity was discovered photographically in 1904 by [[Williamina Fleming]] at Harvard Observatory, where [[Edward Charles Pickering]] was director at the time.  The Triangle is brightest along the northern side of the loop, though photographs show the nebulosity extending into the central area as well.

===NGC 6974 and NGC 6979===
These two objects are generally identified today (as by the NGC/IC Project and ''Uranometria'') with two brighter knots of nebulosity in a cloud at the northern edge of the loop, to the east of the northern edge of Pickering's Triangle.  NGC 6979 was reported by [[William Herschel]], and while the coordinates he recorded for Veil objects were somewhat imprecise,&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6979" /&gt; his position for this one is tolerably close to the knot at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|50|27.9}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+32|01|33}}.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6979"&gt;{{cite web
  | title=NGC/IC Project
  | work=Results for NGC 6979
  | url=http://www.ngcicproject.org/pubdb.htm
  | accessdate=2010-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identifier ''NGC 6979'' is sometimes taken to refer to Pickering's Triangle,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://cs.astronomy.com/asycs/media/p/447512.aspx this photo] posted by ''Astronomy Magazine'' (accessed 2010-12-01).&lt;/ref&gt; but the Triangle is probably not what Herschel saw or what the Catalogue intended for this entry:  it was discovered only photographically, after the Catalogue was published, and long after Herschel's observation.

NGC 6974 was reported by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]], but the position he gave lies in an empty region inside the main loop.  It was assumed that he recorded the position incorrectly, and the [[New General Catalogue]] gives Rosse's object as the other knot in the northern cloud, located at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|51|04.3}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+31|49|41}}, one degree north of Rosse's position.&lt;ref name="ngc-ic-project-6974"&gt;{{cite web

==Southeastern knot==
The southeastern knot is located at J2000 [[Right ascension|RA]] {{RA|20|56|21.2}} [[Declination|Dec]] {{Dec|+30|23|59}} on the southeastern rim of the Cygnus Loop. The knot has been identified as an encounter between the blast wave from the supernova and a small isolated cloud.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/175651 |display-authors=4 |author=Graham JR |author2=Levenson NA |author3=Hester JJ|author4=Raymond JC |author5=Petre R |title=An X-ray and optical study of the interaction of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant with an interstellar cloud |journal=Astrophys.

==Distance==
Until recently, the distance to the supernova remnant was estimated at about 770 parsecs or 2500 [[light-years]].&lt;ref name="SandT"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent studies, however, have shown that it must be closer.  In 1999, William Blair, assuming that the shock wave should be expanding at the same rate in all directions, compared the angular expansion along the sides of the bubble (visible in [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images) with direct line-of-sight measurements of the radial expansion towards the Earth.&lt;ref name="SandT" /&gt; He concluded that the actual size of the bubble was about 40% smaller than the conventional value, leading to a distance of about 1470 ly.&lt;ref name="SandT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt;

This revised calculation, though it involved some uncertainty and was met with some resistance,&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt; has been substantially corroborated by the discovery via the [[Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer]] (FUSE) of a star ''behind'' the Veil.  The star, KPD2055+3111, of [[spectral type]] sdOBwas, was identified as UV-bright in an image from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope,&lt;ref name=Blair&gt;{{ cite journal

The revised distance in turn yields revised estimates of the size of the remnant (to 90 ly, down from 150 ly previously)&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt; and for its age (now thought to be between 5000 and 8000 years).&lt;ref name="fuse-summary" /&gt;

Herman, G. T. and Kuba, A., Advances in Discrete Tomography and Its Applications, Birkhäuser Boston, 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the problem of reconstruction of [[binary image]]s (or finite subsets of the [[integer lattice]]) from a small number of their [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s.

In general, [[tomography]] deals with the problem of determining shape and dimensional information of an object from a set of projections. From the mathematical point of view, the object corresponds to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] and the problem posed is to reconstruct this function from its [[integral]]s or sums over subsets of its [[Domain of a function|domain]]. In general, the tomographic inversion problem may be continuous or discrete. In continuous tomography both the
domain and the range of the function are continuous and line integrals are used. In discrete tomography the domain of the function may be either discrete or continuous, and the range of the function is a finite set of real, usually nonnegative numbers. In continuous tomography when a large number of projections is available, accurate reconstructions can be made by many different algorithms.
It is typical for discrete tomography that only a few projections (line sums) are used. In this case, conventional techniques all fail. A special case of discrete tomography deals with the problem of the reconstruction of
a binary image from a small number of projections. The name ''discrete tomography'' is due to [[Larry Shepp]], who organized the first meeting devoted to this topic ([[DIMACS]] Mini-Symposium on Discrete Tomography, September 19, 1994, [[Rutgers University]]).

In 1957, [[H. J. Ryser]] found a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of vectors being the two orthogonal projections of a discrete set. In the proof of his theorem, Ryser also described a reconstruction algorithm, the very first reconstruction algorithm for a general discrete set from two orthogonal projections. In the same year, [[David Gale]] found the same consistency conditions, but in connection with the [[flow network|network flow]] problem.&lt;ref name=CMC27&gt;{{cite book | last=Brualdi | first=Richard A. | title=Combinatorial matrix classes | series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications | volume=108 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=0-521-86565-4 | zbl=1106.05001 | page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another result of Ryser's is the definition of the switching operation by which discrete sets having the same projections can be transformed into each other.

The problem of reconstructing a binary image from a small number of projections generally leads to a large number of solutions. It is desirable to limit the class of possible solutions to only those that are typical of the class of the images which contains the image being reconstructed by using a priori information, such as convexity or connectedness.

===Theorems===
* Reconstructing (finite) planar lattice sets from their 1-dimensional X-rays is an [[NP-hard]] problem if the X-rays are taken from &lt;math&gt; m\geq 3 &lt;/math&gt; lattice directions (for &lt;math&gt; m=2 &lt;/math&gt; the problem is in P).&lt;ref name="ref15" /&gt;
*The reconstruction problem is highly unstable for &lt;math&gt; m\geq 3 &lt;/math&gt; (meaning that a small perturbation of the X-rays may lead to completely different reconstructions)&lt;ref name="ref23" /&gt; and stable for &lt;math&gt; m=2 &lt;/math&gt;, see.&lt;ref name="ref23"&gt;A.

*Coloring a grid using &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; colors with the restriction that each row and each column has a specific number of cells of each color is  known as the &lt;math&gt;(k-1)&lt;/math&gt;−atom problem in the discrete tomography community. The problem is NP-hard for &lt;math&gt; k \geq 3 &lt;/math&gt;, see.&lt;ref name="ref16" /&gt;

The '''Economic Scholars Program''' (ESP) is an annual conference  in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that highlights undergraduate research in economics and business.  It is co-hosted by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] and [[Austin College]]. The conference is typically held on the last Friday in March or first Friday in April&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasfed.org/educate/events/esp.cfm | title=ESP About | publisher=Dallas Federal Reserve | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is modeled after professional economics conferences. Undergraduate students participate in the conference as presenters of original or faculty-coauthored research, discussants, session chairs or audience member participants. Each level of participation in the program is designed to reflect the growing interests and skills of undergraduate students. Additionally, the ESP added a poster session in 2011 to accommodate more student research.

The 6th annual conference, held in 2012, hosted undergraduate students and faculty mentors representing 35 different undergraduate institutions from 19 states. In terms of the number of attendees, papers, and posters presented it is the largest conference focusing on undergraduate research in economics.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Empower Up''', formerly known as CREAM (Computer Reuse Education And Marketing), a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]], was a [[Computer recycling|computer recycling center]] in SW Washington. Started in mid-2002, Empower Up took old electronics in for donation, and recycled/distributed them.

==History==
Empower Up's history can be traced back to a collection event started by the [[Vancouver, Washington|City of Vancouver]] and [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]] in June 2001. The success of this collection prompted the city to start another collection in January 2002, to collect only reusable computers and monitors for the community. Due to the success of the second event, comments by sponsors, and the general public showed an interest in these collections.

In mid-2002, after both an event for re-usage and recycling of computers, departments of the City of Vancouver created the program Computer REuse and Marketing, or CREAM. This new organization would have a permanent location, permanent collection sites, and mobile collection units to travel around the area. CREAM would also make sure of the proper disposal of materials in electronics not suitable for redistribution. By 2008, CREAM had distributed 250 refurbish computers to needy families (with the help of [[Salvation Army|Salvation Army Family Services]]), and recycled 3.5 million pounds of [[electronic waste]].

Near the beginning of 2009, due to new laws in Washington, it was recommended that the organization become an independent [[non-profit organization]]. With the help of [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]], and Clark County ReStore, the state created a 3-year plan to make CREAM an independent nonprofit. In February 2009, they established their first permanent building in Vancouver.

In April 2010, CREAM's name was changed to Empower Up, with the motto "''Technology Reuse In Action''", and changed to their current logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upgradeyourcommunity.org/about.html |title=Empower Up - About Us |author=CREAM |date=April 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144633/http://www.upgradeyourcommunity.org/about.html |archivedate=July 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 Empower Up moved to 3206 N E 52nd Street Vancouver Washington 98663 on St Johns Road. They expanded the Reuse store and added an eBay store. &lt;!-- dubious - discuss? In the future Empower Up wants to promote more artistic ventures with recycled electronic parts and add skills training certifications.--&gt;

On 27 August 2016 Empower Up was shut down permanently, citing "economic pressure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/jul/26/electronics-recycler-empower-up-closing/|title=Electronics recycler Empower Up closing|date=2016-07-26|work=The Columbian|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empower Up has recently received attention from many local and state news sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">A '''floating signifier''' (also known as an '''empty signifier''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Reference Overview: floating signifier|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095824238}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] without a [[referent]] in [[semiotics]] and [[discourse analysis]], such as a word that points to no actual object and has no agreed upon meaning.

==Definition==

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] originated this term,&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, "Introduction à l'oeuvre de Marcel Mauss" in ''Mauss, Sociologie et Anthropologie'', Paris, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; where he identifies terms like ''[[mana]]'' (magical mystical substance of which the magic is formed), or ''oomph'' (American slang term for flavor in the figurative sense)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/oomph | title= ''Oomph'' definition | publisher= Thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to represent an undetermined quantity of signification, in itself void of meaning and thus apt to receive any meaning".  Daniel Chandler defines the term as "a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified".&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem02a.html | last= Chandler | first= Daniel | title= Semiotics for Beginners | publisher= aber.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such a "floating signifier" may "mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean". Such a floating signifier—which is said to possess "symbolic value zero"—necessarily results to "allow symbolic thought to operate despite the contradiction inherent in it".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Mehlman, ''The "Floating Signifier": From Lévi-Strauss to Lacan'', Yale French Studies, No. 48, '''French Freud: Structural Studies in Psychoanalysis'''. (1972), pp. 10–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Emancipation(s), Ernesto Laclau frames empty signifier a context of social interactions. For Laclau, empty signifier is the hegemonic representative of a collection of various demands, constituting a chain of equivalence whose members are distinguished through a differential logic (as in elements exist only in their differences to one another) but combine through an equivalential one. This chain of unsatisfied demands create an unfulfilled totality, inside of which one signifier subordinates the rest and assumes representation of the rest via a hegemonic process.

==Uses and examples==

The notion of floating signifiers can be applied to concepts such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://caffeinesparks.blogspot.com/2007/08/race-floating-signifier.html | title= Race: a Floating Signifier? Stuart Hall speech | publisher= caffeine_sparks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gender]], as a way of asserting that the word is more concrete than the concept it describes, where the concept may not be stable, but the word is. It is often applied to [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|non-linguistic signs]], such as the example of the [[Rorschach inkblot test]]. [[Roland Barthes]], while not using the term "floating signifier" explicitly, referred specifically to non-linguistic signs as being so open to interpretation that they constituted a "floating chain of signifieds."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt; For example, the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] is at once a signifier of the geographical nation it represents, of patriotism to that nation, of the nation's set of governmental policies, and/or of the ideologies associated with it, such as [[liberty]]. Depending on the context, the flag can carry either positive ''or'' negative significance.

The concept is used in some more textual forms of [[postmodernism]], which rejects the strict anchoring of particular signifiers to particular signifieds and argues against the concept that there are any ultimate determinable meanings to words or signs. For example, [[Jacques Derrida]] speaks of the "freeplay" of signifiers: arguing that they are not fixed to their signifieds but point beyond themselves to other signifiers in an "indefinite referral of signifier to signified."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;

A '''foreign language''' is a [[language]] originally from another country than the speaker. However, there must a be defined distinction between foreign and second language. It is also a language not spoken in the native country of the person referred to, i.e., an [[English language|English]] speaker living in [[Spain]] can say that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a foreign language to him or her. These two characterisations do not exhaust the possible definitions, however, and the label is occasionally applied in ways that are variously misleading or factually inaccurate. 

Some children learn more than one language from birth or from a very young age: they are [[bilingual]] or [[multilingualism|multilingual]]. These children can be said to have two, three or more mother tongues: neither language is foreign to that child, even if one language is a foreign language for the vast majority of people in the child's birth country. For example, a child learning English from his [[England|English]] father and Irish at school in Ireland can speak both English and Irish, but neither is a foreign language to him. This is common in countries such as [[India]], [[South Africa]], or [[Canada]] due to these countries having multiple official languages.

In general, it is believed that children have advantage to learning a foreign language over adults. However, there are studies which have shown adult students are better at foreign language learning than child students. It is because adults have pre-existing knowledge of how grammar works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merritt, Anne. "Are Children Really Better at Foreign Language Learning?"|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|accessdate=2016-05-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511000800/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|archivedate=2016-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a superior ability of memorizing vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Elisabet, et al.

==Foreign language education and ability==
:''See main article: [[Language education]]''
{{globalise/Europe|date=November 2010}}

Most schools around the world teach at least one foreign language and most colleges and high schools require foreign language before graduation.  By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only exception being [[Ireland]], where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English, but neither is considered a foreign language (although Irish pupils do study a third European language). On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, learners have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language is studied at age six, and in [[Flemish Community|Flanders]] at age 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm#2.6 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112090730/http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm |date=2007-01-12 }} Children in the [[Flemish Community|Flemish Community of Belgium]] start learning [[French language|French]] at age 10, [[English language|English]] at 12 or 13 and, if chosen so, mostly [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at age 15 or 16, but with only the first two being obligatory. In the [[Brussels Capital Region]], however, French is taught starting at age 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wales]], all children are taught [[Welsh language|Welsh]] from the first year of primary school. The Welsh language is also compulsory up to the age of 16, although a formal [[GCSE]] qualification is optional.

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a minority/regional language community use partial [[language immersion|immersion]] to teach both the minority and the state language. This method is also highly used in Canada, wherein anglophone students spend all of most of their lessons learning the materials in French.

In 1995, the [[European Commission]]'s White Paper on Education and Training emphasised the importance of schoolchildren learning at least two foreign languages before upper secondary education. The [[Lisbon Summit]] of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language and less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language. In 2001, a European Commission survey found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardise the learning of languages across Europe.

An article from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' claims that only 1 percent of the adults within the American population consider themselves proficient in speaking a foreign language. This is in stark contrast to many other countries, where the percentage is much higher. Even though there are many benefits that come with learning a foreign language, schools across the United States continue to cut foreign language from their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Amelia (2015). America's Lacking Language Skills. 'The Atlantic'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruments for foreign language learning===
{{Main|Language education}}

In recent years, [[computer-assisted language learning]] has been integrated into foreign language education and computer programs with varying levels of interactional relationship between computer and the language learner have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Palmberg, R. (1989). Integrating CALL into Foreign-Language Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; Language learning aids such as [[foreign language writing aid]] and [[foreign language reading aid]], targeted at the specific language skills of foreign language learners, are also alternative instruments available for foreign language learners.

==Research into foreign language learning==
{{Main|Second language acquisition}}

In 2004, a report by the Michel Thomas Language Centre in the [[United Kingdom]] suggested that speaking a second language could increase an average worker's salary by £3000 (€3 300) a year, or £145 000 (€159 000) in a lifetime. Further results showed that nine out of 10 British companies thought their businesses could benefit from better language skills. Studies show that a person that is bilingual or multilingual, can make a greater salary than a computer programmer or engineer because they can use their abilities in foreign language to obtain success in a wide range of career paths. Also due to the increase of international population, a multilingual person can easily communicate and translate to perspective viewers.

Also in 2004, a study by [[University College London]] (UCL) examined the brains of 105 people who could speak more than one language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Learning languages 'boosts brain'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126220802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who learned a second language when younger had denser [[grey matter]] than those who learned one later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Grey matter is an area of the brain where information is most efficiently processed, due to the function of specific nerve cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Helen|date=2004-07-21|title=Grey matter matters for intellect|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news040719-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217224556/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|title=Thinking in a Foreign Language Makes Decisions More Rational|last=Keim|first=Brandon|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001301/https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|archivedate=2017-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown that early exposure to a second language increases divergent thinking strategies,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Diaz (1983). Thought and Two Languages: The Impact of Bilingualism on Cognitive Development. Review of Research in Education. Vol. 10, pp. 23-54.&lt;/ref&gt; helping not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math.  Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.

==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==
{{underlinked|section|date=November 2012}}

There are no major differences in different definitions that different writers have provided about foreign language and second language, although not many of them differentiate these two terms. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and [[TEFL]] (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows some attention of different researchers to the concepts of foreign language and second language.

Richards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide this information about second language:

"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's native language [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfils many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home)."

They also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).

Crystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).

Stern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after World War II in international organisations, such as UNESCO, in order to meet nationalist susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.
Fasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.

So, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).

A 'second language' usually has official status or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, Persian is a second language for Kurdish people, but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning Kurdish. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an Iranian person goes to USA, then English becomes a second language for him or her. Thus British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. In Kermanshah or Kurdistan, we can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.

The purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.

There are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. He or she can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.

Second language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.

[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.

The major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:

# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.
# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.
# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.
# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.
# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.

There are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.

There is often a distinction between acquisition and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.

The distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.

Nevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, immigrants to the US can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.

'''''Gongche'' notation''' or '''''gongchepu''''' is a traditional [[musical notation]] method, once popular in ancient [[China]]. It uses [[Chinese character]]s to represent [[musical note]]s. It was named after two of the Chinese characters that were used to represent musical notes, namely "{{lang|zh|[[wikt:工|工]]}}" ''gōng'' and "{{lang|zh|[[wikt:尺|尺]]}}" ''chě''. Since the pronunciation ''chě'' for the character "{{lang|zh|尺}}" is uncommon, many people call it '''''gongchi'' notation''' or '''''gongchipu''''' by mistake{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

[[Sheet music]] written in this notation is still used for [[traditional Chinese musical instruments]] and [[Chinese opera]]s. However the notation is becoming less popular, replaced by mostly ''jianpu'' ([[numbered musical notation]]) and sometimes the standard western notation.

== The notes ==

=== Basic characters ===

The notation usually uses a [[Solfege#Variations|movable "do"]] system. There are variations of the character set used for musical notes. A commonly accepted set is shown below with its relation to ''jianpu'' and [[solfege]].

=== Usual variations ===

The three notes just below the central octave are usually represented by special characters:
:{| class="wikitable" align="center"

Sometimes "{{lang|zh|士}}" ''shì'' is used instead of "{{lang|zh|四}}" ''sì''. Sometimes "{{lang|zh|一}}" ''yī'' is not used, or its role is exchanged with "{{lang|zh|乙}}" ''yǐ''.

To represent other notes in different [[octave]]s, traditions differ among themselves. For ''[[Kunqu]]'', the end strokes of "{{lang|zh|上}}" "{{lang|zh|尺}}" "{{lang|zh|工}}" "{{lang|zh|凡}}" are extended by a tiny slash downward for the lower octave, a [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] "{{lang|zh|亻}}" is added for one octave higher than the central. For [[Cantonese opera]], however, "{{lang|zh|亻}}" means an octave lower, while "{{lang|zh|彳}}" means an octave higher.

Some other variations:
* "{{lang|zh|尺}}" is replaced by "{{lang|zh|乂}}" in Taiwanese tradition.
* "{{lang|zh|凡}}" is replaced by "{{lang|zh|反}}" in Cantonese tradition.
* "{{lang|zh|彳上}}", the "do" just above the central octave, is usually replaced by "{{lang|zh|生}}" in Cantonese tradition.

=== Pronunciation ===

When the notes are sung in different opera traditions, they do not sound as the words would be pronounced in the respective [[varieties of Chinese|regional dialects]]. Instead, they are pronounced in an approximation of [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Rhythm ==

[[Image:Kungchepo_old_mcdonald.png|left|thumb|250px|An example of ''gongche'' notation]]

''Gongche'' notation does not mark the relative length of the notes. Instead, marks for the [[percussion]], understood to be played at regular intervals, are written alongside with the notes. Gongche is written in the same format as how Chinese was traditionally written; from top to bottom and then from right to left. The rhythm marks are written to the right of the note characters.

The diagram at the left illustrates how the tune "Old McDonald Had a Farm" will look like if written in ''gongche'' notation. Here, "{{lang|zh|。}}" denotes the stronger beat, called "{{lang|zh|板}}" ''bǎn'' or "{{lang|zh|拍}}" ''pāi'', and "{{lang|zh|、}}" denotes the weaker beat, called "{{lang|zh|眼}}" ''yǎn'' or "{{lang|zh|撩}}" ''liáo''. In effect, there is one beat in every two notes, i.e. two notes are sung or played to each beat. These notes in solfege with markings will show a similar effect:
:'''do''' do &lt;u&gt;do&lt;/u&gt; sol '''la''' la &lt;u&gt;sol&lt;/u&gt; &amp;nbsp; '''mi''' mi &lt;u&gt;re&lt;/u&gt; re '''do'''

[[File:Kam Hok Yap Mun-Yeung Kwan Sam Tip.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Example of gongche use with [[guqin]] tablature and beat marks.]]

Using this method, only the number of notes within a beat can be specified. The actual length of each note is up to tradition and the interpretation of the artist.

Notice that the actual rhythm marks used differ among various traditions.

== History and usage ==

''Gongche'' notation was invented in the [[Tang Dynasty]]. It became popular in the [[Song Dynasty]]. It is believed to have begun as a [[tablature]] of certain musical instrument, possibly using a fixed "do" system. Later it became a popular pitch notation, typically using a movable "do" system.

The notation is not accurate in modern sense. It provides a musical skeleton, allowing an artist to improvise. The details are usually passed on by oral tradition. However, once a tradition is lost, it is very difficult to reconstruct how the music was supposed to sound. Variations among different traditions increased the difficulty in learning the notation.

The system was also introduced to Korea (where it is referred to as ''gong jeok bo'') in ancient times and many traditional musicians still learn their music from such scores (although they typically perform from memory).

''[[Kunkunshi]]'', a [[Okinawan music|Ryukyuan]] musical notation still in use for [[sanshin]], was directly influenced by Gongche.&lt;ref&gt;East Asia: China, Japan, and Korea (Garland Encyclopedia of World Music). 2001. page 828&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21926">In the height region between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km altitude on Earth, the ionospheric plasma is electrically conducting. Atmospheric tidal winds due to differential  solar heating or due to gravitational lunar forcing move the ionospheric plasma against the [[geomagnetic field]] lines thus generating electric fields and currents just like a [[dynamo]] coil moving against magnetic field lines. That region is therefore called '''ionospheric dynamo region'''.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels&gt;Chapman , S.J. and J. Bartels, „Geomagnetism“ , Clarendon Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; 
The magnetic manifestation of these electric currents on the ground  can be observed during magnetospheric quiet conditions. They are called Sq-variations (S=solar; q=quiet) and L-variations  (L=lunar) of the geomagnetic field.
Additional electric currents are generated by the varying  [[magnetospheric electric convection field]]. These are the DP1-currents (the auroral electrojets) and the  polar DP2-currents.
&lt;ref name=Akasofu&gt;Akasofu, S.I., "Physics of Magnetospheric Substorms", Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a polar-ring current has been derived from the observations which depends on the polarity of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Heppner, J.P., in Dyer, E.R. (ed), "Critical Problems of Magnetospheric Physics", Nat. Acad. Sci.,Washington, D.C., p. 107. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; These geomagnetic variations belong to the so-called external part of the [[geomagnetic field]]. Their amplitudes reach at most about 1% of the main internal [[geomagnetic field]] '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Atmospheric Electric Conductivity==
Radioactive material from the ground and galactic cosmic rays ionize a small fraction  of the atmospheric gas within the lower and middle atmosphere  and make the gas electrically conducting. Electrons quickly  attach to neutral particles forming negative ions. The positive ions are mostly singly charged. The electric conductivity depends on the mobility of the ions . That mobility  is proportional to the reciprocal air density. Thus, the electric conductivity increases almost  exponentially with altitude.  The ions move with the neutral gas making the conductivity [[isotropic]].&lt;ref&gt;Viggiano, A.A., and F. Arnold, in Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. 1, p. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

At heights between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- and extreme [[ultraviolet radiation]] (XUV) is almost completely absorbed  generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers.  Here, the electrons are already bound to the [[geomagnetic field]] gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes [[anisotropic]]. The conductivity parallel to an electric field  '''E'''  is called  [[Pedersen]] conductivity.  The conductivity orthogonal to '''E''' and the geomagnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  is the [[Hall]] conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus [[Joule]] heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  still increases with altitude. Near the geomagnetic dip equator, a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore,  a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the [[Cowling]] conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140&amp;nbsp;km  altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a factor of ten or more. The values of  these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become of the order of 50 S, or  a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer, A.A., Rev. Geophys., 2, 275, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

In the auroral regions which lie between about 15° and 20° geomagnetic co-latitude and the corresponding latitudes in the southern hemisphere, precipitating high energy particles from the [[magnetosphere]] ionize the neutral gas, in particular at heights around 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;km, and increase the electric conductivity substantially. During magnetospheric disturbed conditions, this conductivity enhancement becomes much larger, and the auroral regions move equatorward.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt;

At heights above about 200&amp;nbsp;km, collisions between neutrals and plasma become rare so that both ions and electrons can only gyrate about the geomagnetic lines of force, or drift orthogonal to '''E''' and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. The parallel conductivity is so large that the geomagnetic lines of force become electric potential lines, and only electric fields orthogonal to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; can exist (see [[magnetosphere]]).

==Atmospheric Tides==
'''Atmospheric tides''' are global-scale waves excited by regular solar differential heating (thermal tides)or by the gravitational [[tidal force]] of the moon (gravitational tides). The atmosphere behaves like a huge waveguide closed at the bottom (the Earth's surface) and open to space at the top. In such a waveguide an infinite number of atmospheric wave modes can be excited. Because the waveguide is imperfect, however, only  modes of lowest degree with large horizontal and vertical scales can develop sufficiently well so that they can be filtered out from the meteorological noise. They are solutions of the [[Laplace]] equation &lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, M.S., "The eigenfunctions of Laplace's tidal equations over a sphere", Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.", London, A262, p. 511, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and are called Hough functions. These can be approximated by a sum of [[spherical harmonics]].

Two kinds of wave modes exit: class 1 waves (sometimes called gravity waves), and class 2 waves (rotational waves). Class 2 waves owe their existence to the [[Coriolis effect]] and can only exist for periods larger than 12 hours. Tidal waves can be either internal (travelling waves ) with positive eigenvalues (or equivalent depth)  which have finite vertical wavelengths and can transport wave energy upward, or external (evanescent waves) with negative eigenvalues and infinitely large vertical wavelengths meaning that their phases remain constant with altitude. These external wave modes cannot transport wave energy, and their  amplitudes decrease exponentially with height outside their source regions. Each mode is characterized by four numbers: the zonal wave number n, positive for class 1 waves and negative for class 2 waves (their meridional structures becoming increasingly complex with increasing number n), a meridional wave number m, the eigenvalue, and the period, in our case one solar or [[lunar day]], respectively. The modes are labeled as (m, n). Even numbers of n correspond to waves symmetric with respect to the equator, and odd numbers corresponding to antisymmetric waves.

At thermospheric heighs, [[dissipation]] of atmospheric waves becomes significant so that at above about 150&amp;nbsp;km altitude, all wave modes gradually become external waves, and the [[Hough function]]s degenerate to [[spherical harmonics]]s; e.g., mode (1, -2) develops to the spherical harmonic P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), mode (2, 2) becomes P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), with θ the co-latitude, etc.&lt;ref name=VollandAT&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrating Solar  Tides===
The fundamental solar diurnal tidal mode which optimally matches the solar heat input configuration and thus is most strongly excited is the (1,&amp;nbsp;-2) - mode. It depends on local time and travels westward with the Sun. It is an external mode of class 2. Its maximum pressure amplitude on the ground is about 60 hPa.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen &gt;Chapman, S., and R.S. Lindzen, "Atmospheric Tides", Kluwer Dordrecht, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[thermosphere]], however, it becomes the predominant mode reaching temperature amplitudes at the [[exosphere]] of at least 140 K  and horizontal winds of the order of  100&amp;nbsp;m/s and more increasing with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, H. and J.W. King, J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 29,1045, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The largest solar semidiurnal wave is mode (2,&amp;nbsp;2) with maximum pressure amplitudes near the ground of 120&amp;nbsp; hPa. It is an internal class 1 wave. Its amplitude increases with altitude. Although its solar excitation is half of that of mode (1,&amp;nbsp;-2), its amplitude on the ground is larger by a factor of two. This indicates the effect of  suppression of external waves, in this case by a factor of four
.&lt;ref name=VollandAT/&gt;

===Semidiurnal Lunar Tides===
The dominant migrating lunar tide is the (2, 2) mode depending on lunar [[Time zone|local time]]. Its maximum pressure amplitude near the ground is 6 Pa, which is far below the meteorological noise. Therefore, it is not simple to detect such small signal.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen /&gt; Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude reaching values at 100&amp;nbsp;km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground.

==Electric Currents==

===Sq-Current===

====Morphology====
More than 100 geomagnetic observatories around the world measure regularly the variations of the [[earth's magnetic field]]. The daily variations during selected days of quiet geomagnetic activity are used to determine a monthly mean. From the horizontal component ΔH of such data, one can derive a corresponding overhead equivalent electric sheet current system at dynamo layer heights of strength

J = 2 ΔH/μ = 1.6 ΔH

with J (in milliAmpere/meter) the electric overhead sheet current, ΔH (in nanoTesla) the observed horizontal component of the geomagnetic variation, and μ the electric permeability of free space.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels /&gt; One can determine the direction of the magnetic field with regard to the current by the simple rule of thumb: if the thumb of the right hand points into the direction of the current, the curved fingers give the direction of the associated magnetic field.

One has to take into account that this relationship is not unique. In general, electric currents within [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] are three-dimensional, and an infinite number of current configurations fits to the geomagnetic variations observed on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima, N., Radio Sci., 6, 269, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic measurement in space are necessary to obtain a realistic picture.

[[File:Sqcurrent.jpg|thumb|400px|Figure 1. Streamlines of equivalent ionospheric Sq current during equinox (1957 - 1969) at 12 UT separated into primary (a) and secondary (b) part. Between two streamlines flow 20 kA &lt;ref&gt;Malin, S.R.C., Phil Trans. R. Soc., London, Ser. A 274, 551,1973&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;]].
Figure 1a shows current streamlines of an equivalent Sq current as seen from the sun at noon. This current configuration is fixed to the sun, while the earth rotates beneath it. A total current of about 140 kA flows within one daytime vortex. The rotating Sq current and the electrically conducting earth interior behave like  a huge  transformer with the dynamo region as the primary winding and the earth as the secondary winding. Since the Sq current varies with the basic period of one day, electric currents are induced within the earth's interior. The magnetic field of this secondary current is superimposed on the magnetic field of the primary Sq current. Methods to separate  both components go back to [[Gauss]]. The amplitude of the secondary current is about 1/3 of that of the  primary current and slightly shifted in  phase. Figure 1b shows that secondary component. The ratio between sheet current and magnetic component given above has now simply the value one.

The Sq current depends on season. The summer [[vortex]] is intensified compared with the winter vortex and reaches into the winter hemisphere. A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which is related to  the inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., at all., J. Geophys. Res., Space Physics, 113, 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 11-year [[solar cycle]], the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric [[E-layer]] diminishes much more strongly than that of the [[F-layer]]. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Matsushita, S., and W.H. Campell, W.H. (eds.), "Physics of Geomagnetic Phenomena", Vol. I and II, Academic Press, New York,1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The main driver of the Sq current is the external (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height,&lt;ref&gt;Kato, S., J. Geophys. Res., 71, 3211, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., J. Geophys.Res. 87, 5222, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by  180°. This appears to be the result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity  
.&lt;ref name=VollandAE&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; 
The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity.  
 
Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150&amp;nbsp;km from the equator
.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; Such enhancement of the Sq current  by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. 
During a [[solar flare]], bursts of [[solar radiation]] from the environment of an active  sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase  occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.DF., and S.V. Venkatesmaran, J. Geophys. Res., 81, 139,1971&lt;/ref&gt; During  a [[solar eclipse]], the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C.U., J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 25,529,1963&lt;/ref&gt; It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity.
 
In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi 
anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, M., and A.D. Richmond, J. Geophys. Res., 85, 1669, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaka, K,.Z., et all., Ann. Geophys., 27, 3523, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This current system is called Ddyn.

====Theory====
[[File:Sqblockdiagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Blockdiagram illustrating coupling between the horizontal wind '''U''' and pressure p via the Ampere force '''j'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Here '''j''' is the electric current density, '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; the geomagnetic field, h the equivalent depth, σ the electric conductivity, and '''E''' the electric polarization field. In a self-consistent treatment of the coupled system, gate B must be closed. In conventional dynamo theories, gate B is open.]]
In order to determine quantitatively the dynamo action of the neutral wind '''U''', one starts with the horizontal momentum equation of the wind together with  an equation for the divergence of the wind. The momentum equation balances the inertial force, the Coriolis force, and the horizontal gradient of pressure p.&amp;nbsp;In addition, the Ampere force '''J'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; couples the electric  current density '''j''' to the wind and pressure system. The equivalent depth h (the eigenvalue of the tidal mode) determines the divergence of the wind. The electric current must obey [[Ohm]]'s law. An electric polarization field  '''E''' is generated by charge separation to enforce the condition of no sources and sinks of the current. Feedback between wind and electric current occurs via the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''. Usually, the  electric conductivity tensor '''σ''' is considered as a given data set, and a height integrated conductivity tensor '''Σ'''  and a height integrated sheet current  '''J''' are applied.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.D., Geomagn. and Geoelectr. 31, 287,1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In conventional models, the Ampere force is neglected. This means that gate B in Figure 2 is open. This is called a kinematic dynamo. Models with closed gate B are called  hydromagnetic dynamos. The influence of the mutual coupling between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity σ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value. Charge separation acts like a self-impedance preventing the current to become infinitely large.&lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

===L-Current===
Lunar (L) currents are weaker by a factor of about 20 than the Sq currents. The dominant wind component to drive these currents is the (2, 2) tidal mode. The L current is similar in shape as the Sq current, with the difference that four vortices instead of two exit. In each vortex a total current of about 4 kA flows. The seasonal variation of L is similar to that of Sq. During sunlit hours, L is strongly enhanced, while it approaches zero during the night. Thus, the L current exhibits, in addition, a  modulation depending on the lunar phase.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; The geomagnetic effect of the L-current can best been seen near the dip equator where the [[Cowling]] conductivity strongly enhances that current.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt;

===DP1-Current===
Interaction between [[solar wind]] plasma and the polar [[geomagnetic field]] produces a global-scale [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] directed from dawn to dusk  with a potential difference of  about 15 kV during quiet magnetospheric conditions, increasing substantially during disturbed conditions. Charge separation takes place at the [[magnetopause]]. This area is connected with the ionospheric dynamo region via the first open geomagnetic field lines with one footpoint within the auroral regions. Thus, electric discharging currents can flow via field-aligned currents as two small bands within the auroral zone dynamo layer, on the daytime as well as on the nighttime hemisphere. These currents are called DP1 current or auroral electrojets. Their magnitudes  are of the order of Mega Amperes.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt; Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating of these currents is comparable with that due to the solar XUV heat input within middle and lower latitudes during quiet conditions and much larger during disturbed conditions. Therefore, it dominates ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics and causes [[ionospheric]] and thermospheric storms &lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G.W., in  Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. II, p.195, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G. W., Surv. Geophys. 32, 101, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===DP2-Current===
The [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] drives a two cell current within the polar cup  with their vortices situated on the morning and on the evening side. It is called DP2 current. That current exists already during quiet conditions  (S&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;) and becomes enhances during disturbed conditions. It is mainly composed of electric  Hall currents.&lt;ref name= ChapmanBartels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishida, A., and S. Kokubun, Rev. Geophys. Space Sci., 9, 417,1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar-Ring Current===
If the azimuthal  component of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]]  (IMF) is directed toward dusk, the magnetospheric plasma is slowed down in the northern polar cap and accelerated in the southern polar cap. If the azimuthal component of the IMF is directed toward dawn, the situation is reversed. This devitation from co-rotation disappears at lower latitudes. The magnetic effect on the ground within the polar regions corresponds to an ionospheric Hall current at about 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; polar distance encircling the magnetic poles in a clockwise direction as seen by an observer standing on the ground during interplanetatry sectors with fields pointing away from the sun, and in a counterclockwise direction during toward-sector polarity &lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

Apart from his musical endeavours, Novoselic has been active politically, including the creation of the [[political action committee]] JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/politics/career.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2010 he wrote a weekly column on music and politics for ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'s'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|title=Reverb – "Krist Novoselic" Archives – Seattle Weekly|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006203927/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|archivedate=October 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 Novoselic has been board chair of the [[electoral reform]] organization [[FairVote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/tags/author_krist_novoselic|title=Author krist novoselic at FairVote|last=FairVote.org|website=FairVote|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Krist Anthony Novoselic was born on May 16, 1965 to [[Croats|Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/krist-novoselic-ne-vjeruje-bushu/114008.aspx|title=Krist Novoselic ne vjeruje Bushu|publisher=index|work=index.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tportal.hr/showtime/glazba/24409/Nirvanin-basist-hrvatskog-porijekla-duboko-u-politici.html|title=Nirvanin basist hrvatskog porijekla duboko u politici|publisher=tportal|work=tportal.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zadarskilist.hr/clanci/17042010/novaselici-nismo-ni-sanjali-da-ce-nam-sin-postati-rock-zvijezda|title=Novaselići: Nismo ni sanjali da će nam sin postati rock zvijezda!|publisher=[[Zadarski list]]|work=zadarskilist.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; immigrant parents, Kristo and Maria, in [[Compton, California]]. He lived there for one year before his parents moved to the ethnically Croatian [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/audio/interviews/mp3/media/krist2.mp3 Interview with Krist Novoselic – Audio file]&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained for most of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humoropedia.com/krist-novoselic/|title=5 Unreal Facts About Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic You’D Never Believe|work=Humoropedia|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic has a younger brother Robert, born in 1968, and a younger sister, Diana, born in 1973. In 1979, his family relocated to [[Aberdeen, Washington]] as a result of surging real estate costs in California. In 1980, his parents sent him to live with relatives in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Younger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/younger.php|title=Novoselic Dedication Page|publisher=novoselic.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic returned to Aberdeen in 1981. His earliest memories of listening to music was listening to [[Chuck Berry]] with his father. Growing up, he had a "severe" [[Malocclusion|underbite]], for which underwent corrective surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kristnovoselicescalators.tumblr.com/post/142188663820/novoselic-91-i-had-started-reading-michael|title=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic — Novoselic ‘91 I had started reading Michael...|website=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pavitt commodore.jpg|thumb|Novoselic with Kathleen Hanna, Bruce Pavitt and Dylan Carlson, Paramount Theater, Seattle, October 31st, 1991]]
Novoselic was already interested in [[Hard rock|hard rock bands]] such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Who]], [[Van Halen]], [[Devo]] and [[Aerosmith]]. He also enjoyed listening to Yugoslavian bands such as [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Prljavo kazalište]] and [[Azra]]. While in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], he picked up an interest in [[punk rock]], and discovered bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Ramones]] when he lived in Croatia at the age of 14 for one year.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/krist-novoselic/110291/biography|title=Krist Novoselic Biography – AOL Music|publisher=Music.aol.com|date=May 16, 1965|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goalweb.com/nirvana2/101_random_facts.htm|title=101 Random Facts|website=www.goalweb.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has cited [[Paul McCartney]], [[Geezer Butler]], [[John Entwistle]], and [[Gene Simmons]] as the fundamental influences of his bass playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Krist Novoselic: My Favorite Bass Players (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824080836/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|archivedate=August 24, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Novoselic's brother Robert introduced him to his friend [[Kurt Cobain]], who had noticed loud music coming from upstairs. Robert told Cobain that it was his older brother, who listened to [[punk rock]]. Cobain eventually befriended the older Novoselic, as the pair ended up sharing similar musical tastes, including a fondness for local band [[Melvins]]. The two had several mutual friends and began hanging out shortly thereafter. Krist attended [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]] and Kurt attended Montesano High School (Washington). At one point, Cobain gave Novoselic a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] of his former band [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]], and asked him to form a band together. After several months, Novoselic finally listened to the tape, liked it, and agreed to start a band with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/nirvana/biography|title=Nirvana Biography|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Novoselic worked as a [[House painter and decorator|painter and decorator]] and was eventually laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wattpad.com/301062129-nirvana-facts-krist-novoselic|title=Nirvana FACTS - Krist Novoselic  - Wattpad|website=www.wattpad.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nirvana (1987–1994) ===

{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
	 
Cobain and Novoselic's first band lasted barely a few weeks before it disbanded, leaving the pair to move on. However, the duo eventually discovered that Melvins could pull $80 a night for one show. Inspired, Cobain and Novoselic started a [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] [[cover band]], in which Cobain played [[Drum kit|drums]] and Novoselic sang and played [[guitar]]. That band was short-lived as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|title=Come as You are: The Story of Nirvana|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday|year=1993|isbn=0-385-47199-8|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later, Cobain and Novoselic met drummer [[Aaron Burckhard]]. While the new band never used the name, it was the first incarnation of Nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1987.php|title=Nirvana Live Guide - 1987|website=www.nirvanaguide.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Burckhard lasted only a few months and Melvins' drummer [[Dale Crover]] filled in until Novoselic and Cobain met [[Chad Channing]]. The trio recorded their debut [[album]] ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.subpop.com/releases/nirvana/bleach_deluxe_edition|title=Bleach: Deluxe Edition|last=Records|first=Sub Pop|website=Sub Pop Records|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing left the band in 1990 and was briefly replaced by Crover and [[Mudhoney]] drummer [[Dan Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternativenation.net/surprising-drummer-reveals-missed-joining-nirvana-twice/|title=Surprising Drummer Reveals How He Missed Out On Joining Nirvana Twice|last=Buchanan|first=Brett|date=2018-01-13|work=AlternativeNation.net|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/nirvana-chad-channing-no-regrets/|title=Chad Channing Recalls His Time in Nirvana Without Regrets|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic contributed to song writing of various songs, helping out Cobain, such as giving ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselic-on-kurts-writing-process-and-the-in-utero-aesthetic-20131003|title=Krist Novoselic on Kurt Cobain's Writing Process|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1990, Melvins' singer-guitarist [[Buzz Osborne]] encouraged Novoselic and Cobain to check out a punk band called [[Scream (band)|Scream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-scream-mn0001287850|title=The Scream {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were impressed by their drummer, [[Dave Grohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/03/dave-grohls-first-band-scream-to-reissue-1988-album-no-more-censorship/|title=Dave Grohl’s first band, Scream, to reissue 1988 album No More Censorship|date=2018-03-29|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Scream disbanded, and Grohl placed a call to Osborne for advice. Osborne gave him Novoselic's phone number, and Novoselic invited Grohl up to Seattle (from [[San Francisco]], where Scream broke up). Grohl passed the audition and joined Nirvana. Grohl was Nirvana's fifth and final [[drummer]]. This was after the first few recordings of songs from their ''Bleach'' Album. Novoselic spent the following months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hardrock.com/rpm/nirvana-signs-to-a-major-or-how-kim-gordon-saved-the-world/|title=NIRVANA SIGNS TO A MAJOR (or how Kim Gordon saved the world)|work=Hard Rock presents Revolutions Per Minute|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] to record ''[[Nevermind]].'' Novoselic helped write the song "[[Polly (Nirvana song)|Polly]]". Upon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/09/howling-in-the-abyss-the-improbable-success-of-nirvanas-nevermind/|title=Howling in the Abyss: The Improbable Success of Nirvana's 'Nevermind'|date=2016-09-23|work=Observer|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=2016-09-24|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Nevermind]]'' had launched the band as a worldwide phenomenon with their hit single "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/nirvana-debuted-smells-like-teen-spirit-22-years-ago-tonight-20130417|title=Watch Nirvana Debut 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' Live in 1991|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, at the [[MTV Music Awards|MTV music awards show]], Nirvana would win awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist in a Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]] for "Smells Like Teen Spirit." At the show, Nirvana performed "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]". When Novoselic started playing the opening bass riff, he signaled that he could not hear his bass. Instead of continuing to play, Novoselic threw his bass guitar in the air, to perform a "Bass Toss". He failed to catch it, later stating that he misjudged the height; he further stated that he "faked like he was knocked out." Musician [[Brian May]] ran to give him medical attention; he did not suffer any injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/10/nirvanas-eight-most-rock-n-roll-moments.html|title=Paste Magazine|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/nirvana-181-1336070|title=Nirvana bassist reveals Brian May helped him after bass-throwing injury - NME|date=2008-11-20|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvanas-novoselic-relives-failed-1992-vma-bass-toss-20081120|title=Nirvana's Novoselic Relives Failed 1992 VMA Bass Toss|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Novoselic and the rest of Nirvana recorded a [[compilation album]] named ''[[Incesticide]]''. Novoselic helped write lyrics for the songs "[[Dive (Nirvana song)|Dive]]", "[[Hairspray Queen]]", and "[[Incesticide|Aneurysm]]" on the album. This album was produced by a joint venture between [[DGC Records|DGC]] and [[Sub Pop|Sup Pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/incesticide-19930121|title=Review: Nirvana's 'Incesticide' Delivers Emotional Honesty|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|Novoselic (left) playing bass alongside singer Cobain (right) in 1992.]]
During Nirvana's 1992 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading]] concert, Novoselic sang "The Money Will Roll Right In" with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livenirvana.com/digitalnirvana/songguide/bodyd9ac.html?songid=179|title=The Money Will Roll Right In|website=www.livenirvana.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic was an occasional [[vocalist]] and [[backing vocalist]] in Nirvana, occasionally singing "[[Scoff (song)|Scoff]]" and "[[Rape Me]]" at live shows. Novoselic stated that "I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/adrift/articles/guitar.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1993, Nirvana worked on their third album [[In Utero (album)|''In Utero'']], it debuted at number one on the [[billboard 200]] in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nirvana/chart-history/billboard-200/song/177363|title=Nirvana In Utero Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recording sessions mixed by [[Steve Albini]] were criticized by the band members, saying some songs "didn't sound perfect" as well as the Novoselic and the rest of the band agreeing that Novoselic's bass lines sounded "too low". ''In Utero'' sold 3.5 million copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5b8c/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Nirvana - In Utero|last=Stack|first=Eamonn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/in-utero-19930916|title=In Utero|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, Nirvana performed on [[MTV Unplugged]] with [[Lori Goldston]] playing [[cello]], the introduction of guitarist [[Pat Smear]], and Novoselic playing acoustic bass guitar, accordion, and acoustic rhythm guitar. This live performance was released a year later as an album, named ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]],'' which earned a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|best alternative music performance.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-nineties-20110427/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-20110517|title=100 Best Albums of the '90s|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-album-anniversary/|title=23 Years Ago: 'Nirvana: MTV Unplugged in New York' Released|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/deep-10-nirvanas-mtv-unplugged-new-york|title=Deep 10: Nirvana's MTV Unplugged In New York|date=2016-11-03|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana ended abruptly in April 1994 following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/krist-novoselic-kurt-cobain-clear-mind-wouldnt-have-killed-himself/|title=Krist Novoselic Discusses Kurt Cobain's Suicide|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the rest of that year, Novoselic retreated from the spotlight. One of a few public appearances came that September at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, where the video for Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" was awarded for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1994/mtvvmas.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 1994 MTV Video Music Awards|website=www.rockonthenet.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Cobain.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several songs, including "Exhausted", "[[Big Me]]", "[[February Stars]]", and "Butterflies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2013/09/09/220657501/dave-grohl-and-krist-novoselic-share-memories-unreleased-tracks-from-in-utero|title=Dave Grohl And Krist Novoselic Share Memories, Unreleased Tracks From 'In Utero'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived. The song "[[You Know You're Right]]" was the band's final studio recording. The band had split up following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Kurt's death]], with both members going their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/features/krist-novoselic-on-nirvanas-rise-traumatic-end-and-his-future-with-giants-in-the-trees/|title=Krist Novoselic On Nirvana's Rise, Traumatic End And His Future With Giants In The Trees — Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic and Grohl continued to support the Nirvana franchise. Novoselic worked on completing the ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' [[box set]] and ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]'' album, as well as pushing for release of a [[Nevermind|20th anniversary album for ''Nevermind'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/discography.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Nirvana (1995–present) ===
After Cobain's death, Novoselic continued to dabble in musical endeavors. He co-formed the band [[Sweet 75]] with Seattle musician Yva Las Vegass in 1995, releasing a single [[Sweet 75 (album)|self-titled album]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselics-ecelctic-new-sound-19970911|title=Krist Novoselic’s Ecelctic New Sound|last=Stone|first=Rolling|date=1997-09-11|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/sweet75/info.html|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com -|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Novoselic joined singer [[Johnny Cash]], guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] of [[Soundgarden]] and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] of [[Alice in Chains]] to record a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Red Headed Stranger|Time of the Preacher]]", for the tribute album ''Twisted Willie'', released in January 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-27/entertainment/ca-29172_1_willie-nelson |title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP : 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=January 27, 1996 |website=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Novoselic directed his first movie, ''[[L7 (band)|L7]]: [[The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum|The Beauty Process]]'', a [[pseudo-documentary]] that utilizes [[concert]] footage taped in 1997 in three American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://clatsopnews.com/2017/09/28/kris-novoselic/|title=Krist Novoselic: Famous Rock Star Lives Among Us - ClatsopNews|last=Publisher|first=ClatsopNews|date=2017-09-28|work=ClatsopNews|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/l7.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|title=L7: The Beauty Process|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213788/|others=Bryan Lee Brown, Suzi Gardner, Gail Greenwood|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he joined [[Jello Biafra]] and [[Soundgarden]] guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] in the [[No WTO Combo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/569932/correction-novoselic-biafra-were-in-no-wto-combo/|title=CORRECTION: Novoselic, Biafra Were In No-WTO Combo|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alternativetentacles.com/artists/no-wto-combo/|title=Alternative Tentacles Records|date=2018-01-19|work=Alternative Tentacles Records|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Krist Novoselic, 2007.jpg|thumb|Novoselic in 2007.]]
In 2002, Novoselic performed uncredited background [[vocals]] on Foo Fighters' song "Walking a Line", written as a tribute to Cobain, during the ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'' album sessions. The track is included on the ''One by One'' bonus [[DVD]], as well as being a bonus track to the album. He then joined former [[Meat Puppets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themeatpuppets.com/|title=Meat Puppets|website=www.themeatpuppets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; front man [[Curt Kirkwood]] and former [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] drummer [[Bud Gaugh]] to form [[Eyes Adrift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], there was another group called "Eyes Adrift", and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album "Bud, Curt &amp; Krist" in this nation. Eyes adrift released a self-titled album with twelve songs, with the [[Japan]]ese version including two extras. Eyes Adrift was the first official release in Krist's career where he sang [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], singing lead on "Inquiring Minds", "Dottie Dawn &amp; Julie Jewel" and "Pasted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-251464/|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|date=2002-08-27|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a single named ''Alaska''.

Following the end of Eyes Adrift, Novoselic announced that he was quitting the music business, noting that he disliked the process of building up publicity for new records. However, in recent years, Novoselic has occasionally worked on music for a possible solo album, noting, "Right now, I'm just doing it for myself, and that's what it's all about."&lt;ref&gt;Jasmin, Earnest.

In 2009, Novoselic played a newspaper vendor in the movie ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]]. In October 2010, [[Dave Grohl]], former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bandmate of Novoselic, announced live on [[BBC]] [[radio]], that Novoselic would be joining [[Foo Fighters]] as a bassist and accordionist on their next album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', which was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/952506/foo-fighters-return-dave-grohl-recruits-krist-novoselic |title=Foo Fighters Return, Dave Grohl Recruits Krist Novoselic |work=Billboard  |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic's first experience with [[Foo Fighters]] was participating in the encore of their show on August 29, 1997 at [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium]] as part of the [[Bumbershoot]] [[festival]], where he played bass for the band's covers of "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]" and "[[Communication Breakdown]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bendersky|first=Ari|title=Semi-Nirvana Reunion at Bumbershoot|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 5, 1997|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/semi-nirvana-reunion-at-bumbershoot-19970905}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Novoselic performed [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] for a non-album track titled "Walking a Line", later released on a special edition of the band's album ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-bassist-krist-novoselic-secretive-musical-project-dave-grohl/|title=Nirvana Bassist Krist Novoselic Talks About Secretive Musical Project With Dave Grohl|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the [[encore]] of Foo Fighters' secret show at Paladino's in [[Tarzana, California]] on December 22, 2010, the band, with Grohl on drums was joined onstage by Novoselic and the band's live guitarist [[Pat Smear]] for a version of Nirvana's "[[Marigold (song)|Marigold]]" a 1992 Grohl original, which was a [[B-side]] on Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]", the first single from ''In Utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=Foo Fighters Secret Show Becomes Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=December 22, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/12/22/foo-fighters-secret-show-becomes-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic also recorded bass and accordion on the song "[[I Should Have Known (Foo Fighters song)|I Should Have Known]]", appearing on Foo Fighters' seventh studio album called ''[[Wasting Light]]'', released on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=New Foo Fighters Album Will Be a Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/10/28/new-foo-fighters-album-will-be-a-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2017, Novoselic joined Foo Fighters on stage at [[Matthew Knight Arena]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], to play bass guitar on "[[Big Me]]", a song off Foo Fighters debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-surviving-nirvana-members-reunite-at-foo-fighters-show-w513601|title=See Surviving Nirvana Members Reunite at Foo Fighters Show|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten months later, on October 6, 2018, Novoselic joined the band during an encore to play several Nirvana songs, with Dave Grohl on drums, Pat Smear on guitar, and Joan Jett filling in as their lead singer.

== Political and social activism ==
[[File:Krist Novoselic 15A.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Novoselic in 2008]]
Novoselic has had an interest in politics from high school. This included the [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] conflict between [[Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=garyalexw|title=Nirvana in Belfast - MTV News|date=2012-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyVYQvQPk|accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nirvana/1992/kings-hall-belfast-northern-ireland-63d67e4f.html|title=Nirvana Setlist at King's Hall, Belfast|website=setlist.fm|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state legislature attempted to pass a [[Bill (law)|bill]] called the Erotic Music Law. The [[law]] would allow courts to declare certain albums "erotic" by their content, and would make it illegal to sell those albums to those under the age of 18. A lobbying group called the Washington Music Industry Coalition formed as a response to the bill. Novoselic and Nirvana actively [[Campaigner|campaigned]] against the bill and performed a benefit concert for the [[Advocacy group|lobbying group]] in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/nirvana-bassist-turns-politician|title=Nirvana Bassist Turns Politician|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krist appeared on [[ABC Studios|ABC]] [[KOMO-TV]]{{'}}s "Town Meeting" in March 1992 arguing his points and expressing his views with two opposing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RareNirvana|title=Krist Novoselic on Komo TV's "Town Meeting" Show in 1992|date=2015-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDrog9H-Yd0|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Erotic Music Law was reintroduced to the [[Washington State Legislature]] as the Matters Harmful to Minors bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/senator-krist-19960208|title=Senator Krist: An Interview With Krist Novoselic|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the music industry had serious clout in Seattle given the success of the scene, Novoselic proposed creating a [[political action committee]], which was named JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/then-now-krist-novoselic-musician-1.608822|title=Then &amp; now Krist Novoselic, musician|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years, JAMPAC fought a number of different issues, including the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]], a 1985 law that strictly limited the ability of minors to attend shows. With JAMPAC, Novoselic began to turn his focus more and more towards politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2011/05/icons-of-rock-krist-novoselic/|title=Icons Of Rock: Krist Novoselic|date=2011-05-01|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic remains active in politics making appearances to advocate [[electoral reform]] (especially [[instant-runoff voting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-ic.galegroup.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/ic/ovic/MagazinesDetailsPage/MagazinesDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Magazines&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA126653168&amp;mode=view|title=Krist Novoselic: Smells Like Governance|author=Katherine Turman|publisher=Opposing Viewpoints|date=January–February 2005|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[proportional representation]]) and running the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fixour.us/|title=Wahkiakum Democrats Precinct Caucus|publisher=Fixour.us|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered a 2004 run for [[Lieutenant governor|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]], challenging an incumbent of the same party, but ultimately decided against it. He also joined the board of [[FairVote]], then the Center for Voting and Democracy, and was appointed chair in January 2008.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kornelis|first=Chris|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/blogs/dailyweekly/2007/11/smells_like_a_new_blogger_kris.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Smells Like a New Blogger: Krist Novoselic (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Seattle Weekly|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907194917/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/blogs/dailyweekly/2007/11/smells_like_a_new_blogger_kris.php|archivedate=September 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic's first book, ''[[Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy]]'', was published in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/books/chapters/of-grunge-and-government.html|title='Of Grunge and Government'|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/topic/of-grunge-and-government-let-s-fix-this-broken-democracy|title=Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers Novoselic's musical past, including Nirvana's rise to a worldwide phenomenon of the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-267813870.html|title= Recalling the spirit of '91 |work=The New Zealand Herald | date=September 24, 2011| publisher=highbeam.com|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers his interest in politics, his support of electoral reform, and his belief in the need to return to grassroots movements and clean up politics overall.

He supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |title=Barack Obama For President |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130232930/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php/ |title=Presidential Pick-A-Problem Primary |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102131705/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php |archivedate=November 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since broken with the Democratic Party, partly because "it's a top-down structure" adverse to reform from its grassroots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic?%20Run%20blog))|title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on Punk, FairVote, Dumping the Dems, &amp;amp; Why the GOP Should Embrace Anarchy|date=June 19, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, he made a donation to [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/krist-novoselic.asp?cycle=08|title=Krist Novoselic - $1,570 in Political Contributions for 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Grange is not actually a political party. He was running in order to protest Washington state's system, in which a candidate can claim any party as their own (real or fictional) without consent or support from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Times|url=http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/olympia/2009/jun/04/former-nirvana-bassist-krist-novoselic-running-wahkiakum-county-clerk/|title=The Spokesman Review, Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic running for Wahkiakum County clerk… .

[[File:KristNovoselicpodium.jpg|thumb|Novoselic giving a speech during his political career.]]
Novoselic continues to support political reform, even looking at [[social network]]s such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as major factors in shaping the political future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2013011568_novoselic27web.html|title=Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic sees political potential in social networks|author=Carla Meyer|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|date=September 27, 2010|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his support for [[Voting|fair voting]] reforms on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Washington Journal]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/309013-5|title=Krist Novoselic on Electoral Reforms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason TV]]'', Novoselic was asked how he described his [[Ideology|political views]], and he responded, "I'm an [[anarcho-capitalist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], moderate... I don't know" and continued to say that while his political views couldn't be easily categorized, he finds fault in the political philosophies of both the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic (at 11:30)&lt;/ref&gt; On his [[Twitter]] page, he announced that he had voted for 2016 [[Libertarian]] [[presidential candidate]] [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KristNovoselic/status/594881482914562048|title=Krist Novoselić on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, he supported [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|his political campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic |first=Krist |url=http://kristnovoselic.blogspot.com/2015/08/real-election-reform-enters-2016.html |title=This Is Krist Novoselić: Real Election Reform Enters The 2016 Race |publisher=Kristnovoselic.blogspot.com |date=2015-08-12 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Mediterranean Basin|Altitudinal zonation}}

The climate and ecology of land immediately surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is influenced by several factors. Overall, the land has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The climate induces characteristic [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] vegetation. Plant life immediately near the Mediterranean is in the Mediterranean Floristic region, while mountainous areas further from the sea supports the Sub-Mediterranean Floristic province.

An important factor in the local climate and ecology of the lands in the Mediterranean basin is the elevation: an increase of elevation by {{convert|1000|m|ft}} causes the average air temperature to drop by 5 C/ 9 F and decreases the amount of water that can be held by the atmosphere by 30%. This decrease in temperature and increase in rainfall result in altitudinal zonation, where the land can be divided into [[life zones]] of similar climate and ecology, depending on elevation.

Mediterranean vegetation shows a variety of ecological adaptations to hot and dry summer conditions. As Mediterranean vegetation differ both in species and composition from temperate vegetation, ecologists use special terminology for the Mediterranean altitudinal zonation: 
* Eu-mediterranean belt: 20- 16&amp;nbsp;°C (avg annual temperature)
* Sub-mediterranean belt: 15- 12&amp;nbsp;°C
* Hilly region: 11- 8&amp;nbsp;°C
* Mountainous belt: 7- 4&amp;nbsp;°C
* Alpine belt: 3- 0&amp;nbsp;°C
* Subnival belt: 0- minus 4&amp;nbsp;°C &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Even within the Mediterranean Basin, differences in aridity alter the life zones as a function of elevation. For example, the wetter [[Maritime Alps|Maritime]] and [[Dinaric Alps]] have a ''North-Mediterranean'' zonation pattern, while the southern [[Apennine Mountains]] and the Spanish [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] have a moderate ''Eu-Mediterranean'' zonation pattern. Finally, the drier [[Atlas Mountains]] of Africa and [[Taurus Mountains]] of the Near East have a ''Xero-Mediterranean'' pattern.&lt;ref name="Horvat et al."&gt;{{cite book

==Sierra Nevada of Spain==
The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] of central [[Spain]] is an example of eu-mediterranean zonation arising from moderate aridity. The Sierra Nevada lie in the [[Iberian conifer forests]] ecoregion, which contain conifers above {{convert|1900|m|ft}} elevation, with mixed oak woodland below.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1208|name=Iberian conifer forests|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base of the mountains have a [[continental Mediterranean climate]], which gets progressively cooler as the elevation increases:
* '''[[Continental Mediterranean climate|Thermomediterranean zone]]''' (Lowland); under {{convert|700|m|ft}} elevation. Summers are hot here and winters almost nonexistent. This zone is mostly used for agriculture, but studies say Mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''), Common Juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), (''[[Aristolochia]] baetica'') and Mediterranean Smilax or Common Smilax (''[[Smilax]] aspera'') would normally grow here. Rosemary (''[[Rosmarinus officinalis]]''), Purret (''[[Ulex]] parviflorus'') and Gum Rockrose (''[[Cistus ladanifer]]'') are present on poor soils or after forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* '''Mesomediterranean zone''' (Submontane) {{convert|700|to|1300|m|ft}} elevation. The summers are here still hot but frosts are normal in the winters. In this zone Mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''), wild [[Olive]] (''Olea europaea'') and Mediterranean [[Smilax]] or Common Smilax (''Smilax aspera'') grow. Poor sandy soils have few species with the [[Holm Oak]] (''Quercus ilex''), the Common Junipers, (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), ''Daphne gnidium'' and Etruscan honeysuckle (''[[Lonicera etrusca]]'').
* '''Supramediterranean zone''' (Mid-Montane) {{convert|1300|to|1900|m|ft}} elevation. The summers are here temperate and frosts and snow are frequent in winter. ''Quercus pyrenaica'' predominates, Portuguese Oak ([[Quercus faginea]]) and [[maple]] appear too; these three species make up the [[forest]]. More frequent are the [[Sessile Oak]]s (''Quercus petraea'') between 1,300 and 1,750 m. The Sessile Oaks are dominated by the [[Holm Oak]]s (Quercus ilex) and, depending on soil and altitude, by bushes as [[Common Juniper]] (''Juniperus oxycedrus''), barberry (''Berberis hispanica''), (''[[Daphne]] gnidium''), Butcher's broom (''[[Ruscus aculeatus]]'') and Common Hawthorn (''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'') over basic soils.
* '''Oromediterranean zone''' (Subalpine) {{convert|1900|to|2700|m|ft}} elevation. In this zone, coniferous plants and sparse ''[[Juniperus thurifera]]'' appear. The vegetation is composed by trees and bushes ([[Scots Pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), [[Savin Juniper]] (''Juniperus sabina''), ''[[Juniperus communis]] subsp. hemisphaerica'', ''[[Prunus ramburii]]'') and other bushes (''Vella spinosa'', ''Erinacea anthyllis'', ''Bupleurum spinosum''). On better soils the Common Juniper, ''[[Juniperus communis]]'' and ''[[Cytisus]]'' appears, forming communities with ''Arenaria imbricata'', ''Festuca indigesta''. The endemic flora is present too: ''Genista versicolor'', ''Arenaria pungens'', ''Potentilla nevadensis''.
* '''Cryo-oromediterranean zone''' (Alpine); {{convert|2600|to|2800|m|ft}} elevation. [[Woody plant|Ligneous plants]] can not grow here because of the seasonal dryness typical of the Mediterranean climate and the presence of snow for more than 8 months. The vegetation has similarities to the Arctic [[tundra]], with the Mat-grass (''Nardus stricta'') as the most common species.

=== Climate ===
[[Almería]], near sea level, is an example of a Thermo-mediterranean climate, among the warmest locations on the European continent:

==Early life and development==
Born in [[Castrovirreyna Province|Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna Province, Peru]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Six decades later, world's youngest mother awaits aid |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]] |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ65vfQ8?url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[silversmith]] Tiburelo Medina and Victoria Losea,&lt;ref name="await"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "American scientists await U.S. visit of youngest mother: Peruvian girl and baby will be exhibited", ''San Antonio Light'', 11 July 1939, page 2A.&lt;/ref&gt; she was brought to a hospital by her parents at the age of five years due to increasing abdominal size. She was originally thought to have a [[tumor]], but doctors determined she was in her seventh month of [[pregnancy]]. Dr Gerardo Lozada took Medina to [[Lima]] to have other specialists confirm that she was pregnant.&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Mikkleson |title=Youngest Mother|publisher=Snopes.com|accessdate=25 January 2017 |url=http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/medina.asp |date=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that interest in the case developed on many fronts. The ''San Antonio Light'' newspaper reported in its 16 July, 1939, edition&amp;mdash;in anticipation of the girl's expected visit to U.S. university scientific facilities&amp;mdash;that a national Peruvian obstetrician/midwife association had demanded that the girl be transported to a national maternity hospital; the paper quoted 18 April reports in the Peruvian paper ''La Crónica'' stating that a North American film making concern had sent a representative "with authority to offer the sum of $5,000 to benefit the minor [in exchange for filming rights] ... we know that the offer was rejected."&lt;ref name="sympathy"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "Wide sympathy aroused by plight of child-mother: opportunity seen to make Lina independent," ''San Antonio Light'', 16 July 1939, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same article, reprinted from a Chicago paper, noted that Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them around 21 April while addressing Peru's National Academy of Medicine; on a subsequent visit to Lina's remote hometown, some of the baggage carrying the films had fallen into the river while crossing "a very primitive bridge ... Enough of his pictorial record remained, however, to intrigue the learned savants."&lt;ref name="sympathy"/&gt;

A month and a half after the original diagnosis, Medina gave birth by [[caesarean section]] to a boy. She was 5 years, 7 months, and 21 days,&lt;ref name=Snopes/&gt; [[List of youngest birth mothers|the youngest known person in history to give birth]]. The caesarean birth was necessitated by her small [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The surgery was performed by Lozada and Dr Busalleu, with Dr Colareta providing [[anaesthesia]]. When doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs from [[precocious puberty]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Her case was reported in detail by Dr. Edmundo Escomel in the medical journal ''La Presse Médicale'', including the additional details that her [[menarche]] had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to a past report stating that she had been having regular periods since she was three years old&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|year=1988|author1=Janice Delaney|author2=Mary Jane Lupton|author3=Emily Toth|isbn=0252014529|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njfQfrMr31EC&amp;q=Lina+Medina#v=snippet&amp;q=Lina%20Medina&amp;f=false|edition=2nd (revised)|publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodney P. Shearman|title=Clinical reproductive endocrinology|year=1985|publisher=[[Churchill Livingstone]]|isbn=0443026459|page=401|quote=In a number of instances, precocious pregnancies at a very early age have been reported. The striking example is that of Lina Medina, who had a Caesarean section when 5 ½ years old, but there have been other pregnancies in children aged 6, 7, 8 and 9 years (Sickel, 1946).}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2½ according to a different article).&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; 

Medina's son weighed {{convert|2.7|kg|lb st|abbr=on}} at birth and was named Gerardo after her doctor. Gerardo was raised believing that Medina was his sister, but found out at the age of 10 that she was, in fact, his mother.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

==Identity of the father and later life==
Medina has never revealed the father of the child nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Escomel suggested she might not actually know herself by writing that Medina "couldn't give precise responses".&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt; Although Lina's father was arrested on suspicion of [[child sexual abuse]], he was later released due to lack of evidence, and the biological father was never identified.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="littlemother"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |title=Little Mother |date=16 December 1957 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ7D1EHq?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C893791%2C00.html |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son grew up healthy. He died in 1979 at the age of 40.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

In young adulthood, Medina worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, who gave her an education and helped put her son through high school.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt; Medina later married Raúl Jurado, who fathered her second son in 1972. {{As of|2002}}, they lived in a poor district of Lima known as "Chicago Chico".&lt;ref name="Dietz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Dietz|title=Urban Poverty, Political Participation, and the State: Lima, 1970–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf0NQ3Eut2IC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=lima+chicago+chico|date=15 July 1998|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-7193-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; She refused an interview with [[Reuters]] that year,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; just as she had turned away many reporters in years past.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;

==Documentation==
Although it was speculated that the case was a [[hoax]], a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on [[biopsies]], [[X rays]] of the fetal skeleton ''[[in utero]]'', and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medico-Physical"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of Medical-physical Research: A Journal of Progressive Medicine and Physical Therapies, Volumes 15-16|year=1941|publisher=American Association for Medico-Physical Research|page=188|quote=Lina Medina... Dear Dr. Eales: 'We are pleased to give you permission to publish the story of Lina Medina' ...  An x-ray examination revealed a foetal skeleton and left no doubt as to a positive uterine gestation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montagu"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ashley Montagu|title=The reproductive development of the female: a study in the comparative physiology of the adolescent organism|year=1979|publisher=PSG Publishing Company|isbn=0884162184|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven-and-a-half months into pregnancy. Taken from Medina's left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. This is the only published photograph of Lina taken during her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/?cote=100000x1939xartorig&amp;p=878&amp;do=page "La Presse médicale",  47(43): 875, 1939] "La Plus Jeune Mère du Monde".  (31 May 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, except for the effects of precocious puberty,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; there was no explanation of how a five-year-old girl could conceive a child.&lt;ref name="leon"&gt;{{cite news|author=Luis Leon|agency= Associated Press|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/iowa/cedar-rapids/cedar-rapids-gazette/1955/10-30/page-18|title=Son of child mother wants to be doctor|work=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=30 October 1955|page=18|via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme precocious pregnancy in children aged five or under has only been documented with Medina.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearman"/&gt;

A '''lithosphere''' ({{lang-grc|λίθος}} [''lithos''] for "rocky", and {{lang|grc|σφαίρα}} [''sphaira''] for "sphere") is the rigid,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.J. &amp; Porter, S.C.: ''Physical Geology'', page 17, chapt. ''The Earth: Inside and Out'', 1987, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-05668-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; outermost shell of a [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial-type planet]], or [[natural satellite]], that is defined by its rigid mechanical properties. On [[Earth]], it is composed of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the portion of the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that behaves elastically on time scales of thousands of years or greater. The outermost shell of a rocky planet, the crust, is defined on the basis of its chemistry and mineralogy.

The study of past and current formations of landscapes is called [[geomorphology]].

== Earth's lithosphere ==

Earth's lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitute the hard and rigid outer layer of the Earth. The lithosphere is subdivided into [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. The uppermost part of the lithosphere that chemically reacts to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]] and [[biosphere]] through the [[Pedogenesis|soil forming process]] is called the [[pedosphere]]. The lithosphere is underlain by the [[asthenosphere]] which is the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle. The [[Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary]] is defined by a difference in response to stress: the lithosphere remains rigid for very long periods of geologic time in which it deforms elastically and through brittle failure, while the asthenosphere deforms viscously and accommodates strain through plastic deformation.

=== History of the concept ===
The concept of the lithosphere as Earth’s strong outer layer was described by [[Augustus Edward Hough Love|A.E.H. Love]] in his 1911 monograph "Some problems of Geodynamics" and further developed by [[Joseph Barrell]], who wrote a series of papers about the concept and introduced the term "lithosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30056401|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages= 289–314|doi=10.1086/622155|issue=4|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..289B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30067162|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages=441–468|doi=10.1086/622163|issue=5|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..441B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30060774|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages=655–683|doi=10.1086/622181|issue=7|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..655B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30067883|author=Barrell, J|date= 1914 |title=The strength of the Earth's crust|journal= Journal of Geology|volume=22|pages=537–555|doi=10.1086/622170|issue=6|bibcode = 1914JG.....22..537B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was based on the presence of significant gravity anomalies over continental crust, from which he inferred that there must exist a strong, solid upper layer (which he called the lithosphere) above a weaker layer which could flow (which he called the asthenosphere). These ideas were expanded by [[Reginald Aldworth Daly]] in 1940 with his seminal work "Strength and Structure of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Daly, R. (1940) ''Strength and structure of the Earth''. New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been broadly accepted by geologists and geophysicists.  These concepts of a strong lithosphere resting on a weak asthenosphere are essential to the theory of [[plate tectonics]].

=== Types ===
[[File:Subduction-en.svg|left|thumb|400px|Different types of lithosphere]]
There are two types of lithosphere:
* Oceanic lithosphere, which is associated with [[oceanic crust]] and exists in the [[ocean basin]]s (mean density of about 2.9 grams per cubic centimeter)
* Continental  lithosphere, which is associated with [[continental crust]] (mean density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter)

The thickness of the lithosphere is considered to be the depth to the isotherm associated with the transition between brittle and viscous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parsons, B.  |author2=McKenzie, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes|date=1978|title= Mantle Convection and the thermal structure of the plates|journal= Journal of Geophysical Research|url=http://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/~johne/teaching/pdfs/parsons-mckenzie78.pdf|volume=83|issue=B9|page=4485|bibcode = 1978JGR....83.4485P |doi = 10.1029/JB083iB09p04485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature at which [[olivine]] begins to deform viscously (~1000&amp;nbsp;°C) is often used to set this isotherm because olivine is generally the weakest mineral in the upper mantle. Oceanic lithosphere is typically about 50–140&amp;nbsp;km thick &lt;ref name="lithothick"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pasyanos M. E.|date=2008-05-15|title=Lithospheric Thickness Modeled from Long Period Surface Wave Dispersion|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/361453.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;(but beneath the [[mid-ocean ridge]]s is no thicker than the crust), while continental lithosphere has a range in thickness from about 40&amp;nbsp;km to perhaps 280&amp;nbsp;km;&lt;ref name="lithothick" /&gt; the upper ~30 to ~50&amp;nbsp;km of typical continental lithosphere is crust. The mantle part of the lithosphere consists largely of [[peridotite]]. The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the [[Moho discontinuity]].

==== Oceanic lithosphere ====

Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of [[mafic]] crust and [[ultramafic]] mantle (peridotite) and is denser than continental lithosphere, for which the mantle is associated with crust made of [[felsic]] rocks. Oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly thick and dense with age. In fact, oceanic lithosphere is a thermal boundary layer for the [[mantle convection|convection]]&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Turcotte, Gerald Schubert, Geodynamics. Cambridge University Press, 25 mar 2002 - 456&lt;/ref&gt; in the mantle.  The thickness of the mantle part of the oceanic lithosphere can be approximated as a thermal boundary layer that thickens as the square root of time.
::&lt;math&gt; \, h \, \sim \, 2\, \sqrt{ \kappa t } \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the oceanic mantle lithosphere, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal diffusivity (approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s) for silicate rocks, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the age of the given part of the lithosphere. The age is often equal to L/V, where L is the distance from the spreading centre of [[mid-oceanic ridge]], and V is velocity of the lithospheric plate.

Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. This is because the chemically differentiated oceanic crust is lighter than asthenosphere, but [[thermal contraction]] of the mantle lithosphere makes it more dense than the asthenosphere. The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at [[subduction zone]]s, oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. The oldest parts of continental lithosphere underlie [[craton]]s, and the mantle lithosphere there is thicker and less dense than typical; the relatively low density of such mantle "roots of cratons" helps to stabilize these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/274544a0|title=Composition and development of the continental tectosphere|date=1978|last1=Jordan|first1=Thomas H.|journal=Nature|volume=274|issue=5671|pages=544|bibcode = 1978Natur.274..544J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doilithos"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2009.04.028|title=Ultradeep continental roots and their oceanic remnants: A solution to the geochemical "mantle reservoir" problem?|date=2009|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Suzanne Y.|last2=Zhang|first2=Ming|last3=Griffin|first3=William L.|last4=Begg|first4=Graham|last5=Hronsky|first5=Jon|journal=[[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]]|volume=112|pages=1043|bibcode = 2009Litho.112.1043O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subducted lithosphere ====
Geophysical studies in the early 21st century posit that large pieces of the lithosphere have been subducted into the mantle as deep as 2900&amp;nbsp;km to near the core-mantle boundary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.09.015|title=Derivation of Large Igneous Provinces of the past 200 million years from long-term heterogeneities in the deep mantle|date=2004|last1=Burke|first1=Kevin|last2=Torsvik|first2=Trond H.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=227|issue=3–4|pages=531|bibcode = 2004E&amp;PSL.227..531B }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others "float" in the upper mantle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(04)00070-6|title=4-D evolution of SE Asia's mantle from geological reconstructions and seismic tomography|date=2004|last1=Replumaz|first1=Anne|last2=Kárason|first2=Hrafnkell|last3=Van Der Hilst|first3=Rob D|last4=Besse|first4=Jean|last5=Tapponnier|first5=Paul|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=221|pages=103|bibcode = 2004E&amp;PSL.221..103R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2007GC001806|title=A new global model for P wave speed variations in Earth's mantle|date=2008|last1=Li|first1=Chang|last2=Van Der Hilst|first2=Robert D.|last3=Engdahl|first3=E.

== Mantle xenoliths ==

Geoscientists can directly study the nature of the subcontinental mantle by examining mantle [[xenolith]]s&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, P.H. (1987) ''Mantle xenoliths'' J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 844 p. {{ISBN|0-471-91209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought up in [[kimberlite]], [[lamproite]], and other [[volcanic pipe]]s. The histories of these xenoliths have been investigated by many methods, including analyses of abundances of isotopes of [[osmium]] and [[rhenium]]. Such studies have confirmed that mantle lithospheres below some cratons have persisted for periods in excess of 3 billion years, despite the mantle flow that accompanies plate tectonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2004RG000156|url=http://earth.usc.edu/downloads/tjordan/copenhagenreadings/c6-carlsonetalrevgeoph2005.pdf|title=Physical, chemical, and chronological characteristics of continental mantle|date=2005|last1=Carlson|first1=Richard W.|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=43|pages=RG1001|bibcode=2005RvGeo..43.1001C|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122125314/http://earth.usc.edu/downloads/tjordan/copenhagenreadings/c6-carlsonetalrevgeoph2005.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12669">The '''Mechanostat''' is a term describing the way in which mechanical loading influences bone structure by changing the mass (amount of bone) and architecture (its arrangement) to provide a structure that resists habitual loads with an economical amount of material.  As changes in the skeleton are accomplished by the processes of formation ([[bone growth]]) and resorption (bone loss), the mechanostat models the effect of influences on the skeleton by those processes, through their effector cells, osteocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The term was invented by [[Harold Frost]] an orthopaedic surgeon and researcher and described extensively in articles referring to Frost and Webster Jee's ''Utah Paradigm of Skeletal Physiology''&lt;ref name="Frost1"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''Defining Osteopenias and Osteoporoses: Another View (With Insights From a New Paradigm)'', Bone 1997, Vol. 20, No. 5, 385–391, {{PMID|9145234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost2"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''The Utah Paradigm of Skeletal Physiology Vol. 1'', ISMNI, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost3"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''The Utah Paradigm of Skeletal Physiology Vol. 2'', ISMNI, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost4"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''The Utah paradigm of skeletal physiology: an overview of its insights for bone, cartilage and collagenous tissue organs'', J Bone Miner Metab. 2000; 18:305–316, {{PMID|11052462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost5"&gt;Frost H.M., Schoenau E.: ''The muscle-bone unit in children and adolescents: an overview'', 2000, J. Pediatr Endorcrinol Metab 13:571–590, {{PMID|10905381}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s. The Mechanostat is often defined as a practical description of [[Wolff's law]] described by [[Julius Wolff (surgeon)|Julius Wolff]] (1836–1902), but this is not completely accurate.  Wolff wrote his treatises on bone after images of bone sections were described by Culmann and von Meyer, who suggested that the arrangement of the struts (trabeculae) at the ends of the bones were aligned with the stresses experienced by the bone.  It has since been established that the static methods used for those calculations of lines of stress were inappropriate for work on what were in effect curved beams, a finding described by Lance Lanyon, a leading researcher in the area as "a triumph of a good idea over mathematics".  While Wolff pulled together the work of Culmann and von Meyer, it was the French scientist Roux, who first used the term "functional adaptation" to describe the way that the skeleton optimized itself for its function, even though Wolff is credited by many for that. 

According to the Mechanostat, bone growth and bone loss is stimulated by the local mechanical elastic deformation of bone. The reason for the elastic deformation of bone is the peak forces caused by muscles (e.g. measurable using [[mechanography]]). The Adaptation (feed-back [[control loop]]) of bone according to the maximum forces is considered to be a lifelong process. Hence bone adapts its mechanical properties according to the needed mechanical function – bone mass, bone geometry and hence bone [[Strength of materials|strength]] (see also [[Stress-strain index]], SSI) is adapted according to the everyday usage / needs. "maximal force" in this context is a simplification of the real input to bone that initiates adaptive changes.  While the magnitude of a force (the weight of a load for example) is an important determinant of its effect on the skeleton, it is not the only one.  The rate of application of force is also critical.  Slow application of force over several seconds is not experienced by bone cells as a stimulus, but they are sensitive to very rapid application of forces (such as impacts) even of lower magnitude.  High frequency vibration of bone at very low magnitudes is thought to stimulate changes but the research in the area is not completely unequivocal.  It is clear that bones respond better to loading/exercise with gaps between individual events so that two loads separated by 10 seconds of rest are a more potent stimulus than 10 loads within the same 10 second period.   

Due to this control loop, there is a linear relationship in the healthy body between muscle cross sectional area (as a surrogate for typical maximum forces the muscle is able to produce under physiological conditions) and the bone cross sectional area (as a surrogate for bone strength).&lt;ref name="Schoenau2"&gt;Schoenau E., NeuC.M., Beck B., Manz F., Rauch F.: ''Bone Mineral content per Muscle Cross-Sectional Area as an Index of the Functional Muscle-Bone Unit'', J Bone Mineral Res, Vol.17, S.1095–1101, 2002, {{PMID|12054165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schiessl1"&gt;Schießl H., Frost H.M., Jee W.S.S.: ''Estrogen and BoneMuscle Strength and Mass Relationships'', Bone, Vol.22, S.1–6, 1998, {{PMID|9437507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These relations are of immense importance especially for bone loss situations like in [[osteoporosis]], since an adapted training utilizing the needed maximum forces on the bone can be used to stimulate bone growth and hence prevent or help to minimize bone loss. An example for such an efficient training is [[vibration training]] or [[whole body vibration]].

== Modeling and remodeling ==
Frost defined four regions of elastic bone deformation which result in different consequences on the control loop: 
 [[Image:UtahParadigm.jpg|thumb|350px|Mechanostat: Modeling- and Remodeling Thresholds]]
*'''Disuse:'''&lt;br&gt; Strain &lt; circa 800μStrain: Remodeling (bone adaptation and bone repair) Bone mass and bone strength is reduced.
*'''Adapted State:'''&lt;br&gt; strain between ca. 800μStrain and ca. 1500μStrain: Remodeling (bone repair) Bone mass and bone strength stays constant (homeostasis: bone resorption=bone formation)
*'''Overload:'''&lt;br&gt; Strain &gt; circa 1500μStrain: Modeling (bone growth) bone mass and bone strength is increased
*'''Fracture:'''&lt;br&gt; Strain &gt; circa 15000μStrain: maximum elastically deformation exceeded – bone fracture.

According to this a typical bone, e.g. the [[tibia]] has a security margin of about 5 to 7 between typical load (2000 to 3000 μStrain) and fracture load (about 15000μStrain).

The comments above are all one part of the way the skeleton responds to loading, because the different bones of the skeleton have a range of habituial strain environments (encompassing magnitude, rate, frequency rest periods etc) and they are not uniform.  The numbers in the table are theoretical only and may reflect the response of the centre of a long bone under specific circumstances.  Other parts of the same bone and other bones in the same individual experience different loading and adapt to them despite different thresholds between disuse, maintenance and adaptive formation.  Furthermore bone structure is controlled by a complex series of different influences such as calcium status the effects of hormones, age, diet, sex, disease, and pharmaceuticals.  A bone experiencing what would in some circumstances be seen as a stimulus to form more material could either be maintained at a constant level where circulating calcium was low, or the same loading could merely temper the amount of resorption experienced in an old person with a bone wasting disease.   

== Unit: Strain ''E''==
The elastic deformation of bone is measured in ''μStrain''.&lt;ref name="Frost2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost3"/&gt; 1000μStrain = 0.1% change of length of the bone.
*Strain ''E'' at length ''l'' and change of length Δ''l'': &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\Delta l}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

It has to be considered that bone strength is highly dependent on geometry and direction of the acting forces in relation to this geometry. The fracture load for axial forces of the tibia for example is about 50 to 60 times the body weight. The fracture load for forces perpendicular to the axial direction is about 10 times lower.

Different type of bones can have different modelling and remodelling thresholds. The modeling threshold of the tibia is about 1500 μStrain (0.15% change of length), the modelling threshold for parts of the bone of the skull is quite different. Some parts of the skull such as the lower jaw (mandible) experience significant forces and strains during chewing, but the dome of the cranium for example must remain present and strong to protect the brain even if it does not experience what would be seen as stimulating strains.  In one study where the strains were measured in the skull of a live human (Hillam et al J.Biomech2016) it was shown that strains in the skull never exceeded 1/10 of the peak strain in the tibia of the same individual, with similar differences in strain rates.  This suggests that either bones of the skull are very sensitive to extremely low strains, or that the "genetic baseline" amount of bone in the skull in what is effectively disuse is not modified by the effects of loading.  Whether the skulls of boxers are thicker than normal individuals is an intriguing question that has not been answered.
 
Since the physical material properties of bone (as a material) are not altered in the different bone types of the body, this difference in modelling threshold results in an increased bone mass and bone strength and hence in an increased safety factor (relation between fracture load and typical loads) for the skull compared to the tibia. A lower modeling threshold means that the same typical daily forces result in a ‘thicker’ and hence stronger bone at the skull.

==Examples==
Typical examples of the influence of maximum forces and the resulting elastic deformations on bone growth or bone loss are extended flights of [[astronauts]] and [[cosmonauts]] as well as patient with [[paraplegia]] due to an accident.  Extended periods in free fall do not lead to loss of bone from the skull, providing support to the idea that its bone is maintained by a genetic not a mechanical influence.  (Skull bone often increases in long term space flights, something thought to be related to fluid shifts within the body.) 
For example, a patient in a  wheel chair who is using his arms but due to his paraplegia not his legs will suffer massive muscle and bone loss only in his legs due to the lack of usage of the legs. However the muscles and bones of the arms which are used every day will stay the same or might even be increased depending on the usage.&lt;ref name="Eser1"&gt;Eser P. et al.: ''Relationship between duration of paralysis and bone structure: a pQCT Study of spinal cord injured individuals'', Bone, Vol.34, S.869–880, 2004, {{PMID|15121019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same effect can be observed for long flight Astronauts or Cosmonauts.&lt;ref name="Blottner1"&gt;Blottner D., Salanova M., Püttmann B., Schiffl G., Felsenberg D., Buehring B., Rittweger J.: ''Human skeletal muscle structure and function preserved by vibration muscle exercise following 55 days of [[bed rest]]'', Eur J. Appl Physiol, 2006, Vol. 97, S. 261–271, {{DOI|10.1007/s00421-006-0160-6}} {{PMID|16568340}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they still use their arms in an almost normal manner due to the lack of gravity in space there are no maximum forces induced on the bones of the legs.  On earth, long term players of racquet sports experience similar effects, where the dominant arm can have 30% more bone than the other due to the asymmetric applications of force.

Harold Frost applied the Mechanostat model not only to skeletal tissues but also to fibrous collagenous connective tissues, such as ligaments, tendons and fascia.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "New targets for fascial, ligament and tendon research: A perspective from the Utah paradigm of skeletal physiology" J Musculoskel Neuron Interact 2003; 3(3):201–209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "The physiology of cartilagenous, fibrous, and bony tissue. C.C. Thomas, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; He described their adaptational responsiveness to strain in his "stretch-hypertrophy rule": 
:"Intermittent stretch causes collagenous tissues to hypertrophy until the resulting increase in strength reduces elongation in tension to some minimum level".&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "The physiology of cartilagenous, fibrous, and bony tissue. C.C. Thomas, 1972, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similar to the responsiveness of bony tissues this adaptational response occurs only if the mechanical strain exceeds a certain threshold value. Harold Frost proposed that for dense collagenous connective tissues the related threshold value is around 4% strain elongation.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "Does the anterior cruciate have a modeling threshold? A case for the affirmative". J Musculoskel Neuron Interact 2001; 2(2):131–136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amborella trichopoda.jpg|thumb|In the [[Order (biology)|order]] Amborellales, there is only one [[family (biology)|family]], Amborellaceae and there is only one [[genus]], ''Amborella '', and in this genus there is only one species, namely ''[[Amborella trichopoda]]''.]]

[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus wild.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'', the [[hyacinth macaw]], is a monotypic species; no [[subspecies]] have been distinguished within it. However, the genus ''[[Anodorhynchus]]'' does include three species.]]

In [[biology]], a '''monotypic taxon''' is a taxonomic group ([[taxon]]) that contains only one immediately subordinate taxon.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E, Ashlock PD. (1991). ''Principles of Systematic Zoology'' (2nd ed.). McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-041144-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monotypic [[species]] is one that does not include [[subspecies]] or smaller, infraspecific taxa.{{Cn|date=August 2017}} In the case of genera, the term "unispecific" or "monospecific" is sometimes preferred.

In [[botanical nomenclature]], a '''monotypic genus''' is a [[genus (biology)|genus]] in the special case where a genus and a single species are simultaneously described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Reine, W.F.P.h.V. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6}} articles 38.5 and 38.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast an '''oligotypic taxon''' contains more than one but only a very few subordinate taxa.

==Examples==
Just as the term ''monotypic'' is used to describe a taxon including only one subdivision, one can also refer to the contained taxon as monotypic within the higher-level taxon, e.g. a genus monotypic within a family. Some examples of monotypic groups are:
* In the [[Order (biology)|order]] Amborellales, there is only one [[family (biology)|family]], Amborellaceae and there is only one [[genus]], ''[[Amborella]]'', and in this genus there is only one species, namely ''Amborella trichopoda''
* The family [[Cephalotaceae]] includes only one genus, ''[[Cephalotus]]'', and only one species, ''Cephalotus follicularis'' – the [[Albany pitcher plant]].
* ''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'', the [[hyacinth macaw]], is a monotypic species; no [[subspecies]] have been distinguished within the species.
* ''Panurus biarmicus'', the [[bearded reedling]], has a few subspecies across its range, but belongs to the genus ''[[Panurus]]'', which current knowledge considers monotypic (the only genus) within the family [[Panuridae]].
* ''[[Ozichthys albimaculosus]]'', the cream-spotted cardinalfish, found in tropical Australia and southern New Guinea, is the type species of the monotypic genus ''Ozichthys''.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, T. H. (2014). "A new genus of cardinalfish from tropical Australia and southern New Guinea (Percomorpha: Apogonidae)". ''Zootaxa'' 3852 (2): 283–293.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The flowering plant ''Breonadia salicina'' is the only species in the monotypic genus ''[[Breonadia]]''.
* The [[madrone butterfly]] is the only species in the monotypic genus ''Eucheira''. However, there are two sub-species of this butterfly, ''E. socialis socialis'' and ''E. socialis westwoodi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.G.|first=Kevan,|last2=R.A.|first2=Bye,|date=1991|title=natural history, sociobiology, and ethnobiology of Eucheira socialis Westwood (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), a unique and little-known butterfly from Mexico|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301742531|journal=Entomologist|language=English|issn=0013-8878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Genres''' is an [[artistic movement]] begun in the early 20th century.  The movement is marked by many notable artists who work with a variety of media such as [[video art]], [[body art]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[performance]], and [[sound art]].

==Definition==
New Genres art is commonly identified as [[installation art]], [[Video (disambiguation)|video]], [[film]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[Digital media]], [[internet art]],&lt;ref&gt;Duron, Julian. Dot Forum: New Genre Art. Fecalface.com. http://www.fecalface.com/SF/component/content/article/138-dot-forum/1434-dot-forum-new-genre-art. Retrieved 2015-6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybrid genre|hybrid]] and [[emerging art forms]]. New Genres is a practice which begins with ideas and then moves to the appropriate form or media for that particular idea, sometimes inventing entirely new sites of [[cultural production]], new methodologies, technologies, or [[genres]] in the process. New Genres gives emphasis to questioning preconceived notions of the role of art in culture and its relationship to a specific form or [[List of artistic media|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;
University of California, Los Angeles. New Genres Homepage. http://www.art.ucla.edu/newgenres/. Retrieved 2015-6-10.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
While no recognized official date marks the beginning of the New Genre period, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} believe that the early 20th-century work of the [[Dadaists]] and [[Futurists]] initiated this movement.  Their work laid a foundation for the experimental practice of New Genres.  Duchamp's "Fountain" (1917) introduced the idea of the [[readymade]] object: a non-art object which becomes viewed as art due to the intention and designation of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492875/ready-made |title= ready-made (style of art) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new use of [[artistic power]] and questioning of the art object opened up the conceptual sphere of New Genres.  These discoveries illuminated the idea that art was possible outside the field of the classical genres like painting and sculpture.

To understand the movement of New Genres, it is important to look at the events occurring simultaneously in the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the first half of the century, [[World War I]] broke out and caused devastation to much of Eastern Europe.  In America, the [[Great Depression]] caused a major economic crises that affected many parts of the world.  [[World War II]] quickly followed, splitting the world into two alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  This war caused tremendous damage and introduced new tragedies into the world, such as the [[Holocaust]] and the first [[nuclear weapons]].

'''Odyssey Studios''' was a recording studio based near [[Marble Arch]] in London and opened in 1979. It was set up by [[Wayne Bickerton]] as an extension of [[State Records]], the label he had set up with [[Tony Waddington (songwriter)|Tony Waddington]] and John Fruin in 1975. The studio closed in 1989 and the building was subsequently sold to [[102.2 Jazz FM|Jazz FM]].&lt;ref name="Tony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonywaddington.co.uk/tony_v4.swf |title=Tony Waddington |publisher=Tonywaddington.co.uk |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albums recorded at Odyssey==
Through the 1980s, many artists recorded at Odyssey Studios, including [[Cliff Richard]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Kate Bush]], [[George Michael]], [[Spandau Ballet]] and [[Roger Daltrey]].&lt;ref name="Tony"/&gt; Below is a list of some albums recorded either in part or entirely at Odyssey Studios.

==Set-up and equipment==
Studio One in Odyssey was 1,400 square feet and had room for 50 musicians, which meant it could facilitate orchestral recordings and could be used for other activities such as video shoots. Studios 1 and 2 were equipped with MCI consoles and tape machines. Peter Jones (chief engineer) went to Fort Lauderdale, home of MCI, to commission all the equipment. At the time, they were the largest consoles that MCI had produced, and a hole in the factory wall was required to accommodate the extra length of the chassis. The studio was designed by Keith Slaughter and constructed on the "floating" principle to ensure total sound insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E5zzEdWiy4 |title=Odyssey Studios Tour |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio Two, which was a mixing suite with capacity for 8 musicians, had an MCI 6000 48 Channel Desk which offered up to 48 tracks of recording, or the capacity to mixdown. Upstairs there was a radio facility, which offered a studio and separate control room plus a lounge area.

Odyssey was one of the first studios to install a satellite linkup, which effectively turned the studio into a miniature radio station and allowing it to broadcast any session live around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9146">The '''particle horizon''' (also called the '''cosmological horizon''', the '''comoving horizon''' (in Dodelson's text), or the '''cosmic light horizon''') is the maximum distance from which [[Elementary particle|particle]]s could have traveled to the [[observation|observer]] in the [[age of the universe]]. Much like the concept of a [[horizon|terrestrial horizon]], it represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=1 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt; so its distance at the present epoch defines the size of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew R. Liddle|author2=David Hilary Lyth|title=Cosmological inflation and large-scale structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmWauPZSovMC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=13 April 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57598-0|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expansion of the universe it is not simply the [[age of the universe]] times the [[speed of light]] (approximately 13.8 billion light-years), but rather the speed of light times the [[conformal time]]. The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]].

==Conformal time and the particle horizon==
In terms of [[comoving distance]], the particle horizon is equal to the '''conformal time''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; that has passed since the [[Big Bang]], times the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. In general, the conformal time at a certain time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{a(t')},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], and we have taken the Big Bang to be at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. By convention, a subscript 0 indicates "today" so that the conformal time today &lt;math&gt;\eta(t_0) = \eta_0 = 1.48 \times 10^{18}\text{ s}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the conformal time is not the [[age of the universe]]. Rather, the conformal time is the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from where we are located to the furthest observable distance provided the universe ceased expanding. As such, &lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt; is not a physically meaningful time (this much time has not yet actually passed), though, as we will see, the particle horizon with which it is associated is a conceptually meaningful distance.

The particle horizon recedes constantly as time passes and the conformal time grows. As such, the observed size of the universe always increases.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Paul Hobson|author2=George Efstathiou|author3=Anthony N.

==Evolution of the particle horizon==

In this section we consider the [[FLRW]] cosmological model. In that context, the universe can be approximated as composed by non-interacting constituents, each one being a perfect fluid with density &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, partial pressure &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and state equation &lt;math&gt;p_i=\omega_i \rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, such that they add up to the total density  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and total pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* Hubble function   &lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\dot a}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* The critical density   &lt;math&gt;\rho_c=\frac{3}{8\pi}H^2&lt;/math&gt;

* The redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; given by the formula   &lt;math&gt;1+z=\frac{a_0}{a(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

Any function with a zero subscript denote the function evaluated at the present time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt; H(z)=H_0\sqrt{\sum \Omega_{i0}(1+z)^{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_i=3(1+\omega_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the addition ranges over all possible partial constituents and in particular there can be countably infinitely many. With this notation we have:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{The particle horizon } H_p \text{ exists if and only if } N&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the largest &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; (possibly infinite). The evolution of the particle horizon for an expanding universe (&lt;math&gt;\dot{a}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) is:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH_p}{dt}=H_p(z)H(z)+c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light and can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (natural units). Notice that the derivative is made with respect to the FLRW-time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, while the functions are evaluated at the redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which are related as stated before. We have an analogous but slightly different result for [[event horizon]].

==Horizon problem==
{{main|Horizon problem}}
The concept of a particle horizon can be used to illustrate the famous horizon problem, which is an unresolved issue associated with the [[Big Bang]] model. Extrapolating back to the time of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was emitted, we obtain a particle horizon of about

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = c\eta_\text{CMB} = 284\text{ Mpc} = 8.9 \times 10^{-3} H_p(t_0) &lt;/math&gt;}}

which corresponds to a proper size at that time of:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; a_\text{CMB}H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = 261\text{ kpc} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Since we observe the CMB to be emitted essentially from our particle horizon (&lt;math&gt;284\text{ Mpc} \ll 14.4\text{ Gpc}&lt;/math&gt;), our expectation is that parts of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) that are separated by about a fraction of a [[great circle]] across the sky of

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{H_p(t_\text{CMB})}{H_p(t_0)}&lt;/math&gt;}}

(an [[angular size]] of &lt;math&gt;\theta \sim 1.7^\circ&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Power Spectrum|url=http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/postgrad/pedagogy/2006_tojeiro.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be out of [[causal contact]] with each other. That the entire CMB is in [[thermal equilibrium]] and approximates a [[blackbody]] so well is therefore not explained by the standard explanations about the way the [[expansion of the universe]] proceeds. The most popular resolution to this problem is [[cosmic inflation]].

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Penicillin''' ('''PCN''' or '''pen''') is a group of [[antibiotics]] which include [[benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]] ([[Intravenous therapy|intravenous use]]), [[phenoxymethylpenicillin|penicillin V]] (use by mouth), [[procaine benzylpenicillin|procaine penicillin]], and [[benzathine benzylpenicillin|benzathine penicillin]] ([[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular use]]). Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many [[bacterial infection]]s caused by [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[streptococcus|streptococci]]. They are still widely used today, though many types of [[bacteria]] have developed [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] following extensive use.

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
About 10% of people report that they are [[allergy|allergic]] to penicillin; however, up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic.&lt;ref name=Al2015 /&gt; Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%.&lt;ref name=Al2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzalez-Estrada A, Radojicic C | title = Penicillin allergy: A practical guide for clinicians | journal = Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine | volume = 82 | issue = 5 | pages = 295–300 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25973877 | doi = 10.3949/ccjm.82a.14111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All penicillins are [[beta-lactam antibiotic|β-lactam antibiotics]].

&lt;!-- History and culture --&gt;
Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist [[Alexander Fleming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery and Development of Penicillin|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html|publisher=American Chemical Society|access-date=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; People began using it to treat infections in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology|year=2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-103962-1|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5W-WBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT56}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several enhanced penicillin families  which are effective against additional bacteria; these include the [[antistaphylococcal penicillins]], [[aminopenicillin]]s and the [[antipseudomonal penicillins]]. They are derived from ''[[Penicillium]]'' fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/penicillin|title=penicillin|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses ==
The term "penicillin" is often used generically to refer to [[benzylpenicillin]] (penicillin G, the original penicillin found in 1928), [[procaine benzylpenicillin]] (procaine penicillin), [[benzathine benzylpenicillin]] (benzathine penicillin), and [[phenoxymethylpenicillin]] (penicillin V). Procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin have the same antibacterial activity as benzylpenicillin but act for a longer period of time. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is less active against [[gram-negative]] bacteria than benzylpenicillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garrod LP | title = Relative antibacterial activity of three penicillins | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 5172 | pages = 527–9 | date = February 1960 | pmid = 13826674 | pmc = 1966560 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.5172.527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garrod LP | title = The relative antibacterial activity of four penicillins | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 5214 | pages = 1695–6 | date = December 1960 | pmid = 13703756 | pmc = 2098302 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.5214.1695 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzylpenicillin, procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin can only be given by intravenous or intramuscular injections, but phenoxymethylpenicillin can be given by mouth because of its acidic stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livertox.nih.gov/PenicillinGandPenicillinV.htm|title=Penicillin G and Penicillin V|website=livertox.nih.gov|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Susceptibility ===
While the number of penicillin-resistant bacteria is increasing, penicillin can still be used to treat a wide range of infections caused by certain susceptible bacteria, including [[Streptococci]], [[Staphylococci]], [[Clostridium]], [[Neisseria]], and [[Listeria]] genera. The following list illustrates [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria:&lt;ref name="Antimicrobial Index"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_914_18.html |title=Penicillin (Benzylpenicillin, Penicillin G, Bicillin C-R/L-A, Pfizerpen, Wycellin) |work=The Antimicrobial Index |publisher=Knowledgebase |access-date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOKU-E"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Penicillin%20G%20sodium%20salt.pdf |title=Penicillin G sodium salt Susceptibilty and Resistance Data |publisher=TOKU-E |access-date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Staphylococcus aureus'': from less than or equal to 0.015 μg/ml to more than 32 μg/ml

== Side effects ==
{{Main|Side effects of penicillin}}
Common (≥ 1% of people) [[adverse drug reaction]]s associated with use of the penicillins include [[diarrhoea]], [[hypersensitivity]], [[nausea]], rash, [[neurotoxicity]], [[urticaria]], and [[superinfection]] (including [[candidiasis]]). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include fever, vomiting, [[erythema]], [[dermatitis]], [[angioedema]], [[seizures]] (especially in people with [[epilepsy]]), and [[pseudomembranous colitis]].&lt;ref name="AMH2006" /&gt; Penicillin can also induce [[serum sickness]] or a [[serum sickness-like reaction]] in some individuals. Serum sickness is a [[type III hypersensitivity]] reaction that occurs one to three weeks after exposure to drugs including penicillin. It is not a true drug allergy, because allergies are [[type I hypersensitivity]] reactions, but repeated exposure to the offending agent can result in an anaphylactic reaction.{{mcn|date=May 2017}} [[Anaphylaxis]] will occur in approximately 0.01% of patients.&lt;ref name="AMH2006" /&gt;

Pain and inflammation at the injection site is also common for [[Parenteral#Parenteral by injection or infusion|parenterally]] administered benzathine benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, and, to a lesser extent, procaine benzylpenicillin.{{mcn|date=May 2017}}

{{Main|Beta-lactam antibiotic}}
[[File:Penicillin spheroplast generation horizontal.svg|upright|Bacteria that attempt to grow and divide in the presence of penicillin fail to do so, and instead end up shedding their cell walls.|thumb|right|600px]]
[[File:Penicillin inhibition.svg|thumb|upright|right|Penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics act by inhibiting [[penicillin-binding proteins]], which normally catalyze cross-linking of bacterial cell walls.]]

Bacteria constantly remodel their [[peptidoglycan]] cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide. [[beta-lactam antibiotic|''β''-Lactam antibiotics]] inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan [[cross-link]]s in the bacterial [[cell wall]]; this is achieved through binding of the four-membered ''β''-lactam [[cycloalkane|ring]] of penicillin to the [[enzyme]] [[DD-transpeptidase]]. As a consequence, DD-transpeptidase cannot [[Catalysis|catalyze]] formation of these cross-links, and an imbalance between cell wall production and degradation develops, causing the cell to rapidly die.

The enzymes that [[hydrolyze]] the peptidoglycan cross-links continue to function, even while those that form such cross-links do not. This weakens the cell wall of the bacterium, and osmotic pressure becomes increasingly uncompensated—eventually causing cell death ([[cytolysis]]). In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall's peptidoglycans. The small size of the penicillins increases their potency, by allowing them to penetrate the entire depth of the cell wall. This is in contrast to the [[glycopeptide antibiotics]] [[vancomycin]] and [[teicoplanin]], which are both much larger than the penicillins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Bambeke|first1=Francois|last2=Lambert|first2=Didier|last3=Mingeot-Leclercq|first3=Marie-Paule|last4=Tulkens|first4=Paul | name-list-format = vanc |title=Mechanism of Action|date=1999|url=http://www.facm.ucl.ac.be/Full-texts-FACM/Vanbambeke-1999-3.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gram-positive bacteria are called [[protoplast]]s when they lose their cell walls. [[Gram-negative]] bacteria do not lose their cell walls completely and are called [[spheroplast]]s after treatment with penicillin.

Penicillin shows a synergistic effect with [[aminoglycosides]], since the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows aminoglycosides to penetrate the bacterial cell wall more easily, allowing their disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell. This results in a lowered [[Minimum Bactericidal Concentration|MBC]] for susceptible organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winstanley TG, Hastings JG | title = Penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy and post-antibiotic effect for enterococci | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–99 | date = February 1989 | pmid = 2708179 | doi = 10.1093/jac/23.2.189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penicillins, like other ''β''-lactam antibiotics, block not only the division of bacteria, including [[cyanobacteria]], but also the division of cyanelles, the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[organelle]]s of the [[glaucophyte]]s, and the division of [[chloroplast]]s of [[bryophyte]]s. In contrast, they have no effect on the [[plastid]]s of the highly developed [[vascular plant]]s. This supports the [[endosymbiotic theory]] of the [[evolution]] of plastid division in land plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Britta|last1=Kasten|first2=Ralf|last2=Reski| name-list-format = vanc |authorlink2=Ralf Reski|date=March 30, 1997|title=β-lactam antibiotics inhibit chloroplast division in a moss (Physcomitrella patens) but not in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)|journal=Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=150|pages=137–140|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2640663|issue=1–2|doi=10.1016/S0176-1617(97)80193-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical structure of penicillin is triggered with a very precise, pH-dependent directed mechanism, effected by a unique spatial assembly of molecular components, which can activate by protonation. It can travel through bodily fluids, targeting and inactivating enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis in gram-positive bacteria, meanwhile avoiding the surrounding non-targets. Penicillin can protect itself from spontaneous hydrolysis in the body in its anionic form, while storing its potential as a strong acylating agent, activated only upon approach to the target transpeptidase enzyme and protonated in the active centre. This targeted protonation neutralizes the carboxylic acid moiety, which is weakening of the β-lactam ring N–C(=O) bond, resulting in a self-activation. Specific structural requirements are equated to constructing the perfect mouse trap for catching targeted prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mucsi Z, Chass GA, Ábrányi-Balogh P, Jójárt B, Fang DC, Ramirez-Cuesta AJ, Viskolcz B, Csizmadia IG | title = Penicillin's catalytic mechanism revealed by inelastic neutrons and quantum chemical theory | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics | volume = 15 | issue = 47 | pages = 20447–55 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23760063 | doi = 10.1039/c3cp50868d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:Penicillin-G 3D.png|thumb|right|Chemical structure of Penicillin G. The sulfur and nitrogen of the five-membered [[thiazolidine]] ring are shown in yellow and blue respectively. The image shows that the thiazolidine ring and fused four-membered ''β''-lactam are not in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].]]

The term "[[penam]]" is used to describe the common core skeleton of a member of the penicillins. This core has the molecular formula R-C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S, where R is the variable side chain that differentiates the penicillins from one another. The penam core has a [[molar mass]] of 243&amp;nbsp;g/mol, with larger penicillins having molar mass near 450—for example, [[cloxacillin]] has a molar mass of 436&amp;nbsp;g/mol. The key structural feature of the penicillins is the four-membered ''β''-lactam ring; this structural [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] is essential for penicillin's antibacterial activity. The ''β''-lactam ring is itself fused to a five-membered [[thiazolidine]] ring. The fusion of these two rings causes the ''β''-lactam ring to be more reactive than monocyclic ''β''-lactams because the two fused rings distort the ''β''-lactam [[amide bond]] and therefore remove the [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance stabilisation]] normally found in these chemical bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaou (1996), pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 19th century there had been many accounts by scientists and physicians on the antibacterial properties of the different types of moulds including the mould [[penicillium]] but they were unable to discern what process was causing the effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Dougherty, Michael J. Pucci, Antibiotic Discovery and Development, Springer Science &amp; Business Media – 2011, pages 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of penicillium mould would finally be isolated in 1928 by Scottish scientist [[Alexander Fleming]], in work that seems to have been independent of those earlier observations.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Landau, Basil Achilladelis, Alexander Scriabine, Pharmaceutical Innovation: Revolutionizing Human Health, Chemical Heritage Foundation – 1999, page 162&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming recounted that the date of his discovery of penicillin was on the morning of Friday 28 September 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haven | first = Kendall F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Marvels of Science : 50 Fascinating 5-Minute Reads |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=Littleton, CO |year=1994 |pages=182 |isbn=1-56308-159-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional version of this story describes the discovery as a [[Serendipity|serendipitous]] accident: in his laboratory in the basement of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St&amp;nbsp;Mary's Hospital]] in London (now part of [[Imperial College]]), Fleming noticed a Petri dish containing [[Staphylococci]] that had been mistakenly left open was contaminated by blue-green mould from an open window, which formed a visible growth.&lt;ref name=Lax2004&gt;{{cite book |last= Lax |first= Eric | name-list-format = vanc |year= 2004 |title= The Mold in Dr. Florey's Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle |publisher= Holt Paperbacks |isbn= 978-0-8050-7778-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a halo of inhibited bacterial growth around the mould. Fleming concluded that the mould released a substance that repressed the growth and caused [[lysing]] of the bacteria.&lt;ref name=Bud2009&gt;{{cite book |last= Bud |first= Robert | name-list-format = vanc |year= 2009 |title= Penicillin: Triumph and Tragedy |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-954161-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Fleming made his discovery he grew a pure [[cell culture|culture]] and discovered it was a ''Penicillium'' mould, now known as ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]''. Fleming coined the term "penicillin" to describe the [[filtrate]] of a broth culture of the ''Penicillium'' mould. Fleming asked C. J. La Touche to help identify the mould, which he incorrectly identified as ''[[Penicillium rubrum]]'' (later corrected by [[Charles Thom]]). He expressed initial optimism that penicillin would be a useful disinfectant, because of its high potency and minimal toxicity in comparison to antiseptics of the day, and noted its laboratory value in the isolation of ''Bacillus influenzae'' (now called ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'').&lt;ref name=Lax2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleming1929&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krylov AK | title = [Gastroenterologic aspects of the clinical picture of internal diseases] | journal = Terapevticheskii Arkhiv | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–41 | year = 1929 | pmc = 2048009 }} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming A | title = On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of B. influenzae. 1929 | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 79 | issue = 8 | pages = 780–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11545337 | pmc = 2566493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming was a famously poor communicator and orator, which meant his findings were not initially given much attention.&lt;ref name=Lax2004 /&gt; He was unable to convince a chemist to help him extract and stabilize the antibacterial compound found in the broth filtrate. Despite this, he remained interested in the potential use of penicillin and presented a paper entitled "A Medium for the Isolation of Pfeiffer's Bacillus" to the [[Medical Research Club]] of London, which was met with little interest and even less enthusiasm by his peers. Had Fleming been more successful at making other scientists interested in his work, penicillin for medicinal use would possibly have been developed years earlier.&lt;ref name=Lax2004 /&gt;

Despite the lack of interest of his fellow scientists, he did conduct several experiments on the antibiotic substance he discovered. The most important result proved it was nontoxic in humans by first performing toxicity tests in animals and then on humans. His following experiments on penicillin's response to heat and pH allowed Fleming to increase the stability of the compound.&lt;ref name=Fleming1929 /&gt; The one test that modern scientists would find missing from his work was the test of penicillin on an infected animal, the results of which would likely have sparked great interest in penicillin and sped its development by almost a decade.&lt;ref name=Lax2004 /&gt;
The importance of his work has been recognized by the placement of an [[International Historic Chemical Landmark]] at the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum in London on November 19, 1999.&lt;ref name="Landmark"&gt;{{cite web |title=Discovery and Development of Penicillin |url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html |publisher = American Chemical Society |work = International Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate = August 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical application ===
[[File:Howard Walter Florey 1945.jpg|thumb|Florey (pictured), Fleming and Chain shared a Nobel Prize in 1945 for their work on penicillin.]]
In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a [[pathologist]] at the [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary|Royal Infirmary]] in [[Sheffield]], attempted to use penicillin to treat [[sycosis barbae]], eruptions in beard follicles, but was unsuccessful.  Moving on to [[Neonatal conjunctivitis|ophthalmia neonatorum]], a gonococcal infection in infants, he achieved the first recorded cure with penicillin, on November 25, 1930.

In 1939, Australian scientist [[Howard Walter Florey|Howard Florey]] (later Baron Florey) and a team of researchers ([[Ernst Boris Chain]], [[Edward Abraham]], [[Arthur Duncan Gardner]], [[Norman Heatley]], M.

=== Mass production ===

By late 1940, the Oxford team under Howard Florey had devised a method of mass-producing the drug, but yields remained low.&lt;ref name=SW /&gt;  In 1941, Florey and Heatley travelled to the US in order to interest pharmaceutical companies in producing the drug and inform them about their process.&lt;ref name=SW /&gt;

Florey and Chain shared the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] with Fleming for their work.

The challenge of mass-producing this drug was daunting.

During [[World War II]], penicillin made a major difference in the number of deaths and amputations caused by infected wounds among [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces, saving an estimated 12%–15% of lives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Availability was severely limited, however, by the difficulty of manufacturing large quantities of penicillin and by the rapid [[clearance (medicine)|renal clearance]] of the drug, necessitating frequent dosing. Methods for [[mass production]] of penicillin were patented by [[Andrew Jackson Moyer]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson Moyer, Method for Production of Penicillin, United States Patent Office, US Patent 2,442,141, filed 11 May 1945, issued 25 March 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson Moyer, Method for Production of Penicillin, United States Patent Office, US Patent 2,443,989, filed 11 May 1945, issued 22 June 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson Moyer, Method for Production of Penicillin, United States Patent Office, US Patent 2,476,107, filed 11 May 1945, issued 12 July 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Florey had not patented penicillin, having been advised by Sir [[Henry Hallett Dale|Henry Dale]] that doing so would be unethical.&lt;ref name="SW"&gt;{{cite web | title = Making Penicillin Possible: Norman Heatley Remembers | access-date = 2007-02-13 | year = 2007 | work = ScienceWatch | publisher = [[Thomson Scientific]]| url=http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/norman_heatly.htm | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070221041204/http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/norman_heatly.htm| archive-date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penicillin is actively excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared from the body within three to four hours of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn2004&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Silverthorn DU | title=Human physiology: an integrated approach. | edition=3rd | location=Upper Saddle River (NJ) | publisher=Pearson Education | year=2004 | isbn=0-8053-5957-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The [[uricosuric]] agent [[probenecid]] proved to be suitable. When probenecid and penicillin are administered together, probenecid competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin's concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins resolved the supply issues, so this use of probenecid declined.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn2004 /&gt; Probenecid is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.&lt;ref name=AMH2006&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Rossi S | title=[[Australian Medicines Handbook]] | year=2006 | location=Adelaide | publisher=Australian Medicines Handbook | isbn=0-9757919-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=May 2017}}

After World War II, Australia was the first country to make the drug available for civilian use. In the U.S., penicillin was made available to the general public on March 15, 1945.&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html | title = Discovery and development of penicillin | publisher = [[American Chemical Society]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developments from penicillin ===
The narrow range of treatable diseases or "spectrum of activity" of the penicillins, along with the poor activity of the orally active phenoxymethylpenicillin, led to the search for derivatives of penicillin that could treat a wider range of infections. The isolation of 6-APA, the nucleus of penicillin, allowed for the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins, with various improvements over [[benzylpenicillin]] (bioavailability, spectrum, stability, tolerance).

The first major development was [[ampicillin]] in 1961. It offered a broader spectrum of activity than either of the original penicillins. Further development yielded β-lactamase-resistant penicillins, including [[flucloxacillin]], [[dicloxacillin]], and [[methicillin]]. These were significant for their activity against β-lactamase-producing bacterial species, but were ineffective against the [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) strains that subsequently emerged.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Another development of the line of true penicillins was the antipseudomonal penicillins, such as [[carbenicillin]], [[ticarcillin]], and [[piperacillin]], useful for their activity against [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. However, the usefulness of the β-lactam ring was such that related antibiotics, including the [[mecillinam]]s, the [[carbapenem]]s and, most important, the [[cephalosporin]]s, still retain it at the center of their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = James CW, Gurk-Turner C | title = Cross-reactivity of beta-lactam antibiotics | journal = Proceedings | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 106–7 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 16369597 | pmc = 1291320 | publisher = Baylor University Medical Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:Penicillin bioreactor.jpg|thumb|A 1957 fermentor (bioreactor) used to grow ''Penicillium'' mould.]]
Penicillin is a [[Secondary metabolism|secondary metabolite]] of certain species of ''[[Penicillium]]'' and is produced when growth of the fungus is inhibited by stress. It is not produced during active growth. Production is also limited by feedback in the synthesis pathway of penicillin.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

::[[alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|α-ketoglutarate]] + [[Acetyl-CoA|AcCoA]] → [[Homocitric acid|homocitrate]] → [[alpha-Aminoadipic acid|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-α-aminoadipic acid]] → [[Lysine|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-lysine]] + [[Beta-lactam|β-lactam]]

The by-product, {{Smallcaps|l}}-lysine, inhibits the production of homocitrate, so the presence of exogenous lysine should be avoided in penicillin production.

The ''Penicillium'' cells are grown using a technique called [[fed-batch]] culture, in which the cells are constantly subject to stress, which is required for induction of penicillin production. The available carbon sources are also important: [[glucose]] inhibits penicillin production, whereas [[lactose]] does not. The [[pH]] and the levels of nitrogen, lysine, phosphate, and oxygen of the batches must also be carefully controlled.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The [[Biotechnology|biotechnological]] method of [[directed evolution]] has been applied to produce by mutation a large number of ''Penicillium'' strains. These techniques include [[Polymerase chain reaction|error-prone PCR]], [[DNA shuffling]], {{abbr|ITCHY|incremental truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymes}}, and strand-overlap PCR.

Semisynthetic penicillins are prepared starting from the penicillin nucleus [[6-APA]].

=== Biosynthesis ===
[[File:Penicillin-biosynthesis.png|thumb|Penicillin G biosynthesis]]
Overall, there are three main and important steps to the biosynthesis of [[penicillin G]] (benzylpenicillin).

The condensation reaction and epimerization are both catalyzed by the enzyme δ-(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-α-aminoadipyl)-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-valine synthetase (ACVS), a [[nonribosomal peptide]] synthetase or NRPS.
* The second step in the biosynthesis of penicillin G is the [[Redox|oxidative]] conversion of linear ACV into the [[Bicyclic molecule|bicyclic]] intermediate isopenicillin N by [[isopenicillin N synthase]] (IPNS), which is encoded by the gene ''pcbC''.&lt;ref name ="Regulation" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Molecular /&gt; Isopenicillin N is a very weak intermediate, because it does not show strong antibiotic activity.&lt;ref name=Fern /&gt;
* The final step is a [[transamidation]] by [[isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase]], in which the α-aminoadipyl side-chain of isopenicillin N is removed and exchanged for a [[Phenylacetic acid|phenylacetyl]] side-chain. This reaction is encoded by the gene ''penDE'', which is unique in the process of obtaining penicillins.&lt;ref name ="Regulation" /&gt;

As a [[Branches of science|sub-discipline]] of [[biology]], the focus of physiology is in how [[organism]]s, [[organ system]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[cell (biology)|cells]], and [[biomolecule]]s carry out the [[Chemistry|chemical]] and [[Physics|physical]] functions that exist in a living system.&lt;ref name="Guyton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=John|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|year=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|pages=3|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to an understanding of physiological functioning is the investigation of the fundamental biophysical and biochemical phenomena, the coordinated [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] control mechanisms, and the continuous [[Cell signaling|communication]] between cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vander's Human Physiology The Mechanisms of Body Function|last=Widmaier|first=Eric P.|last2=Raff|first2=Hershel|last3=Strang|first3=Kevin T.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-1-259-29409-9|location=New York, NY|pages=14–15|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''physiologic''' state is the condition occurring from normal body function, while the [[Pathology|pathological]] state is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248791.php|title=What is physiology?|work=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the type of investigated organisms, the field can be divided into, animal physiology (including that of [[Homo sapiens|humans]]), [[plant physiology]], [[Cell physiology|cellular physiology]] and [[microbial metabolism|microbial physiology]].&lt;ref name="Guyton" /&gt;

The [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Human physiology seeks to understand the mechanisms that work to keep the [[human body]] alive and functioning,&lt;ref name="Guyton"/&gt; through scientific enquiry into the nature of mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals. that integrate function in animals. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals. The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Changes in physiology can impact the mental functions of individuals. Examples of this would be the effects of certain medications or toxic levels of substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental disorders|url=http://www.who.int/topics/mental_disorders/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in [[behavior change (individual)|behavior]] as a result of these substances is often used to assess the health of individuals.&lt;ref name = Davis2017&gt;{{cite web | title = Eszopiclone | publisher = F.A.

Much of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by animal experimentation. Due to the frequent connection between form and function, physiology and [[anatomy]] are intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.&lt;ref name="NIH2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bergman |first1=Esther M |last2=de Bruin |first2=Anique BH |last3=Herrler |first3=Andreas |last4=Verheijen |first4=Inge WH |last5=Scherpbier |first5=Albert JJA |last6=van der Vleuten |first6=Cees PM |title=Students' perceptions of anatomy across the undergraduate problem-based learning medical curriculum: a phenomenographical study |pmc=4225514 |journal=BMC Medical Education |doi=10.1186/1472-6920-13-152 |date=19 November 2013 |quote=Together with physiology and biochemistry, anatomy is one of the basic sciences that are to be taught in the medical curriculum. |pmid=24252155 |volume=13 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
{{Main|Plant physiology}}Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of [[botany]] concerned with the functioning of plants. Closely related fields include [[plant morphology]], [[plant ecology]], [[phytochemistry]], [[cell biology]], genetics, [[biophysics]], and [[molecular biology]]. Fundamental processes of plant physiology include [[photosynthesis]], [[Respiration in plant|respiration]], [[plant nutrition]], [[tropism]]s, [[nastic movements]], [[photoperiodism]], [[photomorphogenesis]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[Germination|seed germination]], [[dormancy]], and [[stoma]]ta function and transpiration. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology.

===Cells===
{{Main|Cell physiology}}Although there are differences between animal, plant, and microbial cells, the basic physiological functions of cells can be divided into the processes of [[cell division]], [[cell signaling]], [[cell growth]], and [[Metabolism|cell metabolism]].

===Microorganisms===
{{Main|Microorganism}}Microorganisms can be found almost everywhere on Earth. Types of microorganisms include archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, protists, fungi, and micro-plants. [[Microbes in human culture|Microbes are important in human culture]] and [[health]] in many ways, serving to [[Fermentation in food processing|ferment foods]], [[Sewage treatment|treat sewage]], [[Algae fuel|produce fuel]], [[enzyme]]s and other [[bioactive compound]]s. They are essential tools in [[biology]] as [[model organism]]s and have been put to use in [[biological warfare]] and [[bioterrorism]]. They are a vital [[Soil microbiology|component of fertile soils]]. In the [[human body]] microorganisms make up the [[human microbiota]] including the essential [[gut flora]]. They are the [[pathogen]]s responsible for many [[infectious disease]]s and as such are the target of [[Hygiene|hygiene measures]]. Most microorganisms can reproduce rapidly, and bacteria are also able to freely exchange genes through [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], even between widely divergent species.

== History ==

===The classical era===
The study of human physiology as a medical field originates in [[classical Greece]], at the time of [[Hippocrates]] (late 5th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/Ph-Py/Physiology.html |title=Physiology|work=Science Clarified |publisher= Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Outside of Western tradition, early forms of physiology or anatomy can be reconstructed as having been present at around the same time in China,&lt;ref&gt;Helaine Selin, ''Medicine Across Cultures: History and Practice of Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'' (2003), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Physiology and Chemistry to Biochemistry|page=8|publisher=Pearson Education|author1=D. P. Burma |author2=Maharani Chakravorty }}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere.
Hippocrates incorporated his belief system called the theory of humours, which consisted of four basic substance: earth, water, air and fire. Each substance is known for having a corresponding humour: black bile, phlegm, blood and yellow bile, respectively. Hippocrates also noted some emotional connections to the four humours, which Claudius Galenus would later expand on. The critical thinking of [[Aristotle]] and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in [[Ancient Greece]]. Like Hippocrates, Aristotle took to the humoral theory of disease, which also consisted of four primary qualities in life: hot, cold, wet and dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/neurophysio.html|title=Early Medicine and Physiology|work=ship.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius Galenus (c. ~130–200&amp;nbsp;AD), known as [[Galen]] of Pergamum, was the first to use experiments to probe the functions of the body. Unlike Hippocrates, Galen argued that humoral imbalances can be located in specific organs, including the entire body.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/223895/Galen-of-Pergamum|title=Galen of Pergamum|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; His modification of this theory better equipped doctors to make more precise diagnoses. Galen also played off of Hippocrates idea that emotions were also tied to the humours, and added the notion of temperaments: sanguine corresponds with blood; phlegmatic is tied to phlegm; yellow bile is connected to choleric; and black bile corresponds with melancholy. Galen also saw the human body consisting of three connected systems: the brain and nerves, which are responsible for thoughts and sensations; the heart and arteries, which give life; and the liver and veins, which can be attributed to nutrition and growth.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Galen was also the founder of experimental physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = C. | last1 = Fell | first2 = F. | last2 = Pearson | title = Historical Perspectives of Thoracic Anatomy | journal = Thoracic Surgery Clinics |date=November 2007 | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–8| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1547412706001034 | doi = 10.1016/j.thorsurg.2006.12.001| pmid = 18271159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And for the next 1,400 years, Galenic physiology was a powerful and influential tool in medicine.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

===Early modern period===
[[Jean Fernel]] (1497–1558), a French physician, introduced the term "physiology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton |page=344|author=Wilbur Applebaum|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen, [[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]], [[Realdo Colombo]], [[Amato Lusitano]] and [[William Harvey]], are credited as making important discoveries in the [[circulation of the blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampling|first=M. W.|date=2016|title=The history of the theory of the circulation of the blood|journal=Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation|volume=64|issue=4|pages=541–549|doi=10.3233/CH-168031|issn=1875-8622|pmid=27791994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santorio Santorio]] in 1610s was the first to use a device to measure the [[pulse]] rate (the ''pulsilogium''), and a [[thermoscope]] to measure temperature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/treasures/santorio-santorio-1561-1636/|title=Santorio Santorio (1561-1636): Medicina statica|last=|first=|date=|website=Vaulted Treasures|publisher=University of Virginia, Claude Moore Health Sciences Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 [[Luigi Galvani]] described the role of electricity in nerves of dissected frogs. In 1811, Julien Jean César Legallois studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the [[medulla oblongata]]. In the same year, [[Charles Bell]] finished work on what would later become known as the [[Bell-Magendie law]], which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the [[spinal cord]]. In 1824, [[François Magendie]] described the sensory roots and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum’s role in [[Equilibrioception|equilibration]] to complete the Bell-Magendie law.

In the 1820s, the French physiologist [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] introduced the notion of physiological division of labor, which allowed to "compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man." Inspired in the work of [[Adam Smith]], Milne-Edwards wrote that the "body of all living beings, whether animal or plant, resembles a factory ... where the organs, comparable to workers, work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual." In more differentiated organisms, the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or [[Biological system|systems]] (called by him as ''appareils'').&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;R. M. Brain. ''The Pulse of Modernism: Physiological Aesthetics in Fin-de-Siècle Europe''. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2015. 384 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=l8IECgAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] studied the cause of blood coagulation and inflammation that resulted after previous injuries and surgical wounds. He later discovered and implemented [[antiseptic]]s in the operating room, and as a result decreased death rate from surgery by a substantial amount.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiologyinfo.org/mm/Timeline-of-Physiology/Milestones-in-Physiology.pdf|date=1 October 2013|title= Milestones in Physiology (1822-2013)|accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Physiological Society]] was founded in London in 1876 as a dining club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/society-history|title=The Society's history {{!}} Physiological Society|website=www.physoc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The American Physiological Society]]  (APS) is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1887. The Society is, "devoted to fostering education, scientific research, and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/About-Us.html|title=American Physiological Society &gt; About|website=www.the-aps.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, [[Ivan Pavlov]] performed research on "conditional responses" that involved dogs' saliva production in response to a bell and visual stimuli.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the [[Cell theory]] of [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. [[Claude Bernard]]'s (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of ''[[milieu interieur]]'' (internal environment),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Study of Ex- perimental Medicine|last=Bernard|first=Claude|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1865|isbn=|location=New York|publication-date=1957|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lectures on the Phenomena of Life Common to Animals and Plants|last=Bernard|first=Claude|publisher=Thomas|year=1878|isbn=|location=Springfield|publication-date=1974|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would later be taken up and championed as "[[homeostasis]]" by American physiologist [[Walter B. Cannon]] in 1929. By homeostasis, Cannon meant "the maintenance of steady states in the body and the physiological processes through which they are regulated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brown Theodore M. |author2=Fee Elizabeth | date = October 2002 | title = Walter Bradford Cannon: Pioneer Physiologist of Human Emotions | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 92 | issue = 10| pages = 1594–1595 | pmc=1447286 | doi=10.2105/ajph.92.10.1594}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the body's ability to regulate its internal environment. William Beaumont was the first American to utilize the practical application of physiology.

Nineteenth century physiologists such as [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]], [[Max Verworn]], and [[Alfred Binet]], based on [[Haeckel]]'s ideas, elaborated what came to be called "general physiology", a unified science of life based on the cell actions,&lt;ref name=brain/&gt; later renamed in the 20th century as [[cell biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, J. L. (2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science'', Oxford University Press, p. 649, [https://books.google.com/books?id=abqjP-_KfzkC link].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late modern period===
In the 20th century, biologists  became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of [[comparative physiology]] and [[ecophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Feder | first1=ME |last2=Bennett |first2=AF |first3=Burggren |last3=WW |last4=Huey |first4=RB  | title = New directions in ecological physiology | year = 1987 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-521-34938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major figures in these fields include [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] and [[George Bartholomew (biologist)|George Bartholomew]]. Most recently, [[evolutionary physiology]] has become a distinct subdiscipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Theodore | last1 = Garland, Jr | author1-link=Theodore Garland, Jr. | last2 = Carter | first2 = P.

In 1920, [[August Krogh]] won the Nobel Prize for discovering how, in capillaries, blood flow is regulated.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

In 1954, [[Andrew Huxley]] and Hugh Huxley, alongside their research team, discovered the sliding filaments in [[skeletal muscle]], known today as the sliding filament theory.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

Recently, there have been intense debates about the vitality of physiology as a discipline (Is it dead or alive?).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinter|first=G.

==Notable physiologists==
{{Main|List of physiologists}}

=== Women in physiology ===
Initially, women were largely excluded from official involvement in any physiological society. The [[American Physiological Society]], for example, was founded in 1887 and included only men in its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Physiological Society &gt; Founders|url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/founders.html|website=www.the-aps.org|publisher=The American Physiological Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the American Physiological Society elected [[Ida Hyde]] as the first female member of the society.&lt;ref name="Tucker 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=GS|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde: the first woman member of the society|journal=The Physiologist|date=December 1981|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1–9|pmid=7043502|url=http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Publications/Journals/Physiologist/1980-1989/1981/December.pdf}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde, a representative of the [[American Association of University Women]] and a global advocate for gender equality in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hydeida-henrietta|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde|work=jwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to promote gender equality in every aspect of science and medicine.

Soon thereafter, in 1913, [[J.S. Haldane]] proposed that women be allowed to formally join [[The Physiological Society]], which had been founded in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/women-physiology|title=Women in Physiology {{!}} Physiological Society|website=www.physoc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1915, six women were officially admitted: [[Florence Buchanan]], [[Winifred Cullis]], [[Ruth C. Skelton]], [[Sarah C. M. Sowton]], [[Constance Leetham Terry]], and  [[Enid M. Tribe]].&lt;ref name="physoc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/women-physiology|title=Women in Physiology|work=physoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The centenary of the election of women was celebrated in 2015 with the publication of the book "Women Physiologists: Centenary Celebrations And Beyond For The Physiological Society." ({{ISBN|978-0-9933410-0-7}})

Prominent women physiologists include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">The [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] that are concerned with the secretion of [[gums]], [[resins]], volatile oils, [[nectar]] 
[[latex]], and other substances in plants are called '''secretory tissues'''
These tissues are divided into two groups-
# Laticiferous tissues
# Glandular tissues

== Introduction ==
[[Cell (biology)|Cells]] or organizations of cells which produce a variety of secretions. The secreted substance may remain deposited within the secretory cell itself or may be excreted, that is, released from the cell. Substances may be excreted to the surface of the plant or into intercellular cavities or canals. Some of the many substances contained in the secretions are not further utilized by the plant (resins, rubber, tannins, and various crystals), while others take part in the functions of the plant (enzymes and hormones). Secretory structures range from single cells scattered among other kinds of cells to complex structures involving many cells; the latter are often called [[gland_(botany)|glands]].

Epidermal hairs of many plants are secretory or glandular. Such hairs commonly have a head composed of one or more secretory cells borne on a stalk. The hair of a stinging needle is bulbous below and extends into a long, fine process above. If one touches the hair, its tip breaks off, the sharp edge penetrates the [[skin]], and the poisonous secretion is released.
Glands secreting a sugary liquid—the nectar—in flowers pollinated by insects are called nectaries. Nectaries may occur on the floral stalk or on any floral organ: sepal, petal, stamen, or ovary.

The [[hydathode]] structures discharge water—a phenomenon called [[guttation]] through openings in margins or tips of leaves.
The water flows through the [[xylem]] to its endings in the leaf and then through the [[intercellular space]]s of the hydathode tissue toward the openings in the epidermis. Strictly speaking, such hydathodes are not glands because they are passive with regard to the flow of water. &lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
Some [[carnivorous plants]] have glands that produce secretions
capable of digesting insects and small animals. These glands
occur on leaf parts modified as insect-trapping structures. In
the sundews ( Drosera ) the traps bear stalked glands, called
tentacles. When an insect lights on the leaf, the tentacles bend
down and cover the victim with a mucilaginous secretion, the
enzymes of which digest the insect. See  [[insectivorous plants]].
&lt;br/&gt; 
Resin ducts are canals lined with secretory cells that release
resins into the canal. Resin ducts are common in gymnosperms
and occur in various tissues of roots, stems, leaves, and
reproductive structures. &lt;br/&gt;
Gum ducts are similar to resin ducts and may contain resins,
oils, and gums. Usually, the term gum duct is used with
reference to the dicotyledons, although gum ducts also may
occur in the [[gymnosperms]].
Oil ducts are intercellular canals whose secretory cells produce
oils or similar substances. Such ducts may be seen, for
example, in various parts of the plant of the carrot family
([[Umbelliferae]]).
Laticifers are cells or systems of cells containing latex, a milky
or clear, colored or colorless liquid. [[Latex]] occurs under
pressure and exudes from the plant when the latter is cut.

== Laticiferous tissues ==

These consist of thin walled, greatly elongated and much 
branched ducts containing a milky or yellowish colored 
juice known as [[latex]]. They contain numerous nuclei 
which lie embedded in the thin lining layer of [[protoplasm]].
They irregularly distributed in the mass of parenchymatous cells.
Laticiferous ducts, in which latex are found are again two types-
# Latex cell or non-articulate latex ducts
# Latex vessels or articulate latex

=== Latex cells ===
Also called as "non-articulate latex ducts", these ducts are independent units which extend as branched structures for long distances in the plant body.
They originates as minute structures, elongate quickly and by repeated branching ramify in all directions but do not fuse together.
Thus a network is not formed as in latex vessels.

=== Latex vessel ===
Also called "articulate latex ducts", these ducts or vecssels are the result of anastamosing of many cells together.
They grow more or less as parallel ducts which by means of branching and frequent anastamose form a complex network.
Latex vessels are commonly found in many angiosperm families [[Papaveraceae]], [[Compositae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Moraceae]], etc.

=== Function ===
The function of laticiferous ducts is not clearly understood. They may also act as food storage organs or as reservoir of waste products.
They may also act as translocatory tissues.

== Glandular tissues ==

This tissue consists of special structures; the glands. These glands contain some secretory or excretory products.
A gland may consist of isolated cells or small group cells with or without a central cavity. 
They are of various kinds and may be internal or external.
&lt;br /&gt;
Internal glands are
* Oil-gland secreting essential oils, as in the fruits and leaves of orange, lemon.
* Mucilage secreting glands, as in the betel leaf 
* Glands secreting gum, resin, tannin, etc. 
* Digestive glands secreting enzymes or digestive agents 
* Special water secreting glands at the tip of veins 
&lt;br /&gt;
External glands are commonly short hairs tipped by glands. They are 
* water-secreting hairs or glands,
* Glandular hairs secreting gum like substances as in [[tobacco]], [[plumbago]], etc. 
* Glandular hairs secreting irritating, poisonous substances, as in nettles
* Honey glands, as in [[carnivorous plants]].

A '''proboscis''' {{IPAc-en|p|r|oʊ|ˈ|b|ɒ|s|ɪ|s}} is an elongated appendage from the head of an [[animal]], either a [[vertebrate]] or an [[invertebrate]]. In invertebrates, the term usually refers to tubular mouthparts used for feeding and sucking. In vertebrates, a proboscis is an elongated nose or snout.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1609 from [[Latin]] ''proboscis'', the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] προβοσκίς (''proboskis''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dproboski%2Fs προβοσκίς],
Henry George Liddell, Robert S, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from πρό (''pro'') "forth, forward, before"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpro%2F πρό], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; + βόσκω (''bosko''), "to feed, to nourish".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbo%2Fskw βόσκω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|proboscis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plural as derived from the Greek is ''proboscides'', but in English the plural form ''proboscises'' occurs frequently.

==Invertebrates==
The most common usage is to refer to the tubular [[feeding]] and [[sucking]] organ of certain [[invertebrate]]s such as [[insects]] (e.g., [[Insect mouthparts#Proboscis|moths and butterflies]]), [[worm]]s (including [[Acanthocephala]], [[Nemertea|proboscis worms]]) and [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s.

===Acanthocephala===
[[File:Parasite140083-fig5 Figs 31-36 Cathayacanthus spinitruncatus.tif|thumb|Scanning electron microscopy of proboscis of an Acanthocephala''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amin, O. A, Heckmann, R. A &amp; Ha, N. V. |title= Acanthocephalans from fishes and amphibians in Vietnam, with descriptions of five new species|journal= Parasite|volume= 21|pages= 53|doi=10.1051/parasite/2014052|pmid=25331738|pmc= 4204126|year= 2014}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Acanthocephala]]  or thorny-headed worms, or spiny-headed worms are characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis, armed with spines, which it uses to pierce and hold the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] wall of its host.

===Lepidoptera mouth parts===
The mouth parts of Lepidoptera mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part is known as the proboscis or 'haustellum'. The proboscis consists of two tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. The proboscis contains muscles for operating. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction takes place due to the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, W. H. (1927) [https://archive.org/details/TheIdentificationOfIndianButterflies ''Identification of Indian Butterflies''], The Diocesan press. Introduction, pp. 1–35.&lt;/ref&gt; A specific example of the proboscis being used for feeding is in the species ''[[Deilephila elpenor]]''. In this species, the moth hovers in front of the flower and extends its long proboscis to attain its food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ysJZBhHe8IcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=deilephila+elpenor+behavior&amp;ots=9TR2zzjB9D&amp;sig=CX-9_8O0fOOD2JXuJBeOMn6JF0A#v=onepage&amp;q=deilephila%20elpenor%20behavior&amp;f=false|title=From Animals to Animats 7: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior|last=Hallam|first=Bridget|last2=Floreano|first2=Dario|last3=Hallam|first3=John|last4=Hayes|first4=Gillian|last5=Meyer|first5=Jean-Arcady|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262582179|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few Lepidoptera species lack mouth parts and therefore do not feed in the [[imago]].  Others, such as the family [[Micropterigidae]], have mouth parts of the chewing kind.&lt;ref name=tj&gt;Charles A. Triplehorn and Norman F. Johnson (2005). ''Borror and Delong's Introduction to the Study of Insects'' (7th edition).  Thomson Brooks/Cole, Belmont, CA.  {{ISBN|0-03-096835-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertebrates==
The [[elephant]]'s trunk, which is by far its most useful appendage, and the [[tapir]]'s elongated nose are called "proboscis", as is the snout of the male [[elephant seal]].

The [[proboscis monkey]] is named for its enormous nose.

An abnormal facial appendage that sometimes accompanies ocular and nasal abnormalities in [[human]]s is also called a proboscis.

Notable mammals with some form of proboscis are:
* [[Aardvark]]
* [[Anteater]]
* Members of the [[elephant]] family (see [[Elephant#Trunk|elephant trunk]])
* [[Elephant shrew]]s
* [[Hispaniolan solenodon]]
* [[Echidna]]
* [[Elephant seal]]
* ''[[Leptictidium]]'' (extinct)
* ''[[Macrauchenia]]'' (extinct)
* ''[[Moeritherium]]'' (extinct)
* ''[[Palorchestes]]'' (extinct)
* [[Numbat]]
* [[Proboscis monkey]]
* [[Saiga]]
* [[Tapir]]

== Computational complexity ==
{{Main|quantum complexity theory}}
[[Computational complexity theory|Complexity]] arguments concern how the amount of some resource needed to solve a problem scales with the size of the input to that problem. As an extension of classical [[computational complexity theory]], [[quantum complexity theory]] is about what a working, [[Quantum Turing machine|universal quantum computer]] could accomplish without necessarily accounting for the difficulty of building one or dealing with [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]] and noise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30440-3_428 |title=Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science |last=Watrous |first=John |date=2009 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9780387758886 |editor-last=Meyers |editor-first=Robert A. |pages=7174–7201 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-30440-3_428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[quantum information]] is a generalization of [[Physical information|classical information]], it is clear that a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]] can efficiently simulate any [[Algorithm|classical algorithm]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[BQP|Bounded quantum polynomial]] (BQP) is the class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a [[Quantum Turing machine|universal quantum computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last=Tereza |first=Tusarova |date=2004-09-26 |title=Quantum Complexity Classes |arxiv=cs/0409051}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to important classical complexity classes by the hierarchy&lt;math&gt;P\subseteq BPP\subseteq BQP\subseteq PSPACE&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Vazirani |first=Umesh |title=A Survey of Quantum Complexity Theory |url=https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~lomonaco/ams/lecturenotes/Vazirani.pdf |journal=Proceedings of Symposia in Applied Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether any of these containments is proper is still an open question.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Contrary to decision problems that require yes or no answers, sampling problems ask for samples from [[probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lund |first=A.

{{Main|Boson sampling}}
This computing paradigm based upon identical [[photon]]s sent through a [[Linear optical quantum computing|linear-optical network]] can solve certain sampling and search problems that, assuming a few conjectures, are intractable for classical computers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, it has been shown that [[Boson sampling|BosonSampling]] in a system with large enough loss and noise can be simulated efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahimi-Keshari|first=Saleh|last2=Ralph|first2=Timothy C.|last3=Caves|first3=Carlton M.|date=2016-06-20|title=Sufficient Conditions for Efficient Classical Simulation of Quantum Optics|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.021039|journal=Physical Review X|volume=6|issue=2|pages=021039|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.6.021039|bibcode=2016PhRvX...6b1039R|arxiv=1511.06526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''snow leopard''' or '''ounce''' (''Panthera uncia'') is a large [[Felidae|cat]] native to the mountain ranges of [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. It is listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] because the global population is estimated to number less than 10,000 mature individuals and decline about 10% in the next 23 years. As of 2016, the global population was estimated at 4,678 to 8,745 mature individuals.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyhus&gt;{{cite book |author=Nyhus, P. |author2=McCarthy, T. |author3=Mallon, D. |year=2016 |title=Snow Leopards.

The snow leopard inhabits [[Alpine climate|alpine]] and [[subalpine zone|subalpine]] zones at elevations from {{Convert|3000|to|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ranging from eastern Afghanistan to Mongolia and western China. In the northern range countries, it also occurs at lower elevations.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2003"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.snowleopardnetwork.org/docs/slss_full.pdf |title=Snow Leopard Survival Strategy |publisher=International Snow Leopard Trust and Snow Leopard Network |year=2003 |editor-last1=McCarthy |editor-first1=T.

[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomically]], the snow leopard was initially classified in the [[monotypic genus]] ''Uncia''.&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft |page=548|id=14000269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, it is considered a member of the genus ''[[Panthera]]'' based on results of [[Genetics|genetic]] studies. Two subspecies were described based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences, but genetic differences between the two have not been confirmed.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; It is therefore regarded a [[monotypic species]].&lt;ref name=catsg&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kitchener, A.

== Naming and etymology ==
Both the [[Latin]]ized [[specific epithet (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''uncia'' and the occasional English name ''ounce'' are derived from the [[Old French]] ''once'', originally used for the [[European lynx]]. ''Once'' itself is believed to have arisen by [[false splitting]] from an earlier variant of ''lynx'', ''lonce''&amp;nbsp;– where ''lonce'' was interpreted as ''l'once'', in which ''l{{'}}'' is the [[Elision|elided form]] of the French definite article ''la'' ('the'), leaving ''once'' to be perceived as the animal's name. This, like the English version ''ounce'', came to be used for other lynx-sized cats, and eventually for the snow leopard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=214|url=https://archive.org/stream/publications23modeuoft#page/214/mode/1up|author=Allen, Edward A |title=English Doublets |volume='''23''' (New Series '''16''')|year=1908|journal=Publications of the Modern Language Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Oxford University Press. 1933: Ounce&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''panther'' derives from [[classical Latin]] ''panthēra'', itself from the [[ancient Greek]] ''pánthēr'' (πάνθηρ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Liddell, H. G. |author2=R. Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2377441 |title=πάνθηρ |work=A Greek-English Lexicon, revised and augmented |year=1940 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
[[File:Two cladograms for Panthera.svg|thumbnail|left|Two cladograms proposed for ''Panthera''. The upper cladogram is based on two studies published in 2006 and 2009;.,&lt;ref name="johnson2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="werdelin2009"/&gt; the lower one is based on studies published in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="davis2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mazak2011"/&gt;]]
The snow leopard was first [[Scientific description|described]] by the German naturalist [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] on the basis of an illustration in his 1777 publication ''Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen''. Schreber named the cat ''Felis uncia'' and gave its [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] as [[Barbary]], [[Persia]], [[East India]], and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scheber |first1=J.C.D. |chapter=Die Unze |title=Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen |date=1777 |pages=386–387 |location=Erlangen |publisher=Wolfgang Walther |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/SaYugthiereAbbiIIISchr#page/386/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] proposed the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''Uncia'', to which he subordinated the snow leopard under the name ''Uncia irbis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=J.E. |title=The ounces|journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |date=1854 |volume=2nd series |issue=14 |page=394 |url=https://archive.org/stream/annalsmagazineof34lond#page/394/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; British zoologist [[Reginald Innes Pocock]] corroborated this classification, but attributed the scientific name ''Uncia uncia''. He also described morphological differences between snow leopards and the then-accepted ''Panthera'' [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pocock | first1 = R. I. | year=1930 | title = The panthers and ounces of Asia. Part II. The panthers of Kashmir, India, and Ceylon | journal = Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society | volume = 34 |issue=2 |pages=307–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subspecies ===
Following Schreber's description of the species, several snow leopard [[subspecies]] were proposed:&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt;
* ''U. u. uncia'' in Mongolia and Russia;
* ''U. u. uncioides'' in western China and the Himalayas;
* ''U. u. baikalensis-romanii'' was proposed for a population living in the southern [[Transbaikal]] region;&lt;ref&gt;Medvedev, D. G. (2000).

Vestnik Irkutskoi Gosudarstvennoi sel'skokhozyaistvennoi akademyi [Proceedings of Irkutsk State Agricultural Academy], vypusk 20: 20–30. (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until spring 2017, there was no evidence available for recognition of subspecies.&lt;ref name=catsg/&gt;
Results of a [[phylogeography|phylogeographic]] study published in September 2017 indicate that three subspecies should be recognised: ''P. u. uncia'' in the [[Pamir Mountains]] range countries, ''P. u. uncioides'' in the Himalayas and Qinghai, and ''P. u. irbis'' in Mongolia.&lt;ref name=Janecka2017&gt;{{cite journal |author=Janecka, J.E., Zhang, Y., Li, D., Munkhtsog, B., Bayaraa, M., Galsandorj, N., Wangchuk, T.R., Karmacharya, D., Li, J., Lu, Z. and Uulu, K.Z. |year=2017 |journal=Journal of Heredity |title=Range-Wide Snow Leopard Phylogeography Supports Three Subspecies |volume=108 |issue=6 |pages=597−607 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esx044|pmid=28498961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phylogeny ===
The snow leopard is part of the ''Panthera'' lineage, one of the eight lineages of Felidae. This lineage comprises the species of ''Panthera'' and ''Neofelis''. The [[Neofelis]] lineage diverged first from the remainder of the Felinae. Subsequent branching between the snow leopard and [[clouded leopard]] began two to three million years ago, but the details of this are disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=A. |url=https://journals.co.za/content/nfi_annalstm/34/15/AJA00411752_121|title=New fossil carnivore remains from the Sterkfontein hominid site (Mammalia: Carnivora) |journal=Annals of the Transvaal Museum |date=1987 |volume=34|pages=319–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of a [[phylogenetic]] study published in 2006, based on [[nDNA]] and [[mtDNA]] analysis, indicate that snow leopard and [[tiger]] are [[sister taxa]], whereas the leopard is sister taxon to two [[clade]]s within ''Panthera'' – one consisting of the tiger and the snow leopard, and the other of the [[lion]] and the [[jaguar]].&lt;ref name="johnson2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=W.E.|last2=Eizirik|first2=E.|last3=Pecon-Slattery |first3=J.|last4=Murphy |first4=W.J.|last5=Antunes|first5=A. |last6=Teeling|first6=E.|last7=O'Brien|first7=S.J. |title=The late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: a genetic assessment|journal=Science |year=2006 |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=73–77 |pmid=16400146 |doi=10.1126/science.1122277 |bibcode=2006Sci...311...73J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of a similar study published in 2009 corroborated this assessment.&lt;ref name="werdelin2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Werdelin |first1=L. |last2=Yamaguchi |first2=N. |last3=Johnson |first3=W.E. |last4=O'Brien |first4=S.J. |title=Phylogeny and evolution of cats (Felidae) |journal=Biology and Conservation of Wild Felids |year=2010 |pages=59–82 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266755142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results obtained during two subsequent phylogenetic studies indicate a swapping in the cladogram between the leopard and the jaguar.&lt;ref name="davis2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=B.W. |last2=Li |first2=G. |last3=Murphy |first3=W.J. |title=Supermatrix and species tree methods resolve phylogenetic relationships within the big cats, ''Panthera'' (Carnivora: Felidae) |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |year=2010 |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=64–76 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.01.036 |url=http://web.csulb.edu/~acarter3/course-evolution/files/cat-phylogeny.pdf |pmid=20138224 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305131606/http://web.csulb.edu/~acarter3/course-evolution/files/cat-phylogeny.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mazak2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mazák|first1=J.H.|last2=Christiansen |first2=P. |last3=Kitchener |first3=A.C. |last4=Goswami |first4=A. |title=Oldest known pantherine skull and evolution of the tiger |journal=PLoS ONE |year=2011 |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=e25483 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0025483|pmid=22016768|pmc=3189913|bibcode=2011PLoSO...625483M}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study indicates that, at some point in their evolution, snow leopards interbred with lions, as their [[mitochondrial genome]]s are more similar to each other than their [[nuclear genome]]s.

The snow leopard's fur is whitish to gray with black spots on head and neck, but larger rosettes on the back, flanks and bushy tail. The belly is whitish. The fur is thick with hairs between {{convert|5|and|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Its body is stocky, short-legged and slightly smaller than the other cats of the genus ''Panthera'', reaching a shoulder height of {{convert|56|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and ranging in head to body size from {{Convert|75|to|150|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in a cold, mountainous environment. Its body is stocky, its fur is thick, and its ears are small and rounded, features that help to minimize heat loss. Its broad paws well distribute the body weight for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase their grip on steep and unstable surfaces; it also helps to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps to maintain balance in the rocky terrain. The tail is also very thick due to fat storage, and is very thickly covered with fur, which allows the cat to use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep.&lt;ref name=NatGeog&gt;{{cite web |work=National Geographic |date=2008 |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/06/snow-leopards/chadwick-text/1 |title=Out of the Shadows |first=D.

The snow leopard cannot [[Roar (utterance)|roar]], despite possessing partial [[ossification]] of the [[hyoid bone]].

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Snow Leopard in Ladakh( Photo by Tashi Lonchay).jpg|alt=Spotted this elusive predators in ladakh|thumb|In [[Ladakh]], India]]
The snow leopard is distributed from the west of [[Lake Baikal]] through southern [[Siberia]], in the [[Kunlun Mountains]], in the Russian [[Altai mountains]], [[Sayan Mountains|Sayan]] and [[Tannu-Ola Mountains]], in the [[Tian Shan]], across [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] to the [[Hindu Kush]] in eastern [[Afghanistan]], [[Karakoram]] in northern [[Pakistan]], in the [[Pamir Mountains]], and in the high altitudes of the [[Himalaya]]s in [[India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]], and the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. In [[Mongolia]], it is found in the Mongolian and Gobi [[Altai Mountains]] and the [[Khangai Mountains]]. In [[Tibet]], it is found up to the [[Altyn-Tagh]] in the north.&lt;ref name=McCarthy2003 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Geptner, V. G. |author2=Sludskii, A.

Potential snow leopard habitat in the [[India]]n Himalayas is estimated at less than {{convert|90000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Sikkim]], and [[Arunachal Pradesh]], of which about {{convert|34000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is considered good habitat, and 14.4% is protected. In the beginning of the 1990s, the Indian snow leopard population was estimated at roughly 200–600 individuals living across about 25 [[Protected areas in India|protected areas]].&lt;ref name=McCarthy2003 /&gt;

In summer, snow leopards usually live above the [[tree line]] on mountainous meadows and in rocky regions at altitudes from {{Convert|2700|to|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In winter, they come down into the forests to altitudes around {{Convert|1200|to|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Snow leopards prefer rocky, broken terrain, and can travel without difficulty in snow up to {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep, although they prefer to use existing trails made by other animals.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt;

[[Global warming]] has caused the tree line to be increased in altitude, resulting in the decrease of wild prey that depend on the plants for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scidev.net/south-asia/environment/news/climate-change-stalks-the-snow-leopard.html|title= Climate change stalks the snow leopard|last1= Ebrahim|first1= Zofeen|date= May 5, 2015|website= scidev.net|publisher= |access-date= May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population ===
Before 2003, the total wild snow leopard population was estimated at 4,080 to 6,500 individuals.&lt;ref name=McCarthy2003 /&gt; In 2016, the global population was estimated at 4,678 to 8,745 individuals, suggesting that the total number of snow leopards was larger than previously thought.&lt;ref name=nyhus /&gt;

== Ecology and behavior ==
[[File:Uncia uncia.jpg|thumb|upright|Walking in the [[snow]]]]
The snow leopard is solitary, except for females with cubs. They rear them in dens in the mountains for extended periods.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

An individual snow leopard lives within a well-defined home range, but does not defend its territory aggressively when encroached upon by other snow leopards.{{disputed-inline|reason=The National Geographic article claims otherwise|date=November 2018}} Home ranges vary greatly in size. In Nepal, where prey is abundant, a home range may be as small as {{Convert|12|km2|sqmi|0|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|40|km2|sqmi|0|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and up to five to 10 animals are found here per {{Convert|100|km2|sqmi|0|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}; in habitats with sparse prey, though, an area of {{Convert|1000|km2|sqmi|0|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} supports only five of these cats.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; However, a new study lasting from 2008 to 2014 indicates their ranges are much greater than believed; a male snow leopard requires a territory of around 80 square miles, while females require up to 48 square miles of territory. Taking this data into account, it is estimated that 40 percent of the 170 protected areas in place are smaller than the space required to support a single male snow leopard. This study also says the leopards defend their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/snow-leopards-huge-territories-asia/|title=One Snow Leopard Needs a Protected Range Bigger Than Aruba|date=21 September 2016|publisher=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other cats, snow leopards use [[scent mark]]s to indicate their territories and common travel routes. These are most commonly produced by scraping the ground with the hind feet before depositing [[urine]] or [[feces|scat]], but they also [[spraying (animal behavior)|spray urine]] onto sheltered patches of rock.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt;

Snow leopards are [[crepuscular]], being most active at dawn and dusk.&lt;ref name=Trust /&gt; They are known for being extremely secretive and well camouflaged.

The snow leopard is a [[carnivore]] and actively [[Hunting|hunt]]s its prey. It is an opportunistic hunter and also eats [[carrion]]. It can kill animals two to four times its own weight, such as [[Himalayan blue sheep]], [[Himalayan tahr]], [[markhor]], [[argali]], [[horse]], and [[camel]].&lt;ref name="Johansson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johansson |first=Ö. |last2=McCarthy |first2=T. |last3=Samelius, G.; Andrén, H.; Tumursukh, L: Mishra, C. |first3=Gustaf |last4=Andrén |first4=Henrik |last5=Tumursukh |first5=Lkhagvasumberel |last6=Mishra |first6=Charudutt |year= 2015|title= Snow leopard predation in a livestock dominated landscape in Mongolia |url=http://snowleopardnetwork.org/bibliography/Johansson_et_al_2015.pdf |journal= Biological Conservation |volume=184 |pages=251–258 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.02.003|access-date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It prefers prey ranging in weight from {{convert|36|to|76|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but also hunts smaller mammals such as [[marmot]], [[pika]] and [[vole]] species.&lt;ref name=Lyngdoh2014&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prey preferences of the snow leopard (''Panthera uncia''): regional diet specificity holds global significance for conservation |authors=Lyngdoh, S., Shrotriya, S., Goyal, S.P., Clements, H., Hayward, M.W. and Habib, B. |year=2014 |journal=PLoS One |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=e88349|pmid=24533080 |pmc=3922817 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0088349 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...988349L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow leopards prefer to [[ambush]] prey from above, using broken terrain to conceal their approach. They will actively pursue prey down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of their initial leap to chase animals for up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}. They kill with a bite to the neck, and may drag the prey to a safe location before feeding. They consume all edible parts of the carcass, and can survive on a single bharal for two weeks before hunting again. Annual prey needs appears to be 20–30 adult blue sheep.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt;

The snow leopard is capable of killing most animals in its range, with the probable exception of the adult male [[yak]]. It  also eats a significant amount of vegetation, including grass and twigs.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt; Snow leopards have been recorded to hunt in pairs successfully, especially mating pairs.&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Behavioural analysis of solitary versus socially housed snow leopards (''Panthera uncia''), with the provision of simulated social contact |author1=Macri, A.

The diet of the snow leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on [[prey]] availability. In the [[Himalayas]], it preys mostly on Himalayan blue sheep and [[Siberian ibex]]. In the [[Karakoram]], [[Tian Shan]], [[Altai mountains|Altai]] and Mongolia's Tost Mountains, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex, [[Thorold's deer]], [[Siberian roe deer]] and [[argali]].&lt;ref name=Lyngdoh2014/&gt;&lt;ref name= Shehzad2012&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prey Preference of Snow Leopard (''Panthera uncia'') in South Gobi, Mongolia |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032104 |year=2012|authors=Shehzad, W., McCarthy, T.M., Pompanon, F., Purevjav, L., Coissac, E., Riaz, T. and Taberlet, P. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=2 |page=e32104 |pmid=22393381 |pmc=3290533 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732104S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species hunted when available include [[red panda]], [[wild boar]], [[langur monkey]], [[snow cock]] and [[Chukar partridge]].&lt;ref name=Trust /&gt;

Where snow leopards prey on domestic [[livestock]], they are subject to conflict with humans.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; However, even in Mongolia, where wild prey has been reduced, and interactions with humans are common, domestic livestock, mainly [[domestic sheep]], comprises less than 20% of snow leopard diet.&lt;ref name= Shehzad2012 /&gt; Herders kill snow leopards to prevent them from taking their livestock.&lt;ref name=NatGeog /&gt; The loss of prey animals due to overgrazing by domestic livestock, poaching, and defense of livestock are the major drivers for the decreasing population of the snow leopard. The snow leopard has not been reported to attack humans, and appears to be the least aggressive to humans of all big cats. As a result, they are easily driven away from livestock; they readily abandon their kills when threatened, and may not even defend themselves when attacked.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt;

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===

}}
Snow leopards become sexually mature at two to three years, and normally live for 15–18 years in the wild. In captivity they can live for up to 25 years. [[Oestrus]] typically lasts from five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time. Paired snow leopards mate in [[Lordosis behavior|the usual felid posture]], from 12 to 36 times a day. They are unusual among large cats in that they have a well-defined birth peak. They usually [[mating|mate]] in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Females have a [[gestation period]] of 90–100 days, so the cubs are born between April and June.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt;

[[Generation time|Generation length]] of the snow leopard is eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Generation length for mammals |author=Pacifici, M., Santini, L., Di Marco, M., Baisero, D., Francucci, L., Grottolo Marasini, G., Visconti, P. and Rondinini, C. |journal=Nature Conservation |year=2013 |issue=5 |pages=87–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother gives birth in a rocky den or crevice lined with fur shed from her underside. [[Litter (animal)|Litter]] sizes vary from one to five [[List of animal names|cubs]], but the average is 2.2. The cubs are blind and helpless at birth, although already with a thick coat of fur, and weigh from {{convert|320|to|567|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Their eyes open at around seven days, and the cubs can walk at five weeks and are fully weaned by 10 weeks.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt; Also when they are born, they have full black spots which turn into rosettes as they grow to adolescence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The cubs leave the den when they are around two to four months of age, but remain with their mother until they become independent after around 18–22 months. Once independent, they disperse over considerable distances, even crossing wide expanses of flat terrain to seek out new hunting grounds. This likely helps reduce the inbreeding that would otherwise be common in their relatively isolated environments.&lt;ref name=WCoW /&gt;

== Threats ==
The major threat to snow leopard populations is [[poaching]] and illegal trade of skins and body parts. In China, 103 to 236 animals are poached every year, in Mongolia between 34 and 53, in Pakistan between 23 and 53, in India from 21 to 45, and in Tajikistan 20 to 25. Poaching is linked to prey declines and livestock depredation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nowell, K., Li, J., Paltsyn, M. and Sharma, R.K. |year=2016 |title=An Ounce of Prevention: Snow Leopard Crime Revisited |publisher=TRAFFIC |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-1-85850-409-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
Numerous agencies are working to conserve the snow leopard and its threatened mountain ecosystems. These include the [[Snow Leopard Trust]], the [[Snow Leopard Conservancy]], the Snow Leopard Network, the Cat Specialist Group, and the [[Panthera Corporation]].

These groups and various national governments from the snow leopard’s range, nonprofits, and donors from around the world worked together at the 10th International Snow Leopard Conference in Beijing. Their focus on research, community programs in snow leopard regions, and education programs are aimed at understanding the cat's needs, as well as the needs of the villagers and herder communities juxtaposed with the snow leopards' habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Theile, Stephanie (2003).

=== Global Snow Leopard Forum ===
In 2013, government leaders and officials from all 12 countries encompassing the snow leopard's range (Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) came together at the Global Snow Leopard Forum (GSLF) initiated by the President Almazbek Atambayev of the Kyrgyz Republic, and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under the government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The meeting was held in Bishkek, the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, and all countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain habitat it lives in need trans-boundary support to ensure a viable future for snow leopard populations, as well as to safeguard their fragile environment. The event brought together many partners, including [[Non-governmental organisation|NGOs]] like the [[Snow Leopard Conservancy]], the [[Snow Leopard Trust]], and the [[Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union]]. Also supporting the initiative were the Snow Leopard Network, the [[World Bank]]'s [[Global Tiger Initiative]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the [[World Wild Fund for Nature]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]], and [[Global Environment Facility]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==== Bishkek Declaration ====
At the GSLF meeting, the 12 range countries signed the Bishkek Declaration to "acknowledge that the snow leopard is an irreplaceable symbol of our nations' natural and cultural heritage and an indicator of the health and sustainability of mountain ecosystems; and we recognize that mountain ecosystems inhabited by snow leopards provide essential [[ecosystem services]], including storing and releasing water from the origins of river systems benefitting one-third of the world’s human population; sustaining the pastoral and agricultural livelihoods of local communities which depend on biodiversity for food, fuel, fodder, and medicine; and offering inspiration, recreation, and economic opportunities."

==== Global Snow Leopard and Eco-system Protection Program ====
Out of these efforts was formed a cooperative support effort, the Global Snow Leopard and Eco-system Protection Program (GSLEP). The GSLEP is a joint initiative of range country governments, international agencies, civil society, and the private sector. Its goal is to secure the long-term survival of the snow leopard in its natural ecosystem.

The goal of the GSLEP is for the 12 snow leopard range countries, with support from conservation agencies, NGOs and others to work together to identify and secure at least 20 healthy populations of snow leopards across the cat’s range by 2020, or "20 by 2020". Many of these populations will cross international boundaries.

The three criteria that will secure healthy populations of snow leopards are populations that represent at least 100 breeding age snow leopards, contain adequate and secure prey populations and have connectivity to other snow leopard populations.

This is an interim goal for the years through to 2020. During the coming years, agreement will be reached on the steps needed to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring that healthy snow leopard populations remain the icon of the mountains of Asia for generations to come.

=== 2015 designated International Year of the Snow Leopard ===
To help spread the word amongst the people, government authorities, and conservation groups in each range country, 2015 was designated the International Year of the Snow Leopard as part of the GSLEPP's work. All range-country governments, nongovernmental and inter-governmental organizations, local communities, and various private sector businesses pledged to take the year as an opportunity to further work towards conservation of snow leopards and their high-mountain ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snowleopardblog.com/?p=5010 "International Year of the Snow Leopard"], Saving Snow Leopards Report (2015-02-06).

A 2008 ''[[Natural World (TV series)|Natural World]]'' episode, "Snow Leopard – Beyond the Myth", interviewed a couple with a goat farm in Pakistan; the woman was bowled over by a snow leopard escaping an enclosure where it had been feeding on the livestock, but she was not attacked by the cat, despite fainting and being helpless. The film crew went to some lengths to demonstrate that the cat was primarily hunting wild prey and was often ranging far outside the area, as they hoped to prevent local farmers from shooting it. Nevertheless, they also found evidence of other sightings of the cats around nearby human settlements, and of repeated attacks on livestock (some of them unsuccessful).&lt;ref name="Natural World"&gt;{{cite video |date=4 January 2008 |title=Snow Leopard – Beyond the Myth |episodelink=List of Natural World episodes |series=Natural World |serieslink=Natural World (TV series) |seriesno=26 |number=1 |network=[[BBC Two]] |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow leopards attacking livestock has also been a subject of conservation journal papers.&lt;ref name="Johansson" /&gt;

=== In culture ===
[[File:Ounce1.jpg|thumb|Ounce]]
Snow leopards have symbolic meaning for [[Turkic peoples]] of Central Asia, where the animal is known as ''irbis'' or ''bars'', so it is widely used in [[heraldry]] and as an emblem.

The snow leopard in heraldry is sometimes known in English as the ''ounce''. The cat has long been used as a political symbol, the ''[[Aq Bars]]'' ('White Leopard'), by [[Tatars]], [[Kazakhs]], and [[Bulgars]], among others. A snow leopard is found on the official seal of the city of [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, and the former 10,000 [[Kazakhstani tenge]] banknote also featured one on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]. A mythical winged ''Aq Bars'' is found in the national [[coat of arms of Tatarstan]], the seal of the city of [[Samarqand]], [[Uzbekistan]], and (also with a crown) the old coat of arms of the Kazakh capital, [[Astana]]. In [[Kyrgyzstan]], it has been used in highly stylized form in the modern emblem of the capital, [[Bishkek]], and the same art has been integrated into the badge of the [[Scouting in Kyrgyzstan#Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association|Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association]]. A crowned snow leopard features in the arms of [[Shushensky District]], [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Russia]].

The [[Snow Leopard award]], given to Soviet mountaineers who scaled all five of the [[Soviet Union]]'s 7,000-meter peaks, is named after the animal, but does not depict one.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The cat is the [[List of Indian state animals|state animal]] of [[Himachal Pradesh]], a north [[India]]n state in the western [[Himalayas]]. The animal has also been declared the "[[List of national animals|National Predator]]" of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/national_symbols.html|title=The Official Web Gateway to Pakistan|website=www.pakistan.gov.pk|access-date=2016-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128073024/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/national_symbols.html|archivedate=2016-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the media ===

==== Documentary ====
Documentary footage of the snow leopard is scarce. While such coverage would not be remarkable with regard to common species, wildlife video of the snow leopard is difficult to obtain due to the animal's rarity and the human inaccessibility of much of its natural habitat.&lt;ref name="Natural World" /&gt;

The [[BBC One]] TV series ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'' had a segment on snow leopards. The series took some of the first video of snow leopards in the wild, and also featured a snow leopard hunting a [[markhor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/02_february/01/earth_firsts.shtml Press Office – Planet Earth firsts]. BBC (2006-02-01). Retrieved 2012-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode ''Mountains'' of ''[[Planet Earth II]]'', aired in November 2016, featured the rather violent mating fights of snow leopards, as well as a snow leopard's chuffing and wailing.

Nisar Malik, a Pakistani journalist, and Mark Smith, a cameraman who had worked on the ''Planet Earth'' segment, spent a further 18 months filming snow leopards in the [[Hindu Kush]] for the [[BBC Two]] series ''[[Natural World]]'' episode "Snow Leopard – Beyond the Myth".&lt;ref name="Natural World" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mcdq BBC Two – Natural World, 2007–2008, Snow Leopard- Beyond the Myth]. BBC.co.uk (2008-09-23). Retrieved 2012-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The cat has been featured in segments of other episodes of the same series.

The [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]]/[[WNET]] series ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]'' focused on the species in its episode "Silent Roar: Searching for the Snow Leopard".

A snow leopard named Dawa along with her cubs is one of the focal points of the 2017 [[Disneynature]] film ''[[Born in China]]''.

==== Non-fiction ====
In [[Peter Matthiessen]]'s 1978 travelogue ''[[The Snow Leopard]]'', he recounts his two-month search with naturalist [[George Schaller]] for snow leopards in Nepal.

==== Fictional ====
In Philip Pullman's 1995–2000 fantasy trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', Lord Asriel's dæmon is a snow leopard named Stelmaria.

Tai Lung, the main antagonist of the 2008 film ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] snow leopard.

In the 2013 film ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'', photojournalist Sean O'Connell (played by [[Sean Penn]]) is shown photographing snow leopards in Afghanistan.

'''''Syntagma Musicum''''' is a book by the German musicologist [[Michael Praetorius]], published in [[Wittenberg]] and [[Wolfenbüttel]] in three parts between 1614 and 1620. It is one of the most commonly used research sources for the music theory of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Herbert2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Trevor|title=The Trombone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy8bhvi2-j8C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=28 March 2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10095-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second work ''De Organographia'' illustrates and describes musical instruments and their use; becoming a valuable resource for the research and reconstruction of early instruments.

The three volumes (a fourth was in progress but never published) were:

[[Image:Tecnology Life Cycle.png|right|frame|The typical life-cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise. The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime.]]

The '''technology life-cycle''' ('''TLC''') describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase, and the financial return during its "vital life". Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) while in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nInjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=The+technology+underlying+the+product+(for+example,+that+of+a+uniquely+flavoured+tea)+may+be+quite+marginal+but+the+process+of+creating+and+managing+its+life+as+a#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20technology%20underlying%20the%20product%20(for%20example%2C%20that%20of%20a%20uniquely%20flavoured%20tea)%20may%20be%20quite%20marginal%20but%20the%20process%20of%20creating%20and%20managing%20its%20life%20as%20a&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of IAC-MEM 2015 in Vienna|last=group of authors|publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education z.s., 2015|year=2015|isbn=9788090579156|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle (PLC) dealt with in [[product life-cycle management]]. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction, marketing measures, and business costs. The ''technology'' underlying the product (for example, that of a uniquely flavoured tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different. 

The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost, and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with [[patents]] and [[trademark]]s seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it.

The ''product'' of the technology may be a commodity such as [[polyethylene]] plastic or a sophisticated product like the [[integrated circuit]]s used in a [[smartphone]].

The development of a ''competitive product'' or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the ''management'' of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development.

Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the [[technological maturity]] of a product. This is not similar to a [[product life cycle management|product life cycle]], but applies to an entire technology, or a generation of a technology.

Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle. After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes, producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult, as the [[mature technology|technology matures]].

==The four phases of the technology life-cycle==
The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases:
#The '''research and development  (R&amp;D)''' phase (sometimes called the "bleeding edge") when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high 
#The '''ascent''' phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the "leading edge") 
#The '''maturity''' phase when gain is high and stable, the region, going into saturation, marked by M, and 
#The '''decline''' (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology.

===S-curve===
The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.improvementandinnovation.com/features/article/understanding-s-curve-innovation/|accessdate=15 October 2012|title=Understanding S-curve Innovation|journal=Improvementandinnovation.com|author=Dr. Chandana Jayalath|date=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology perception dynamics==
There is usually [[technology hype]] at the introduction of any new technology, but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim.
Because of the [[logistic curve]] nature of technology adoption, it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive.

The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming eternal [[exponential growth]]
* fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing

[[Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Rogers' bell curve|300px]]
Similarly, in the later stages, the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of [[mature technology|technology maturity]] and [[market saturation]].

The [[technology adoption life cycle]] typically occurs in an S curve, as modelled in [[diffusion of innovations]] theory. This is because customers respond to new products in different ways. Diffusion of innovations theory, pioneered by [[Everett Rogers]], posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new [[innovation]]s and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption. Rogers classified individuals into five groups: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. In terms of the S curve, innovators occupy 2.5%, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, late majority 34%, and laggards 16%.

The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/20309856/Technology-Management-Growth-Lifecycle Technology Management - Growth &amp; Lifecycle], Shahid kv, Sep 28, 2009, Attribution Non-commercial&lt;/ref&gt;
*Innovation stage: This stage represents the birth of a new product, material of process resulting from R&amp;D activities. In R&amp;D laboratories, new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors. Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element, the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely.
*Syndication stage: This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology, such as, product, material or process with potential for immediate utilisation. Many innovations are put on hold in R&amp;D laboratories. Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised. Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical, mostly economic factors.
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] stage: This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation, by potential users of the technology. But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion.
*Substitution stage: This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology, due to replacement by another technology. Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution. The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics.

==Licensing options==
Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later.&lt;ref&gt;Bayus, B. (1998). An Analysis of Product Lifetimes in a Technologically Dynamic Industry. Management Science, 44(6), pp.763-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing in the R&amp;D phase===
There are always smaller firms ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&amp;D in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions,  substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats. Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk (e.g. aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained.

In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as [[venture capitalists]] or business angels, can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&amp;D, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital.

Larger firms may opt for Joint R&amp;D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called [[strategic alliance]]s – strategic partnerships.
 
With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change.

In the case  of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of  technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through [[Initial Public Offering|initial public offering]] (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed.

Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development.

===Licensing in the ascent phase ===
The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R&amp;D portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be ''as successful'' in that period. Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period.

The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare.

Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring ''not'' to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party.

===Licensing in the maturity phase===
The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity.

The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in [[joint venture]], typically in regions where the technology would be in the ''ascent phase'',as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy.

===Licensing in the decline phase===
After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life).

Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply, say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology.

The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as [[knowhow]] which could have a longer life if properly protected.

''It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs''. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations.

The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, ''may'' imply a declining technology.

In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated.

There are instances when, even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This  is often the  form that ''technical service'' and ''technical assistance'' contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

== Technology development cycle ==
According to the [[Encyclopedia of Earth]], "In the simplest formulation, innovation can be thought of as being composed of research, development, demonstration, and deployment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156452/|title=Technological Innovation|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]] |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Berlin key or how to do words with things'''" is an essay  by sociologist [[Bruno Latour]], that originally appeared as ''La clef de Berlin et autres lecons d'un amateur de sciences'', La Dècouverte, in 1993. "The Berlin key or how to do words with things" was later published   as the first chapter in P.M. Graves-''Brown's Matter, Materiality and Modern Culture''. In the 15-page chapter, written informally in third-person narrative, Latour describes a common object used in Berlin, a "Berlin Key" which is constructed so that after opening leaving one's apartment house, after unlocking the street door  from the inside, one can only retrieve the key from the outside in a manner which locks the door behind oneself; upon entering, after one unlocks the door with the key, one must retrieve it from the inside, again locking the door behind oneself; this prevents leaving the door open but unlocked. The essay  is organized to expose  deftly exposes how many layers of significance a unique key can connote.&lt;ref name=Ryzewski&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryzewski|first=Krista|title=The Berlin Key|url=https://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute//courses/13things/7444.html|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Latour&gt;{{cite web|last=Latour|first=Bruno|title=The Berlin Key or How to Do Words with Things|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-36-Berliner-KEY-GBpdf.pdf|publisher=Routledge|accessdate= 16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the P.M. Graves-Brown version, [[Lydia Davis]] translated the piece into English. Additional editing was completed and illustrations redrawn by PMGB.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt; The title could have been chosen as a witty word-play off of [[J.L. Austin]]'s ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]''.

Latour argues that while an object's purposefully designed material nature may recommend or permit a highly controlled set of functional purposes, it may also offer a broad range of valuable possibilities.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maycroft&gt;{{cite web|last=Maycroft|first=Neil|title=The objectness of everyday life: disburdenment or engagement?|url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/1258/1/Objects_and_Use.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour uses the Berlin key to show that there are social constraints which force people to do whatever it is that the object makes them do; thus, the object (the Berlin key) is a sign, of sorts, telling the inhabitants to 'lock their doors at night, but never during the day.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ying&gt;{{cite web|last=Ying|first=Jing|title=The Berlin key|url=https://jingalex.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/the-berlin-key/|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

Latour discusses the relationship between the social realm and the technological realm.  He asserts that the [[Sociologist]] and the Technologist are "enemy brothers", thinking they will come to an end—the sociologist with the social and the technologist with objects.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;

'''''The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham''''' is a book by biblical scholar [[Thomas L. Thompson]], Professor of Old Testament Studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]].

Together with [[John Van Seters]]'s [[Abraham in History and Tradition (book)|''Abraham in History and Tradition'']] (1975), this book marked the culmination of a growing current of dissatisfaction in scholarly circles with the then-current consensus (or near-consensus) on the Patriarchal narratives. The consensus can be summarized as the proposal that, even if archaeology could not directly confirm the existence of the patriarchs ([[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]), these Patriarchal narratives had originated in a second millennium BC setting because many personal names, place names, and customs referenced in the Genesis narratives were unique to that era. This view was expressed by [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] in his influential ''History of Israel'' (1959, 2nd edition 1960) in these words; "one is forced to the conclusion that the patriarchal narratives authentically reflect social customs at home in the second millennium rather than those of later Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/epn_4_selman.html#7 John Bright, "History of Israel", quoted in Martin J. Selman, "Comparative Customs and the Patriarchal Age"]&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson and Van Seters pointed out that, in fact, none of the archaeological evidence cited by the dominant scholars of the time (notably [[William F. Albright]], [[E. A. Speiser]], [[Cyrus Gordon]], and Bright himself) actually provided irrefutable proof for the historicity of the Patriarchal narratives. "Not only has archaeology not proven a single event of the patriarchal traditions to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely."&lt;ref&gt;"The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives", p.328, quoted in review by Dennis Pardee in [https://www.jstor.org/stable/545164 ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 36, No.3 (July 1977)]&lt;/ref&gt; Albright's reputation never quite recovered from the publication of Thompson's book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e1x9Rs_zdG8C&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=3o0u6HYPvz&amp;sig=elF1DM6SQWF_b3XmQ27aocIZXq0&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3DA%2BCentury%2Bof%2BBiblical%2BArchaeology%2Bby%2BRoger%2BMoorey%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title#PPA114,M1 P.R.F.

{{Thermoreg}}

'''Thermoregulation''' is the ability of an [[organism]] to keep its [[core temperature|body temperature]] within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of [[homeostasis]]: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from [[thermal equilibrium]] with its environment (the study of such processes in [[zoology]] has been called [[physiological ecology]]). If the body is unable to maintain a [[normal human body temperature|normal temperature]] and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as [[hyperthermia]] occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately {{convert|55|°C|°F}}, and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around {{convert|75|°C|°F}} death is almost inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the [[wet bulb temperature]] is sustained above {{convert|35|°C|°F}} for six hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155413.htm|title=  Global Warming: Future Temperatures Could Exceed Livable Limits, Researchers Find}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as [[hypothermia]]. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around  {{convert|37|°C|°F}}, and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than {{convert|35|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothermia/basics/definition/con-20020453|title=Hypothermia |work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hypothermia#1|title=Hypothermia: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the introduction of [[thermometer]]s that any exact data on the temperature of animals could be obtained. It was then found that local differences were present, since heat production and heat loss vary considerably in different parts of the body, although the circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature of the internal parts. Hence it is important to identify the parts of the body that most closely reflect the temperature of the [[internal organ]]s. Also, for such results to be comparable, the measurements must be conducted under comparable conditions. The [[rectum]] has traditionally been considered to reflect most accurately the temperature of internal parts, or in some cases of sex or species, the [[vagina]], [[uterus]] or [[Urinary bladder|bladder]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=48}}

Occasionally the temperature of the [[urine]] as it leaves the [[urethra]] may be of use in measuring [[core temperature|body temperature]]. More often the temperature is taken in the [[mouth]], [[axilla]], [[ear]] or [[groin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}}

Some animals undergo one of various forms of [[dormancy]] where the thermoregulation process temporarily allows the body temperature to drop, thereby conserving energy. Examples include [[Hibernation|hibernating]] [[bear]]s and [[torpor]] in [[bat]]s.

===Endothermy vs. ectothermy===
Thermoregulation in organisms runs along a spectrum from [[endotherm]]y to [[ectotherm]]y. [[Endotherm]]s create most of their heat via metabolic processes, and are colloquially referred to as [[Warm-Blooded|warm-blooded]]. When the surrounding temperatures are cold, endotherms increase metabolic heat production to keep their body temperature constant, thus making the internal body temperature of an endotherm more or less independent of the temperature of the environment.&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/principles-of-physiology/metabolism-and-thermoregulation/a/endotherms-ectotherms|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One metabolic activity, in terms of generating heat, that endotherms are able to do is that they possess a larger number of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms, enabling them to generate more heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars.&lt;ref name="Boundless"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boundless|date=2016-09-20|title=Homeostasis: Thermoregulation|url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/the-animal-body-basic-form-and-function-33/homeostasis-194/homeostasis-thermoregulation-743-11974/|journal=Boundless|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ectotherm]]s use external sources of temperature to regulate their body temperatures. They are colloquially referred to as [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] despite the fact that body temperatures often stay within the same temperature ranges as warm-blooded animals. Ectotherms are the opposite of endotherms when it comes to regulating internal temperatures. In ectotherms, the internal physiological sources of heat are of negligible importance; the biggest factor that enables them to maintain adequate body temperatures is due to environmental influences. Living in areas that maintain a constant temperature throughout the year, like the tropics or the ocean, have enabled ectotherms to develop a wide range of behavioral mechanisms that enable them to respond to external temperatures, such as sun-bathing to increase body temperature, or seeking the cover of shade to lower body temperature.&lt;ref name="Boundless"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"/&gt;

===Ectotherms===

[[File:BFAL SOTE shade.JPG|thumb|320px|Seeking shade is one method of cooling. Here [[sooty tern]] chicks are using a [[black-footed albatross]] chick for shade.]]

===Ectothermic cooling===
*Vaporization:
** [[Evaporation]] of sweat and other bodily fluids.
*Convection:
**Increasing blood flow to body surfaces to maximize heat transfer across the advective gradient.
*Conduction:
**Losing heat by being in contact with a colder surface. For instance:
***Lying on cool ground.
***Staying wet in a river, lake or sea.
***Covering in cool mud.
**
*Radiation:
**releasing heat by radiating it away from the body.

===Ectothermic heating (or minimizing heat loss)===
*Convection:
**Climbing to higher ground up trees, ridges, rocks.
**Entering a warm water or air current.
**Building an insulated nest or burrow.

Lizards are ectotherms and use behavioral adaptations to control their temperature. They regulate their behavior based on the temperature outside, if it is warm they will go outside up to a point and return to their burrow as necessary.]]
*Conduction:
**Lying on a hot surface.
*Radiation:
**Lying in the sun (heating this way is affected by the body's angle in relation to the sun).
**Folding skin to reduce exposure.
**Concealing wing surfaces.
**Exposing wing surfaces.
*Insulation:
**Changing shape to alter surface/volume ratio.
**Inflating the body.

To cope with low temperatures, some [[fish]] have developed the ability to remain functional even when the water temperature is below freezing; some use natural [[antifreeze]] or [[antifreeze proteins]] to resist ice crystal formation in their tissues. [[Amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s cope with heat loss by evaporative cooling and behavioral adaptations. An example of behavioral adaptation is that of a lizard lying in the sun on a hot rock in order to heat through conduction.

===Endothermy===

{{Main|Endotherm}}

An endotherm is an animal that regulates its own body temperature, typically by keeping it at a constant level. To regulate body temperature, an organism may need to prevent heat gains in arid environments. Evaporation of water, either across respiratory surfaces or across the skin in those animals possessing [[sweat glands]], helps in cooling body temperature to within the organism's tolerance range. Animals with a body covered by fur have limited ability to sweat, relying heavily on '''panting''' to increase evaporation of water across the moist surfaces of the lungs and the tongue and mouth. Mammals like cats, dogs and pigs, rely on panting or other means for thermal regulation and have sweat glands only in foot pads and snout. The sweat produced on pads of paws and on palms and soles mostly serves to increase friction and enhance grip. [[Bird]]s also counteract overheating by '''gular fluttering''', or rapid vibrations of the [[Gular skin|gular (throat) skin]]. [[Down feathers]] trap warm air acting as excellent insulators just as hair in mammals acts as a good insulator. Mammalian skin is much thicker than that of birds and often has a continuous layer of insulating fat beneath the dermis. In marine mammals, such as whales, or animals that live in very cold regions, such as the polar bears, this is called [[blubber]]. Dense coats found in desert endotherms also aid in preventing heat gain such as in the case of the camels.

A cold weather strategy is to temporarily decrease metabolic rate, decreasing the temperature difference between the animal and the air and thereby minimizing heat loss. Furthermore, having a lower metabolic rate is less energetically expensive. Many animals survive cold frosty nights through [[torpor]], a short-term temporary drop in body temperature. Organisms when presented with the problem of regulating body temperature have not only behavioural, physiological, and structural adaptations but also a feedback system to trigger these adaptations to regulate temperature accordingly. The main features of this system are ''stimulus, receptor, modulator, effector'' and then the feedback of the newly adjusted temperature to the ''stimulus.'' This cyclical process aids in homeostasis.

===Homeothermy compared with poikilothermy===
[[Homeothermy]] and [[poikilothermy]] refer to how stable an organism's deep-body temperature is. Most endothermic organisms are homeothermic, like [[mammal]]s. However, animals with [[facultative endothermy]] are often poikilothermic, meaning their temperature can vary considerably. Most [[fish]] are ectotherms, as most of their heat comes from the surrounding water. However, almost all fish are poikilothermic.

==Vertebrates==
By numerous observations upon [[homo sapiens sapiens|humans]] and other animals, [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] showed that the essential difference between the so-called [[warm-blooded]] and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] animals lies in observed constancy of the temperature of the former, and the observed variability of the temperature of the latter. Almost all birds and mammals have a high temperature almost constant and independent of that of the surrounding air ([[Homeothermic|homeothermy]]). Almost all other animals display a variation of body temperature, dependent on their surroundings ([[Poikilothermic|poikilothermy]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}}

===Brain control===
Thermoregulation in both ectotherms and endotherms is controlled mainly by the [[preoptic area]] of the [[anterior hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="Romanovsky"/&gt; Such [[homeostatic]] control is separate from the [[Sense#Temperature|sensation of temperature]].&lt;ref name="Romanovsky"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Romanovsky | first1 = AA | year = 2007 | title = Functional architecture of the thermoregulatory system | url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/292/1/R37| journal = Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol | volume = 292 | issue = 1| pages = R37–46 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.00668.2006 | pmid = 17008453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds and mammals===
[[File:Kangaroo licking itself to cool.jpg|thumb|250px|Kangaroo [[licking]] its arms to cool down on a very hot day]]
In cold environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to minimize heat loss:
# Using small smooth muscles (arrector pili in mammals), which are attached to feather or hair shafts; this distorts the surface of the skin making feather/hair shaft stand erect (called [[goose bumps]] or pimples) which slows the movement of air across the skin and minimizes heat loss.
# Increasing body size to more easily maintain core body temperature (warm-blooded animals in cold climates tend to be larger than similar species in warmer climates (see [[Bergmann's Rule]]))
# Having the ability to store energy as fat for [[metabolism]]
# Have shortened extremities
# Have [[countercurrent exchange|countercurrent blood flow]] in extremities – this is where the warm arterial blood travelling to the limb passes the cooler venous blood from the limb and heat is exchanged warming the venous blood and cooling the arterial (e.g., [[Arctic wolf]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Swan | first = K.

In warm environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to maximize heat loss:
# Behavioural adaptations like living in burrows during the day and being nocturnal
# Evaporative cooling by perspiration and panting
# Storing fat reserves in one place (e.g., camel's hump) to avoid its insulating effect
# Elongated, often vascularized extremities to conduct body heat to the air

As in other mammals, thermoregulation is an important aspect of [[human homeostasis]]. Most body heat is generated in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart, and in contraction of skeletal muscles.&lt;ref name="GuytonHall2006p80"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |author=Guyton, A.C., &amp; Hall, J.E. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |page=890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates, including hot humid and hot arid. High temperatures pose serious stresses for the human body, placing it in great danger of injury or even death. For example, one of the most common reactions to hot temperatures is heat exhaustion, which is an illness that could happen if one is exposed to high temperatures, resulting in some symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or a rapid heartbeat.&lt;ref&gt;"Heat Exhaustion: Symptoms and Treatment".

There are three avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, and radiation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually ''gains'' heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise.&lt;ref name=GuytonHall2006pp891892&gt;Guyton &amp; Hall (2006), pp. 891–892&lt;/ref&gt; During intense physical activity (e.g. sports), evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmore, Jack H., &amp; Costill, David L.

One possible explanation for plant thermoregulation is to provide protection against cold temperature. For example, the skunk cabbage is not frost-resistant, yet it begins to grow and flower when there is still snow on the ground.&lt;ref name=Minorsky /&gt; Another theory is that thermogenicity helps attract pollinators, which is borne out by observations that heat production is accompanied by the arrival of beetles or flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Thermogenesis in three Philodendron species (Araceae) of French Guiana |first=Marc |last=Gibernau |first2=Denis |last2=Barabé |year=2000 |journal=Canadian Journal of Botany |url=http://www.edb.ups-tlse.fr/equipe3/MG/publis/thermo.pdf |doi=10.1139/cjb-78-5-685 |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral temperature regulation==
Animals other than humans regulate and maintain their body temperature with physiological adjustments and behavior. Desert lizards are ectotherms and so unable to metabolically control their temperature but can do this by altering their location. They may do this, in the morning only by raising their head from its burrow and then exposing their entire body. By basking in the sun, the lizard absorbs solar heat. It may also absorb heat by conduction from heated rocks that have stored radiant solar energy. To lower their temperature, lizards exhibit varied behaviors. Sand seas, or [[erg (landform)|erg]]s, produce up to {{convert|57.7|°C|°F}}, and the sand lizard will hold its feet up in the air to cool down, seek cooler objects with which to contact, find shade or return to their burrow. They also go to their burrows to avoid cooling when the sun goes down or the temperature falls.  Aquatic animals can also regulate their temperature behaviorally by changing their position in the thermal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westhoff|first=Jacob|date=9 Oct 2014|title=Behavioural thermoregulation and bioenergetics of riverine smallmouth bass associated with ambient cold-period thermal refuge|journal=Ecology of Freshwater Fish|doi=10.1111/eff.12192|pmid=|volume=25|pages=72–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:smallhuddle.jpg|thumb|During cold weather many animals increase their thermal inertia by huddling.]]

Animals also engage in [[kleptothermy]] in which they share or even steal each other's body warmth. In endotherms such as [[bat]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arends | first1 = A | last2 = Bonaccorso | first2 = FJ | last3 = Genoud | first3 = M | year = 1995 | title = Basal rates of metabolism of nectarivorous bats (Phyllostomidae) from a semiarid thorn forest in Venezuela | url = | journal = J.

Some animals living in cold environments maintain their body temperature by preventing heat loss. Their fur grows more densely to increase the amount of [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. Some animals are [[heterothermic|regionally heterothermic]] and are able to allow their less insulated extremities to cool to temperatures much lower than their core temperature—nearly to {{convert|0|°C|°F}}. This minimizes heat loss through less insulated body parts, like the legs, feet (or hooves), and nose.
[[File:wiki ostrich.jpg|thumb|An [[ostrich]] can keep its body temperature relatively constant, even though the environment can be very hot during the day and cold at night.]]

===Hibernation, estivation and daily torpor===
To cope with limited food resources and low temperatures, some mammals [[hibernation|hibernate]] during cold periods. To remain in "stasis" for long periods, these animals build up [[Brown adipose tissue|brown fat]] reserves and slow all body functions. True hibernators (e.g., groundhogs) keep their body temperatures low throughout hibernation whereas the [[core temperature]] of false hibernators (e.g., bears) varies; occasionally the animal may emerge from its den for brief periods. Some bats are true hibernators and rely upon a rapid, non-shivering thermogenesis of their brown fat deposit to bring them out of hibernation.

[[Aestivation|Estivation]] is similar to hibernation, however, it usually occurs in hot periods to allow animals to avoid high temperatures and [[desiccation]].  Both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrates enter into estivation. Examples include lady beetles (''[[Coccinellidae]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kenneth S. Hagen |year=1962 |title=Biology and ecology of predaceous Coccinellidae |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=7 |pages=289–326 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.07.010162.001445}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desert tortoise|North American desert tortoises]], [[crocodile]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[cane toad]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.audubonguides.com/article.html?id=27 |publisher=[[Audubon Guides]] |title=Estivation: The Survial{{sic|hide=n}} Siesta |date=29 September 2009 |author=Bob Moore |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cyclorana platycephala|water-holding frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=F.H.

Daily [[torpor]] occurs in small endotherms like [[bats]] and [[hummingbirds]], which temporarily reduces their high metabolic rates to conserve energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology: Concepts and Applications |first=Cecie |last=Starr |year=2005 |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |pages=639 | isbn=978-0-534-46226-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RtSpGV_Pl_0C&amp;pg=PA639&amp;dq=cold+temperatures+birds+minimize+heat+loss

== Variation in animals ==
[[File:Body Temp Variation.png|thumb|250px|Chart showing diurnal variation in body temperature.]]

===Normal human temperature===
{{Main|Normal human body temperature}}
Previously, average oral temperature for healthy adults had been considered {{convert|37.0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, while normal ranges are {{convert|36.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|37.8|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In Poland and Russia, the temperature had been measured [[axilla]]ry. 36.6&amp;nbsp;°C was considered "ideal" temperature in these countries, while normal ranges are 36&amp;nbsp;°C to 36.9&amp;nbsp;°C.

Recent studies suggest that the average temperature for healthy adults is {{convert|36.8|C|abbr=on}} (same result in three different studies). Variations (one [[standard deviation]]) from three other studies are:
* 36.4–37.1&amp;nbsp;°C (97.5–98.8&amp;nbsp;°F)
* 36.3–37.1&amp;nbsp;°C (97.3–98.8&amp;nbsp;°F) for males, 36.5–37.3&amp;nbsp;°C (97.7–99.1&amp;nbsp;°F) for females
* 36.6–37.3&amp;nbsp;°C (97.9–99.1&amp;nbsp;°F)&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite journal |title=Temperature of a Healthy Human (Body Temperature) |last=Wong |first=Lena |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/LenaWong.shtml |year=2005 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-6712.2002.00069.x |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences, the Physics Factbook |volume=16 |pages=122–128 |pmid=12000664 |last2=Forsberg |first2=C |last3=Wahren |first3=LK |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=24 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926162224/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/LenaWong.shtml |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measured temperature varies according to thermometer placement, with rectal temperature being 0.3–0.6&amp;nbsp;°C (0.5–1&amp;nbsp;°F) higher than oral temperature, while axillary temperature is 0.3–0.6&amp;nbsp;°C (0.5–1&amp;nbsp;°F) lower than oral temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://health.yahoo.com/topic/hearing/resources/article/healthwise/tw9223 |title=Rectal, ear, oral, and axillary temperature comparison |publisher=Yahoo Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average difference between oral and axillary temperatures of [[India]]n children aged 6–12 was found to be only 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C (standard deviation 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/june2004/600.pdf |title=Comparison of Axillary Temperature with Rectal or Oral Temperature and Determination of Optimum Placement Time in Children |journal=Indian Pediatrics |volume=41  |date=17 June 2004 |pages=600–603 |author1=Deepti Chaturvedi |author2=K.Y.

===Variations due to circadian rhythms===
In humans, a diurnal variation has been observed dependent on the periods of rest and activity, lowest at 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. and peaking at 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. [[Monkey]]s also have a well-marked and regular diurnal variation of body temperature that follows periods of rest and activity, and is not dependent on the incidence of day and night; [[nocturnal]] monkeys reach their highest body temperature at night and lowest during the day. Sutherland Simpson and J.J. Galbraith observed that all nocturnal animals and birds – whose periods of rest and activity are naturally reversed through habit and not from outside interference – experience their highest temperature during the natural period of activity (night) and lowest during the period of rest (day).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}} Those diurnal temperatures can be reversed by reversing their daily routine.&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 1465744|year = 1905|last1 = Simpson|first1 = S|title = An investigation into the diurnal variation of the body temperature of nocturnal and other birds, and a few mammals|journal = The Journal of Physiology|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 225–238|last2 = Galbraith|first2 = J. J|pmid = 16992810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, the temperature curve of [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds is similar to that of man and other homoeothermal animals, except that the maximum occurs earlier in the afternoon and the minimum earlier in the morning. Also, the curves obtained from rabbits, [[guinea pig]]s, and dogs were quite similar to those from man.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}} These observations indicate that body temperature is partially regulated by [[circadian rhythm]]s.

===Variations due to women's menstrual cycles===
During the [[follicular phase]] (which lasts from the first day of [[menstruation]] until the day of [[ovulation]]), the average [[basal body temperature]] in women ranges from 36.45 to 36.7&amp;nbsp;°C (97.6 to 98.1&amp;nbsp;°F). Within 24 hours of ovulation, women experience an elevation of 0.15–0.45&amp;nbsp;°C (0.2–0.9&amp;nbsp;°F) due to the increased metabolic rate caused by sharply elevated levels of [[progesterone]]. The basal body temperature ranges between 36.7–37.3&amp;nbsp;°C (98.1–99.2&amp;nbsp;°F) throughout the [[luteal phase]], and drops down to pre-ovulatory levels within a few days of menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZb0ibgYDCIC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=temperature+higher+during+follicular+phase |title=Women's Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation |isbn=978-0-8342-1731-7 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=2001 |last= Swedan |first=Nadya Gabriele |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women can chart this phenomenon to determine whether and when they are ovulating, so as to aid conception or contraception.

===Variations due to fever===
[[Fever]] is a regulated elevation of the set point of core temperature in the [[hypothalamus]], caused by circulating pyrogens produced by the immune system. To the subject, a rise in core temperature due to fever may result in feeling cold in an environment where people without fever do not.

===Variations due to biofeedback===
Some monks are known to practice [[Tummo]], [[biofeedback]] [[meditation]] techniques, that allow them to raise their body temperatures substantially.&lt;ref name=harvardgazette&gt;{{cite book |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html |title=Meditation changes temperatures: Mind controls body in extreme experiments |first=William J. |last=Cromie |publisher=Harvard Gazette |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Low body temperature increases lifespan ==
It has been theorised that low body temperature may increase lifespan. In 2006, it was reported that transgenic mice with a body temperature 0.3–0.5 C lower than normal mice lived longer than normal mice.  This mechanism is due to overexpressing the uncoupling protein 2 in [[hypocretin]] neurons (Hcrt-UCP2), which elevated hypothalamic temperature, thus forcing the [[hypothalamus]] to lower body temperature.  Lifespan was increased by 12% and 20% for males and females, respectively.  The mice were fed ''[[ad libitum]]''.&lt;ref name=sciencemag&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/314/5800/825 Transgenic Mice with a Reduced Core Body Temperature Have an Increased Life Span], by Bruno Conti et al.

== Limits compatible with life ==
There are limits both of heat and cold that an endothermic animal can bear and other far wider limits that an [[ectothermic]] animal may endure and yet live. The effect of too extreme a cold is to decrease [[metabolism]], and hence to lessen the production of heat. Both [[catabolic]] and [[Anabolism|anabolic]] pathways share in this metabolic depression, and, though less energy is used up, still less energy is generated. The effects of this diminished metabolism become telling on the [[central nervous system]] first, especially the [[brain]] and those parts concerning consciousness;&lt;ref name=cat&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J. Physiol. |date=1905-05-09 |volume=32|issue=5 Suppl 8|pages=305–11| title=The effect of cold narcosis on reflex action in warm-blooded animals|vauthors=Simpson S, Herring PT | pmid=16992777|postscript=.| pmc=1465681 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1905.sp001084}}&lt;/ref&gt; both [[heart rate]] and [[respiration rate]] decrease; judgment becomes impaired as drowsiness supervenes, becoming steadily deeper until the individual loses consciousness; without medical intervention, [[death]] by [[hypothermia]] quickly follows. Occasionally, however, [[convulsion]]s may set in towards the end, and death is caused by [[asphyxia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}&lt;ref name=cat /&gt;

In experiments on cats performed by Sutherland Simpson and Percy T. Herring, the animals were unable to survive when rectal temperature fell below 16&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=cat /&gt; At this low temperature, respiration became increasingly feeble; heart-impulse usually continued after respiration had ceased, the beats becoming very irregular, appearing to cease, then beginning again. Death appeared to be mainly due to [[asphyxia]], and the only certain sign that it had taken place was the loss of knee-jerks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}

However, too high a temperature speeds up the metabolism of different tissues to such a rate that their metabolic capital is soon exhausted. Blood that is too warm produces [[dyspnea]] by exhausting the metabolic capital of the respiratory centre;{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} heart rate is increased; the beats then become arrhythmic and eventually cease. The central nervous system is also profoundly affected by [[hyperthermia]] and [[delirium]], and convulsions may set in. Consciousness may also be lost, propelling the person into a [[coma]]tose condition. These changes can sometimes also be observed in patients suffering from an acute [[fever]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} [[Mammal]]ian muscle becomes rigid with heat rigor at about 50&amp;nbsp;°C, with the sudden rigidity of the whole body rendering life impossible.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}

H.M. Vernon performed work on the death temperature and paralysis temperature (temperature of heat rigor) of various animals. He found that species of the same [[Class (biology)|class]] showed very similar temperature values, those from the [[Amphibia]] examined being 38.5&amp;nbsp;°C, [[fish]] 39&amp;nbsp;°C, [[Reptilia|reptiles]] 45&amp;nbsp;°C, and various [[mollusc]]s 46&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Also, in the case of [[pelagic]] animals, he showed a relation between death temperature and the quantity of solid constituents of the body. In higher animals, however, his experiments tend to show that there is greater variation in both the chemical and physical characteristics of the [[protoplasm]] and, hence, greater variation in the extreme temperature compatible with life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}

===Arthropoda===
The maximum temperatures tolerated by certain [[thermophilic]] arthropods exceeds the lethal temperatures for most vertebrates.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140427191124.htm |title=Mite sets new record as world's fastest land animal |author=Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) |date=27 April 2014 |website=Featured Research |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most heat-resistant insects are three genera of desert ants recorded from three different parts of the world. The ants have developed a lifestyle of scavenging for short durations during the hottest hours of the day, in excess of {{convert|50|°C|°F}}, for the carcasses of insects and other forms of life which have succumbed to heat stress.&lt;ref name="InsectRecords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_21.shtml |title=Chapter 21: Most heat tolerant |author=Sherwood, Van |date= 1 May 1996 |website=Book of Insect Records |publisher=University of Florida |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the South Californian mite ''[[Paratarsotomus macropalpis]]'' has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length, at a speed of 322 body lengths per second. Besides the unusually great speed of the mites, the researchers were surprised to find the mites running at such speeds on concrete at temperatures up to {{convert|60|°C|°F}}, which is significant because this temperature is well above the lethal limit for the majority of animal species. In addition, the mites are able to stop and change direction very quickly.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;

'''Rosalind Mary Owens''' (born 12 November 1944), known as '''Tuppy Owens''', is an English sex therapist, consultant, campaigner, writer and former adult model.&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt;&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18669012.html|title=BBC under fire for porn star's Viagra love-making|date=19 August 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tuppy Owens was born in [[Cambridge]]. She gained a degree in [[zoology]] from [[Exeter University]], and then worked in [[ecology]] in [[Africa]] and [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; She settled in [[London]], and worked as a scientific administrator at the [[Natural Environment Research Council]].&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; Then, in the late 1960s, she established a sex education book publishing company, for which she wrote and published ''The Sex Maniac’s Diary''&lt;ref name=paulharris/&gt; successfully between 1972 and 1995, and which she operated as a thriving business from her [[Mayfair]] flat&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; — for example, the 1975 ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was launched in August 1974 with a reception at the Bristol Hotel in London which was reported on the following day in the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref name=ft19740822/&gt;

==Work==

From 1974, Tuppy Owens also began lecturing on the subject of sex.&lt;ref name=es19740409/&gt;  In 1975, she appeared in the Dutch pornographic film ''Sensations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK13009|title=Sensations (1975) on Video Blue|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984, the ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was published as ''The Safer Sex Maniac's Diary'' and provided the first visual instructions to the public on how to put a [[condom]] on securely; it also reviewed condoms and offered [[Safe sex|safer sex]] advice, all at the beginning of the outbreak of [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=thediary/&gt;

In 1979, Owens started the Outsiders Club for socially and physically disabled people to find partners. She was helped by Nigel Verbeek, who had recently lost his sight. Both worked voluntarily, which Tuppy continues to do today. Outsiders is a warm and friendly club providing peer support to members, a beautiful online Clubhouse, and lovely monthly lunches around the country.

In order to ensure that she answered the members' questions with accuracy, Owens trained as a [[sex therapist]] at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, where she gained a diploma in Human Sexuality in 1986.&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; She was also subsequently awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Institute of Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; In 2009, Owens was named one of the Family Planning Association‘s 80 most influential achievers in the field of family planning.

For disabled men and women who want to learn what pleasures their bodies are capable of enjoying, and how to please a partner, Owens set up the TLC Trust website, where they can find responsible, safe sexual services.

In 1981, Owens appeared in the English pornographic film ''Lady Victoria's Training'', which was produced by Mike Freeman/Videx and featured Simon Linsday Honey, who went on to work as a porn producer and actor in 1990's under the pseudonym [[Ben Dover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK09550|title=Lady Victoria's Training (1981) on Videx|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;

In the 1990s, after more than 30 years living in London, Tuppy Owens moved away from that city. Since then, she has lived in a croft in the north of Scotland.&lt;ref name=highladnews20060608/&gt;

In 2005, Tuppy Owens founded the Sexual Health and Disability Alliance (SHADA)&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; to bring together health professionals interested in sex and disability. In November 2009, a conference with the title "Disability: Sex, Relationships and Pleasure" was held by SHADA with the [[Royal Society of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=rsm20091113/&gt; Tuppy produced the Sexual Respect Tool Kit, and started the sexual advocacy service, ASAP. Tuppy also answers the Sex and Disability Helpline. Her book "Supporting Disabled People with their Sexual Lives" was published by [[Jessica Kingsley Publishers|Jessica Kingsley]] on 19 November 2014.

Tuppy Owens remains active in running Outsiders.&lt;ref name=realist136/&gt; At the same time, she also advises the promoter of the Sexual Freedom Ball to fund Outsiders, and the organisers of the fundraiser, The [[Erotic Awards]],&lt;ref name=thetimes1085069/&gt; now called The Sexual Services and Entertainment Awards. 

Owens is now the chair of the Sexual Freedom Coalition.&lt;ref name=marieclaire200903/&gt; Back in the 90s Owens worked campaigning with Prostitution Pride, parades through London, which were funded by Arcadia events in North London.

Owens has been working with the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering in the hope that they will be able to create sex toys that can be used by disabled people who, without them, cannot masturbate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owens|first1=Tuppy|title=Supporting disabled residents to enjoy masturbation and sexual services|url=http://shadainternational.com/all-impairments/pioneers/|website=Shada International|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens will be the editor of a forthcoming website, The School of Sex for Disabled People, which is being created by sexually experienced disabled people and those who provide them with sexual services. She is currently writing her autobiography.

==Award==
Owens has won the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Lifestyles Awards. She is also a Winner of the Innovation Award of Sexual Health and Human Rights UNESCO 2015.
She was a finalist (Lifetime Achievement) in the Directory of Social Change Awards 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: 2015 Social Change Awards Ceremony|url=https://www.dsc.org.uk/content/2015-social-change-awards-ceremony/|website=Directory of Social Change|accessdate=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UC Berkeley School of Information''' or the '''I School''' is a graduate school offering three degree programs: a professional master's degree in information management (MIMS), a professional master's degree in data science (MIDS), and an academic doctoral degree. Created in 1994, the I School is UC Berkeley's newest school. It was previously known as the School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS) until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/about&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots trace back to UC Berkeley's School of Librarianship founded in the 1920s. The program is located in UC Berkeley's [[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]], near [[Sather Tower]] in the center of the [[UC Berkeley]] campus.

==Curriculum==

===MIMS program===
The Master of Information Management &amp; Systems (MIMS) program is a 48 unit, two-year program designed to train students for careers as information professionals. Students who complete the program are awarded the Masters of Information Management and Systems (MIMS) degree. During the first year MIMS students take required courses in Information Organization and Retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/202&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed Computing Applications and Infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/206&lt;/ref&gt; Social and Organizational Issues of Information,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/203&lt;/ref&gt; and Information Law and Policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/courses/205&lt;/ref&gt; During the second year students may choose from elective courses both at the I School and in other departments. The final prerequisite for the MIMS degree is the completing of a group or individual thesis project.

===MIDS program===
The Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program is an innovative part-time fully online program that trains data-savvy professionals and managers. Working with data at scale requires distinctive new skills and tools. The MIDS program is distinguished by its disciplinary breadth; unlike other programs that focus on advanced mathematics and modeling alone, the MIDS degree provides students insights from social science and policy research, as well as statistics, computer science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://datascience.berkeley.edu/|title=Earn Your Master’s in Data Science Online|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ph.D. program===
The doctoral program is a research-oriented program in which the student chooses specific fields of specialization, prepares sufficiently in the literature and the research of those fields to pass written and oral examinations, and completes original research culminating in the written dissertation. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is conferred in recognition of a candidate's grasp of a broad field of learning and distinguished accomplishment in that field through contribution of an original piece of research revealing high critical ability and powers of imagination and synthesis.
