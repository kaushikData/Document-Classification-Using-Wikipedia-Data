 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on April 3, 2018, ''A New Kind of Science'' was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolinsky|first=Jacob|title=190 Books Recommended by Bill Gates|url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/04/bill-gates-books/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=April 2017}}

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5460">Throughout history, some people have claimed experiences that are the supposed results of '''alien visitation'''. While some of the factors of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] visits range in variety, the basic structure stays the same, motivating further research into the topic.

Alien visitation refers to an intentional encounter between an extraterrestrial being to a human. For alien visitation to be considered a real issue among researchers, extraterrestrials must be proven to have a valid motivation for visiting, and the encounter must be scientifically possible and probable. As of now, theories have been put forth by various researchers regarding the validity of alien visitation. 

==Motive==
The proposed motives for extraterrestrial visitations can be classified into three subsections: 1) attempt to influence the future of humanity, 2) attempt to warn or enlighten, and 3) experimental use. 

===Attempt to influence the future of humanity===
According to [[ancient astronaut hypothesis]], extraterrestrials had been active in the affairs of early man.&lt;ref&gt;See section on Ancient Astronauts in ''The Human Myth: an Introduction to Anthropology'' by Michael D. Olien, Harper &amp; Row, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Erich Von Däniken]], a notable ancient astronaut believer, considers that the deities of ancient cultures were attempts at explaining alien visitation.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, Michael (1998). ''Children of Ezekiel: Aliens, Ufos, the Crisis of Race, and the Advent of End Time.'' Duke University Press. p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Because Von Däniken’s hypothesis is considered purely speculative, the ancient astronaut hypothesis has no support within the scientific community. According to ancient astronaut devotees, proof of alien visitations in antiquity are found prevalently in patterns of art, technology, and engineering. To them, the [[Moai]] statues on [[Easter Island]], the [[Pyramids of Egypt]], and [[Stonehenge]] can all be easily explained through the ancient astronaut hypothesis. They also argue that the technological advances in antiquity are the result of alien visitation, citing unaccounted for invention and abnormal historical surges in technology as proof for their claims. The ancient astronaut hypothesis suggests that the motive for alien visitation is to influence the future of mankind. In fact, some ancient astronaut proponents even mention the cause of [[World War II]] and the [[atomic bomb]] as effects of alien visitation and activity.&lt;ref&gt;Von Däniken, Erich (1984). ''Chariots of the Gods''. Berkley Pub Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Although mainstream science and historians dismiss these claims as make believe, they do provide ample motive for a supposed alien visitation.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Attempts to warn or enlighten===
Rather than hypothetically or historically based, this proposed motive for alien visitation is based on supposed [[alien abduction]] accounts. According to most supposed alien abductees, an abduction session is always concluded with an instructional portion, where the extraterrestrials show supposed abductees one of three different scenarios. Generally, the "abductee" is shown either 1) a world destroyed by war and pestilence, 2) a result of extraterrestrial technological advancement or 3) a specific duty to perform. Many times, the "abductee" is shown multiple scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Thomas E. "The Rarer Abduction Episodes." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ancient astronaut proponents, these modern abduction accounts fit the ancient astronaut narrative, claiming that the instructional portion carries many similarities to ancient [[prophecies]] or [[oracle]] sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Von Däniken, Erich (1984). ''Chariots of the Gods''. Berkley Pub Group.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the revealing of extraterrestrial technology fits with the narrative of extraterrestrials assisting in human advancement.

===Experimental use===
Another facet of abductee testimonial, which provides motive for alien visitation, is the use of experimentation. In nearly all alien supposed abductee experiences, the abductee recalls being examined upon. Reportedly, the examinations are generally centered around the human [[sex organs]], while focus is also put on the [[cranium]] and [[skin]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John G. "Medical Procedural Differences: Alien Versus Human." In: Pritchard, Andrea &amp; Pritchard, David E. &amp; Mack, John E. &amp; Kasey, Pam &amp; Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 59–64&lt;/ref&gt; This experimentation process leads some to believe that the motive for extraterrestrial visitation is to use human body functions to either: 1) save their own race 2) help our race to survive or 3) genetically alter the human [[gene pool]] in order to serve their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Randles, J; Pritchard A; Pritchard DE; Mack JE; Kasey P &amp; Yapp C (1994). "Why are They Doing This?". Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press. pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allofeeding''' is a type of [[Evolutionary models of food sharing|food sharing]] [[Behavior|behaviour]] observed in [[Cooperative breeding|cooperatively breed]]ing species of [[bird]]s. Allofeeding refers to a parent, sibling or unrelated adult bird feeding [[altricial]] [[hatchling]]s, which are dependent on [[parental care]] for their survival.&lt;ref name="barrows"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yaXMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE9ePx_sHRAhWLq1QKHUJ1CC8Q6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=Animal Behavior Desk Reference|last=Barrows|first=Edward M.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4398-3652-1|edition=3rd|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding also refers to food sharing between adults of the same species.&lt;ref name="handicap"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ImjqhNqjiqsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-jfi2gMLRAhVIhlQKHVOQAHE4ChDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|last2=Zahavi|first2=Avishag|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-19-510035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding can occur between mates during mating rituals, [[Courtship display|courtship]], egg laying or incubation, between peers of the same species, or as a form of parental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan M.|date=1980|title=Demand Behavior: A New Interpretation of Courtship Feeding|jstor=1367395|journal=The Condor|volume=82|issue=3|pages=291–295|doi=10.2307/1367395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=Matthew R.|last2=Holmes|first2=Aaron L.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Allofeeding evolved for different reasons in different species of birds. While Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows allofeed to reduce [[predation]] during incubation, Sichuan Jays allofeed to increase a female’s nutritional level prior to egg laying, and Chinstrap Penguins allofeed to strengthen the bond between the pair during chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jing|first=Yu|last2=Fang|first2=Yun|last3=Strickland|first3=Dan|last4=Lu|first4=Nan|last5=Sun|first5=Yue-Hua|date=2009|title=Alloparenting in the Rare Sichuan Jay (Perisoreus Internigrans) - Cuidado Aloparental en la Especie Rara Perisoreus internigrans|journal=The Condor|volume=111|issue=4|pages=662–667|doi=10.1525/cond.2009.080114|jstor=10.1525/cond.2009.080114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mori|first=Yoshihisa|last2=Kokubun|first2=Nobuo|last3=Shin|first3=Hyoung-Chul|last4=Takahashi|first4=Akinori|date=2010-10-01|title=An observation of between-mates feeding behaviour in chick-guarding chinstrap penguins|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|journal=Polar Biology|language=en|volume=33|issue=10|pages=1437–1438|doi=10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|issn=0722-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While parental allofeeding is a common form of parental care among many species of birds, the practice is not inherently restricted to biological parents and their young, and is often done for reasons unrelated to the well-being of the chicks. Arabian Bablers, for instance, peer allofeed in an attempt at increasing their social rank, whereas the King Penguin considers those 'non-breeders' who allofeed chicks to be  altruistic and highly revered.

Although many species of birds exhibit allofeeding, there are some species that do not perform allofeeding, such as Siberian Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

== Allofeeding between mates ==
Many species of migratory [[songbird]]s display allofeeding during the [[incubation period]].&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; During the incubation period, a male songbird will feed its mate, while she sits on the eggs through beak-to-beak interaction.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is suggested to be adaptive because the male is indirectly investing in its offspring.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The male uses its energy to forage and retrieve food, and to feed the female.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This behaviour of the male reduces nutritional stress of the female because it reduces the amount of time the female spends foraging.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In addition, the allofeeding behaviour decreases the number of times a female has to leave the nest, which in turn extends the incubation period and reduces the risk of nest being detected by a predator.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Overall, allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased fitness and is therefore considered advantageous.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; However, Nolan (1958) theorizes that allofeeding is a non-adaptive and is derived from anticipatory parental care.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Allofeeding during the incubation period can also transpire through both the male and the female interchangeably feeding each other via beak-to-beak interactions, while a mate receiving the food incubates the eggs.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Once feeding is completed, the recipient now becomes the feeder and the mate that was just foraging incubates the eggs. For example, Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows (''Spizella breweri breweri'') allofeed in this manner.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; A recent study by Halley et al., 2015, examined allofeeding in twenty-four nests of Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study revealed that allofeeding occurred at low frequencies (55%) in nests with biparental incubation and no allofeeding occurred in uniparental nests.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study suggests that allofeeding is an intraspecific signal required to maintain social bonds between mates, in addition to increasing the nutrition levels of females and concealment of the nest.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Furthermore, the study found that incubation sessions per hour were higher in biparental nests with allofeeding than in biparental nests without allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; These findings indicate that allofeeding is beneficial because it reduces the risk of predation from visually oriented predators through increased nest concealment,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; which can maximize the fitness of males while increasing the fitness of females.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

There have been many documented observations of allofeeding between mates (mate allofeeding).&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; However, in penguins allofeeding between mates is rare.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; In 2010, [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguins]] (''P. antarctica'') allofeeding was reported during the period of chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The researchers witnessed a male feeding a female, which had a large chick in its nest.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The behaviour was engaged by the female frequently pecking the side of the male’s bill to stimulate the male to regurgitate its food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; This resulted in the male regurgitating its food into the female’s open mouth. This allofeeding behaviour was identical to the manner in which a chick begs its parent for food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Notably, during this behaviour the female kept the attention of male when the chick tried to gain the male’s attention.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; It is proposed that mate allofeeding in Chinstrap Penguins was performed to strengthen the bond between the pair.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

Allofeeding between mates can also occur during courtship.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding occurs in half of bird subfamilies and mainly appears in monogamous bird species.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs or increase a female’s nutritional level before laying eggs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; For example, in the Sichuan Jay ([[Sichuan jay|''P. internigrans'']]), females are fed by only one male during courtship.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is suggested that allofeeding the female during courtship, increases a female’s nutritional level before egg laying.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This behaviour was also recorded in the Grey Jays (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Other species of birds display allofeeding during courtship. Additionally, courtship allofeeding in some birds species is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

== Allofeeding and parental care ==

=== ''Aptenodytes patagonicus'' ===
[[File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|thumb|Emperor Penguin (''Aptenodytes patagonicus)'' feeding its offspring]]
A parent feeding a non-biological chick via bill-to-bill interactions is a form of allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lecomte|first=Nicolas|last2=Kuntz|first2=Gregoire|last3=Lambert|first3=Nicolas|last4=Gendner|first4=Jean-Paul|last5=Handrich|first5=Yves|last6=Maho|first6=Yvon Le|last7=Bost|first7=Charles-André|title=Alloparental feeding in the king penguin|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347205004173|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=71|issue=2|pages=457–462|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouventin|first=Pierre|last2=Barbraud|first2=Christophe|last3=Rubin|first3=Michel|title=Adoption in the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1023–1029|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental allofeeding occurs in all altricial species of birds to ensure proper growth, development, and to prevent starvation of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggers|first=Sönke|last2=Griesser|first2=Michael|last3=Ekman|first3=Jan|date=2005-01-01|title=Predator-induced plasticity in nest visitation rates in the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus)|url=http://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/16/1/309/206728/Predatorinduced-plasticity-in-nest-visitation|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=309–315|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh163|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of allofeeding has been shown to be a form of parental care in some species, such as in King Penguins ([[King penguin|''A. patagonicus'']]).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguins are pelagic seabirds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguin chicks form dense groups called crèches during winter for social thermoregulation when food availability is low.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The formation of crèches results from the parents interchangeably leaving starving chicks to gather food from the sea.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A study by Lecomte et al., 2015 examined the allofeeding behaviour in King Penguins, in which they marked the white underbellies of 74 non-breeding adults and 103 breeding pairs with a unique dark colouring called dye-mark code of Nyanzol-D.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) found 22% of the marked adults feed 65% of the chicks in crèches, revealing that allofeeding behaviour was most common during the breeding season.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) also identified that most of the 22% of adult King Penguins demonstrating allofeeding behaviour were unable to successfully breed along with few breeders performing the behaviour.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The allofeeding behaviour resulted in more feedings for chicks,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which is consistent with study by Pierre et al. (1994) that showed that allofeeding in penguins increases the chick growth rate from 35g/day to 190g/day.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; From these results, Lecomte et al., (2015) concluded that allofeeding increased the survival rate of chicks in crèches.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The results imply that parental allofeeding in King Penguins is an altruistic behaviour, where allofeeding benefits the young at a cost to the non-biological parent.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Notably, no direct benefits to the non-biological parents have been described.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The cost of allofeeding non-biological chicks resulted in no detrimental effects to the fitness of the [[Alloparenting|alloparent]], because the cost of allofeeding is low (several grams) when compared to the nutritional costs of an adult king penguin, which is several kilograms.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; However, it is suggested that allofeeding many chicks may cost each chick lost meals that can cause negative effects on the fitness of allofed chicks.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, allofeeding decreases when non-biological parents had offspring.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== ''Pseudomonas antarctica'' ===
The [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguin]] (''P. antarctica'') is another species of penguin that displays allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Allofeeding in the Chinstrap Penguin has been observed between the female and its offspring.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Similar to mate allofeeding in this species, the offspring of a female will peck the side of the female’s bill to signal the female to regurgitate its food into the chick's open mouth.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

=== ''Perisoreus internigrans'' ===
In Sichuan Jays ([[Sichuan jay|''P. Internigrans'']]), females are not the only sex that participates in the allofeeding of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; During their first week of life, the chicks are only fed by the male.&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/studies-of-less-familiar-birds-162-siberian-jay/|title=Studies of less Familiar birds 162 Siberian Jay - British Birds|last=Blomgren|first=Arne Blomgren|date=|work=British Birds|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male forages and stores food in a pouch within its throat. At the nest, the male regurgitates the semi-digested food from its pouch into the mouths of its chicks.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; After the first week, the male continues to feed the chicks while the female begins feeding the chicks.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The female uses the same method as the male.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt;

== Peer allofeeding ==

=== ''Turdoides sqamiceps'' ===
There have been many reported cases of allofeeding between siblings in several species of birds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; For example, the Arabian Babblers ([[Arabian babbler|''T. sqamiceps'']]) are a territorial, desert inhibiting species of bird that participate in cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In this species, non-breeders show numerous types of cooperative behaviour, including allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Adult and immature Babblers, as well as previous and newly fledged Babblers, will frequently engage in allofeeding behaviour.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Carlisle et al. (1986) revealed that Arabian Babblers participate in peer allofeeding in order to increase social rank, which increases fitness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is supported by the Zahavi's hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; An individual (a dominate Babbler) can increase in social rank by allofed a subordinate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On the contrary, an individual (a subordinate Babbler) can decrease in social rank when they are allofed by a dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Subordinate Babblers have been observed refusing to be allofeed by dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The refusal resulted in the dominate Babbler becoming aggressive with the subordinate - hitting or chasing the subordinate.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Dominate Babblers also showed the same aggressive behaviours when a subordinate tried to allofeed it.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== ''Tyto alba'' ===
Another species that exhibits peer allofeeding is the [[Barn owl|Barn Owl]] (''T. alba'').&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Barn Owl nest siblings establish a hierarchy for the sharing of food resources via vocal negotiations.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; It is suggested that Barn Owl nest siblings show peer allofeeding to reduce sibling competition in the food sharing hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Peer allofeeding observed in 60 nestling pairs revealed that the behaviour occurs by a donor sibling placing the food item on the ground in front of the receiver sibling, which transfers the food item to its bill using its talons.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Alternatively, the donor sibling uses its bill to place the food item in the bill of the receiver sibling.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; As well, peer allofeeding behaviour in Barn Owl siblings is proposed to increase the [[inclusive fitness]] of the peer performing the allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

== Intraspecific allofeeding ==

=== ''Perisoreus Internigrans'' ===
[[File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|thumb|Gray Jays (''Perisoreus canadensis)'' feeding offspring at the nest]]
Intraspecific allofeeding in Sichuan Jays (''[[Sichuan jay|P. internigrans]]'') is performed during the nestling and fledging period by non-breeders.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; One to three non-breeders support a nesting breeding pair by feeding the chicks, regurgitating the food from their throat pouches.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; In 2009, Jing et al. determined that two non-breeders contributed to 44% of feedings in the nest of two Sichuan Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Jing et al. (2009) suggest that allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased nest survival.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

In Sichuan Jays, allofeeding is hypothesized to be evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In this species, two to three non-breeders will allofeed the young of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The large body mass (21% heavier than Siberian Jays) of the Sichuan Jays, and the presence of more than one non-breeder, allows one non-breeder to ward off a predator while another non-breeder protects the young from additional predators.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Both the large body mass of the non-breeders and the presence of multiple non-breeders reduces the risk of injury or death when predators are encountered.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefits of allofeeding the young outweighs the cost of injury or death of the non-breeder and/or chick when more than one non-breeder is present.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Peer allofeeding has also been observed in the Gray Jay (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Gray Jay, non-breeders allofeed the young after fledging.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

Not all species of jays allofeed their young, such as the Siberian Jay (''[[Siberian jay|P. infaustus]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Siberian Jays, non-breeders do not allofeed the chicks of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is predicted that Siberian Jays do not display allofeeding because the cost of predation is too high.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Siberian Jays are continuously threatened by a more dangerous predators, the Eurasian Sparrowhawk and Northern Goshawk, then Gray Jays, which are threatened by Eurasian red squirrel.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  One non-breeder per breeding pair and the small size (21% less body mass than the Sichuan Jays) of the Siberian Jays, in combination with continuous risk of predation, reveals that the non-breeding Siberian Jays are unable to confront predators and protect the nest simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This indicates that the cost of allofeeding the young is more costly to the non-breeder when one non-breeder is present because an encounter with a predator increases the risk of injury and death of both the young and the non-breeder.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefit of allofeeding the young does not exceed the cost of injury or death of non-breeder and/or young.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This is consistent with the predator-avoidance hypothesis, suggesting that the cost of allofeeding in the Siberian Jays prevents allofeeding from being evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

'''Animal sexual behaviour''' takes many different forms, including within the same [[species]]. Common [[mating]] or [[Reproduction|reproductively]] motivated systems include [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamy]], [[polygyny]], [[polyandry]], [[polygamy]] and [[promiscuity]]. Other sexual behaviour may be reproductively motivated (e.g. [[Sexual coercion|sex apparently due to duress or coercion]] and [[situational sexual behaviour]]) or [[Non-reproductive sexual behavior in animals|non-reproductively motivated]] (e.g. [[cross-species sex|interspecific sexuality]], sexual arousal from objects or places, [[Necrophilia in animals|sex with dead animals]], [[Homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual sexual behaviour]], and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] sexual behaviour).

When animal sexual behaviour is reproductively motivated, it is often termed ''mating'' or ''[[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]]''; for most non-human [[mammal]]s, mating and copulation occur at [[Estrous cycle|oestrus]] (the most fertile period in the mammalian female's reproductive cycle), which increases the chances of [[internal fertilization|successful impregnation]].&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Kent, Michael |title= Advanced biology |isbn= 978-0-19-914195-1 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2000 |pages= 250–253 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8aw4ZWLABQkC&amp;pg=PA250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= General Studies Manual |publisher= [[Pearson Education|Pearson Education India]] |year= 2009 |page=17 |isbn= 9788131721339 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oAo1X2eagywC&amp;pg=RA1-PR17 |last=Thorpe |first=Showick |last2=Thorpe |first2=Edgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some animal sexual behaviour involves [[Competition (biology)|competition]], sometimes fighting, between multiple males. Females often select males for mating only if they appear strong and able to protect themselves.  The male that wins a fight may also have the chance to mate with a larger number of females and will therefore pass on his genes to their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wickler, Wolfgang |author2=Lorenz |author3=Konrad |author4=Kacher, Hermann |title= The sexual code : the social behaviour of animals and men |year= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, it was believed that only humans and a small number of other species performed sexual acts other than for reproduction, and that animals' sexuality was instinctive and a simple "[[stimulus-response]]" behaviour. However, in addition to homosexual behaviours, a range of species [[masturbate]] and may [[Tool use by animals|use objects as tools]] to help them do so. Sexual behaviour may be tied more strongly to establishment and maintenance of complex social bonds across a population which support its success in non-reproductive ways. Both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviours can be related to expressions of dominance over another animal or survival within a stressful situation (such as sex due to duress or coercion).

==Mating systems==
In [[sociobiology]] and [[behavioural ecology]], the term [[Mating systems#In animals|"mating system"]] is used to describe the ways in which animal societies are structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The mating system specifies which males mate with which females, and under what circumstances. There are four basic systems:

===Monogamy===
{{Main|Monogamous pairing in animals}}
{{See also|Evolution of monogamy}}

[[Monogamous pairing in animals|Monogamy]] occurs when one male mates with one female exclusively. A monogamous mating system is one in which individuals form [[Pair-bonding|long-lasting pairs]] and cooperate in raising offspring. These pairs may last for a lifetime, such as in [[pigeons]],&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460131/pigeon |title= Pigeon |accessdate= 26 August 2014 |work= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it may occasionally change from one mating season to another, such as in [[emperor penguin]]s.&lt;ref name="NSF"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=126932 |title= Animal Attraction: The Many Forms of Monogamy in the Animal Kingdom |accessdate= 26 August 2014 |author= Lily Whiteman |date= 13 February 2013 |work= National Science Foundation |publisher= National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with [[tournament species]], these pair-bonding species have lower levels of male aggression, competition and little [[sexual dimorphism]]. [[Zoologists]] and [[biologists]] now have evidence that monogamous pairs of animals are not always sexually exclusive. Many animals that form pairs to mate and raise offspring regularly engage in sexual activities with [[Extra-pair copulation|extra-pair partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ågren | first1 = G. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Q. | last3 = Zhong | first3 = W. | title = Ecology and social behaviour of Mongolian gerbils, ''Meriones unguiculatus'', at Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, China | doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(89)90002-X | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 37 | pages = 11–27 | year = 1989 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birkhead, Møller, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reichard, 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Westneat | first1 = D.

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
Social monogamy refers to a male and female's social living arrangement (e.g., shared use of a territory, behaviour indicative of a social pair, and/or proximity between a male and female) without inferring any sexual interactions or reproductive patterns. In humans, social monogamy takes the form of monogamous marriage. Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. Finally, the term genetic monogamy is used when DNA analyses can confirm that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other. A combination of terms indicates examples where levels of relationships coincide, e.g., sociosexual and sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social and sexual, and social and genetic monogamous relationships, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Reichard, U.H. (2003). Monogamy: Past and present. In U.H. Reichard and C. Boesch (Eds.), Monogamy: Mating strategies and partnerships in birds, humans, and other mammals, pp. 3–25, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521819733}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whatever makes a pair of animals socially monogamous does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.

Social monogamy is relatively rare in the animal kingdom. The actual incidence of social monogamy varies greatly across different branches of the evolutionary tree. Over 90% of avian species are socially monogamous.&lt;ref name="Reichard, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reichard |first=U.H. |year=2002 |title=Monogamy – a variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62–67 |url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514183645/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash, Lipton, 2001"&gt;Barash, D.P. &amp; Lipton, J.E. (2001). The Myth of Monogamy. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company, {{ISBN|0805071369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This stands in contrast to mammals. Only 3% of mammalian species are socially monogamous, although up to 15% of primate species are.&lt;ref name="Reichard, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash, Lipton, 2001" /&gt; Social monogamy has also been observed in [[reptile]]s, fish, and [[insects]].

Sexual monogamy is also rare among animals. Many socially monogamous species engage in [[extra-pair copulation]]s, making them sexually non-monogamous. For example, while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous, "on average, 30% or more of the baby birds in any nest [are] sired by someone other than the resident male."&lt;ref name="NY Times Mating"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC143FF932A1575BC0A966958260 |work= The New York Times |title= Mating for Life? It's Not for the Birds of the Bees |first= Natalie |last= Angier |date= 21 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Adair Gowaty]] has estimated that, out of 180 different species of socially monogamous songbirds, only 10% are sexually monogamous.&lt;ref name="Gowaty, Morell, 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of genetic monogamy, determined by DNA fingerprinting, varies widely across species. For a few rare species, the incidence of genetic monogamy is 100%, with all offspring genetically related to the socially monogamous pair. But genetic monogamy is strikingly low in other species. Barash and Lipton note:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
The highest known frequency of extra-pair copulations are found among the [[fairy-wren]]s, lovely tropical creatures technically known as ''[[Malurus splendens]]'' and ''[[Malurus cyaneus]]''. More than 65% of all fairy-wren chicks are fathered by males outside the supposed breeding group.&lt;ref name="Barash, Lipton, 2001" /&gt;{{sup|p. 12}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such low levels of genetic monogamy have surprised biologists and zoologists, forcing them to rethink the role of social monogamy in evolution. They can no longer assume social monogamy determines how genes are distributed in a species. The lower the rates of genetic monogamy among socially monogamous pairs, the less of a role social monogamy plays in determining how genes are distributed among offspring.

===Polygyny===
{{Main|Polygyny in nature}}

[[Polygyny threshold model|Polygyny]] occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In some species, notably those with [[harem]]-like structures, only one of a few males in a group of females will mate. Technically, [[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]] in sociobiology and zoology is defined as a system in which a male has a relationship with more than one female, but the females are predominantly bonded to a single male. Should the active male be driven out, killed, or otherwise removed from the group, in a number of species the new male will ensure that breeding resources are not wasted on another male's young.&lt;ref&gt;This section and examples taken from [[Robert Sapolsky]] (1998) ''[[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]'', W.H. Freeman and Co., {{ISBN|0-7167-3210-6}}, pp. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; The new male may achieve this in many different ways, including:

* competitive [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]]: in [[lion]]s, [[hippopotamuses]], and some [[monkey]]s, the new male will kill the offspring of the previous alpha male to cause their mothers to become receptive to his sexual advances since they are no longer [[lactation|nursing]]. To prevent this, many female primates exhibit ovulation cues among all males, and show  situation-dependent receptivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fürtbauer|first=Ines|last2=Heistermann|first2=Michael|last3=Schülke|first3=Oliver|last4=Ostner|first4=Julia|date=2011-08-10|title=Concealed Fertility and Extended Female Sexuality in a Non-Human Primate (Macaca assamensis)|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23105|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023105|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3154278|pmid=21853074}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[harassment]] to [[miscarriage]]: amongst wild [[horse]]s and [[baboon]]s, the male will "systematically harass" pregnant females until they miscarry.
* [[Pheromone]]-based [[spontaneous abortion]]
* in some [[rodent]]s such as [[mouse|mice]], a new male with a different scent will cause females who are pregnant to spontaneously fail to implant recently fertilised eggs. This does not require contact; it is mediated by [[scent]] alone. It is known as the [[Bruce effect]].

Von Haartman specifically described the mating behaviour of the [[European pied flycatcher]] as successive polygyny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haartman | first1 = L. V. | doi = 10.1163/156853951X00296 | title = Successive Polygamy | journal = Behaviour | volume = 3 | pages = 256–273 | year = 1951 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this system, the males leave their home territory once their primary female lays her first egg. Males then create a second territory, presumably in order to attract a secondary female to breed. Even when they succeed at acquiring a second mate, the males typically return to the first female to exclusively provide for her and her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Polyandry===
[[File:Hamol u0.gif|thumb|right|The anglerfish ''[[Haplophryne mollis]]'' is [[polyandrous]]. This female is trailing the atrophied remains of males she has encountered.]]
{{Main|Polyandry in nature}}

[[Polyandry in nature|Polyandry]] occurs when one female gets exclusive mating rights with multiple males. In some species, such as [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blennies]], both [[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]] and [[Polyandry in nature|polyandry]] are observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Marraro |first= CH |author2= Nursall JR |title= The reproductive periodicity and behaviour of Ophioblennius atlanticus at Barbados |journal= J Zool |year= 1983 |volume= 61 |issue= 2 |pages= 317–325 |doi= 10.1139/z83-042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The males in some deep sea [[anglerfish]]es are much smaller than the females. When they find a female they bite into her skin, releasing an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of their mouth and her body and fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly [[atrophy|atrophies]], losing first his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, ending as nothing more than a pair of [[gonads]], which release [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] in response to [[hormones]] in the female's bloodstream indicating [[ovum|egg]] release. This extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.&lt;ref name="doran"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author = Theodore W.

===Polygynandry===
{{Main|Polygynandry}}

[[Polygynandry]] occurs when multiple males mate indiscriminately with multiple females. The numbers of males and females need not be equal, and in vertebrate species studied so far, there are usually fewer males. Two examples of systems in primates are promiscuous mating [[chimpanzees]] and [[bonobo]]s. These species live in social groups consisting of several males and several females. Each female copulates with many males, and vice versa. In bonobos, the amount of promiscuity is particularly striking because bonobos use sex to alleviate social conflict as well as to reproduce.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/07/0722_040722_gayanimal_2.html|title=Homosexual Activity Among Animals Stirs Debate|date=2004-07-23|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mutual promiscuity is the approach most commonly used by spawning animals, and is perhaps the "original fish mating system."&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161}} Common examples are [[forage fish]], such as [[herring]]s, which form huge mating [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] in shallow water. The water becomes milky with sperm and the bottom is draped with millions of fertilised eggs.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161}}

===Polygamy===
{{See also|Promiscuity#Other animals}}

The term [[polygamy]] is an umbrella term used to refer generally to non-monogamous matings. As such, polygamous relationships can be polygynous, polyandrous or polygynandrous. In a small number of species, individuals can display either polygamous or monogamous behaviour depending on environmental conditions. An example is the social wasp ''[[Apoica flavissima]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In some species, polygyny and polyandry is displayed by both sexes in the population. Polygamy in both sexes has been observed in [[Red flour beetle#Polygamy in red flour beetles|red flour beetle]] (''Tribolium castaneum''). Polygamy is also seen in many [[Lepidoptera]] species including ''[[Mythimna unipuncta]]'' (true armyworm moth)''.''&lt;ref&gt;Mcneil, Jeremy N. “Calling Behavior: Can It Be Used to Identify Migratory Species of Moths.”''The Florida Entomologist'', vol. 69, no. 1, 1986, pp. 78–84., doi:10.2307/3494746.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tournament species]] is one in which "mating tends to be highly polygamous and involves high levels of male-male aggression and competition."&lt;ref name=twsNovK12&gt;{{cite news |author= Robert Sapolsky |title= Biology and Human Behavior: The Neurological Origins of Individuality, 2nd edition |url= http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=1597 |publisher= ''The Teaching Company'' |year= 2005 |accessdate= 2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tournament behaviour often correlates with high levels of [[sexual dimorphism]], examples of species including [[chimpanzees]] and [[baboons]]. Most polygamous species present high levels of tournament behaviour, with a notable exception being [[bonobos]]{{Citation needed|reason=Evidence for bonobo sexual peacefulness is scant|date=April 2018}} .

==Parental investment and reproductive success==
{{Main|Bateman's principle}}
[[File:Mating Great Grey Slug 4111.jpg|thumb|Mating [[Limax maximus|grey slugs]], suspended from a slime thread]]

Female and male sexual behaviour differ in many species. Often, males are more active in initiating mating, and bear the more conspicuous sexual ornamentation like antlers and colourful plumage. This is a result of [[anisogamy]], where [[sperm]] are smaller and much less costly (energetically) to produce than [[egg]]s. This difference in physiological cost means that males are more limited by the number of mates they can secure, while females are limited by the quality of genes of her mates, a phenomenon known as [[Bateman's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bateman | first = A.J. | title = Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila | journal = Heredity | volume = 2 | pages = 349–368 | year = 1948 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1948.21 | pmid = 18103134 | issue = Pt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many females also have extra reproductive burdens in that [[parental care]] often falls mainly, or exclusively, on them.  Thus, females are more limited in their potential [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name=Trivers1972&gt;Trivers, R.L. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'', 1871–1971 (pp.&amp;nbsp;136–179). Chicago, IL: Aldine. {{ISBN|0-435-62157-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In species where males take on more of the reproductive costs, such as [[sea horses]] and [[Jacanidae|jacana]]s, the role is reversed, and the females are larger, more aggressive and more brightly coloured than the males.

In hermaphroditic animals, the costs of parental care can be evenly distributed between the sexes, e.g. [[earthworm]]s. In some species of [[planarian]]s, sexual behaviour takes the form of [[penis fencing]].  In this form of copulation, the individual that first penetrates the other with the penis, forces the other to be female, thus carrying the majority of the cost of reproduction.&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/2_14_98/fob2.htm Hermaphrodites duel for manhood], ''Science News Online''.

==Seasonality==
{{Main|Seasonal breeder}}
[[File:Brain coral spawning.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brain coral]]s typically [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] in connection with the full moon every August]]

Many animal species have specific mating (or breeding) periods e.g. ([[Seasonal breeder|seasonal breeding]]) so that offspring are born or hatch at an optimal time. In marine species with limited mobility and [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] like [[coral]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[clam]]s, the timing of the common spawning is the only externally visible form of sexual behaviour. In areas with continuously high [[primary production]], some species have a series of breeding seasons throughout the year. This is the case with most primates (who are primarily tropical and subtropical animals). Some animals ([[opportunistic breeders]]) breed dependent upon other conditions in their environment aside from time of year.

===Mammals===
Mating seasons are often associated with changes to herd or group structure, and behavioural changes, including territorialism amongst individuals. These may be annual (e.g. [[Wolves#Reproduction|wolves]]), biannual (e.g. [[canine reproduction|dogs]]) or more frequently (e.g. horses). During these periods, females of most mammalian species are more mentally and physically receptive to sexual advances, a period scientifically described as [[estrous]] but commonly described as being "in season" or "in heat".  Sexual behaviour may occur outside estrus,&lt;ref&gt;For example, masturbation, trial mounting, and other behaviours are regularly seen in male animals out of season&lt;/ref&gt; and such acts as do occur are not necessarily harmful.&lt;ref name="danish"&gt;2006 Danish Animal Ethics Council report: "The mucous membrane in the female animal’s vagina and the animal’s behaviour is under influence of its rut cycle. That means that the animal is physically and mentally more ready for sexual activities at some times than at others. But this does not mean that sexual activity will lead to injuries, fear or suffering, if it happens outside the rut period."&lt;br/&gt; (Danish: ''"Slimhinden i hundyrets vagina og dyrets adfærd er under indflydelse af dets brunstcyklus. Det betyder, at dyret er fysisk og mentalt mere parat til seksuelle aktiviteter på nogle tidspunkter end på andre. Men dette er ikke ensbetydende med, at den seksuelle aktivitet vil være forbundet med skader, angst og lidelse, hvis den foregår udenfor brunstperioden."'') [http://www.jm.dk/image.asp?page=image&amp;objno=76595 Report November 2006 (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312214507/http://www.jm.dk/image.asp?page=image&amp;objno=76595 |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mammals (e.g. domestic cats, rabbits and camilidae) are termed [[Induced ovulation (animals)|"induced ovulators"]].  For these species, the female ovulates due to an external stimulus during, or just prior, to mating, rather than ovulating cyclically or spontaneously. Stimuli causing induced ovulation include the sexual behaviour of coitus, sperm and pheromones.  
Domestic cats have [[penile spines]]. Upon withdrawal of a [[cat's penis]], the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which may cause ovulation.&lt;ref name="HayssenTienhoven1993"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Virginia Douglass Hayssen |author2 = Ari Van Tienhoven |title = Asdell's Patterns of Mammalian Reproduction: A Compendium of Species-specific Data |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yQzSe71g2AcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=spines |accessdate = 27 September 2013 |year = 1993 |publisher = Cornell University Press |isbn = 978-0-8014-1753-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aronson 1967"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Penile spines of the domestic cat: their endocrine-behavior relations.|last=Aronson|first=L.

===Amphibians===
For many amphibians, an annual breeding cycle applies, typically regulated by ambient temperature, precipitation, availability of surface water and food supply. This breeding season is accentuated in temperate regions, in boreal climate the breeding season is typically concentrated to a few short days in the spring.  Some species, such as the Rana Clamitans (green frog), spend from June to August defending their territory.  In order to protect these territories, they use five vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Kentwood D|title=Territoriality in the green frog (Rana clamitans): Vocalizations and agonistic behaviour|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=November 1978|volume=26|issue=4|pages=1051–1054|doi=10.1016/0003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347278900945|accessdate=2 October 2017|doi-broken-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish===
Like many [[coral reef]] dwellers, the [[clownfish]] spawn around the time of the full moon in the wild.  In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive female is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilisation. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. If the female clownfish is removed from the group, such as by death, one of the largest and most dominant males will become a female. The remaining males will move up a rank in the hierarchy.

==Motivation==
Various [[neurohormone]]s stimulate sexual wanting in animals. In general, studies have suggested that [[dopamine]] is involved in sexual incentive motivation, [[oxytocin]] and [[melanocortin]]s in sexual attraction, and [[noradrenaline]] in sexual arousal.&lt;ref name="georgiadis"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Georgiadis, J.

===Neurohormones in the mating systems of voles===
The mating system of [[prairie vole]]s is [[monogamous]]; after mating, they form a lifelong bond. In contrast, [[montane vole]]s have a [[polygamous]] mating system. When montane voles mate, they form no strong attachments, and separate after copulation. Studies{{Citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=No citation is given for the study referenced in the text.}} on the brains of these two species have found that it is two neurohormones and their respective receptors that are responsible for these differences in mating strategies. Male prairie voles release vasopressin after copulation with a partner, and an attachment to their partner then develops. Female prairie voles release oxytocin after  copulation with a partner, and similarly develop an attachment to their partner.

Neither male nor female montane voles release high quantities of oxytocin or vasopressin when they mate. Even when injected with these neurohormones, their mating system does not change. In contrast, if prairie voles are injected with the neurohormones, they may form a lifelong attachment, even if they have not mated. It's believed{{By whom|date=May 2017}} that the differing response to the neurohormones between the two species is due to a difference in the number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Prairie voles have a greater number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors compared to montane voles, and are therefore more sensitive to those two neurohormones. It's believed that it's the quantity of receptors, rather than the quantity of the hormones, that determines the mating system and bond-formation of either species.

===Oxytocin and rat sexual behaviour===
Mother rats experience a [[Estrous cycle|postparum estrus]] which makes them highly motivated to mate.  However, they also have a strong motivation to protect their newly born pups.  As a consequence, the mother rat solicits males to the nest but simultaneously becomes aggressive towards them to protect her young.  If the mother rat is given injections of an oxytocin [[receptor antagonist]], they no longer experience these maternal motivations.&lt;ref name="Kennet"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kennett, J.E. |author2=McKee, D.T.|year=2012|title=Oxytocin: An emerging regulator of prolactin secretion in the female rat|journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=403–412|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2011.02263.x|pmc=3288386| pmid= 22129099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolactin influences social bonding in rats.&lt;ref name="Kennet" /&gt;

===Oxytocin and primate sexual behaviour===
Oxytocin plays a similar role in non-human primates as it does in humans.

Grooming, sex, and cuddling frequencies correlate positively with levels of oxytocin. As the level of oxytocin increases so does sexual motivation. While oxytocin plays a major role in parent child relationships, it is also found to play a role in adult sexual relationships. Its secretion affects the nature of the relationship or if there will even be a relationship at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Pieper|first2=Bridget A.|last3=Boe|first3=Carla Y.|last4=Cronin|first4=Katherine A.|last5=Kurian|first5=Aimee V.|last6=Ziegler|first6=Toni E.|title=Variation in oxytocin is related to variation in affiliative behavior in monogamous, pairbonded tamarins|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0018506X10001741|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=58|issue=4|pages=614–618|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.06.014|pmid=20600045|pmc=2933949|year=2010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-2863-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that oxytocin is higher in monkeys in lifelong monogamous relationships compared to monkeys which are single. Furthermore, the oxytocin levels of the couples correlate positively; when the oxytocin secretion of one increases the other one also increases. Higher levels of oxytocin are related to monkeys expressing more behaviours such as cuddling, grooming and sex, while lower levels of oxytocin reduce motivation for these activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Research on oxytocin's role in the animal brain suggests that it plays less of a role in behaviours of love and affection than previously believed. "When oxytocin was first discovered in 1909, it was thought mostly to influence a mother’s labour contractions and milk let-down. Then, in the 1990s, research with prairie voles found that giving them a dose of oxytocin resulted in the formation of a bond with their future mate (Azar, 40)." Oxytocin has since been treated by the media as the sole player in the "love and mating game" in mammals. This view, however, is proving to be false as, "most hormones don’t influence behaviour directly. Rather, they affect thinking and emotions in variable ways (Azar, 40)." There is much more involved in sexual behaviour in the mammalian animal than oxytocin and vasopressin can explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert |first= K. |title= The Lab Rat Chronicles |year= 2011 |publisher= penguin group |location= New York |pages= 151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Azar |first= B. |title= Oxytocin's other side |url= http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/03/oxytocin.aspx |date= March 2011 |volume= 42 |issue= 3 |page= 40 |journal= Science Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aubert | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gustison | first2 = M.

===Pleasure{{anchor|Sex for pleasure}}===
It is often assumed that animals do not have sex for pleasure, or alternatively that humans, pigs, [[bonobo]]es (and perhaps dolphins and one or two more species of primates) are the only species that do. This is sometimes stated as "animals mate only for reproduction". This view is considered a misconception by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Elaine M., R. L. Meisel, and B. D. Sachs.

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
Even though the evolution-related purpose of mating can be said to be reproduction, it is not actually the creating of offspring which originally causes them to mate. It is probable that they mate because they are motivated for the actual copulation, and because this is connected with a positive experience. It is therefore reasonable to assume that there is some form of pleasure or satisfaction connected with the act. This assumption is confirmed by the behaviour of males, who in the case of many species are prepared to work to get access to female animals, especially if the female animal is in oestrus, and males who for breeding purposes are used to [[semen collection|having sperm collected]] become very eager, when the equipment they associate with the collection is taken out.&lt;ref name="animal ethics council"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Det Dyreetiske Råd |year=2006 |title=Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr |publisher=Justitsministeriet |url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |quote=Selv om det evolutionsmæssige formål med at parre sig kan siges at være reproduktion, er det ikke selve det, at dyrene får afkom, der i første omgang får dem til at parre sig.

Det er derfor rimeligt at antage, at der er en eller anden form for behag eller tilfredsstillelse forbundet med akten. Denne antagelse bekræftes af adfærden hos handyr, der for mange arters vedkommende er parate til at arbejde for at få adgang til hundyr, især hvis hundyret er i brunst, og handyr der i avlsøjemed er vant til at få tappet sæd – de viser stor ivrighed, når det udstyr, de forbinder med sædopsamlingen, tages frem. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227144357/http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
There is nothing in [[female mammals]]' anatomy or physiology that contradicts that [[sexual stimulation|stimulation of the sexual organs]] and mating is able to be a positive experience. For instance, the clitoris acts in the same way as with women, and scientific studies have shown that the success of reproduction is improved by stimulation of clitoris on (among other species) cows and mares in connection with insemination, because it improves the transportation of the sperm due to contractions of the inner genitalia. This probably also applies to female animals of other animal species, and contractions in the inner genitals are seen e.g. also during orgasm for women. It is therefore reasonable to assume that sexual intercourse may be linked with a positive experience for female animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Det Dyreetiske Råd |year=2006 |title=Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr |publisher=Justitsministeriet |url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |quote=Der er intet ved hunpattedyrenes anatomi eller fysiologi, der modsiger, at stimulation af kønsorganerne og parring skulle kunne være en positiv oplevelse – fx fungerer klitoris på samme måde som hos kvinder. Videnskabelige undersøgelser har vist, at reproduktionssuccesen forbedres ved stimulation af klitoris på bl.a. køer og hopper i forbindelse med insemination, fordi det forbedrer sædtransporten pga. sammentrækninger af de indre kønsdele. Dette gælder sandsynligvis også hundyr af andre dyrearter, og sammentrækninger i de indre kønsdele ses fx også under orgasme hos kvinder. Det er derfor rimeligt at antage, at det seksuelle samvær kan være forbundet med en positiv oplevelse for hundyrene. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227144357/http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Koinophilia==
{{Main|Koinophilia}}

[[Koinophilia]] is the love of the "normal" or phenotypically common (from the Greek, ''koinos'', meaning "the usual" or "common").&lt;ref name=Koeslag1990&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koeslag | first1 = J.H. | year = 1990 | title = Koinophilia groups sexual creatures into species, promotes stasis, and stabilizes social behaviour | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 15–35 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80297-8 | pmid=2200930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to scientific literature in 1990, and refers to the tendency of animals seeking a mate to prefer that mate not to have any unusual, peculiar or deviant features.&lt;ref name=Koeslag1990 /&gt;  Similarly, animals preferentially choose mates with low [[fluctuating asymmetry]]. 
&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moller, A.P.  |author2=Pomiankowski, A |title=Fluctuating asymmetry and sexual selection|journal=Genetica|volume=89|pages=267–279|year=1993|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02424520#page-2|doi=10.1007/bf02424520}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, animal sexual ornaments can evolve through runaway selection, which is driven by (usually female) selection for non-standard traits.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1986). The Blind Watchmaker. Longman, London. Published in Penguin Books 1988, 1991, and 2006. Chapter 8, Explosions and Spirals.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation bias==
The field of study of sexuality in non-human species was a long-standing [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="news-medical"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/23/1500-animal-species-practice-homosexuality.aspx |title= 1,500 animal species practice homosexuality |date= 23 October 2006 |publisher= News-medical.net |accessdate= 19 February 2007}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past, researchers sometimes failed to observe, mis-categorising and mis-described sexual behaviour which [[Observer bias|did not meet their preconceptions]] (mainly from western [[puritanism]]). In earlier periods, bias tended to support what would now be described as conservative sexual mores. An example of overlooking behaviour relates to descriptions of [[giraffe]] mating:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
When nine out of ten pairings occur between males, "[e]very male that sniffed a female was reported as sex, while [[anal sex|anal intercourse]] with [[orgasm]] between males was only [categorized as] 'revolving around' [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]], competition or greetings."&lt;ref name="news-medical" /&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 21st century, liberal social or sexual views are often projected upon animal subjects of research. Popular discussions of bonobos are a frequently cited example. Current research frequently expresses views such as that of the [[Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo]], which in 2006 held an exhibition on animal sexuality:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
Many researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realise that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's ethical principles.&lt;ref name="news-medical" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other animal activities may be misinterpreted due to the frequency and context in which animals perform the behaviour. For example, domestic ruminants display behaviours such as mounting and head-butting.  This often occurs when the animals are establishing dominance relationships and are not necessarily sexually motivated. Careful analysis must be made to interpret what animal motivations are being expressed by those behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Types of sexual behaviour==

===Reproductive sexual behaviour===
====Copulation====
{{Main|Copulation (zoology)}}
Copulation is the union of the male and female [[sex organs]], the innate sexual activity specifically organized to transmit male sperm into the body of the female.

In non-primate mammals (for example, [[rodent]]s, [[canidae|canines]], [[felidae|felines]], [[bovine]]s, and [[equine]]s), the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation.&lt;ref name="Knobil"&gt;Knobil E., Neill J.D. (Eds). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1_1cDe92k_YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The physiology of reproduction]. Academic Press, 3nd edition, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cuckoldry====
[[File:BlueGill 002.jpg|thumb|right|Small male [[bluegill]] sunfishes [[cuckold]] large males by adopting ''sneaker'' strategies.]]
{{See also|Cuckoldry in fish}}

Alternative male strategies which allow small males to engage in [[cuckoldry]] can develop in species such as fish where [[spawning]] is dominated by large and aggressive males. Cuckoldry is a variant of [[Polyandry in nature|polyandry]], and can occur with ''sneak spawners''. A sneak spawner is a male that rushes in to join the spawning rush of a spawning pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=streak+spawning&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is Streak spawning] Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A spawning rush occurs when a fish makes a burst of speed, usually on a near vertical incline, releasing [[gamete]]s at the apex, followed by a rapid return to the lake or sea floor or fish aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=spawning+rush&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is Spawning rush] Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sneaking males do not take part in courtship. In salmon and trout, for example, ''jack males'' are common. These are small silvery males that migrate upstream along with the standard, large, hook-nosed males and that spawn by sneaking into [[Spawn (biology)|redds]] to release sperm simultaneously with a mated pair. This behaviour is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] for reproduction, because it is favoured by natural selection just like the "standard" strategy of large males.&lt;ref&gt;Gross MR (1984) "Sunfish, salmon, and the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics in fishes". Pages 55–75 in GW Potts and RJ Wottoon, eds. ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics''. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hermaphroditism====
[[File:Georgia Aquarium - Giant Grouper.jpg|thumb|right|Female [[grouper]]s change their sex to male if no male is available.]]
{{See also|Sequential hermaphroditism}}

[[Hermaphroditism]] occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternative between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with [[gonochorism]], where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of [[teleost]] fishes.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984"&gt;Shapiro DY (1984) "Sex reversal and sociodemographics processes in coral reef fishes" Pages 103–116 in GW Potts and RK Wootoon, eds., ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually hermaphrodites are ''[[Sequential hermaphroditism|sequential]]'', meaning they can [[Sex change|switch sex]], usually from female to male ([[protogyny]]). This can happen if a dominant male is removed from a group of females. The largest female in the harem can switch sex over a few days and replace the dominant male.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984" /&gt; This is found amongst [[coral reef fish]]es such as [[grouper]]s, [[parrotfish]]es and [[wrass]]es. It is less common for a male to switch to a female ([[protandry]]).&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|162}} As an example, most [[wrasse]]s are [[protogynous]] hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system.&lt;ref name="Robertson1978"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Sexual cannibalism====
{{Main|Sexual cannibalism}}

Sexual cannibalism is a behaviour in which a female animal kills and consumes the male before, during, or after copulation. Sexual cannibalism confers fitness advantages to both the male and female.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Sexual cannibalism is common among insects, arachnids&lt;ref name="No7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polis | first1 = G.A. | year = 1981 | title = The evolution and dynamics of intraspecific +4193 predation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 225–251 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.001301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].&lt;ref name="No7" /&gt; There is also evidence of sexual cannibalism in [[Gastropoda|gastropods]] and [[copepod]]s.&lt;ref name="No8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bilde | first1 = T. | last2 = Tuni | first2 = C. | last3 = Elsayed | first3 = R. | last4 = Pekár | first4 = S. | last5 = Toft | first5 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Death feigning in the face of sexual cannibalism | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 23–5 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0392 | pmid=17148316 | pmc=1617195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual coercion====
{{Main|Sexual coercion}}
[[File:Cairina moschata reproduction.jpg|thumb|During mating, the male [[muscovy duck]] typically immobilises the female.]]

Sex in a forceful or apparently coercive context has been documented in a variety of species.  In some [[herbivore|herbivorous]] herd species, or species where males and females are very different in size, the male [[dominance (ethology)|dominates]] sexually by force and size.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Some species of birds have been observed combining sexual intercourse with apparent violent assault; these include [[duck]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey, R.O. |author2=Seymour, N.

In the [[water beetle]] genus ''[[Acilius genus|Acilius]]'', an "[[evolutionary arms race]]" between the two sexes means that there is no courtship system for these beetles. Their mating behaviours include males holding females underwater until exhausted, and allowing only occasional access to the surface to breathe for up to six hours (to prevent them breeding with other males), and females which have a variety of body shapings (to prevent males from gaining a grip).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1980376.ece "Not tonight, not ever.

====Parthenogenesis====
[[Parthenogenesis]] is a form of asexual reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wininger|first=J. David|date=2004|pages=635–637|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-012436643-5/50072-9|isbn=9780124366435|title=Handbook of Stem Cells|chapter=Parthenogenetic Stem Cells}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, parthenogenesis is not a behaviour, however, sexual behaviours may be involved.

[[Cnemidophorus|Whip-tailed lizard]] females have the ability to reproduce through parthenogenesis and as such males are rare and sexual breeding non-standard. Females engage in "pseudocopulation"&lt;ref name="Whiptail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/05/the-new-mexico-whiptail-lizard-is-made-up-entirely-of-females/|title=New Mexico whiptail lizards are all females|author=Hiskey, D.|accessdate=13 February 2015|date=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to stimulate [[ovulation]], with their behaviour following their hormonal cycles; during low levels of oestrogen, these (female) lizards engage in "masculine" sexual roles. Those animals with currently high oestrogen levels assume "feminine" sexual roles.  Lizards that perform the courtship ritual have greater fecundity than those kept in isolation due to an increase in hormones triggered by the sexual behaviours. So, even though asexual whiptail lizards populations lack males, sexual stimuli still increase reproductive success.  From an [[evolutionary]] standpoint these females are passing their full genetic code to all of their offspring rather than the 50% of genes that would be passed in sexual reproduction.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

It is rare to find true parthenogenesis in fishes, where females produce female offspring with no input from males. All-female species include the Texas [[silverside (fish)|silverside]], ''Menidia clarkhubbsi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Echelle AA, Echelle AF, Crozier CD | year = 1983 | title = Evolution of an all-female fish, ''Menidia clarkhubbsi'' (Atherinidae) | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 772–784 | doi = 10.2307/2407918 | pmid = 28568119 | jstor = 2407918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a complex of Mexican [[Poecilia|mollies]].&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|162}}

====Unisexuality====
[[Unisexuality]] occurs when a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, and can take complex forms. ''[[Squalius alburnoides]]'', a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, appears to be an all-male species. The existence of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is [[diploid]], but not hermaphroditic. It can have [[triploid]] and [[tetraploid]] forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through [[hybridogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alves MJ, Collarea-Pereira MJ, Dowling TE, Coelho MM | year = 2002 | title = The genetics of maintenance of an all-male lineage in the ''Squalius alburnoides'' complex | url = | journal = J.

Invertebrates are often [[hermaphrodite]]s. Some hermaphroditic [[land snail]]s begin mating with an elaborate tactile courting ritual. The two snails circle around each other for up to six hours, touching with their tentacles, and biting lips and the area of the genital pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding an organ housing a sharpened dart. The dart is made of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[chitin]], and is called a [[love dart]]. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the love dart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s002650100345 |title=Dart receipt promotes sperm storage in the garden snail Helix aspersa |year=2001 |last1=Rogers |first1=David |last2=Chase |first2=Ronald |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=122–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the snails have fired their darts, they copulate and exchange sperm as a separate part of the mating progression. The love darts are covered with a mucus that contains a [[hormone]]-like substance that facilitates the survival of the sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chase, R.| year=2007 |title=The function of dart shooting in helicid snails |journal=American Malacological Bulletin |volume=23 |pages=183–189 |doi=10.4003/0740-2783-23.1.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgill.ca"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chase, R. |author2=Blanchard, K.

[[Penis fencing]] is a mating behaviour engaged in by certain species of [[flatworm]], such as ''[[Pseudobiceros bedfordi]]''. Species which engage in the practice are hermaphroditic, possessing both eggs and sperm-producing testes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/kcet/shapeoflife/episodes/hunt_explo2.html |title= Fighting to mate: flatworm penis fencing |author= Newman, Leslie |publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species "fence" using two-headed dagger-like penises which are pointed, and white in colour. One organism inseminates the other. The sperm is absorbed through pores in the skin, causing fertilisation.

[[Coral]]s can be both [[Gonochorism|gonochoristic]] (unisexual) and [[Hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]], each of which can reproduce sexually and asexually. Reproduction also allows corals to settle new areas. Corals predominantly reproduce [[sexual reproduction|sexually]]. 25% of [[hermatypic coral]]s (stony corals) form single sex ([[gonochoristic]]) colonies, while the rest are [[hermaphroditic]].&lt;ref name="Veron"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reproductive synchrony|Synchronous spawning]] is very typical on the coral reef and often, even when multiple [[species]] are present, all corals spawn on the same night. This synchrony is essential so that male and female gametes can meet. Corals must rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve lunar changes, sunset time, and possibly chemical signalling.&lt;ref name="Veron" /&gt; Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=Hatta&gt;

Butterflies spend much time searching for mates. When the male spots a mate, he will fly closer and release [[pheromone]]s. He then performs a special [[courtship dance]] to attract the female. If the female appreciates the dancing she may join him. Then they join their bodies together end to end at their [[abdomen]]s. Here, the male passes the sperm to the female's egg-laying tube, which will soon be fertilised by the sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scienceray.com/biology/zoology/13-strangest-and-most-unusual-sexual-behavior-among-the-animals/2/ |title= Chan Lee Peng, August 2008 |publisher= Scienceray.com |accessdate= 5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals make [[copulatory plug|plugs of mucus]] to seal the female's [[Body orifice|orifice]] after mating. Normally such plugs are secreted by the male, to block subsequent partners.

They use these to pick their sperm up from their genitals and insert it into the female's sexual orifice, rather than copulating directly.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; On the 14 occasions a sexual plug was made, the female produced it without assistance from the male. On ten of these occasions the male's pedipalps then seemed to get stuck while he was transferring the sperm (which is rarely the case in other species of spider), and he had great difficulty freeing himself. In two of those ten instances, he was eaten as a result.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

==Inbreeding avoidance==
{{Main|Inbreeding avoidance}}

When close relatives mate, progeny may exhibit the detrimental effects of [[inbreeding depression]].  Inbreeding depression is predominantly caused by the [[homozygous]] expression of recessive deleterious alleles.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |year=2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, inbreeding depression may lead to the evolution of [[inbreeding avoidance]] behaviour.  Several examples of animal behaviour that reduce mating of close relatives and inbreeding depression are described next.

Reproductively active female [[naked mole-rat]]s tend to associate with unfamiliar males (usually non-kin), whereas reproductively inactive females do not discriminate.&lt;ref name="pmid10584337"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke FM, Faulkes CG |title=Kin discrimination and female mate choice in the naked mole-rat Heterocephalus glaber |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=266 |issue=1432 |pages=1995–2002 |year=1999 |pmid=10584337 |pmc=1690316 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0877 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The preference of reproductively active females for unfamiliar males is interpreted as an adaptation for avoiding inbreeding.

When mice inbreed with close relatives in their natural habitat, there is a significant detrimental effect on progeny survival.&lt;ref name="pmid7939661"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiménez JA, Hughes KA, Alaks G, Graham L, Lacy RC |title=An experimental study of inbreeding depression in a natural habitat |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5183 |pages=271–3 |year=1994 |pmid=7939661 |doi= 10.1126/science.7939661|url=|bibcode=1994Sci...266..271J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the house mouse, the [[Major urinary proteins|major urinary protein]] (MUP) gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity that appears to underlie [[kin recognition]] and [[inbreeding avoidance]].   Thus there are fewer matings between mice sharing MUP [[haplotype]]s than would be expected if there were random mating.&lt;ref name="pmid17997307"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherborne AL, Thom MD, Paterson S, Jury F, Ollier WE, Stockley P, Beynon RJ, Hurst JL |title=The genetic basis of inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=23 |pages=2061–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17997307 |pmc=2148465 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.041 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meerkat]] females appear to be able to discriminate the odour of their kin from the odour of their non-kin.&lt;ref name="pmid23234867"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leclaire S, Nielsen JF, Thavarajah NK, Manser M, Clutton-Brock TH |title=Odour-based kin discrimination in the cooperatively breeding meerkat |journal=Biol. Lett. |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=20121054 |year=2013 |pmid=23234867 |pmc=3565530 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.1054 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kin recognition is a useful ability that facilitates both cooperation among relatives and the avoidance of inbreeding.  When mating does occur between meerkat relatives, it often results in [[inbreeding depression]].  Inbreeding depression was evident for a variety of traits: pup mass at emergence from the natal burrow, hind-foot length, growth until independence and juvenile survival.&lt;ref name="pmid22497583"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nielsen JF, English S, Goodall-Copestake WP, Wang J, Walling CA, Bateman AW, Flower TP, Sutcliffe RL, Samson J, Thavarajah NK, Kruuk LE, Clutton-Brock TH, Pemberton JM |title=Inbreeding and inbreeding depression of early life traits in a cooperative mammal |journal=Mol.

The [[Grey red-backed vole|grey-sided vole]] (''Myodes rufocanus'') exhibits male-biased dispersal as a means of avoiding incestuous matings.&lt;ref name="pmid19140979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishibashi Y, Saitoh T |title=Role of male-biased dispersal in inbreeding avoidance in the grey-sided vole (Myodes rufocanus) |journal=Mol.

In natural populations of the bird ''Parus major'' (great tit), inbreeding is likely avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.&lt;ref name="pmid18211876"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szulkin M, Sheldon BC |title=Dispersal as a means of inbreeding avoidance in a wild bird population |journal=Proc.

[[Toad]]s display [[Philopatry#Breeding-site philopatry|breeding site fidelity]], as do many [[amphibian]]s.  Individuals that return to natal ponds to breed will likely encounter [[sibling]]s as potential mates.  Although [[incest]] is possible, ''Bufo americanus'' siblings rarely mate.  These toads likely recognise and actively avoid close kins as mates.  Advertisement vocalisations by males appear to serve as cues by which females recognise their kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldman | first1 = B | last2 = Rice | first2 = JE | last3 = Honeycutt | first3 = RL | year = 1992 | title = Kin recognition and incest avoidance in toads | url = | journal = Am.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Aortic dissection''' ('''AD''') occurs when an injury to the [[Tunica intima|innermost layer]] of the [[aorta]] allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, [[Dissection (medical)|forcing the layers apart]].&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt; In most cases this is associated with a sudden onset of severe [[acute aortic syndrome|chest or back pain]], often described as "tearing" in character.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt; Also, vomiting, [[diaphoresis|sweating]], and [[lightheadedness]] may occur.&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt; Other symptoms may result from decreased blood supply to other organs such as [[stroke]] or [[mesenteric ischemia]].&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt; Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death from [[myocardial ischemia|not enough blood flow to the heart]] or complete [[Aortic rupture|rupture of the aorta]].&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Aortic dissection is more common in those with a history of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], a number of [[connective tissue disease]]s that affect blood vessel wall strength such as [[Marfan syndrome]] and [[Ehlers Danlos syndrome]], a [[bicuspid aortic valve]], and previous [[heart surgery]].&lt;ref name=White2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=A|last2=Broder|first2=J|last3=Mando-Vandrick|first3=J|last4=Wendell|first4=J|last5=Crowe|first5=J|title=Acute aortic emergencies--part 2: aortic dissections.|journal=[[Advanced Emergency Nursing Journal]]|date=2013|volume=35|issue=1|pages=28–52|pmid=23364404|doi=10.1097/tme.0b013e31827145d0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt; [[Major trauma]], [[smoking]], [[cocaine]] use, [[pregnancy]], a [[thoracic aortic aneurysm]], [[arteritis|inflammation of arteries]], and [[dyslipidemia|abnormal lipid levels]] are also associated with an increased risk.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt; The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms with [[medical imaging]] such as [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]], or [[echocardiography|ultrasound]] used to confirm and further evaluate the dissection.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; The two main types are Stanford type A which involves the [[ascending aorta|first part of the aorta]] and type B which does not.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is by blood pressure control and not smoking.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; Treatment of aortic dissection depends on the part of the aorta involved.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; Dissections that involve the first part of the aorta usually require surgery.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt; Surgery may be done either by an opening in the chest or by [[endovascular aneurysm repair]]; carried out from [[Endovascular surgery|inside the blood vessels]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nienaber|first1=CA|last2=Clough|first2=RE|title=Management of acute aortic dissection.|journal=Lancet|date=28 February 2015|volume=385|issue=9970|pages=800–11|pmid=25662791|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissections that involve the second part of the aorta can typically be treated with medications that lower blood pressure and heart-rate, unless there are complications.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Aortic dissection is relatively rare, occurring at an estimated rate of three per 100,000 people per year.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Criado2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Criado FJ |title=Aortic dissection: a 250-year perspective |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=694–700 |year=2011 |pmid=22199439 |pmc=3233335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more common in males than females.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; The typical age at diagnosis is 63, with about 10% of cases occurring before 40.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt; Without treatment, about half of people with type A die within three days and about 10% of people with type B die within a month.&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt; The first case of aortic dissection described was in the examination of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]] following his death in 1760.&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt; Surgery for aortic dissection was introduced in the 1950s by [[Michael E. DeBakey]].&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
About 96% of individuals with aortic dissection present with severe pain that had a sudden onset.  The pain may be described as a tearing, stabbing, or sharp sensation; 17% of individuals feel the pain migrate as the dissection extends down the aorta.  The location of pain is associated with the location of the dissection. [[Anterior]] chest pain is associated with dissections involving the ascending aorta, while interscapular (back) pain is associated with descending aortic dissections.  If the pain is [[pleurisy|pleuritic]] in nature, it may suggest acute [[pericarditis]] caused by bleeding into the [[Pericardium|pericardial sac]].  This is a particularly dangerous eventuality, suggesting that acute [[pericardial tamponade]] may be imminent. Pericardial tamponade is the most common cause of death from aortic dissection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Isselbacher E.M. | author2 = Cigarroa J.E. | author3 = Eagle K.A. | year = 1994 | title = Cardiac Tamponade Complicating Proximal Aortic Dissection. Is Pericardiocentesis Harmful? | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/90/5/2375 | journal = Circulation | volume = 90 | issue =  | pages = 2375–2378 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.90.5.2375 | pmid = 7955196 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160318081737/http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/90/5/2375 | archivedate = 2016-03-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pain may be confused with the pain of a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), aortic dissection is usually not associated with the other signs that suggest myocardial infarction, including heart failure and [[ECG]] changes.

Individuals with aortic dissection who do not present with pain have a chronic dissection.

Less common symptoms that may be seen in the setting of aortic dissection include [[congestive heart failure]] (7%), [[syncope (medicine)|fainting]] (9%), [[stroke]] (6%), ischemic [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[paraplegia]], and [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name=She2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheikh|first=AS|author2=Ali, K|author3= Mazhar, S|title=Acute aortic syndrome.|journal=Circulation|date=Sep 3, 2013|volume=128|issue=10|pages=1122–7|pmid=24002714|doi=10.1161/circulationaha.112.000170}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the individual had a fainting episode, about half the time it is due to bleeding into the pericardium leading to pericardial tamponade.

Neurological complications of aortic dissection (i.e., [[stroke]] and [[paralysis]]) are due to the involvement of one or more arteries supplying portions of the [[central nervous system]].

If the aortic dissection involves the abdominal aorta, compromise of the branches of the abdominal aorta is possible.  In abdominal aortic dissections, compromise of one or both [[renal artery|renal arteries]] occurs in 5–8% of cases, while mesenteric [[ischemia]] (ischemia of the [[intestine]]s) occurs about 3% of the time.&lt;ref name="pmid26024781"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orihashi K |title=Mesenteric ischemia in acute aortic dissection |journal=Surg. Today |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=509–16 |date=May 2016 |pmid=26024781 |doi=10.1007/s00595-015-1193-4 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28823323"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kamman AV, Yang B, Kim KM, Williams DM, Michael Deeb G, Patel HJ |title=Visceral Malperfusion in Aortic Dissection: The Michigan Experience |journal=Semin. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=173–178 |date=2017 |pmid=28823323 |doi=10.1053/j.semtcvs.2016.10.002 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood pressure===
People with an aortic dissection often have a history of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]; the blood pressure is quite variable at presentation with acute aortic dissection, and tends to be higher in individuals with a distal dissection. In individuals with a proximal aortic dissection, 36% present with hypertension, while 25% present with [[hypotension]]. Proximal aortic dissections tend to be more associated with weakening of the vascular wall due to [[cystic medial degeneration]]. In those who present with distal (type B) aortic dissections, 60-70% present with high blood pressure, while 2-3% present with [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="Alfson2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alfson|first1=DB|last2=Ham|first2=SW|title=Type B Aortic Dissections: Current Guidelines for Treatment|journal=Cardiology Clinics|date=August 2017|volume=35|issue=3|pages=387–410|doi=10.1016/j.ccl.2017.03.007|pmid=28683909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe hypotension at presentation is a grave prognostic indicator. It is usually associated with pericardial tamponade, severe aortic insufficiency, or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of the blood pressure is important. Pseudohypotension (falsely low blood-pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the [[brachiocephalic artery]] (supplying the right arm) or the [[subclavian artery|left subclavian artery]] (supplying the left arm).

===Aortic insufficiency===
[[Aortic insufficiency]] (AI) occurs in half to two-thirds of ascending aortic dissections, and the diastolic [[heart sounds|heart murmur]] of aortic insufficiency is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections. The intensity (loudness) of the murmur depends on the blood pressure and may be inaudible in the event of low blood pressure.

Multiple causes exist for AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the [[aortic valve]], so that the leaflets of the valve cannot coapt. Another mechanism is that the dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. The third mechanism is that if there was an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV outflow tract, causing intimal [[intussusception (blood vessel growth)|intussusception]] into the aortic valve preventing proper valve closure.

===Myocardial infarction===
Myocardial infarction (heart attack) occurs in 1–2% of aortic dissections. The cause of the infarction is involvement of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]], which supply the heart with oxygenated blood, in the dissection. The right coronary artery is involved more commonly than the left coronary artery. If the myocardial infarction is treated with [[thrombolytic]] therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac causing [[cardiac tamponade]].

Because aortic dissection may present to the [[emergency room]] [[physician]] similar to a myocardial infarction, the physician must be careful to make the proper diagnosis prior to initiating treatment for myocardial infarction since the treatment regimen for myocardial infarction can be lethal to an individual presenting with aortic dissection.

===Pleural effusion===
A [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection in the space between the [[lung]]s and the chest wall or [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]) can be due to either blood from a transient rupture of the aorta or fluid due to an inflammatory reaction around the aorta. If a pleural effusion were to develop due to an aortic dissection, it is more commonly in the left hemithorax rather than the right hemithorax.

==Causes==
Aortic dissection is associated with [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and many [[connective tissue]] disorders. [[Vasculitis]] ([[inflammation]] of an artery) is rarely associated with aortic dissection. It can also be the result of chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an aortic dissection have a previous history of hypertension. Illicit drug use with stimulants such as [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamine]] is also a modifiable risk factor for AD.&lt;ref name="Lech2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25657055"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stankowski RV, Kloner RA, Rezkalla SH |title=Cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use |journal=Trends Cardiovasc. Med. |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=517–26 |date=August 2015 |pmid=25657055 |doi=10.1016/j.tcm.2014.12.013 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be caused by smoking.

A [[bicuspid aortic valve]] (a type of [[congenital heart disease]] involving the [[aortic valve]]) is found in 7–14% of individuals who have an aortic dissection. These individuals are prone to dissection in the ascending aorta. The risk of dissection in individuals with bicuspid aortic valve is not associated with the degree of [[aortic stenosis|stenosis]] of the valve.

[[Connective tissue disorder]]s such as [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], and [[Loeys–Dietz syndrome]] increase the risk of aortic dissection.&lt;ref name="Alfson2017"/&gt; Similarly, vasculitides such as [[Takayasu's arteritis]], [[giant cell arteritis]], [[polyarteritis nodosa]], and [[Behcet's disease]] have been associated with a subsequent aortic dissection.&lt;ref name="Alfson2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lech2017"/&gt;  Marfan's syndrome is found in 5-9% of individuals who had an aortic dissection. In this subset, the incidence in young individuals is increased. Individuals with Marfan syndrome tend to have aneurysms of the aorta and are more prone to proximal dissections of the aorta.&lt;ref name="pmid24443022"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook JR, Ramirez F |title=Clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of the Marfan syndrome |journal=Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. |volume=802 |issue= |pages=77–94 |date=2014 |pmid=24443022 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7893-1_6 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turner syndrome]] also increases the risk of aortic dissection, by aortic root dilatation.&lt;ref name=Turner2006/&gt;

Chest trauma leading to aortic dissection can be divided into two groups based on cause: blunt chest trauma (commonly seen in [[car accident]]s) and [[iatrogenic]]. Iatrogenic causes include trauma during [[cardiac catheterization]] or due to an [[intra-aortic balloon pump]].

Aortic dissection may be a late sequela of [[cardiac surgery|heart surgery]]. About 18% of individuals who present with an acute aortic dissection have a history of open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone aortic valve replacement for [[aortic insufficiency]] are at particularly high risk because aortic insufficiency causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta. This can cause dilatation and weakening of the walls of the ascending aorta.

[[Syphilis]] only potentially causes aortic dissection in its tertiary stage.&lt;ref name=Kamalakannan2007/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:AoDissect Schema 01a.png|right|thumb|Blood penetrates the intima and enters the media layer.]]
As with all other arteries, the aorta is made up of three layers, the [[tunica intima|intima]], the [[tunica media|media]], and the [[tunica adventitia|adventitia]]. The intima is in direct contact with the blood inside the vessel, and mainly consists of a layer of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] on a [[basement membrane]]; the media contains connective and muscle tissue, and the vessel is protected on the outside by the adventitia, comprising connective tissue.&lt;ref name=Hiratzka2010/&gt;

In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima and enters the media layer. The high pressure rips the [[biological tissue|tissue]] of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart.&lt;ref name=Seidensticker2008&gt;Das M., Mahnken A.H. and Wildberger J.E., “Dual Energy: CTA Aorta” in Seidensticker P.R. and Hofmann L.K. (eds.), [https://books.google.com.ar/booksid=oUtHea3ZnJ0C&amp;dq=Seidensticker+P.R.+and+Hofmann+L.K&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s   ''Dual Source CT Imaging'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Springer Medizin Verlag, Heidelberg, 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-540-77601-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This can propagate along the length of the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100&amp;nbsp;mm of the [[aortic valve]], so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.

[[File:Aortic dissection (1) Victoria blue-HE.jpg|thumb|Histopathological image of dissecting aneurysm of thoracic aorta in a patient without evidence of Marfan syndrome: The damaged aorta was surgically removed and replaced by artificial vessel, Victoria blue &amp; HE stain.]]
The initiating event in an aortic dissection is a tear in the intimal lining of the aorta. Due to the high pressures in the aorta, blood enters the media at the point of the tear.  The force of the blood entering the media causes the tear to extend. It may extend proximally (closer to the heart) or distally (away from the heart) or both. The blood travels through the media, creating a [[pseudoaneurysm|false lumen]] (the true lumen is the normal conduit of blood in the aorta). Separating the false lumen from the true lumen is a layer of intimal tissue known as the intimal flap.

The vast majority of aortic dissections originate with an intimal tear in either the [[ascending aorta]] (65%), the [[aortic arch]] (10%), or just distal to the [[ligamentum arteriosum]] in the [[Descending aorta|descending thoracic aorta]] (20%).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}

As blood flows down the false lumen, it may cause secondary tears in the intima. Through these secondary tears, the blood can re-enter the true lumen.

While it is not always clear why an intimal tear may occur, quite often it involves degeneration of the [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] that make up the media. This is known as [[cystic medial necrosis]] and is most commonly associated with Marfan syndrome and is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

In about 13% of aortic dissections, no evidence of an intimal tear is found. In these cases, the inciting event is thought to be an intramural [[hematoma]] (caused by bleeding within the media). Since no direct connection exists between the true lumen and the false lumen in these cases, diagnosing an aortic dissection by [[#Aortogram|aortography]] is difficult if the cause is an intramural hematoma. An aortic dissection secondary to an intramural hematoma should be treated the same as one caused by an intimal tear.

==Diagnosis==
Because of the varying symptoms of aortic dissection, the diagnosis is sometimes difficult to make. Concern should be increased in those with low blood pressure, neurological problems, and an unequal pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohle|first1=R|last2=Kareemi|first2=HK|last3=Wells|first3=G|last4=Perry|first4=JJ|title=Clinical Examination for Acute Aortic Dissection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|date=18 December 2017|doi=10.1111/acem.13360|pmid=29265487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While taking a good history from the individual may be strongly suggestive of an aortic dissection, the diagnosis cannot always be made by history and physical signs alone.  Often, the diagnosis is made by visualization of the intimal flap on a diagnostic imaging test. Common tests used to diagnose an aortic dissection include a [[CT scan]] of the chest with iodinated contrast material and a [[transesophageal echocardiogram]]. The proximity of the aorta to the [[esophagus]] allows the use of [[high-frequency ultrasound|higher-frequency ultrasound]] for better anatomical images. Other tests that may be used include an aortogram or magnetic resonance angiogram of the aorta.  Each of these tests has pros and cons, and they do not have equal sensitivities and specificities in the diagnosis of aortic dissection.

In general, the imaging technique chosen is based on the pretest likelihood of the diagnosis, availability of the testing modality, patient stability, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

===D-dimer===
A measurement of blood [[D-dimer]] level may be useful in diagnostic evaluation. A level less than 500&amp;nbsp;ng/ml may be considered evidence against a diagnosis of aortic dissection,&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shimony2011/&gt; although this guideline is only applicable in cases deemed "low risk"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asha|first1=SE|last2=Miers|first2=JW|title=A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of D-dimer as a Rule-out Test for Suspected Acute Aortic Dissection.|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=21 March 2015|pmid=25805111|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2015.02.013|volume=66|pages=368–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within 24 hours of symptom onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bossone|first=E|author2=Suzuki, T|author3= Eagle, KA|author4= Weinsaft, JW|title=Diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes : imaging and beyond.|journal=Herz|date=May 2013|volume=38|issue=3|pages=269–76|pmid=23263244|doi=10.1007/s00059-012-3710-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heart Association]] does not advise using this test in making the diagnosis, as evidence is still tentative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Evidence-Based Approach To Acute Aortic Syndromes|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|date=December 2013|volume=15|issue=12|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&amp;topic_id=388|author=Bruce M.

===Chest X-ray===
[[File:AoDiss ChestXRay.jpg|thumb|Aortic dissection on CXR: Note is made of a wide [[aortic knob]].]]
[[Chest radiograph]]y may demonstrate a change in the morphology of the thoracic aorta which can be seen in aortic dissection. Classically, new widening of the [[mediastinum]] on radiograph is of moderate [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] for detecting an ascending aortic dissection; however, this finding is of low [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]], as many other conditions can cause apparent widening of the mediastinum.

There are several other associated radiographic findings:
* The "calcium sign" describes an apparent separation of the intimal calcification from the outer aortic margin by greater than 10&amp;nbsp;mm.
* [[Pleural effusion]]s, more commonly in descending aortic dissections, and typically left sided.
* Other: obliteration of the [[aortic knob]], depression of the left mainstem bronchus, loss of the paratracheal stripe, and tracheal deviation.
Importantly, about 12 to 20% of aortic dissections are not detectable by chest radiograph; therefore, a "normal" chest radiograph does not rule out aortic dissection. If there is high clinical suspicion, a more sensitive imaging test ([[Computed tomography angiography|CT angiogram]], [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MR angiography]], or [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal echo]]) may be warranted.

===Computed tomography===
[[Computed tomography angiography]] is a fast, noninvasive test that gives an accurate three-dimensional view of the aorta. These images are produced by taking rapid, thin-cut slices of the chest and abdomen, and combining them in the computer to create cross-sectional slices. To delineate the aorta to the accuracy necessary to make the proper diagnosis, an iodinated contrast material is injected into a peripheral vein. Contrast is injected and the scan performed using a [[bolus tracking]] method. This type of scan is timed to an injection to capture the contrast as it enters the aorta. The scan then follows the contrast as it flows through the vessel. It has a sensitivity of 96 to 100% and a specificity of 96 to 100%. Disadvantages include the need for iodinated contrast material and the inability to diagnose the site of the intimal tear.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===MRI===
[[File:AoDiss MRT.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of an aortic dissection&lt;br/&gt;''1'' Aorta descendens with dissection&lt;br/&gt;''2'' Aorta isthmus]]
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is also used for the detection and assessment of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 98%. An MRI examination of the aorta produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the aorta, allowing the physician to determine the location of the intimal tear and the involvement of branch vessels, and to locate any secondary tears. It is a noninvasive test, does not require the use of iodinated contrast material, and can detect and quantitate the degree of aortic insufficiency.

The disadvantage of the MRI scan in the face of aortic dissection is that it has limited availability and is often located only in larger hospitals, and the scan is relatively time-consuming, which may be dangerous in people who are already very unwell. Due to the high-intensity magnetic fields used during MRI, it is contraindicated in individuals with metallic implants. In addition, many individuals experience [[claustrophobia]] while in the MRI scanning tube.

===Ultrasound===

In the image to the right, color flow during ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] suggests that the upper lumen is the true lumen.}}
The [[transesophageal echocardiogram]] (TEE) is a relatively good test in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity up to 98% and a specificity up to 97%. It has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected aortic dissection. It is a relatively noninvasive test, requiring the individual to swallow the echocardiography probe. It is especially good in the evaluation of AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection, and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during transesophageal echocardiography for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the [[aortic arch]]), and the descending abdominal aorta that lies below the [[stomach]]. A TEE may be technically difficult to perform in individuals with esophageal strictures or [[esophageal varices|varices]].

===Aortogram===
{{Main|Aortography}}
An aortogram involves placement of a catheter in the aorta and injection of contrast material while taking X-rays of the aorta. The procedure is known as [[aortography]]. Previously thought to be the diagnostic [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]], it has been supplanted by other, less-invasive imaging modalities.

Several different classification systems have been used to describe aortic dissections. One such classification is based on chronicity and labels aortic dissections as hyperacute (&lt;24 hours duration), acute (2–7 days), subacute (8–30 days), and chronic (&gt;30 days).&lt;ref name="Lech2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lech|first1=C|last2=Swaminathan|first2=A|title=Abdominal Aortic Emergencies|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=November 2017|volume=35|issue=4|pages=847–67|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2017.07.003|pmid=28987432}}&lt;/ref&gt; The systems commonly in use are based on either the anatomy of the dissection or the duration of onset of symptoms prior to presentation. The Stanford system is used more commonly now, as it is more attuned to the management of the patient.

====DeBakey====
The DeBakey system, named after cardiothoracic surgeon [[Michael E. DeBakey]], is an anatomical description of the aortic dissection. It categorizes the dissection based on where the original intimal tear is located and the extent of the dissection (localized to either the ascending aorta or descending aorta or involves both the ascending and descending aorta.&lt;ref name=DeBakey1965/&gt;
*'''Type I''' – originates in ascending aorta, and propagates at least to the aortic arch and often beyond it distally. It is most often seen in patients less than 65 years of age and is the most lethal form of the disease. 
*'''Type II''' – originates in the ascending aorta and is confined to it.
*'''Type III''' – originates in the descending aorta and rarely extends proximally, but will extend distally. It most often occurs in elderly patients with [[atherosclerosis]] and hypertension.

====Stanford====
The Stanford classification is divided into two groups, A and B, depending on whether the ascending aorta is involved.&lt;ref name=Daily1970/&gt;
*'''A''' – involves the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch, and possibly the descending aorta. The tear can originate in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, or more rarely, in the descending aorta. It includes DeBakey types I and II.
*'''B''' – involves the descending aorta or the arch (distal to the left subclavian artery), without the involvement of the ascending aorta. It includes DeBakey type III.

The Stanford classification is useful as it follows clinical practice, as type A ascending aortic dissections generally require primary surgical treatment, whereas type B dissections generally are treated medically as initial treatment with surgery reserved for any complications.

The reason for surgical repair of type A dissections is that ascending aortic dissections often involve the aortic valve, which, having lost its suspensory support, telescopes down into the aortic root, resulting in aortic incompetence. The valve must be resuspended in order to be reseated, as well as to repair or prevent coronary artery injury. Also, the area of dissection is removed and replaced with a Dacron graft to prevent further dissection from occurring. However, type B dissections are not improved, from a mortality point of view, by the operation, unless leaking, rupture, or compromise to other organs, e.g. kidneys, occurs.

==Prevention==
Among the recognized risk factors for aortic dissection, hypertension, [[Dyslipidemia|abnormally high levels of lipids (such as cholesterol) in the blood]], and smoking tobacco are considered preventable risk factors.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;

Repair of an enlargement of the ascending aorta from an aneurysm or previously unrecognized and untreated aortic dissections is recommended when greater than {{convert|6|cm|1|abbr=on}} in size to decrease the risk of dissection. Repair may be recommended when greater than {{convert|4.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} in size if the person has one of the several connective-tissue disorders or a family history of a ruptured aorta.

==Management==
In an acute dissection, treatment choice depends on its location. For Stanford type A (ascending aortic) dissection, surgical management is superior to medical management. For uncomplicated Stanford type B (distal aortic) dissections (including abdominal aortic dissections), medical management is preferred over surgical. Complicated Stanford type B aortic dissections require surgical intervention after medical therapy is initiated.

The risk of death due to aortic dissection is highest in the first few hours after the dissection begins, and decreases afterward. Because of this, the therapeutic strategies differ for the treatment of an acute dissection compared to a chronic dissection. An acute dissection is one in which the individual presents within the first two weeks. If the individual has managed to survive this window period, his prognosis is improved. About 66% of all dissections present in the acute phase. Individuals who present two weeks after the onset of the dissection are said to have chronic aortic dissections.  These individuals have been self-selected as survivors of the acute episode and can be treated with medical therapy as long as they are stable.

===Medication===
Aortic dissection generally presents as a hypertensive emergency, and the prime consideration of medical management is to decrease the shear stress in the aortic wall (dP/dt (force of ejection of blood from the [[left ventricle]])) by decreasing blood pressure and the heart rate. The target blood pressure should be a [[mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) of 60 to 75 [[mmHg]], or the lowest blood pressure tolerated. Initial decreases should be by about 20%.&lt;ref name=White2013/&gt; The target heart rate is less than 65 beats per minute. Long-term blood pressure control is required for every person who has experienced aortic dissection.

[[Beta blockers]] are the first-line treatment for patients with acute and chronic aortic dissection. In acute dissection, fast-acting agents which can be given intravenously and have doses that are easier to adjust (such as [[esmolol]], [[propranolol]], or [[labetalol]]) are preferred. Vasodilators such as [[sodium nitroprusside]] can be considered for people with ongoing high blood pressure, but they should never be used alone, as they often stimulate a [[reflex tachycardia|reflexive increase in the heart rate]].

[[Calcium channel blocker]]s can be used in the treatment of aortic dissection, particularly if a contraindication to the use of beta blockers exists.  The calcium channel blockers typically used are [[verapamil]] and [[diltiazem]], because of their combined vasodilator and negative [[inotropic]] effects.

If the individual has refractory hypertension (persistent hypertension on the maximum doses of three different classes of antihypertensive agents), an involvement of the renal arteries in the aortic dissection plane should be considered.

===Surgical===
Indications for the surgical treatment of aortic dissection include an acute proximal aortic dissection and an acute distal aortic dissection with one or more complications.  Complications include compromise of a vital organ, rupture or impending rupture of the aorta, retrograde dissection into the ascending aorta. These are more common with a history of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The objective in the surgical management of aortic dissection is to resect (remove) the most severely damaged segments of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and any secondary tears along the vessel). While excision of the intimal tear may be performed, it does not significantly change mortality.

The particular treatment used depends on the segment or segments of aorta involved. Some treatments are:
* [[Open aortic surgery]] with replacement of the damaged section of aorta with a tube graft (often made of [[Dacron]]) when no damage to the [[aortic valve]] is seen
* [[Bentall procedure]] — replacement of the damaged section of aorta and replacement of the aortic valve
* [[David procedure]] — replacement of the damaged section of aorta and reimplantation of the aortic valve
* [[TEVAR|Thoracic endovascular aortic repair]], a minimally invasive surgical procedure usually combined with on-going medical management
* Replacement of the damaged section of aorta with a sutureless [[vascular ring connector]]-reinforced Dacron graft: The vascular ring connector is a titanic ring used as a stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. Two furrows on the surface of the ring are for fixation of the vascular graft and the aorta. The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger contact surface area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger anastomosis and better surgical results.

A number of comorbid conditions increase the surgical risk of repair of an aortic dissection.  These conditions include the following:
* Prolonged preoperative evaluation (increased length of time prior to surgery)
* Advanced age
* Comorbid disease states (e.g.: [[coronary artery disease]])
* Aneurysm leakage
* [[Cardiac tamponade]]
* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]
* Past history of myocardial infarction &lt;!-- or CVA --&gt;
* History of [[kidney failure]] (either acute or chronic kidney failure)

===Follow-up===
[[File:TypeBdisectionlumonclosed.png|thumb|Closure of the lumen of a Type B aortic dissection following medical management]]
The long-term follow-up in individuals who survive aortic dissection involves strict blood pressure control.  The relative risk of late rupture of an [[aortic aneurysm]] is 10 times higher in individuals who have uncontrolled hypertension, compared to individuals with a systolic pressure below 130 mmHg.

The risk of death is highest in the first two years after the acute event, and individuals should be followed closely during this time period. About 29% of late deaths following surgery are due to rupture of either a dissecting aneurysm or another aneurysm. In addition, a 17% to 25% incidence exists of new aneurysm formation, typically due to dilatation of the residual false lumen. These new aneurysms are more likely to rupture, due to their thinner walls.

Serial imaging of the aorta is suggested, with MRI being the preferred imaging technique.

==Epidemiology==
Establishing the incidence of aortic dissection has been difficult because many cases are only diagnosed after death (which may have been attributed to another cause), and is often initially misdiagnosed. Aortic dissection affects an estimated 2.0–3.5 people per every 100,000 every year. Studies from Sweden suggest that the incidence of aortic dissection may be rising.&lt;ref name=Olsson2006&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Olsson Ch. | author2 = Thelin S. | author3 = Ståhle E. | author4 = Ekbom A. | author5 = Granath F. | year = 2006 | title = Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection.

Of all people with aortic dissection, 40% die immediately and do not reach a hospital in time. Of the remainder, 1% die every hour, making prompt diagnosis and treatment a priority. Even after diagnosis, 5–20% die during surgery or in the immediate postoperative period.&lt;ref name=Hiratzka2010/&gt; In ascending aortic dissection, if surgery is decided to be not appropriate, 75% die within 2 weeks. With aggressive treatment, 30-day survival for thoracic dissections may be as high as 90%.&lt;ref name=Woo2009/&gt;

==History==
The earliest fully documented case of aortic dissection is attributed to [[Frank Nicholls]] in his [[autopsy]] report of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]], who had been found dead on 25 October 1760; the report describes dissection of the aortic arch and into the pericardium.&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicholls1761/&gt; The term "aortic dissection" was introduced by the French physician J.P. Maunoir in 1802, and [[René Laennec]] labelled the condition "dissecting aneurysm".&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard1979/&gt; London cardiologist [[Thomas Bevill Peacock]] contributed to the understanding of the condition by publishing two series of the cases described in the literature so far: 19 cases in an 1843 review, and 80 in 1863.&lt;ref name=Leonard1979/&gt; The characteristic symptom of tearing pain in the chest was recognized in 1855 when a case was diagnosed in life.&lt;ref name=Leonard1979/&gt;

Surgery for aortic dissection was first introduced and developed by [[Michael E. DeBakey]], [[Denton Cooley]], and Oscar Creech, cardiac surgeons associated with the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], Houston, Texas, in 1954. DeBakey developed aortic dissection himself at age 97 in 2005,&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt; and underwent surgery in 2006.&lt;ref name=Altman2006/&gt; Endovascular treatment of aortic dissection was developed in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Criado2011/&gt;

==Society and culture==

=== Ritter rules ===
Ritter rules are a compilation of reminders, symptoms, and risk factors designed to prevent the misdiagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection.&lt;ref name="tadcoalition.36beta.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ritter Rules|website=Thoracic Aortic Disease Coalition |url=http://tadcoalition.36beta.com/patients-and-caregivers/who-is-at-risk/ritter-rules/ |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105141210/http://tadcoalition.36beta.com/patients-and-caregivers/who-is-at-risk/ritter-rules/ |archivedate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules were named for actor [[John Ritter]], who died from a thoracic aortic dissection on September 11, 2003.

'''Biotic potential'''  is described by the unrestricted growth of populations resulting in the maximum growth of that population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Gary|title=Living with the Earth, Third Edition: Concepts in Environmental Health Science|page=38|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Biotic potential is the highest possible vital index of a species; therefore, when the species has its highest birthrate and lowest mortality rate.

==Quantitative Expression==

The biotic potential is the quantitative expression of the ability of a species to face selection in any environment. The main equilibrium of a particular population is described by the equation:

:Number of Individuals = Biotic Potential/Resistance of the Environment (Biotic and Abiotic)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Ancona|first1=Umberto|title=The Struggle for Existence|page=227|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman also relates to a "vital index", regarding a ratio to find the rate of surviving members of a species, whereas;
:Vital Index = (number of births/number of deaths)*100

==Components==

According to the ecologist R.N Chapman (1928), the biotic potential could be divided into a reproductive and survival potential. The survival potential could in turn be divided into nutritive and protective potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Ancona|first1=Umberto|title=The Struggle for Existence|page=227|accessdate=8 July 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive potential (potential [[natality]]) is the upper limit to biotic potential in the absence of mortality. Survival potential is the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[Death|mortality]]. Because reproductive potential does not account for the number of gametes surviving, survival potential is a necessary component of biotic potential. In the absence of mortality, biotic potential = reproductive potential.

Chapman also identified two additional components of nutritive and protective potentials as divisions of the survival potential. Nutritive potential is the ability to acquire and use food for growth and energy. Protective potential is described by the ability of the organism to protect itself against the dynamic forces of environment in order to insure successful reproduction and offspring.

Full expression of the biotic potential of an organism is restricted by environmental resistance, any condition that inhibits the increase in number of the population. It is generally only reached when environmental conditions are very favorable. A species reaching its biotic potential would exhibit exponential [[population growth]] and be said to have a high [[fertility]], that is, how many offspring are produced per mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nebel|first1=Bernard|last2=Wright|first2=Richard|title=Environmental Science: The Way the World Works|page=73|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christiaan Frederik Beyers''' (23 September 1869 – 8 December 1914) was a Boer general during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Boksburg’s Citizen General C F Beyers|journal=Boksburg Historical Association News|date=31 October 2006|issue=141|url=http://boksburghistorical.com/index_files/BHAoct2006.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
As a young man, he went to the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], where he took a prominent part on the [[Boer]] side in the [[Second Boer War|South African War]], winning high distinction in the field and bearing the rank of general when peace was made in 1902. Beyers had much influence, as soldier and statesman, among the [[Afrikaaners|Dutch-speaking people of South Africa]], and was, with Generals [[Louis Botha|Botha]] and [[Jan Smuts|Smuts]], though in a less degree than they, one of the recognized leaders of the Transvaal [[Boers]].

When responsible government was granted to the Transvaal, Beyers became speaker of the Lower House. He showed in the speaker's chair remarkable gifts. He was acute, tolerant and rigidly impartial, thus making a deep impression upon English-speaking South Africans, who would have supported his claims to be the first speaker of the first [[Union of South Africa|South African]] House of Assembly, had they been pressed by [[Louis Botha]], the first Prime Minister. Instead, Beyers was made commandant general of the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Citizen Forces of the Union Defence Force]] of South Africa, and in that capacity paid a visit to [[Great Britain]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]] in 1912.

A man of fine physique, of passionate nature, and of profound religious convictions, Beyers, as commandant general of South Africa, was entertained with marked attentions during his visit to Germany by [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]. When [[World War I]] broke out, he set himself in almost open opposition to the policy of the Botha government. For some months, this opposition smouldered. Then, at a moment when the South African expeditionary force was being mobilized for the invasion of [[German South-West Africa]], and when rebellion was already smouldering among the irreconcilables of the South African Dutch, Beyers resigned his post as commandant general in a letter addressed to General Smuts, then Minister of Defence, and published in ''[[Het Volk (newspaper)|Het Volk]]'', an anti-government journal. In this letter he declared that he had always disapproved the Government's intention to invade German South-West Africa and that this disapproval was shared by the great majority of the Dutch-speaking people of the Union. General Smuts replied in a stern letter declaring that the war was a test of the loyalty to their pledged word of the Dutch-speaking people, and accepting Beyers' resignation. He had a friendship with [[Jozua Naudé (pastor)|JF Naudé]] and Naudé named his son [[Beyers Naudé| CFB Naudé]] after him.

A few weeks later Beyers took the field as a leader of the [[Maritz Rebellion|Boer Rebels]] against the government, only to be overwhelmed by the government troops under the command of General Botha, to be driven from pillar to post as a fugitive, and to be wounded and consequently drowned on 8 December 1914, while trying to escape from his pursuers by crossing the [[Vaal River]]. His body was recovered two days later, and with his death the rebellion was brought to an end.

In [[developmental psychology]] and [[developmental biology]], a '''critical period''' is a maturational stage in the lifespan of an organism during which the nervous system is especially sensitive to certain environmental stimuli. If, for some reason, the organism does not receive the appropriate stimulus during this "critical period" to learn a given skill or trait, it may be difficult, ultimately less successful, or even impossible, to develop some functions later in life. Functions that are indispensable to an organism's survival, such as vision, are particularly likely to develop during critical periods. "Critical period" also relates to the ability to acquire one's first language. Researchers found that people who passed the "critical period" would not acquire their first language fluently.&lt;ref name="Robson"&gt;Robson, Ann L. "Critical/Sensitive Periods." Child Development. Ed. Neil J. Salkind. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2002. 101-103. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 10 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers differentiate between 'critical' and 'sensitive' periods—defining 'sensitive' periods as more extended periods, after which learning is still possible.&lt;ref&gt;Brainard, M. S., &amp; Knudsen, E. I. (1998). Sensitive periods for visual calibration of the auditory space map in the barn owl optic tectum. ''The Journal of Neuroscience'', ''18(''10), 3929-3942.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers consider these the same phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hensch | first1 = T. K. | year = 2004 | title = Critical period regulation | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144327 | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 549–579 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the critical period for the development of a human child's [[binocular vision]] is thought to be between three and eight months, with sensitivity to damage extending up to at least three years of age. Further critical periods have been identified for the development of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]&lt;ref name= "Kral2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kral A |title= Auditory critical periods: A review from system's perspective |journal= Neuroscience |volume= 247 | pages=117–133 |year= 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.05.021 |pmid=23707979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vestibular system]].{{ref|Moorman}}

==Linguistics==

{{Main|Critical period hypothesis}}

===First language acquisition===
The [[critical period hypothesis]] (CPH) states that the first few years of life constitute the time during which language develops readily and after which (sometime between age 5 and [[puberty]]) language acquisition is much more difficult and ultimately less successful.&lt;ref name="Siegler"&gt;Siegler, Robert (2006). How Children Develop, Exploring Child Develop Student Media Tool Kit &amp; Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop. New York: Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7167-6113-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that language is acquired during a critical period was first proposed by neurologists Wilder Penfield and Lamar Roberts in 1959 and popularized by linguist Eric H. Lenneberg in 1967. Lenneberg argued for the hypothesis based on evidence that children who experience brain injury early in life develop far better language skills than adults with similar injuries.

[[Dr. Maria Montessori]] was one of the earlier educators who brought attention to this phenomenon and called it "Sensitive Periods", which is one of the pillars of [[Montessori education|her philosophy of education]].

The two most famous cases of children who failed to acquire language after the critical period are [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]] and the feral child [[Victor of Aveyron]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, S. (1977). ''Genie: a psycholinguistic study of a modern-day wild child''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tragic circumstances of these cases and the moral and ethical impermissibility of replicating them make it difficult to draw conclusions about them. The children may have been cognitively disabled from infancy, or their inability to develop language may have resulted from the profound neglect and abuse they suffered.&lt;ref name="Siegler" /&gt;

Many subsequent researchers have further developed the CPH, most notably [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]] and Rachel Mayberry. Studies conducted by these researchers demonstrated that profoundly deaf individuals who are not exposed to a sign language as children never achieve full proficiency, even after 30 years of daily use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newport | first1 = E. L. | year = 1990 | title = Maturational constraints on language learning | url = | journal = Cognitive science | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 11–28 | doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1401_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effect is most profound for individuals who receive no sign language input until after the age of 12, even those deaf people who began learning a sign language at age 5 were significantly less fluent than native deaf signers (whose exposure to a sign language began at birth). Early language exposure also affects the ability to learn a second language later in life: profoundly deaf individuals with early language exposure achieve comparable levels of proficiency in a second language to hearing individuals with early language exposure. In contrast, deaf individuals without early language exposure perform far worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayberry | first1 = R. I. | last2 = Lock | first2 = E. | last3 = Kazmi | first3 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Development: Linguistic ability and early language exposure | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6884| pages = 38–38 | doi=10.1038/417038a|bibcode = 2002Natur.417...38M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Pinker discusses the CPH in his book, The Language Instinct. According to Pinker, language must be viewed as a concept rather than a specific language because the sounds, grammar, meaning, vocabulary, and social norms play an important role in the acquisition of language.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Eric. "First-Language Acquisition." Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education. Ed. Josué M. González. Vol. 1. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 2008. 299-304. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 22 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological changes in the brain are also conceivable causes for the terminus of the critical period for language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Pinker1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Pinker |first1= Steven |title=The Language Instinct |year=1994|publisher= Morrow |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As language acquisition is crucial during this phase, similarly infant-parent attachment is crucial for social development of the infant. An infant learns to trust and feel safe with the parent, but there are cases in which the infant might be staying at an orphanage where it does not receive the same attachment with their caregiver. Research shows that infants who were unable to develop this attachment had major difficulty in keeping close relationships, and had maladaptive behaviors with adopted parents.&lt;ref name="Robson" /&gt;

Other evidence comes from [[neuropsychology]] where it is known that adults well beyond the critical period are more likely to suffer permanent language impairment from brain damage than are children, believed to be due to youthful resiliency of neural reorganization.&lt;ref name="Siegler"/&gt;

===Second language acquisition===
The theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeKeyser|first=Robert M.|date=2000-12-01|title=THE ROBUSTNESS OF CRITICAL PERIOD EFFECTS IN SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-second-language-acquisition/article/div-classtitlethe-robustness-of-critical-period-effects-in-second-language-acquisitiondiv/6963A1AFEB8148B7F3B719D60994CD65|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=22|issue=4|pages=499–533|issn=1470-1545}}&lt;/ref&gt; has often been extended to a critical period for [[second language acquisition]] (SLA), which has influenced researchers in the field on both sides of the spectrum, supportive and unsupportive of CPH, to explore.&lt;ref name="Jia 2008"&gt;Jia, Li. "Learning a Language, Best Age." Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education. Ed. Josué M. González. Vol. 1. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 2008. 520-523. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 20 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature of this phenomenon has been one of the most fiercely debated issues in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive science]] in general for decades.

Certainly, older learners of a [[second language]] rarely achieve the native-like fluency that younger learners display, despite often progressing faster than children in the initial stages. This is generally accepted as evidence supporting the CPH. Incorporating the idea, "younger equals better" by Penfield, [[David Singleton]] (1995) states that in learning a second language there are many exceptions, noting that five percent of adult bilinguals master a second language even though they begin learning it when they are well into adulthood—long after any critical period has presumably come to a close. The critical period hypothesis holds that first language acquisition must occur before cerebral lateralization completes, at about the age of puberty. One prediction of this hypothesis is that second language acquisition is relatively fast, successful, and qualitatively similar to first language only if it occurs before the age of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snow|first=C.E.|author2=Hoefnagel-Höhle, M.|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition: Evidence from Second-Language Learning|journal=Child Development|date=December 1978|volume=49|issue=4|pages=1114–1128|jstor=1128751|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1978.tb04080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; To grasp a better understanding of SLA, it is essential to consider linguistic, cognitive, and social factors rather than age alone, as they are all essential to the learner's language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Jia 2008"/&gt;

Over the years, many experimenters have tried to find evidence in support or against the critical periods for&amp;nbsp;[[Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition.]]&amp;nbsp;Many have found evidence that young children acquire&amp;nbsp;[[language]]&amp;nbsp;more easily than adults, but there are also special cases of adults acquiring a second language with native-like proficiency. Thus it has been difficult for researchers to separate&amp;nbsp;[[Correlation function (statistical mechanics)|correlation]]&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;[[Causality|causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Language Acquisition and the Critical Period Hypothesis|last=Birdsong|first=David|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9781135674892|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Jacqueline S. Johnson and Elissa L. Newport found support for the claim that second languages are more easily acquired before&amp;nbsp;[[puberty]], or more specifically before the age of seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Jacqueline S|last2=Newport|first2=Elissa L|date=1989-01-01|title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028589900030|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=21|issue=1|pages=60–99|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(89)90003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested second language learners of&amp;nbsp;[[English language|English]]&amp;nbsp;who arrived in the United States at various ages ranging from three to thirty-nine, and they found that there was a decline in grammatical correctness after the age of seven. Johnson and Newport attributed this claim to a decline in language learning ability with age. Opponents of the critical period argue that the difference in language ability found by Johnson and Newport could be due to the different types of input that children and adults receive; children received reduced input while adults receive more complicated structures.

Additional evidence against a strict&amp;nbsp;critical period&amp;nbsp;is also found in the work of Pallier et al. (2003) who found that children adopted to&amp;nbsp;[[France]]&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;[[Korea]]&amp;nbsp;were able to become native-like in their performance of&amp;nbsp;[[French language|French]]&amp;nbsp;even after the critical period for&amp;nbsp;[[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallier|first=C.|last2=Dehaene|first2=S.|last3=Poline|first3=J.-B.|last4=LeBihan|first4=D.|last5=Argenti|first5=A.-M.|last6=Dupoux|first6=E.|last7=Mehler|first7=J.|date=2003-02-01|title=Brain Imaging of Language Plasticity in Adopted Adults: Can a Second Language Replace the First?|url=https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/13/2/155/270786/Brain-Imaging-of-Language-Plasticity-in-Adopted|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=13|issue=2|pages=155–161|doi=10.1093/cercor/13.2.155|issn=1047-3211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment may represent a special case where subjects must lose their first language in order to more perfectly acquire their second.

There is also some debate as to how one can judge the native-like quality of the speech participants produce and what exactly it means to be a near-native speaker of a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Lydia|last2=Genesee|first2=Fred|date=1996-01-01|title=How native is near-native? The issue of ultimate attainment in adult second language acquisition|jstor=43104516|journal=Second Language Research|volume=12|issue=3|pages=233–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; White et al. found that it is possible for non-native speakers of a language to become native-like in some aspects, but those aspects are influenced by their&amp;nbsp;[[first language]].

Recently, a connectionist model has been developed to explain the changes that take place in second language learning assuming that sensitive period affects lexical learning and syntactic learning parts of the system differently, which sheds further light on how first and second language acquisition changes over the course of learners development. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janciauskas|first=Marius|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|date=2017-07-26|title=Input and Age-Dependent Variation in Second Language Learning: A Connectionist Account|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12519|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=42|pages=519–554|doi=10.1111/cogs.12519|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision==
[[File:Ocular and Binocular.jpg|thumb|right]]
In [[mammals]], [[neurons]] in the brain that process vision actually develop after birth based on signals from the eyes. A landmark experiment by [[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] (1963) showed that cats that had one eye sewn shut from birth to three months of age ([[monocular deprivation]]) only fully developed vision in the open eye. They showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. In general electrophysiological analyses of axons and neurons in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] showed that the visual receptive field properties was comparable to adult cats. However, the layers of cortex that were deprived had less activity and fewer responses were isolated. The kittens had abnormally small [[ocular dominance columns]] (part of the brain that processes sight) connected to the closed eye, and abnormally large, wide columns connected to the open eye. Because the critical period time had elapsed, it would be impossible for the kittens to alter and develop vision in the closed eye. This did not happen to adult cats even when one eye was sewn shut for a year because they had fully developed their vision during their critical period. Later experiments in monkeys found similar results.&lt;ref name="Wiesel1963"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wiesel, TN, Hubel DH| title= Effects of visual deprivation on morphology and physiology of cell in the cat's lateral geniculate body |journal= Journal of Neurophysiology |volume= 26 |issue= 6 |pages= 978–993 |year= 1963 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/26/6/978.full |pmid= 14084170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up experiment, Hubel and Wiesel (1963) explored the cortical responses present in kittens after binocular deprivation; they found it difficult to find any active cells in the cortex, and the responses they did get were either slow-moving or fast-fatiguing. Furthermore, the cells that did respond selected for edges and bars with distinct orientation preferences.  Nevertheless, these kittens developed normal binocularity. Hubel and Wiesel first explained the mechanism, known as orientation selectivity, in the mammalian visual cortex. Orientation tuning, a model that originated with their model, is a concept in which receptive fields of neurons in the LGN excite a cortical simple cell and are arranged in rows. This model was important because it was able to describe a critical period for the proper development of normal [[ocular dominance]] columns in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]], and thus able to explain the effects of [[monocular deprivation]] during this critical period.  The critical period for cats is about three months and for monkeys, about six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_rouge05.html Experiment Module: Effects of Visual Deprivation During the Critical Period for Development of Vision]. McGill University, [http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/index_a.html The Brain from Top to Bottom]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar experiment, Antonini and Stryker (1993) examined the anatomical changes that can be observed after [[monocular deprivation]].  They compared geniculocortical axonal arbors in monocularly deprived animals in the long term (4- weeks) to short term (6–7 days) during the critical period established by Hubel and Wiesel (1993).  They found that in the long term, monocular deprivation causes reduced branching at the end of neurons, while the amount of afferents allocated to the nondeprived eye increased.  Even in the short term, Antonini and Stryker (1993) found that geniculocortical neurons were similarly affected.  This supports the aforementioned concept of a critical period for proper neural development for vision in the cortex.&lt;ref name= "Antonini 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Antonini A, Stryker MP |title=Rapid Remodeling of Axonal Arbors in the Visual Cortex |journal=Science |volume=260 |issue=5115 |pages= 1819–21 |date=June 1993 |jstor= 2881379 |bibcode=1993Sci...260.1819A |doi=10.1126/science.8511592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, some babies are born blind in one or both eyes, for example, due to [[cataracts]]. Even when their vision is restored later by treatment, their sight would not function in the normal way as for someone who had [[binocular vision]] from birth or had surgery to restore vision shortly after birth. Therefore, it is important to treat babies born blind soon if their condition is treatable.

Expression of the protein [[LYNX1|Lynx1]] has been associated with the normal end of the critical period for synaptic plasticity in the visual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Imprinting==
[[File:Konrad Lorenz.JPG|right|thumb|Konrad Lorenz]]
In psychology, [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] is any type of rapid learning that occurs in a particular life stage. While this rapid learning is independent of the behavioral outcome, it also establishes it and can effect behavioral responses to different stimuli.  [[Konrad Lorenz]] is well known for his classic studies of filial imprinting in graylag geese. From 1935 to 1938, he presented himself to a group of newly hatched gosling and took note of how he was instantly accepted, followed, and called to as if he were the one who laid them himself.  As the first moving object they encountered, Lorenz studied the phenomenon in how quickly the geese were able to form such an irreversible [[Affectional bond|bond]].  Through his work he demonstrated that this only developed during a brief “critical period,” which was about a few hours after hatching.&lt;ref name= "Kisilevsky2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kisilevsky BS, Sylvia MJ, Xing X, Hefeung H, Hai HY, Ke Z, Zengping W |title=Effects of experience on fetal voice recognition |journal=Psychological Science |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages= 220–4 |year=2003 |pmid= 12741744 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz also discovered a long-lasting effect of his studies, and that was a shift in the species' [[sexual imprinting]] as a result from imprinting upon a foster mother of a second species. For certain species, when raised by a second one, they develop and retain imprinted preferences and approach the second species they were raised by rather than choose their own, if given a choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mertz|first1=Leslie A.|title=Imprinting and Establishment of Ethology|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3408503214&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=fcbfa43e177e9e6bd6df6584c7755813|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Neil Schlager and Josh Lauer|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprinting serves as the distinguishing factor between one's own mother and other mother figures. The mother and the infant both identify with each other, this is a strong bonding moment for humans.  It provides a sort of model or guide to adult behaviors in addition to other factors such as nurture, protection in infancy, guidance, and nourishment. The imprinting process, Lorenz also found, brought about a sense of familiarity for the young animals. When such a strong bond is formed at such an early stage, it creates a sense of security and comfort for the subject and actually encourages the imprinting behavior.

[[Pheromones]] play a key role in the imprinting process, they trigger a biochemical response in the recipient, leading to a confirmed identification in the other individual. If direct contact between mother and infant is not maintained during the critical imprinting period, then the mother goose may reject the infant because she is unfamiliar with her newborn's scent. If that does happen, then the infant's life would be in jeopardy unless it were claimed by a substitute mother and if it failed to imprint would, that trigger psychological trauma, possibly leading to awkward social behavior in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hollar|first1=David Wason, Jr.|title=Imprinting|journal=Salem Health: Psychology &amp; Mental Health|volume=3|pages=980–984|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2275200294&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=253ef8de1c5a81a25244f72500a53c92|ref=Gale Virtual Refernce Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to humans, a newborn during the critical period identifies with its mother's and other peoples' scents since its scent is one of the most developed senses at that stage in life. The newborn uses this pheromone identification to seek the people it identifies with, when in times of distress, hunger, and discomfort as a survival skill.&lt;ref name="Neil J. Salkind"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Sherril M.|title=Imprinting|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300346&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=8430515f88ac71c0347588e1ae433b48|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=SAGE Reference|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inferences could be made for newborns based upon Lorenz's studies. When imprinting on their mothers, newborns look to them for nourishment, a sense of security, and comfort. Human newborns are among the most helpless known with orangutang newborns ranking second. Newborns of these species have a very limited array of innate survival abilities. Their most important and functional ability is to form bonds with close individuals who are able to keep them alive. Imprinting is a crucial factor of the critical period because it facilitates the newborn's abilities to form bonds with other individuals, from infancy to adulthood.

==Auditory processing==
Many studies have supported a correlation between the type of auditory stimuli present in the early postnatal environment and the development on the topographical and structural development of the auditory system.&lt;ref name="Kral2013" /&gt;

First reports on critical periods came from deaf children and animals that received a [[cochlear implant]] to restore hearing. Approximately at the same time, both an electroencephalographic study by Sharma, Dorman and Spahr &lt;ref name= "Sharma2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma A, Dorman MF, Spahr AJ |title= A sensitive period for the development of the central auditory system in children with cochlear implants: implications for age of implantation. |journal= Ear Hear |volume= 23 |pages=532–29 |year= 2002 |doi=10.1097/00003446-200212000-00004 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an in-vivo investigation of the cortical plasticity in deaf cats by Kral and colleagues &lt;ref name= "Kral2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kral A, Harmann R, Tillein J, Heid S, Klinke R |title= Hearing after congenital deafness: central auditory plasticity in deafness |journal= Cerebral Cortex |volume= 12 |issue=8 | pages=797–807 |year= 2002 |pmid=12122028 |doi= 10.1093/cercor/12.8.797}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the adaptation to the cochlear implant is subject to an early, developmental sensitive period. The closure of sensitive periods likely involves a multitude of processes that in their combination make it difficult to reopen these behaviorally.&lt;ref name="Kral2013" /&gt; The understanding of the mechanisms behind critical periods has consequences for medical therapy of hearing loss.&lt;ref name= "Kral2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kral A, Sharma A |title= Developmental neuroplasticity after cochlear implantation. |journal= Trends in Neurosciences |volume= 35 |pages=111–122 |year= 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2011.09.004 |pmid=22104561 |pmc=3561718 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Merzenich and colleagues showed that during an early critical period, noise exposure can affect the frequency organization of the auditory cortex.&lt;ref name= "Nakahara2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Nakahara |title= Specialization of primary auditory cortex processing by sound exposure in the "critical period" |journal= PNAS |volume= 101 |issue=18 | pages=7170–7174 |year= 2004|display-authors=etal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401196101 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.7170N |pmc=406484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have examined the possibility of a critical period for thalamocortical connectivity in the auditory system.  For example, Zhou and Merzenich (2008) studied the effects of noise on development in the primary auditory cortex in rats.  In their study, rats were exposed to pulsed noise during the critical period and the effect on cortical processing was measured.  Rats that were exposed to pulsed noise during the critical period had cortical neurons that were less able to respond to repeated stimuli; the early auditory environment interrupted normal structural organization during development.

In a related study, Barkat, Polley and Hensch (2011) looked at how exposure to different sound frequencies influences the development of the tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex and the ventral medical geniculate body.  In this experiment, mice were reared either in normal environments or in the presence of 7&amp;nbsp;kHz tones during early postnatal days.  They found that mice that were exposed to an abnormal auditory environment during a critical period P11- P15 had an atypical tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex.&lt;ref name= "Barkat2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barkat TR, Polley DB, Hensch TK |title= A critical period for auditory thalamocortical connectivity |journal= Nature Neuroscience |volume= 14 |issue= 9 |pages=1189–96 |date=September 2011 |url= http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n9/abs/nn.2882.html?lang=en?WT.ec_id=NEURO-201109 |doi=10.1038/nn.2882 |pmid=21804538 |pmc=3419581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These studies support the notion that exposure to certain sounds within the critical period can influence the development of tonotopic maps and the response properties of neurons. Critical periods are important for the development of the brain for the function from a pattern of connectivity.  In general, the early auditory environment influences the structural development and response specificity of the primary auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Zhou2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhou X, Merzenich MM |title=Enduring Effects of early structured noise exposure on temporal modulation in the primary auditory cortex |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=11 |pages=4423–8 |year=1993 |url=http://www.pnas.org_cgi_doi_10.1073_pnas.0800009105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.4423Z |doi=10.1073/pnas.0800009105 |pmid=18332439 |pmc=2393777 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical ability===

{{main|Absolute pitch}}

[[Absolute pitch]] manifests itself almost always before adolescence and rarely if ever among individuals who are first exposed to music after mid-childhood, suggesting that exposure to music or similar phenomena (''e.g.'', tonal languages) in early to mid-childhood is a necessary condition for its development or refinement.  Studies that ask musicians and non-musicians to sing or hum well-known popular songs that have definitive recordings (and hence are sung in standardized keys) show that—on average—participants sing within a semitone of the standardized key but that outside the small subset of participants with absolute pitch there is broad variation (the "bell curve" that reflects the degree of approximation to the standard key is broad and flat).{{rn|date=April 2016}}  These results suggest that almost all humans have some innate aptitude for absolute pitch recognition—though other factors may enhance or limit the level of that aptitude. Also, the results' conjunction with the aforementioned chronological observations suggests that early to mid-childhood exposure to environments whose interpretation depends on pitch is a developmental "trigger" for whatever aptitude an individual possesses.

==Vestibular system==
In our [[vestibular system]], neurons are undeveloped at neuronal birth and mature during the critical period of the first 2-3 postnatal weeks.  Hence, disruption of maturation during this period can cause changes in normal balance and movement through space.  Animals with abnormal vestibular development tend to have irregular motor skills.&lt;ref name="Eugéne2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eugéne D, Deforges S, Vibert N, Vidal PP |title= Vestibular Critical Period, Maturation of Central Vestibular Neurons, and Locomotor Control |journal= Basic and Clinical Aspects of Vertigo and Dizziness |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03727.x |volume=1164 |issue=1 |pages=180–187|bibcode=2009NYASA1164..180E }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies have consistently shown that animals with genetic vestibular deficiencies during this critical period have altered vestibular [[phenotype]]s, most likely as a result of lack insufficient input from the semicircular canals and [[dopaminergic]] abnormalities.  Moreover, exposure to abnormal vestibular stimuli during the critical period is associated with irregular motor development. Children with hypofunctioning vestibular receptors frequently have delayed motor development. The results of the studies done on ferrets and rats reinforced the idea that the vestibular system is very important to motor development during the initial neonatal period. If the vestibular receptors are present during the initial six months to a year when the infant is learning to sit and stand, then the child may develop motor control and balance normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Cleave|first1=S|title=A critical period for the impact of vestibular sensation on ferret motor development|pmc=2034323|pmid=17538206|volume=16|pages=179–86|journal=J Vestib Res}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR) is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement. It produces an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. Studies in fish and amphibians revealed a sensitivity in their VOR. They launched into space flight for 9-10, some with developing VOR's and others with already developed reflexes. The fish with developing reflexes developed an upward bend in their tails. The altered gravity resulted in a shift of orientation. Those who were already matured with the reflex were insensitive to the microgravity exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein-Allee|first1=Albert|title="Critical periods" in vestibular development or adaptation of gravity sensory systems to altered gravitational conditions?|journal=University of Ulm|pmid=15260375|volume=142|pages=155–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==
Recent studies also support the possibility of a critical period for the development of neurons that mediate memory processing.  Experimental evidence supports the notion that young neurons in the adult dentate gyrus have a critical period (about 1–3 weeks after neuronal birth) during which they are integral to memory formation.&lt;ref name= "Aasebø 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aasebø, IEJ |title= Critical maturational period of new neuron in adult dentate gyrus for their involvement in memory formation |journal= European Journal of Neuroscience |volume= 33 |pages=1094–1100 |year= 2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07608.x |last2= Blankvoort |first2= Stefan |last3= Tashiro |first3= Ayumu |issue= 6 |pmid= 21395853}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although the exact reasoning behind this observation is uncertain, studies suggest that the functional properties of neurons at this age make them most appropriate for this purpose; these neurons: (1) Remain hyperactive during the formation of memories; (2) are more excitable; and (3) More easily depolarizable due to GABAergic effects. It is also possible that hyperplasticity makes the neurons more useful in memory formation. If these young neurons had more plasticity than adult neurons in the same context, they could be more influential in smaller numbers.&lt;ref name="Aasebø 2011"/&gt;
The role of these neurons in the adult dentate gyrus in memory processing is further supported by the fact that behavioral experiments have shown that an intact dentate gyrus is integral to hippocampal memory formation.&lt;ref name="Aasebø 2011"/&gt;   It is speculated that the dentate gyrus acts a relay station for information relating to memory storage.  The likelihood of a critical period could change the way we view memory processing because it would ultimately mean that the collection of neurons present is constantly being replenished as new neurons replace old ones. If a critical period does indeed exist, this could possibly mean that: (1) Diverse populations of neurons that represent events occurring soon after one another may connect those events temporally in the memory formation and processing; OR (2) These different populations of neurons may distinguish between similar events, independent of temporal position; OR (3) Separate populations may mediate the formation of new memories when the same events occur frequently.&lt;ref name="Aasebø 2011"/&gt;

==Sports==
In physical sports, humans need several years of practice before reaching the highest competitive level. To date, no single professional football or basketball player has been able to play in the best leagues after starting practice at age 20. The same applies to mental sports like chess, where no player has arrived to the top 100 after starting practice at age 20. In general, to reach the highest level in sport, the sooner a person start to train, the best.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''''Dictyostelium discoideum''''' is a species of soil-living [[Amoeboid|amoeba]] belonging to the phylum [[Amoebozoa]], infraphylum [[Mycetozoa]]. Commonly referred to as [[slime mold]], ''D. discoideum'' is a [[eukaryote]] that transitions from a collection of unicellular amoebae into a multicellular slug and then into a fruiting body within its lifetime. Its unique asexual lifecycle consists of four stages: vegetative, aggregation, migration, and culmination. The lifecycle of ''D. discoideum'' is relatively short, which allows for timely viewing of all stages. The cells involved in the lifecycle undergo movement, chemical signaling, and development, which are applicable to human cancer research. The simplicity of its lifecycle makes ''D. discoideum'' a valuable model organism to study genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes in other organisms.

==Natural habitat and diet==
In the wild, ''D. discoideum'' can be found in soil and moist leaf litter. Its primary diet consists of [[bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', found in the soil and decaying organic matter. [[Uninucleate]] [[amoebae]] of ''D. discoideum'' consume bacteria found in its natural habitat, which includes [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forest]] soil and decaying leaves.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eichinger L | year = 2003 | title = Crawling in to a new era – the ''Dictyostelium'' genome project | url = | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 9| pages = 1941–1946 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/cdg214 | pmid = 12727861 | last2 = Noegel | first2 = AA | pmc = 156086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle and reproduction==
The [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of ''D. discoideum'' begins as [[spore]]s are released from a mature [[sorocarp]] (fruiting body). Myxamoebae hatch from the spores under warm and moist conditions. During their vegetative stage, the myxamoebae divide by [[mitosis]] as they feed on bacteria.  The bacteria secrete [[folic acid]], attracting the myxamoebae. When the supply of bacteria is depleted, the myxamoebae enter the aggregation stage.

During aggregation, starvation initiates the creation of a biochemical machinery that includes [[glycoprotein]]s and [[adenylyl cyclase]].&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."&gt;Gilbert S.F. 2006. Developmental Biology. 8th ed. Sunderland (MA):Sinauer p. 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The glycoproteins allow for cell-cell [[adhesion]], and adenylyl cyclase creates [[cyclic AMP]]. Cyclic AMP is secreted by the amoebae to attract neighboring cells to a central location. As they move toward the signal, they bump into each other and stick together by the use of glycoprotein adhesion molecules.

[[File:Dicty Life Cycle H01.svg|left|thumb|Lifecycle]]
The migration stage begins once the amoebae have formed a tight aggregate and the elongated mound of cells tip over to lie flat on the ground. The amoebae work together as a motile pseudoplasmodium, also known as a slug. The slug is about 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm long, composed of up to 100,000 cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cell|last = Cooper|first = Geoffrey M|publisher = [[Sinauer Associates]]|year = 2000|isbn = 0-87893-106-6|location = Sunderland, Massachusetts|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9917/|edition = 2nd|authorlink = Geoffrey M.

Developmental Biology: A guide for experimental study. 2nd ed. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer. p. 31-34. {{ISBN|0-87893-843-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this sheath is left behind as a slimy trail as it moves toward attractants such as [[light]], [[heat]], and [[humidity]] in a forward-only direction.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  Cyclic AMP and a substance called [[differentiation-inducing factor]], help to form different cell types.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  The slug becomes differentiated into prestalk and prespore cells that move to the anterior and posterior ends, respectively. Once the slug has found a suitable environment, the anterior end of the slug forms the stalk of the fruiting body and the posterior end forms the spores of the fruiting body.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  Anterior-like cells, which have only been recently discovered, are also dispersed throughout the posterior region of the slug. These anterior-like cells form the very bottom of the fruiting body and the caps of the spores.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  After the slug settles into one spot, the posterior end spreads out with the anterior end raised in the air, forming what is called the "Mexican hat", and the culmination stage begins.

The prestalk cells and prespore cells switch positions in the culmination stage to form the mature fruiting body.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  The anterior end of the Mexican hat forms a cellulose tube, which allows the more posterior cells to move up the outside of the tube to the top, and the prestalk cells move down.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; This rearrangement forms the stalk of the fruiting body made up of the cells from the anterior end of the slug, and the cells from the posterior end of the slug are on the top and now form the spores of the fruiting body.  At the end of this 8– to 10-hour process, the mature fruiting body is fully formed.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  This fruiting body is 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm tall and is now able to start the entire cycle over again by releasing the mature spores that become myxamoebae.

==Sexual reproduction==
In general, although ''D. discoideum'' generally reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], ''D. discoideum'' is still capable of [[sexual reproduction]] if certain conditions are met. ''D. discoideum'' has three different mating types and studies have identified the sex locus that specifies these three mating types. Type I strains are specified by the gene called MatA, Type II strains have three different genes: MatB (homologous to Mat A), Mat C, and Mat D, and Type III strains have Mat S and Mat T genes (which are homologous to Mat C and Mat D).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloomfield|first=Gareth|last2=Skelton|first2=Jason|last3=Ivens|first3=Alasdair|last4=Tanaka|first4=Yoshimasa|last5=Kay|first5=Robert R.|date=2010-12-10|title=Sex Determination in the Social Amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6010/1533|journal=Science|language=en|volume=330|issue=6010|pages=1533–1536|doi=10.1126/science.1197423|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3648785|pmid=21148389}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sexes can only mate with the two different sexes and not with its own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When incubated with their bacterial food supply, heterothallic or homothallic sexual development can occur, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote.&lt;ref name="pmid21929567"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Day DH, Keszei A |title=Signalling and sex in the social amoebozoans |journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=313–29 |date=May 2012  |pmid=21929567 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00200.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20617172"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Flowers JM, Li SI, Stathos A, Saxer G, Ostrowski EA, Queller DC, Strassmann JE, Purugganan MD |title=Variation, sex, and social cooperation: molecular population genetics of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1001013 |date=July 2010  |pmid=20617172 |pmc=2895654 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heterothallic mating occurs when two amoebae of different [[mating type]]s are present in a dark and wet environment, where they can fuse during aggregation to form a giant zygote cell. The giant cell then releases cAMP to attract other cells, then engulfs the other cells cannibalistically in the aggregate. The consumed cells serve to encase the whole aggregate in a thick, cellulose wall to protect it. This is known as a [[macrocyst]]. Inside the macrocyst, the giant cell divides first through [[meiosis]], then through mitosis to produce many [[haploid]] amoebae that will be released to feed as normal amoebae would. Homothallic ''D. discoideum'' strains AC4 and ZA3A are also able to produce macrocysts.&lt;ref name="pmid24189663"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robson GE, Williams KL |title=The mating system of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum |journal=Curr.

While sexual reproduction is possible, it is very rare to see successful [[germination]] of a ''D. discoideum'' macrocyst under laboratory conditions.  Nevertheless, recombination is widespread within ''D. discoideum'' natural populations, indicating that sex is likely an important aspect of their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="pmid20617172" /&gt;

==Use as a model organism==
Because many of its genes are homologous to human genes, yet its lifecycle is simple, ''D. discoideum'' is commonly used as a [[model organism]]. It can be observed at organismic, cellular, and molecular levels primarily because of their restricted number of cell types and behaviors, and their rapid growth.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; It is used to study cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and programmed cell death, which are all normal cellular processes. It is also used to study other aspects of development, including cell sorting, pattern formation, phagocytosis, motility, and signal transduction.&lt;ref&gt;Dictybase, About Dictyostelium. [Online] (1, May, 2009). http://dictybase.org/&lt;/ref&gt; These processes and aspects of development are either absent or too difficult to view in other model organisms. ''D. discoideum'' is closely related to higher metazoans. It carries similar genes and pathways, making it a good candidate for [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilip K. Nag, Disruption of Four Kinesin Genes in Dictyostelium. [Online] (22, April, 2008). http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1529371&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]] process occurs when a cell becomes more specialized to develop into a multicellular organism. Changes in size, shape, metabolic activities, and responsiveness can occur as a result of adjustments in gene expression. Cell diversity and differentiation, in this species, involves decisions made from cell-cell interactions in pathways to either stalk cells or spore cells.&lt;ref name="Kay R.R., Garrod D., and Tilly R."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kay R.R. |author2=Garrod D. |author3=Tilly R. | year = 1978 | title = Requirements for cell differentiation in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 211 | issue = 5640| pages = 58–60 |doi=10.1038/271058a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cell fates depend on their environment and pattern formation. Therefore, the organism is an excellent model for studying cell differentiation.

[[File:Dictyostelium Aggregation.JPG|thumb|right|''D. discoideum'' exhibiting chemotaxis through aggregation]]
[[Chemotaxis]] is defined as a passage of an organism toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In ''D. discoideum'', the amoeba secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.&lt;ref name=Dusenbery&gt;{{cite book|author=Dusenbery, David B.|year=1996|title=Life at Small Scale|series=Scientific American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-7167-5060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174–175}}

An elegant set of mathematical equations that reproduces the spirals and the streaming patterns of ''D. discoideum'' was discovered by mathematical biologists Thomas Höfer and Martin Boerlijst. Mathematical biologist Cornelis J. Weijer has proven that similar equations can model its movement. The equations of these patterns are mainly influenced by the density of the amoeba population, the rate of the production of cyclic AMP and the sensitivity of individual amoebas to cyclic AMP. The spiraling pattern is formed by amoebas at the centre of a colony who rotate as they send out waves of cyclic AMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/2000_11.html|title=Biomathematics Patterns: Spiral Slime.

The use of cAMP as a chemotactic agent is not established in any other organism. In developmental biology, this is one of the comprehensible examples of chemotaxis, which is important for an understanding of human inflammation, arthritis, asthma, lymphocyte trafficking, and axon guidance. Phagocytosis is used in immune surveillance and antigen presentation, while cell-type determination, cell sorting, and pattern formation are basic features of embryogenesis that may be studied with these organisms.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;

[[Thermotaxis]] is movement along a gradient of temperature. The slugs have been shown to migrate along extremely shallow gradients of only 0.05&amp;nbsp;°C/cm, but the direction chosen is complicated; it seems to be away from a temperature about 2&amp;nbsp;°C below the temperature to which they had been acclimated. This complicated behavior has been analyzed by computer modeling of the behavior and the periodic pattern of temperature changes in soil caused by daily changes in air temperature. The conclusion is that the behavior moves slugs a few centimeters below the soil surface up to the surface. This is an amazingly sophisticated behavior by a primitive organism with no apparent sense of gravity.&lt;ref name=Dusenbery/&gt;{{rp|108–109}}

[[Programmed cell death]] (apoptosis) is a normal part of species development.&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."/&gt; Apoptosis is necessary for the proper spacing and sculpting of complex organs. Around 20% of cells in ''D. discoideum'' altruistically sacrifice themselves in the formation of the mature fruiting body.  During the pseudoplasmodium (slug or grex) stage of its lifecycle, the organism has formed three main types of cells: prestalk, prespore, and anterior-like cells. During culmination, the prestalk cells secrete a cellulose coat and extend as a tube through the grex.&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."/&gt;  As they differentiate, they form vacuoles and enlarge, lifting up the prespore cells. The stalk cells undergo apoptosis and die as the prespore cells are lifted high above the substrate. The prespore cells then become spore cells, each one becoming a new myxamoeba upon dispersal.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  This is an example of how apoptosis is used in the formation of a reproductive organ, the mature fruiting body.

A recent major contribution from ''Dictyostelium'' research has come from new techniques allowing the activity of individual genes to be visualised in living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16713960 | year = 2006 | last1 = Chubb | first1 = JR | last2 = Trcek | first2 = T | last3 = Shenoy | first3 = SM | last4 = Singer | first4 = RH | title = Transcriptional pulsing of a developmental gene | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 1018–25 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.092 | journal = Current Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has shown that transcription occurs in "bursts" or "pulses" ([[transcriptional bursting]]) rather than following simple probabilistic or continuous behaviour.  Bursting transcription now appears to be conserved between bacteria and humans.  Another remarkable feature of the organism is that it has sets of DNA repair enzymes found in human cells, which are lacking from many other popular metazoan model systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hudson J. J. |author2=Hsu D. W. |author3=Guo K. |author4=Zhukovskaya N. |author5=Liu P. H. |author6=Williams J. G. |author7=Pears C. J. |author8=Lakin N.

===Lab cultivation===
This organism's ability to be easily cultivated in the laboratory&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; adds to its appeal as a model organism. While ''D. discoideum'' can be grown in liquid culture, it is usually grown in Petri dishes containing nutrient [[agar]] and the surfaces are kept moist. The cultures grow best at 22–24&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature). ''D. discoideum'' feed primarily on ''E. coli'', which is adequate for all stages of the lifecycle.  When the food supply is diminished, the myxamoebae aggregate to form pseudoplasmodia. Soon, the dish is covered with various stages of the lifecycle. Checking the dish often allows for detailed observations of development. The cells can be harvested at any stage of development and grown quickly.

While cultivating ''D. discoidium'' in a laboratory, it is important to take into account its behavioral responses. For example, it has an affinity toward light, higher temperatures, high humidity, low ionic concentrations, and the acidic side of the pH gradient. Experiments are often done to see how manipulations of these parameters hinder, stop, or accelerate development. Variations of these parameters can alter the rate and viability of culture growth. Also, the fruiting bodies, being that this is the tallest stage of development, are very responsive to air currents and physical stimuli. It is unknown if there is a stimulus involved with spore release.

===Protein expression studies===
Detailed analysis of protein expression in ''Dictyostelium'' has been hampered by large shifts in the protein expression profile between different developmental stages and a general lack of commercially available antibodies for ''Dictyostelium'' antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immunoblotting: Equality for slime molds!|date = July 2013|journal = [[BioTechniques]]|page = 9|type = paper|volume = 55|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, a group at the [[Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre]] reported an antibody-free protein visualization standard for immunoblotting based on detection of [[MCCC1]] using [[streptavidin]] conjugates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The use of strepavidin conjugates as immunoblot loading controls of mitrochondrial markers for use with Dictyostelium discoidium|date = July 2013|last = Davidson|first = Andrew J.|last2 = King|first2 = Jason S.|last3 = Insall|first3 = Robert H.|volume = 55|issue = 1|pages = 39–41|department = Benchmarks|journal = [[BioTechniques]]|type = paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legionnaire's disease===
The bacterial genus ''[[Legionella]]'' includes the species that causes [[legionnaire's disease]] in humans.  ''D. discoideum'' is also a host for ''Legionella'' and is a suitable model for studying the infection process.&lt;ref name="Bruhn H."&gt;Bruhn H. 2008. ''Dictyostelium'', a tractable model host organism for ''Legionella''. In: Heuner K, Swanson M, editors. ''Legionella'': Molecular Microbiology. Norwich (UK): Caister Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-904455-26-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, ''D. discoideum'' shares with mammalian host cells a similar cytoskeleton and cellular processes relevant to ''Legionella'' infection, including [[phagocytosis]], membrane trafficking, [[endocytosis]], vesicle sorting, and chemotaxis.

=="Farming"==
A 2011 report in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published findings that demonstrated a "primitive farming behaviour" in ''D. discoideum'' colonies.&lt;ref name="primitive farming behaviour"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12227168 "Amoebas show primitive farming behaviour as they travel"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 19 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brock DA, Douglas TE, Queller DC, Strassmann JE |title=Primitive agriculture in a social amoeba |journal=Nature |volume=469 |issue= 7330|pages=393–396 |date=20 January 2011|pmid= 21248849|doi=10.1038/nature09668 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "[[symbiosis]]" between ''D. discoideum'' and bacterial prey, about one-third of wild-collected ''D. discoideum'' colonies engaged in the "[[husbandry]]" of the bacteria when the bacteria were included within the slime mold fruiting bodies.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt; The incorporation of the bacteria into the fruiting bodies allows the "seeding" of the food source at the location of the spore dispersal, which is particularly valuable if the new location is low in food resources.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt; Colonies produced from the "farming" spores typically also show the same behavior when sporulating. This incorporation has a cost associated with it: Those colonies that do not consume all of the prey bacteria produce smaller spores that cannot disperse as widely. In addition, much less benefit exists for bacteria-containing spores that land in a food-rich region. This balance of the costs and benefits of the behavior may contribute to the fact that a minority of ''D. discoideum'' colonies engage in this practice.&lt;ref name="primitive farming behaviour"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;
''D. discoideum'' is known for eating [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]], as well as [[Gram-negative bacteria]], but some of the phagocytized bacteria, including some  human pathogens,&lt;ref name=Microreview&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recent insights into host-pathogen interactions from Dyctiostelium |journal=Cellular Microbiology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=283–291 |year=2010 |url= |doi=10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01413.x |first=Margaret |last=Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; are able to live in the amoebae and exit without killing the cell. When they enter the cell, where they reside, and when they leave the cell are not known. The research is not yet conclusive but it is possible to draw a general lifecycle of ''D. discoideum'' adapted for farmer clones to better understand this symbiotic process.[[File:Life-cycle of farmer dictyostelium discoideum.jpg|thumb|Lifecycle of farmer ''D. discoideum'']]

In the picture, one can see the different stages. First, in the starvation stage, bacteria are enclosed within ''D. discoideum'',&lt;ref name=Microreview/&gt; after entry into amoebae, in a phagosome the fusion with lysosomes is blocked and these unmatured phagosomes are surrounded by host cell organelles such as mitochondria, vesicles, and a multilayer membrane derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of amoebae. The role of the RER in the intracellular infection is not known, but the RER is not required as a source of proteins for the bacteria.&lt;ref name=Molmeret&gt;{{cite journal |author= Molmeret M., Horn, M., Wagner, M., Abu Kwaik, Y |title=Primitive Amoebae as Training Grounds for Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |pages=20–28 |date=January 2005 |doi=10.1128/AEM.71.1.20-28.2005 |url= |volume=71 |issue=1|pmc=544274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The bacteria reside within these phagosomes during the aggregation and the multicellular development stages. The amoebae preserve their individuality and each amoeba has its own bacterium. During the culmination stage, when the spores are produced, the bacteria pass from the cell to the sorus with the help of a cytoskeletal structure that prevents host cell destruction.&lt;ref name=Macroautophagy &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grant P.Ottom Mary Y.Wu |author2=Margaret Clarke |author3=Hao Lu |author4=O.Roger Anderson |author5=Hubert Hilbi |author6=Howard A. Shuman |author7=Richard H.

Free-living amoebae seem to play a crucial role for persistence and dispersal of some pathogens in the environment. Transient association with amoebae has been reported for a number of different bacteria, including ''Legionella pneumophila'', many ''Mycobacterium'' species, ''Francisella tubarensis'', and ''Escherichia coli'', among others.&lt;ref name=Molmeret/&gt;  Agriculture seems to play a crucial role for pathogens' survival, as they can live and replicate inside ''D. discoideum'', making husbandry. 
''Nature''’s report has made an important advance in the knowledge of amoebic behavior, and the famous Spanish phrase translated as “you are more stupid than an amoeba” is losing the sense because amoebae are an excellent example of social behavior with an amazing coordination and sense of sacrifice for the benefit of the species.

== Sentinel cells ==
[[Sentinel cell]]s in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' are phagocytic cells responsible for removing toxic material from the slug stage of the social cycle. Generally round in shape, these cells are present within the slug sheath where they are found to be circulating freely. The detoxification process occurs when these cells engulf toxins and pathogens within the slug through [[phagocytosis]]. Then, the cells clump into groups of five to ten cells, which then attach to the inner sheath of the slug. The sheath is sloughed off as the slug migrates to a new site in search of food bacteria.

Sentinel cells make up approximately 1% of the total number of slug cells, and the number of sentinel cells remains constant even as they are being released. This indicates a constant regeneration of sentinel cells within the slugs as they are being removed along with toxins and pathogens. Sentinel cells are present in the slug even when there are no toxins or pathogens to be removed. Sentinel cells have been located in five other species of ''Dictyostelia'', which suggests that sentinel cells can be described as a general characteristic of the [[innate immune system]] in social amoebae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Guokai |last2=Zhuchenko |first2=Olga |last3=Kuspa |first3=Adam |date=2007-08-03 |title=Immune-like Phagocyte Activity in the Social Amoeba |journal=Science |location=New York, NY |volume=317 |issue=5838 |pages=678–681 |doi=10.1126/science.1143991 |issn=0036-8075 |pmc=3291017 |pmid=17673666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of farming status on sentinel cells ===
The number of sentinel cells varies depending on the farming status of wild ''D. discoideum''. When exposed to a toxic environment created by the use of ethidium bromide, it was shown that the number of sentinel cells per millimeter was lower for farmers than non-farmers. This was concluded by observing the trails left behind as the slugs migrated and counting the number of sentinel cells present in a millimeter. However, the number of sentinel cells does not affect the spore production and viability in farmers. Farmers exposed to a toxic environment produce the same number of spores as farmers in a non-toxic environment, and the spore viability was the same between the farmers and non-farmers. When Clade 2 ''[[Burkholderia]]'', or farmer-associated bacteria, are removed from the farmers, spore production and viability were similar to that of the non-farmers. Thus, it is suggested that bacteria carried by the farmers provide an additional role of protection for the farmers against potential harm due to toxins or pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brock |first=Debra A. |last2=Callison |first2=W.

==Classification and phylogeny==

In older classifications, ''Dictyostelium'' was placed in the defunct [[polyphyletic]] class [[Acrasiomycete]]s.

Elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) data analyses support Mycetozoa as a monophyletic group, though rRNA trees place it as a polyphyletic group.  Further, these data support the idea that the dictyostelid and myxogastrid are more closely related to each other than they are the protostelids.

==Genome==
The ''D. discoideum'' [[genome]] sequencing project was completed and published in 2005 by an international collaboration of institutes. This was the first free-living protozoan genome to be fully sequenced. ''D. discoideum'' consists of a 34-Mb haploid genome with a base composition of 77% [A+T] and contains six chromosomes that encode around 12,500 proteins.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; Sequencing of the ''D. discoideum'' genome  provides a more intricate study of its cellular and developmental biology.

Tandem repeats of trinucleotides are very abundant in this genome; one class of the genome is clustered, leading researchers to believe it serves as centromeres. The repeats correspond to repeated sequences of amino acids and are thought to be expanded by nucleotide expansion.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; Expansion of trinucleotide repeats also occurs in humans, in general leading to many diseases. Learning how ''D. discoideum'' cells endure these amino acid repeats may provide insight to allow humans to tolerate them.

Every genome sequenced plays an important role in identifying genes that have been gained or lost over time. Comparative genomic studies allow for comparison of eukaryotic genomes. A phylogeny based on the proteome showed that the amoebozoa deviated from the animal-fungal lineage after the plant-animal split.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; The ''D. discoideum'' genome is noteworthy because its many encoded proteins are commonly found in fungi, plants, and animals.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt;

==Background==
There were originally eight principles formulated by the [[Central Asia]]n Sufi teacher [[Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani]] (died 1179), the last three of the eleven being added later by [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]] (1318–1389), founder of the Naqshbandi Order.&lt;ref name="RulesOrSecrets10"&gt;{{cite book

These principles are designed to be borne in mind and used as [[spiritual practice]]s or exercises in the Naqshbandi system of spiritual development. They are carried out under individual tuition, expertly prescribed, monitored for changes, and carefully adjusted by a teacher, rather than being automatically performed.&lt;ref name="PerfumedScorpion"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-900860-62-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles have been brought to the attention of contemporary Western audiences through the works of the writers [[Idries Shah]],&lt;ref name="PerfumedScorpion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OrientalMagic"/&gt; [[John G. Bennett]],&lt;ref name="MastersOfWisdom"&gt;{{cite book

Spencer Trimingham]].&lt;ref name="Trimingham"/&gt; The exercises were an important aspect of Omar Ali-Shah's work with groups in the modern Naqshbandi tradition in the West. For instance, one of Ali-Shah's books of edited transcripts, ''The Rules or Secrets of the Naqshbandi Order'', was devoted to this subject.&lt;ref name="RulesOrSecretsAll"/&gt;

In ''A Perfumed Scorpion'', Idries Shah gives the order of the first eight principles as shown in this article, and the first eight accord with those given at naqshbandi.org, whereas Omar Ali-Shah gives the order as:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Hush dar dam - awareness of breathing&lt;br /&gt;
2. Nazar ba kadam - watching over the steps&lt;br /&gt;
3. Safar dar watan - travelling in the Homeland&lt;br /&gt;
4. Khilwat dar anjuman - retirement in company&lt;br /&gt;
5. Neegar dashtan - watchfulness, use of special faculties&lt;br /&gt;
6. Yad dashtan - keeping of the memory, sensing of the being and the body&lt;br /&gt;
7. Yad kardan - remembering, recollecting exercises&lt;br /&gt;
8. Baaz gasht - restraint&lt;br /&gt;
All are agreed about the order of the last three principles:&lt;br /&gt;
9. Ukufi zamani - time-halt&lt;br /&gt;
10. Ukufi adadi - number-halt&lt;br /&gt;
11. Ukufi qalbi - heart-halt or visualisation.&lt;/ref&gt; from the order presented by Omar Ali-Shah:

1. '''Hush dar dam''' (or hosh dar dam) — awareness of breathing
:Being aware or conscious of one's breathing. Breathing deeply in a natural rhythm without being preoccupied by breathing. Inhaling and exhaling whilst in remembrance of God.

2. '''Nazar ba kadam''' (or nazar bar qadam) — watching over the steps
:Watching over one's steps, ie being aware of one's intention. Paying attention and not being distracted from one's goal, maintaining awareness and being open to opportunities, so that one does the right thing at the right time.

3. '''Safar dar watan''' — travelling in the Homeland
:Making an interior journey, ie inside oneself, observing oneself in a detached and not overly-critical manner, learning from one's errors and travelling from blameworthy to praiseworthy qualities.

4. '''Khilwat dar anjuman''' (or khalwat dar anjuman) — retirement in company
:Developing the ability to detach from and distance oneself from external noise, disturbance and confusion when in company, and remain tranquil, perhaps with the aid of a [[Dhikr|zikr]], an exercise in remembrance of God. Also being able to re-attach one's attention to the outward when necessary. Though outwardly the Sufi is in the world, inwardly he or she is with God.

5. '''Yad kardan''' (or yad kard) — remembering, recollecting exercises
:Remembering experiences one has had and that one is a part of the Tradition from which one may draw positive energy and derive strength. Using inner or vocalized zikr, remembrance or "making mention" of the Divine names, to remain attentive and alert, and so that the heart becomes aware of the presence of Truth (Al [[Haqq]]).

6. '''Baaz gasht''' (or baz gasht) — restraint
:Being self-disciplined, for example cultivating the quality of patience, keeping one's thoughts from straying when repeating the [[Shahada]] (the declaration of the Oneness of God and the acceptance of [[Muhammad]] as his prophet), being repentant and returning to righteousness.

7. '''Neegar dashtan''' (or nigah dasht) — watchfulness, use of special faculties
:Concentrating on the presence of God. Being alert, watchful for and open to subtle perceptions, positive energy, positive opportunity and positive impacts. Being watchful over passing thoughts.

8. '''Yad dashtan''' (or yad dasht) — keeping of the memory, sensing of the being and the body
:Sensing one's being and one's body, recalling positive memories and positive experiences.

9. '''Ukufi zamani''' (or wuquf-e zamani) — time-halt (or pause)
:Suspending intellect, judgement, preconceptions and conditioned thought. Reprising one's thoughts and actions. Accounting for how one's time is spent, being thankful for acts of righteousness and asking forgiveness for wrongdoing.

10. '''Ukufi adadi''' (or wuquf-e adadi) — number-halt (or pause)
:Carrying out exercises involving numbers, such as the awareness of the number of repetitions when carrying out one's silent heart zikr exercise, and also certain forms of counting using the Abjad&lt;ref name=Abjad&gt;A system whereby the letters of significant words are assigned numerical equivalents. The numbers are then added together to form a number believed to be equivalent of and representative of the concept behind the word. See mentions throughout Shah, Idries (1999). ''[[The Sufis]]''. Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0-86304-074-8}}. First published 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; system.

11. '''Ukufi qalbi''' (or wuquf-e qalbi) — heart-halt (or pause) or visualisation
:Visualising one's heart ([[Qalb]]), perhaps with the name of God inscribed on it, and identifying with Truth or with God.

'''Gabriel Jones''' (May 17, 1724 – October 1806) was an 18th-century [[Welsh American]] lawyer, legislator, court clerk and civil servant in the [[Colony of Virginia|colony]] (and later U.S. state) of [[Virginia]].

Jones attended [[Christ's Hospital]] (also known as "The Bluecoat School"), after which he served as an [[indenture]]d apprentice studying [[jurisprudence]] under a [[solicitor]] in the [[Court of Chancery]] and of [[Lyon's Inn]] in [[Middlesex]]. At the age of 21, Jones was admitted to practice law following the completion of his apprenticeship. He was persuaded by either [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], the [[Land tenure|landowner]] of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], or his relative [[Hugh Mercer]] to return to Virginia, where he engaged in the practice of law.

Jones served as Clerk of Court for [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]) for a tenure lasting 25 years (1757–1782) and represented [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]], Hampshire, and [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta]] counties as a member of the [[House of Burgesses of Virginia]]. In addition, Jones also served as the [[County attorney|King's Attorney]] for Augusta County and as the [[coroner]] for Frederick County. He was elected to represent Virginia at the [[Continental Congress]] but did not attend, and was elected to represent [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]] in the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]]. Jones was an uncle of American pioneer [[John Gabriel Jones]] (1752–1776), and he was a friend of both [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].

== Early life and education ==
Gabriel Jones was born on May 17, 1724, approximately {{convert|3|mi}} from [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], in [[York County, Virginia|York County]], [[Colony of Virginia]].&lt;ref name = "Munske1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=39.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"&gt;{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=195.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=392.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a son of John and Elizabeth Jones, who had arrived in Virginia several years earlier from [[Montgomeryshire]] in northern [[Wales]], [[Great Britain]], where Jones's family was of [[gentry|noble]] descent.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Loth2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Loth|Wilson|2008|p=11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones's father was a [[Weaving|weaver]].&lt;ref name = "Brown1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1965|p=116.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones's elder sister Elizabeth was born on August 13, 1721, at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in Williamsburg, and his younger brother John was born on June 12, 1725, at the same location as Jones.&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;

According to Jones family tradition, Jones's father lost a significant amount of his wealth while in Virginia, which brought about his family's return to England in 1727.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; Jones's father's death prior to 1727 also precipitated the family's move, and following their relocation to England, Elizabeth raised Jones and his siblings in London where she had Jones's sister [[baptism|baptized]] at [[St Giles in the Fields]] on February 20, 1727.&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;

In April 1732, Jones was granted admission to [[Christ's Hospital]] (also known as "The Bluecoat School") in London following his presentation by Thomas Sandford.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=86.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones attended Christ's Hospital for seven years.&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt; On April 12, 1739, he was discharged from the institution by his mother and John Houghton, a [[Solicitor]] in the [[Court of Chancery]] and of Lyon's Inn in Middlesex.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green1"/&gt; Despite its noble origins, Jones's family was of limited means,&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;{{efn|name=coin}} and he served as an indentured apprentice studying jurisprudence under Houghton's charge for a term of six years until 1745.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt; At the age of 21, Jones was admitted to practice law following the completion of his apprenticeship.&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;

== Political career ==

===Return to Virginia===
Following his admission to the bar and the death of his mother in 1745, Jones was persuaded by either [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], the [[Land tenure|landowner]] of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], or his relative [[Hugh Mercer]] to return to Virginia.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green1"/&gt; Once he was "free of his indentures" and had "attained his majority",&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt; Jones secured his return to Virginia.&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt; He settled first in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] and later relocated to Frederick County, after which on March 1, 1747, he acquired a [[Land lot|tract of land]] along [[Opequon Creek]] near present-day [[Kernstown, Virginia|Kernstown]], where he resided for several years.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt; Upon settling in Frederick County, Jones became the private secretary to Lord Fairfax.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;

===House of Burgesses tenures===
Jones was appointed to serve as the first [[county attorney|King's Attorney]] for [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]] around April 1746, at the age of 22.&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=87.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=31.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county's court recommended Jones to the position, citing him "as a fit person to transact His Majesty's affairs in this county".&lt;ref name = "Waddell6"/&gt; Jones continued to reside in Frederick County while performing the duties of King's Attorney in Augusta County.&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=393.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the first appointed justices of Augusta County assembled on December 9, 1745, the body qualified Jones to practice as an "attorney-at-law" in the county.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first lawyer to reside within the then-boundaries of Augusta County.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; Jones served in that position for two years until his election to represent [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]] as a member of the [[House of Burgesses of Virginia]] in 1748, and he was subsequently re-elected to his seat for the 1749 [[legislative session]].&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt; From 1748 to 1750, Jones represented Frederick County alongside George Fairfax.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=511.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was again elected to represent Frederick County in the House of Burgesses in 1752, but resigned in 1753 to serve as the county's [[coroner]].&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; From 1752 until 1754, Jones represented Frederick County alongside [[George William Fairfax]].&lt;ref name="Cartmell1"/&gt; In 1753, Jones relocated from Kernstown in Frederick County to his estate "[[Bogota (Port Republic, Virginia)|Bogota]]" in Augusta County (present-day [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]] near the modern [[unincorporated community]] of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]]).&lt;ref name = "Waddell10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=481.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Loth1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Loth|Wilson|2008|p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1754 to 1755, Jones served alongside a Mr.&amp;nbsp;Parker representing [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] in the House of Burgesses.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=45.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Parker were Hampshire County's first representatives in the House of Burgesses following the county's creation on May 1, 1754.&lt;ref name = "Munske2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske3"/&gt; Jones, along with Lord Fairfax, was appointed as a [[trustee]] for the towns of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] and [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephensburg]] (present-day Stephens City) charged with laying out the towns and establishing regulations for the construction of residences in each town.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;

===Hampshire County Clerk of Court tenure===
[[File:Letter from Gabriel Jones to George Washington, June 6, 1777.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Jones maintained correspondences with [[George Washington]], as evidenced in this June 6, 1777 letter written by Jones to Washington.]]
In 1757, Jones was appointed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, to serve as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=363.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=278.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was on close terms with Lord Fairfax,&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt; and [[George Rockingham Gilmer]] described Jones as a "kinsman, friend and executor of Lord Fairfax".&lt;ref name = "Green1"/&gt; Despite the county's establishment in 1754, it was not until 1757 that formal record-keeping was actualized in Hampshire County, due in part to the [[French and Indian War]].&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=362.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Archibald Wager]] was likely the first appointed Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, Jones was the first operational appointee to serve in the position.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell5"/&gt;{{efn|name=first}}{{efn|name=maxwell}} According to [[historian]] Wilmer L. Kerns in ''Hampshire County, West Virginia, 1754–2004'' (2004), Jones was "well-organized" and had the "best penmanship of any clerk in the history of the county, in spite of being totally blind in his right eye".&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; Historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]] described Jones's handwriting as "unmistakable" in their ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897).&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;

Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of [[Richmond County, Virginia|Richmond County]] to serve as his deputy clerk.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, occasionally performing duties as acting clerk.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, it is likely that Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=364.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;

While serving as Clerk of Court, Jones was again elected to serve as a member of the House of Burgesses representing Augusta County from 1757 until 1758&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=35.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hampshire County from 1758 until 1761.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Munske3"/&gt; It was during this period that Jones formed a close relationship with George Washington, and the two regularly corresponded.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; Jones was elected to serve a final term in the House of Burgesses representing Augusta County in 1771.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=36.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, Jones was elected to represent Virginia in the [[Continental Congress]]&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt; but did not attend. When Jones's Bogota estate became part of the newly minted Rockingham County following its creation from Augusta County in 1778, Jones thus became a citizen of Rockingham and was summarily appointed as its Deputy [[Commonwealth's Attorney]].&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; Jones was also commissioned to ascertain the "pay and subsistence" of the [[Virginia militia]] and damages caused by [[Cherokee]] and [[Catawba people|Catawba]] Native American tribes throughout the Virginia frontier.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt; In addition, Jones was appointed, along with [[Samuel Washington]] and [[George Read (U.S. statesman)|George Read]], by the Continental Congress and Virginia to travel to [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], Pennsylvania, to inquire about "the condition of affairs there" in 1777.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt; Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Jones was one of the executors of Lord Fairfax's will.&lt;ref name = "WVHS3"&gt;{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=87.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones served as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County for a tenure spanning 25 years until his retirement from the position in 1782.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=369.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897), Maxwell and Swisher theorize that Jones retired from his position due in part to Lord Fairfax's death the previous year and waning British influence in Virginia toward the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;

== Later life and legacy ==
Following his retirement from his position as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, Jones continued to remain active in Virginia political affairs. In 1784, George Washington visited and dined with Jones at his home at Bogota.&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt; In 1788, Jones and his brother-in-law [[Thomas Lewis (Virginia)|Thomas Lewis]] were elected to represent Rockingham County at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], where both were fervent proponents for the adoption of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt;{{efn|name=election}} Archibald Stuart of neighboring Augusta County traveled to Rockingham to canvass for Jones prior to the election, and in return, Jones gifted Stuart a [[chaise]] for he and his wife to return home in to Augusta County.&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; Jones was among the first [[trustee]]s of the Staunton Academy, following its [[Incorporation (association)|incorporation]] by an act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] on December 4, 1792.&lt;ref name = "Waddell7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=203.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones continued to practice law in Rockingham County until his death. The road upon which he regularly traveled between his residence Bogota and Rockingham County's [[county seat|seat]] of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] became known as "The Lawyer's Road",&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; which evolved to its present name of "Lawyer Road".&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt; Because of his prominence throughout the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Valley of Virginia]] region, and possibly also due to the fact he may have been the first lawyer in Augusta County, Jones was nicknamed "The Valley Lawyer".&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brown1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green1"/&gt; Jones died at his estate Bogota&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; in October 1806.&lt;ref name = "Waddell5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=394.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1887, a memorial window to Jones and his wife was installed in a new [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church erected near their former Bogota residence.&lt;ref name = "Waddell5"/&gt; Jones was further memorialized in historian Joseph Addison Waddell's ''Annals of Augusta County, Virginia'' (1886), in which Waddell remarked of Jones: "He was considered a man of great ability and unbending integrity. His only fault, or the only one which tradition tells of, was an extremely irritable temper, which, when aroused, expressed itself in the strongest terms he could command, mingled with no little profanity. Having a scorn of all dishonesty and meanness, he did not spare a miscreant by tongue or pen."&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; In his ''Historic Families of Kentucky'' (1889), historian and [[genealogist]] Thomas Marshall Green said of Jones: "Gabriel Jones rose rapidly in his profession; in attainments he was second to no man at the colonial bar; in native ability he was conspicuous among those who stood in the first rank."&lt;ref name = "Green1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green2"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Jones was married on October 16, 1749, to Margaret Strother Morton (1726–1822), the widow of George Morton and the daughter of William Strother and his wife Margaret Watts of [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]].&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVHS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green2"/&gt; Jones's wife lived to be 97, and was described by Waddell in his ''Annals of Augusta County, Virginia'' as "a lady of eminent Christian character".&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; Jones and his wife Margaret had three daughters, one son, and a child of unknown sex that died in infancy: Margaret Morton Jones Harvie, married to lawyer Colonel [[John Harvie]] of [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]]; Elizabeth Jones Lewis, married to merchant John Lewis of Fredericksburg (son of [[Fielding Lewis]] and his first wife Catharine Washington); Anna Gabriella Jones Hawkins, married to John Hawkins of Kentucky; and William Strother Jones (born March 21, 1756), married to Fanny Thornton of Fredericksburg.&lt;ref name = "Waddell10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=89.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVHS4"&gt;{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=193.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Green4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=90.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]].&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; As early as 1750, Jones used the same family crest and coat of arms as [[Philology|philologist]] [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], indicating a possible familial relationship between the two.&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt; Physically, Jones was of short stature,&lt;ref name = "Waddell5"/&gt; and according to an extant contemporary portrait of him by artist [[John Drinker]], Jones sported a wig and an eyepatch over his right eye.&lt;ref name = "Waddell5"/&gt; According to Jones's descendants, it was supposed that his right eye was injured in his earlier years while others attributed the loss of his right eye to an accident during his later years.&lt;ref name = "Waddell5"/&gt; Jones was completely blind in his right eye, and had likely suffered his injury prior to his tenure as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County in 1757.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt; [[Philip Doddridge (Virginia)|Philip Doddridge]] described Jones as wearing a [[bicorne]] hat, "frilled shirt bosom", and waistbands.&lt;ref name = "WVHS2"&gt;{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further described Jones as sporting "powdered hair", a blue coat, a white vest, a [[cravat]], silk stockings, and silver knee and shoe buckles.&lt;ref name = "WVHS2"/&gt;

In his spare time during and between holding political appointments and serving in elected offices,&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; Jones regularly embarked upon "pleasure trips" to various American cities including [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; Another known pastime of Jones's was gaming.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; According to Maxwell and Swisher in their ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897), Jones had been gambling over the course of several days while in Richmond until a final game left him with only one [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] remaining in his pocketbook.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; Jones was wearing a coat fastened with twelve gold buttons each valued at five dollars,&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; and undeterred after losing his last shilling, he began staking one gold button at a time until he was left with one.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; Without hesitation, Jones removed his final button and remarked:&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt; "Here goes the last button on Gabe's coat."&lt;ref name = "Maxwell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=365.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell and Swisher state that Jones's remark "became a proverb in Hampshire County" and was used when someone had been driven to extremes and utilized what little resources were left at their disposal.&lt;ref name = "Maxwell3"/&gt;

==Landholdings==
Jones settled in Frederick County and on March 1, 1747, he acquired a [[Land lot|tract of land]] along [[Opequon Creek]] near present-day [[Kernstown, Virginia|Kernstown]], where he resided for several years.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell1"/&gt; On August 8, 1751, Jones acquired from Christopher Francisco of Pennsylvania {{convert|244|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} of land along the northern side of the [[Shenandoah River#South Fork Shenandoah River|South Fork Shenandoah River]] in Augusta County (later Rockingham County) near the present-day unincorporated community of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]].&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt;

While still a resident in Frederick County, Jones purchased another {{convert|400|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} on the northern side of the [[James River]] in [[Botetourt County, Virginia|Botetourt County]].&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt; On December 3, 1753, Jones sold his property near Kernstown in Frederick County and relocated to his tract of land along the Shenandoah River, on which he established his estate later known as Bogota.&lt;ref name = "Munske1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell10"/&gt; Jones was the first to settle and construct a residence on his Bogota property upon his arrival in 1753, and the estate received its name under Jones's occupancy. Jones continued to reside at Bogota until his death in 1806.&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waddell4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Loth1"/&gt;

Following Jones's death in 1806, his widow Margaret Morton Jones continued to reside at Bogota until her own death in 1822.&lt;ref name = "Loth3"/&gt; Jaquelin Harvie, the son of Jones's daughter Margaret Jones Harvie and her husband John Harvie, purchased the Bogota estate after the death of Jones's wife, and Harvie subsequently sold the property in 1830 to Jacob Strayer, who built the current house in 1845–1847.&lt;ref name = "Loth3"/&gt; The original house erected and occupied by Jones was demolished shortly after the construction of the current house.&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt; The site of Jones's house is presently located on property no longer part of the Bogota estate, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 25, 2009.&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt; A log tenant house estimated to have been built during the mid-18th century during the ownership of the Jones family is extant, and remains part of the current Bogota estate, as of 2008.&lt;ref name = "Loth2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Loth3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Loth|Wilson|2008|p=12.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=39}}. Noted Hampshire County historian Wilmer L. Kerns in ''Hampshire County, West Virginia, 1754–2004'' (2004) contends that Jones was in fact the first Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, as there was no record keeping in the county until the start of Jones's tenure as Clerk of Court in 1757.

| {{harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=362}}. West Virginia historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]] state in their ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present'' (1897) that [[Archibald Wager]] was the inaugural Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, serving from 1755 to 1757. Maxwell and Swisher asserted the following: "The honor of being the first clerk of Hampshire has usually been given to Gabriel Jones; but this is also a mistake, and it was made in the same manner as the error as to the first court. The first page of the oldest book was examined, and the clerk who recorded that page was Gabriel Jones. But the records of the court of June 11, 1755 show that Archibald Wager was the first clerk, or at least was in office before Gabriel Jones. There is nothing in this old book to show where this first court was held."

A spike in [[chromium]] contained in ancient rock-deposits formed underwater shows the accumulation had been washed off from the continental shelves.

==Timing==
{{Life timeline}}
{{see also|Oxygen cycle}}
The most widely accepted chronology of the Great Oxygenation Event suggests that free oxygen was first produced by [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and then later [[eukaryotic]] organisms that carried out [[photosynthesis]] more efficiently, producing oxygen as a waste product.

Initially, the oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the [[paleoatmosphere|atmosphere]] by the chemical weathering of reducing (oxidizable) minerals, most notably iron. This 'mass rusting' led to the deposition of [[iron(III) oxide]] in the form of [[banded iron formations|banded-iron formations]] such as the [[Animikie Group|sediments]] in Minnesota and [[Pilbara]], Western Australia. The saturation of these mineral sinks, and the resulting persistence of oxygen in the atmosphere, led within 50 million years to the start of the GOE.&lt;ref name=Anabar2007&gt;{{Cite journal| last4 = Arnold| last6 = Creaser| last3 = Lyons| first1 = A. | first2 = Y.| last9 = Scott| last2 = Duan | first3 = T. | first4 = G.| last8 = Gordon | first5 = B. | first10 = J. | first6 = R.| last10 = Garvin | first7 = A.| last11 = Buick | first8 = G. | first11 = R. | first9 = C.| title = A whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event?| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5846| year = 2007| last7 = Kaufman| pages = 1903–1906| last5 = Kendall| pmid = 17901330| last1 = Anbar | doi = 10.1126/science.1140325|bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1903A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen could have accumulated very rapidly: at today's rates of photosynthesis (much greater than those in the [[Precambrian]] without land plants), modern atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels could be produced in only 2,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Dole1965&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.| title = The Natural History of Oxygen| journal = The Journal of General Physiology| volume = 49| pages = Suppl:Supp5–27| year = 1965| last1 = Dole | doi = 10.1085/jgp.49.1.5| pmc = 2195461| pmid=5859927| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis is that oxygen producers did not evolve until a few million years before the major rise in atmospheric oxygen concentration.&lt;ref name=Kopp2005/&gt; This is based on a particular interpretation of a supposed oxygen indicator used in previous studies, the [[mass-independent fractionation]] of sulfur isotopes. This hypothesis would eliminate the need to explain a lag in time between the evolution of oxyphotosynthetic microbes and the rise in free oxygen.

In either case, oxygen did eventually accumulate in the atmosphere, with two major consequences.

Firstly, it oxidized atmospheric methane (a strong [[greenhouse gas]]) to carbon dioxide (a weaker one) and water. This decreased the [[greenhouse effect]] of the Earth's atmosphere, causing planetary cooling, and triggered the [[Huronian glaciation]]. Starting around 2.4 billion years ago, this lasted 300-400&amp;nbsp;million years, and may have been the longest ever [[snowball Earth]] episode.&lt;ref name="Kopp2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Robert E.

Secondly, the increased oxygen concentrations provided a new opportunity for [[evolution|biological diversification]], as well as tremendous changes in the nature of chemical interactions between [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[sand]], [[clay]], and other geological substrates and the Earth's air, oceans, and other surface waters. Despite the natural recycling of [[organic matter]], life had remained energetically limited until the widespread availability of oxygen. This breakthrough in metabolic evolution greatly increased the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] available to living organisms, with global environmental impacts. For example, [[mitochondria]] evolved after the GOE, giving organisms the energy to exploit new, more complex morphologies interacting in increasingly complex ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sperling|first1=Erik|last2=Frieder|first2=Christina|last3=Raman|first3=Akkur|last4=Girguis|first4=Peter|last5=Levin|first5=Lisa|last6=Knoll|first6=Andrew|title=Oxygen, ecology, and the Cambrian radiation of animals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/13446.full |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |accessdate=1 October 2014 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1312778110 |volume=110 |pages=13446–13451 |pmid=23898193 |date=Aug 2013 |pmc=3746845|bibcode=2013PNAS..11013446S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time lag theory==
There may have been a gap of up to 900&amp;nbsp;million years between the start of photosynthetic oxygen production and the geologically rapid increase in atmospheric oxygen about 2.5–2.4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. Several hypotheses propose to explain this time lag.

===Tectonic trigger===
[[File:Black-band ironstone (aka).jpg|thumb|right|250px|2.1&amp;nbsp;billion year old rock showing banded iron formation]]
The oxygen increase had to await tectonically driven changes in the Earth, including the appearance of shelf seas, where reduced organic carbon could reach the sediments and be buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=T. M.|last=Lenton|author2=H. J. Schellnhuber |author3=E.

Evidence is found in older rocks that contain massive [[banded iron formation]]s apparently laid down as this iron and oxygen first combined; most present-day [[iron ore]] lies in these deposits. Evidence suggests oxygen levels spiked each time smaller land masses collided to form a super-continent. Tectonic pressure thrust up mountain chains, which eroded to release nutrients into the ocean to feed photosynthetic cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/5C271294-EE45-D925-BEBBEF03016A7CF4/|title=Abundant Oxygen Indirectly Due to Tectonics|last=American|first=Scientific|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nickel famine===
Early [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic organisms]] likely produced [[methane]], an important trap for molecular oxygen, since methane readily [[Oxidation|oxidizes]] to [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water in the presence of [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]]. Modern [[methanogens]] require [[nickel]] as an [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|enzyme cofactor]]. As the Earth's crust cooled and the supply of volcanic nickel dwindled, oxygen-producing algae began to out-perform methane producers, and the oxygen percentage of the atmosphere steadily increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/breathing-easy-thanks-to-great-oxid-09-04-13/|title=Breathing Easy Thanks to the Great Oxidation Event|last=American|first=Scientific|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2.7 to 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, the rate of deposition of nickel declined steadily from a level 400&amp;nbsp;times today's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kurt O. Konhauser|display-authors=etal|title=Oceanic nickel depletion and a methanogen famine before the Great Oxidation Event|journal=Nature|volume=458|issue=7239|pages=750–753|date=2009|pmid=19360085|doi=10.1038/nature07858|bibcode= 2009Natur.458..750K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bistability===
Another hypothesis posits a model of the atmosphere that exhibits [[bistability]]: two [[steady state]]s of oxygen concentration. The state of stable low oxygen concentration (0.02%) experiences a high rate of methane oxidation. If some event raises oxygen levels beyond a moderate threshold, the formation of an [[ozone layer]] shields UV rays and decreases methane oxidation, raising oxygen further to a stable state of 21% or more. The Great Oxygenation Event can then be understood as a [[phase transition|transition]] from the lower to the upper steady states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=C.|last=Goldblatt|author2=T.M. Lenton |author3=A.J. Watson |date=2006|title=The Great Oxidation at 2.4 Ga as a bistability in atmospheric oxygen due to UV shielding by ozone| journal=Geophysical Research Abstracts|volume=8|issue= |pages=00770|id= |url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/00770/EGU06-J-00770.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrogen gas ===
Another theory credits the appearance of cyanobacteria with suppressing hydrogen gas and increasing oxygen.

Some bacteria in the early oceans could separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. Under the Sun's rays, hydrogen molecules were incorporated into organic compounds, with oxygen as a by-product. If the hydrogen-heavy compounds were buried, it would have allowed oxygen to accumulate in the atmosphere.

However, in 2001 scientists realized that the hydrogen would instead escape into space through a process called methane photolysis, in which methane releases its hydrogen in a reaction with oxygen. This could explain why the early Earth stayed warm enough to sustain oxygen-producing lifeforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-theory-explains-how-e/|title=New Theory Explains How Earth's Early Atmosphere Became Oxygen-Rich|last=Franzen|first=Harald|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late evolution of oxy-photosynthesis theory==
The oxygen indicator might have been misinterpreted. During the proposed lag era in the previous theory, there was a change in sediments from mass-independently fractionated (MIF) sulfur to mass-dependently fractionated (MDF) sulfur. This was assumed to show the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, since oxygen would have prevented the [[Photodissociation|photolysis]] of sulfur dioxide, which causes MIF. However, the change from MIF to MDF of sulfur isotopes may instead have been caused by an increase in glacial weathering, or the homogenization of the marine sulfur pool as a result of an increased thermal gradient during the [[Huronian glaciation]] period (which in this interpretation was not caused by oxygenation).&lt;ref name=Kopp2005/&gt;

==Role in mineral diversification==
The Great Oxygenation Event triggered an explosive growth in the diversity of [[mineral]]s, with many elements occurring in one or more oxidized forms near the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sverjensky|first=Dimitri A.|last2=Lee|first2=Namhey|date=2010-02-01|title=The Great Oxidation Event and Mineral Diversification|url=http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/content/6/1/31|journal=Elements|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=31–36|doi=10.2113/gselements.6.1.31|issn=1811-5209}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the GOE was directly responsible for more than 2,500 of the total of about 4,500 minerals found on Earth today. Most of these new minerals were formed as [[hydrated]] and [[oxidized]] forms due to dynamic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[Crust (geology)|crust]] processes.&lt;ref name="sciam1"&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=evolution-of-minerals "Evolution of Minerals"], ''Scientific American'', March&amp;nbsp;2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of eukaryotes==

It has been proposed that a local rise in oxygen levels due to [[cyanobacteria]]l photosynthesis in ancient microenvironments was highly toxic to the surrounding biota, and that this selective pressure drove the evolutionary transformation of an [[archaea]]l lineage into the first [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid20731852"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gross J, Bhattacharya D |title=Uniting sex and eukaryote origins in an emerging oxygenic world |journal=Biol.

'''HMS ''Good Hope''''' was one of four [[Drake class cruiser|''Drake''-class]] [[armoured cruiser]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] around 1900; she was originally named ''Africa'', but was renamed before she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]]. She became [[flagship]] of the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in 1906, and was the flagship of the [[2nd Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Cruiser Squadron]] in 1908. She was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1913, but was recommissioned in mid-1914.

When war was declared in August 1914, ''Good Hope'' was ordered to reinforce the [[4th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Cruiser Squadron]] and became the [[flagship]] of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Christopher Cradock]]. Cradock moved the available ships of his squadron later that month to the coast of South America to search for German [[commerce raider]]s. He was then ordered further south to the [[Strait of Magellan]] to block any attempt of the [[German East Asia Squadron]] to penetrate into the South Atlantic. He found the German squadron on 1 November off the coast of Chile. The German squadron outnumbered Cradock's force and were individually more powerful; they sank Cradock's two armoured cruisers in the [[Battle of Coronel]]. ''Good Hope'' was lost with all hands.

==Design and description==
''Good Hope'' was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|14150|LT|t}}. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|553|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|71|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|9|in|m|1}}. She was powered by two 4-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of {{convert|30000|ihp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by 43 [[Belleville boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=ck8&gt;Chesneau &amp; Kolesnik, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; She carried a maximum of {{convert|2500|LT|t}} of coal and her complement consisted of 900 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=f6&gt;Friedman, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Her main armament consisted of two [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|{{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} Mk X guns]] in single [[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the superstructure.&lt;ref name=f6/&gt; Her secondary armament of sixteen [[BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 6-inch Mk VII guns]] was arranged in [[casemate]]s amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 243, 260–61&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12 cwt guns]] were fitted for defence against [[torpedo boat]]s. Two additional [[QF 12-pounder 8-cwt Mk I naval gun|12-pounder 8 cwt guns]] could be dismounted for service ashore.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, pp. 250, 336&lt;/ref&gt; ''Good Hope'' also carried three [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder]] [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and two submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|{{convert|17.72|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}]] [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt;

The ship's [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armour belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|6|in|0}} and was closed off by {{convert|5|in|adj=on|0}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick. The protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] armour ranged in thickness from {{convert|1|-|2.5|in|mm|0}} and the conning tower was protected by {{convert|12|in|0}} of armour.&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt;

==Service==
[[File:HMS Good Hope in art.jpg|left|thumbnail|"HMS Good Hope" by [[William Lionel Wyllie]]]]
''Good Hope'', named after the [[Cape Colony|British colony]] on the [[Cape of Good Hope]], was [[laid down]] on 11 September 1899 with the name of ''Africa''&lt;ref name=s5&gt;Silverstone, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering]] at their [[Govan]] shipyard.&lt;ref name=ck8/&gt; She was renamed ''Good Hope'' on 2 October and [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 21 February 1901, when she was formally named by Mrs. (Ethel) Elgar, wife of [[Francis Elgar]], manager of the shipbuilding company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence - Launch of the Good Hope and the Bacchante |day_of_week=Friday |date=22 February 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36385| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s5/&gt; She arrived in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] to be completed and armed in late December 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military Intelligence|day_of_week=Monday |date=23 December 1901 |page_number=8 |issue=36645| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Sir Charles Madden, 1st Baronet|Charles Edward Madden]] was appointed in command as she was completed in late 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=8 September 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36867| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 she became the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic Fleet and was the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when she visited South Africa two years later. ''Good Hope'' was placed in reserve in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon recommissioning in mid-1914, she was briefly assigned to the [[6th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|6th Cruiser Squadron]] in August before being assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron to reinforce Cradock's forces. He transferred his flag to her because she was faster than his previous flagship. Cradock's command was transferred to the coast of South America later that month at his own suggestion to better hunt for the German ships preying upon British merchant ships. His ships were generally unsuccessful in this and he moved his squadron further south in late September to search for the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral [[Graf Maximilian von Spee]], in the vicinity of [[Cape Horn]] and the Strait of Magellan in accordance to his orders from the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, pp. 40, 51, 257, 261, 309–10&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of September, Cradock made his first fruitless search of the [[Tierra del Fuego]] area and later detached three of his ships to search up the Chilean coast, reaching [[Valparaiso]] on 15 October, while ''Good Hope'' returned to [[Port Stanley]], in the [[Falkland Islands]], to recoal and to reestablish communications with the Admiralty. He received word on 7 October that Spee's ships were definitely bound for the Cape Horn region and waited for the elderly [[predreadnought battleship]] {{HMS|Canopus|1897|2}} to reinforce his squadron. She was in poor mechanical condition when she arrived at Port Stanley and required time to make repairs. ''Good Hope'' sailed on 22 October without her, going around Cape Horn, while ''Canopus'' and three [[collier (ship type)|collier]]s departed the following day, taking the shorter route through the Strait of Magellan.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 210–19&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Battle of Coronel===
[[File:HMS Good Hope plaque CFB Halifax.jpg|200px|thumb|right|HMS ''Good Hope'' plaque, [[CFB Halifax]]]]
{{main|Battle of Coronel}}

''Good Hope'' rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron at Vallenar Roads in the remote [[Chonos Archipelago]] of Chile on 27 October to recoal. They departed two days later, just as ''Canopus'' arrived, Cradock ordering the battleship to follow as soon as possible. He sent the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Glasgow|1909|2}} to scout ahead and to enter [[Coronel, Chile]] to pick up any messages from the Admiralty and acquire intelligence regarding German activities. The cruiser began to pick up German radio signals from the light cruiser {{SMS|Leipzig|1905|6}} on the afternoon of 29 October, and delayed entering Coronel for two days with Cradock's permission to avoid being trapped by the fast German ships. A German supply ship was already there and radioed Spee that ''Glasgow'' had entered the harbour around twilight. The cruiser departed on the morning of 1 November, but Spee had already made plans to catch her when informed of her presence the previous evening.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 221–24&lt;/ref&gt;

''Glasgow'' departed Coronel at 09:15 after having picked up the squadron's mail and rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron four hours later. Cradock ordered his ships to form line abreast with an interval of {{convert|15|nmi}} between ships to maximise visibility at 13:50, and steered north at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. At 16:17 ''Leipzig'' spotted ''Glasgow'', the easternmost British ship, to its west and she spotted ''Leipzig''{{'}}s [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] smoke three minutes later. At 17:10 Cradock ordered his ships to head for ''Glasgow'', the closest ship to the Germans. Once gathered together, he formed them into line astern, with ''Good Hope'' in the lead, steering southeasterly at {{convert|16|kn}} at 18:18. As the sixteen {{convert|21|cm|adj=on}} guns aboard the armoured cruisers [[SMS Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}} were only matched by the two 9.2-inch guns on his flagship, he needed to close the range to bring his more numerous 6-inch guns to bear. The [[Beaufort scale|Force 7 winds]] and high seas, however, prevented the use of half of those guns as they were too close to the water. He also wanted to use the setting sun to his advantage so that its light would blind the German gunners. Spee was well aware of the British advantages and refused to allow Cradock to close the range. His ships were faster than the British, slowed by the 16-knot maximum speed of the [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{HMS|Otranto||2}}, and he opened up the range to {{convert|18000|yd}} until conditions changed to suit him. The sun set at 18:50, which silhouetted the British ships against the light sky while the German ships became indistinguishable from the shoreline behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 223–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Spee immediately turned to close and signalled his ships to open fire at 19:04 when the range closed to {{convert|12300|yd}}. Spee's flagship, ''Scharnhorst'', engaged ''Good Hope'' while ''Gneisenau'' fired at [[HMS Monmouth (1901)|''Monmouth'']]. Cradock's flagship was hit on the ''Scharnhorst''{{'}}s third [[salvo]], when shells knocked out her forward 9.2-inch turret and set her [[forecastle]] on fire. Cradock, knowing his only chance was to close the range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee's ships inflicted. By 19:23 the range was almost half of that when the battle began and the British ships bore onwards. Spee tried to open the range, fearing a torpedo attack, but the British were only {{convert|5500|yd}} away at 19:35. Seven minutes later, ''Good Hope'' charged directly at the German ships, although they dodged out of her way. Spee ordered his armoured cruisers to concentrate their fire on the British flagship and she soon drifted to a halt with her topsides all aflame. At 19:50 her forward [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] exploded, severing the bow from the rest of the ship, and she later sank in the darkness. Spee estimated that his flagship had made 35 hits on ''Good Hope'', suffering only two hits in return that did no significant damage and failed even to wound one crewman.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 228–30, 236&lt;/ref&gt; ''Good Hope'' was sunk with all hands, a total of 926 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Battle of Coronel |url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1Battle-Battle_of_Coronel_1914.htm |website=World War 1 at Sea - Naval Battles in outline with Casualties etc. |publisher=naval-history.net |accessdate=4 November 2018 |date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the [[midshipmen]] aboard the ship were the first casualties of the newly formed [[Royal Canadian Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwpda.org/naval/j0500001.htm First Canadian Casualties in the RCN]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homeorhesis''', derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "similar flow", is a concept encompassing [[dynamical systems]] which return to a [[trajectory]], as opposed to systems which return to a particular state, which is termed [[homeostasis]].

==Biology==
Homeorhesis is steady flow. Often biological systems are inaccurately described as homeostatic, being in a steady state. Steady state implies equilibrium which is never reached, nor are organisms and ecosystems in a closed environment. During his tenure at the State University of New York at Oneonta, Dr William Butts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneonta.edu/academics/biofld/facultystaff.asp&lt;/ref&gt; correctly applied the term homeorhesis to biological organisms. The term was first used in biology by [[C.H. Waddington]] around 1940, where he described the tendency of developing or changing organisms to continue development or adapting to their environment and changing towards a given state.

==Gaia hypothesis==
{{wiktionary}}
In [[ecology]] the concept is important as an element of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], where the system under consideration is the ecological balance of different forms of life on the planet. It was [[Lynn Margulis]], the coauthor of Gaia hypothesis, who wrote in particular that only homeorhetic, and not homeostatic, balances are involved in the theory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} That is, the composition of Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in homeostasis, but those set points change with time.

'''Ideomotor [[Apraxia]]''', often '''IMA''', is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to correctly imitate hand gestures and voluntarily mime tool use, e.g. pretend to brush one's hair. The ability to spontaneously use tools, such as brushing one's hair in the morning without being instructed to do so, may remain intact, but is often lost.  The general concept of apraxia and the classification of ideomotor apraxia were developed in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the work of [[Hugo Liepmann]],  [[Adolph Kussmaul]],  [[Arnold Pick]],  [[Paul Flechsig]], [[Hermann Munk]], [[Carl Nothnagel]], [[Theodor Meynert]],  and linguist [[Heymann Steinthal]], among others. Ideomotor apraxia was classified as "ideo-kinetic apraxia" by Liepmann due to the apparent dissociation of the idea of the action with its execution.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = G. | last2 = Liepmann | first2 = H. | title = Apraxia and beyond: life and work of Hugo Liepmann. | journal = Cortex | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 509–24 |date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70261-2 | pmid = 12870824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classifications of the various subtypes are not well defined at present, however, owing to issues of diagnosis and pathophysiology. Ideomotor apraxia is hypothesized to result from a disruption of the system that relates stored tool use and gesture information with the state of the body to produce the proper motor output. This system is thought to be related to the areas of the brain most often seen to be damaged when ideomotor apraxia is present: the left [[parietal lobe]] and the [[premotor cortex]]. Little can be done at present to reverse the motor deficit seen in ideomotor apraxia, although the extent of dysfunction it induces is not entirely clear.

==Signs and Symptoms==
Ideomotor apraxia (IMA) impinges on one's ability to carry out common, familiar actions on command, such as waving goodbye. Persons with IMA exhibit a loss of ability to carry out motor movements, and may show errors in how they hold and move the tool in attempting the correct function.&lt;ref name="Macauley 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macauley|first=Beth|author2=Handley, Candace|title=Gestures Produced by Patients with Aphasia and Ideomotor Apraxia|journal=Contemporary Issues in Communication Science and Disorders|date=Spring 2005|volume=32|pages=30–37| url = http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/asha/publications/cicsd/2005SGesturesProducedbyPatients.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the defining symptoms of ideomotor apraxia is the inability to pantomime tool use. As an example, if a normal individual were handed a comb and instructed to pretend to brush his hair, he would grasp the comb properly and pass it through his hair. If this were repeated in a patient with ideomotor apraxia, the patient may move the comb in big circles around his head, hold it upside-down, or perhaps try and brush his teeth with it. The error may also be temporal in nature, such as brushing exceedingly slowly. The other characteristic symptom of ideomotor apraxia is the inability to imitate hand gestures, meaningless or meaningful, on request; a meaningless hand gesture is something like having someone make a ninety-degree angle with his thumb and placing it under his nose, with his hand in the plane of his face. This gesture has no meaning attached to it. In contrast, a meaningful gesture is something like saluting or waving goodbye. An important distinction here is that all of the above refer to actions that are consciously and voluntarily initiated. That is to say that a person is specifically asked to either imitate what someone else is doing or is given verbal instructions, such as "wave goodbye." People suffering from ideomotor apraxia will know what they are supposed to do, e.g. they will know to wave goodbye and what their arm and hand should do to accomplish it, but will be unable to execute the motion correctly. This voluntary type of action is distinct from spontaneous actions. Ideomotor apraxia patients may still retain the ability to perform spontaneous motions; if someone they know leaves the room, for instance, they may be able to wave goodbye to that person, despite being unable to do so at request. The ability to perform this sort of spontaneous action is not always retained, however; some sufferers lose this capability, as well.&lt;ref name="Wheaton 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Wheaton | first1 = LA. | last2 = Hallett | first2 = M. | title = Ideomotor apraxia: a review. | journal = J Neurol Sci | volume = 260 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 1–10 |date=Sep 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2007.04.014 | PMID = 17507030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition of meaningful gestures, e.g. understanding what waving goodbye means when it is seen, seems to be unaffected by ideomotor apraxia.&lt;ref name="Halsband 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Halsband | first1 = U. | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = J. | last3 = Weyers | first3 = M. | last4 = Binkofski | first4 = F. | last5 = Grützner | first5 = G. | last6 = Freund | first6 = HJ. | title = Recognition and imitation of pantomimed motor acts after unilateral parietal and premotor lesions: a perspective on apraxia. | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 200–16 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0028-3932(00)00088-9 | PMID = 11163376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that ideomotor apraxia sufferers may have some deficits in general spontaneous movements. Apraxia patients appear to be unable to tap their fingers as quickly as a control group, with a lower maximum tapping rate correlated with more severe apraxia. It has also been demonstrated that apraxic patients are slower to point at a target light when they do not have sight of their hand as compared with healthy patients under the same conditions. The two groups did not differ when they could see their hands. The speed and accuracy of grasping objects also appears unaffected by ideomotor apraxia.&lt;ref name="Ietswaart 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ietswaart | first1 = M. | last2 = Carey | first2 = DP. | last3 = Della Sala | first3 = S. | title = Tapping, grasping and aiming in ideomotor apraxia. | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 1175–84 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.10.003 | PMID = 16298401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients suffering from ideomotor apraxia appear to be much more reliant on visual input when conducting movements then nonapraxic individuals.&lt;ref name="Jax 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Jax | first1 = SA. | last2 = Buxbaum | first2 = LJ. | last3 = Moll | first3 = AD. | title = Deficits in movement planning and intrinsic coordinate control in ideomotor apraxia. | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 2063–76 |date=Dec 2006 | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2006.18.12.2063 | PMID = 17129191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
The most common cause of ideomotor apraxia is a unilateral ischemic lesion to the brain, which is damage to one hemisphere of the brain due to a disruption of the blood supply, as in a stroke. There are a variety of brain areas where lesions have been correlated to ideomotor apraxia. Initially it was believed that damage to the subcortical white matter tracts, the axons that extend down from the cells bodies in the cerebral cortex, was the main area responsible for this form of apraxia. Lesions to the [[basal ganglia]] may also be responsible, although there is considerable debate as to whether damage to the basal ganglia alone would be sufficient to induce apraxia. Lesions to these lower brain structures has not, however, been shown to be more prevalent in apraxic patients. In fact, these types of lesions are more common in nonapraxic patients. The lesions most associated with ideomotor apraxia are to the left parietal and [[premotor cortex|premotor areas]]. Patients with lesions to the [[supplementary motor area]] have also presented with ideomotor apraxia.&lt;ref name="Wheaton 2007"/&gt;  Lesions to the [[corpus callosum]] can also induce apraxic-like symptoms, with varying effects on the two hands, although this has not been thoroughly studied.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = G. | last2 = Laimgruber | first2 = K. | last3 = Hermsdörfer | first3 = J. | title = Imitation of gestures by disconnected hemispheres. | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 39 | issue = 13 | pages = 1432–43 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00062-8  | PMID = 11585611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ischemic lesions to the brain, ideomotor apraxia has also been seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], [[corticobasal degeneration]], and [[progressive supranuclear palsy]].&lt;ref name="Wheaton 2007"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The prevailing hypothesis for the pathophysiology of ideomotor apraxia is that the various brain lesions associated with the disorder somehow disrupt portions of the praxis system.&lt;ref name="Wheaton 2007"/&gt; The praxis system is the brain regions that are involved in taking processed sensory input, accessing of stored information about tools and gestures, and translating these into a motor output. Buxbaum et al. have proposed that the praxis system involves three distinct parts: stored gesture representations, stored tool knowledge, and a "dynamic body schema." The first two store information about the representation of gestures in the brain and the characteristic movements of tools. The body schema is a brain model of the body and its position in space. The praxis system relates the stored information about a movement type to how the dynamic, i.e. changing, body representation varies as the movement progresses. It is still not clear how this system maps out onto the brain itself, although some research has given indications to possible locations for certain portions. The dynamic body schema has been suggested to be localized in the superior [[posterior parietal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Buxbaum 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Buxbaum | first1 = LJ. | last2 = Giovannetti | first2 = T. | last3 = Libon | first3 = D. | title = The role of the dynamic body schema in praxis: evidence from primary progressive apraxia. | journal = Brain Cogn | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–91 |date=Nov 2000 | doi = 10.1006/brcg.2000.1227 | PMID = 11041988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that the [[inferior parietal lobule]] may be the locus for storage of the characteristic movements of a tool. This area showed inverse activation to the [[cerebellum]] in a study of tool use and tool mime.&lt;ref name="Imazu 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Imazu | first1 = S. | last2 = Sugio | first2 = T. | last3 = Tanaka | first3 = S. | last4 = Inui | first4 = T. | title = Differences between actual and imagined usage of chopsticks: an fMRI study. | journal = Cortex | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–7 |date=Apr 2007 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70456-8 | pmid = 17533754 | url = http://freylab.missouri.edu/boat_notes/Imazu_2007_Cortex_Differences_between_actual_and_imagined_usage_of_chopsticks_An_fMRI_study.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the connections between these areas become severed, the praxis system would be disrupted, possibly resulting in the symptoms observed in ideomotor apraxia.
==Diagnosis==
There is no one definitive test for ideomotor apraxia; there are several that are used clinically to make an ideomotor apraxia diagnosis. The criteria for a diagnosis are not entirely conserved among clinicians, for apraxia in general or distinguishing subtypes.  Almost all the tests laid out here that enable a diagnosis of ideomotor apraxia share a common feature: assessment of the ability to imitate gestures. A test developed by Georg Goldenberg uses imitation assessment of 10 gestures.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = G. | title = Imitating gestures and manipulating a mannikin--the representation of the human body in ideomotor apraxia. | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72 |date=Jan 1995 | doi = 10.1016/0028-3932(94)00104-W | PMID = 7731541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tester demonstrates the gesture to the patient and rates him on how whether the gesture was correctly imitated. If the first attempt to imitate the gesture was unsuccessful, the gesture is presented a second time; a higher score is given for correct imitation on the first trial, then for the second, and the lowest score is for not correctly imitating the gesture. The gestures used here are all meaningless, such as placing the hand flat on the top of the head or flat outward with the fingers towards the ear. This test is specifically designed for ideomotor apraxia. The main variation from this is in the type and number of gestures used. One test uses twenty-four movements with three trials for each and a trial-based scoring system similar to the Goldenberg protocol. The gestures here are also copied by the patient from the tester and are divided into finger movements, e.g. making a scissor movement with the forefinger and middle finger, and hand and arm movements, e.g. doing a salute. This protocol combines meaningful and meaningless gestures. Another test uses five meaningful gestures, such as waving goodbye or scratching your head and five meaningless gestures.  Additional differences in this test are a verbal command to initiate the movement and it distinguishes between accurate performance and inaccurate but recognizable performance. One test utilizes tools, including a hammer and a key, with both a verbal command to use the tools and the patient copying the tester's demonstrated use of the tools. These tests have been shown to be individually unreliable, with considerable variability between the diagnoses delivered by each.  If a battery of tests is used, however, the reliability and validity may be improved. It is also highly advisable to include assessments of how the patient performs activities in daily life.&lt;ref name="Butler 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Butler | first1 = JA. | title = How comparable are tests of apraxia? | journal = Clin Rehabil | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 389–98 |date=Jun 2002 | doi = 10.1191/0269215502cr493oa   | PMID = 12061473 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the newer tests that has been developed may provide greater reliability without relying on a multitude of tests. It combines three types of tool use with imitation of gestures. The tool use section includes having the patient pantomime use with no tool present, with visual contact with the tool, and finally with tactile contact with the tool. This test screens for ideational and ideomotor apraxia, with the second portion aimed specifically at ideomotor apraxia.&lt;ref name="van Heugten 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = van Heugten | first1 = CM. | last2 = Dekker | first2 = J. | last3 = Deelman | first3 = BG. | last4 = Stehmann-Saris | first4 = FC. | last5 = Kinebanian | first5 = A. | title = A diagnostic test for apraxia in stroke patients: internal consistency and diagnostic value. | journal = Clin Neuropsychol | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 182–92 |date=May 1999 | doi = 10.1076/clin.13.2.182.1966 | PMID = 10949159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed great potential for this test, but further studies are needed to reproduce these results before this can be said with confidence.&lt;ref name="Zwinkels 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zwinkels | first1 = A. | last2 = Geusgens | first2 = C. | last3 = van de Sande | first3 = P. | last4 = Van Heugten | first4 = C. | title = Assessment of apraxia: inter-rater reliability of a new apraxia test, association between apraxia and other cognitive deficits and prevalence of apraxia in a rehabilitation setting. | journal = Clinical Rehabilitation | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 819–27 |date=Nov 2004 | doi =  10.1191/0269215504cr816oa  | PMID = 15573839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This disorder often occurs with other degenerative neurological disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. These comorbidities can make it difficult to pick out the specific features of ideomotor apraxia. The important point in distinguishing ideomotor apraxia is that basic motor control is intact; it is a high level dysfunction involving tool use and gesturing. Additionally, clinicians must be careful to exclude [[aphasia]] as a possible diagnosis, as, in the tests involving verbal command, an aphasic patient could fail to perform a task properly because they do not understand what the directions are.&lt;ref name="Wheaton 2007"/&gt;

==Management==
Given the complexity of the medical problems facing ideomotor apraxia patients, as they are usually suffering from a multitude of other problems, it is difficult to ascertain the impact that it has on their ability to function independently. Deficits due to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease could very well be sufficient to mask or make irrelevant difficulties arising from the apraxia. Some studies have shown ideomotor apraxia to independently diminish the patient's ability to function on their own.&lt;ref name="Hanna-Pladdy 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hanna-Pladdy | first1 = B. | last2 = Heilman | first2 = KM. | last3 = Foundas | first3 = AL. | title = Ecological implications of ideomotor apraxia: evidence from physical activities of daily living. | journal = Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 487–90 |date=Feb 2003 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.60.3.487  | PMID = 12578932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The general consensus seems to be that ideomotor apraxia does have a negative impact on independence in that it can reduce an individual's ability to manipulate objects, as well as diminishing the capacity for mechanical problem solving, owing to the inability to access information about how familiar parts of the unfamiliar system function.&lt;ref name="Sunderland 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Sunderland | first1 = A. | last2 = Shinner | first2 = C. | title = Ideomotor apraxia and functional ability. | journal = Cortex | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 359–67 |date=Apr 2007 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70461-1  | PMID = 17533759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small subset of patients has been known to spontaneously recover from apraxia; this is rare, however. One possible hope is the phenomenon of hemispheric shift, where functions normally performed by one hemisphere can shift to the other in the event that the first is damaged. This seems to necessitate, however, that some portion of the function is associated with the other hemisphere to begin with. There is dispute over whether the right hemisphere of the cortex is involved at all in the praxis system, as some evidence from patients with severed corpus callosums indicates it may not be.&lt;ref name="Wheaton 2007"/&gt;

Although there is little that can be done to substantially reverse the effects of ideomotor apraxia, [[Occupational Therapy]] can be effective in helping patients regain some functional control.  Sharing the same approach in treating [[ideational apraxia]], this is achieved by breaking a daily task (e.g. combing hair) into separate components and teaching each distinct component individually.&lt;ref name=text1182&gt;Unsworth, C.A. (2007).  Cognitive and Perceptual Dysfunction.  In S. B. O'sullivan, &amp; T. J. Schmitz (Eds.), Physical Rehabilitation (5th Ed.) (p.1182).  Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  With ample repetition, proficiency in these movements can be acquired and should eventually be combined to create a single pattern of movement.&lt;ref name=text1182/&gt;

The [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963 has spurred numerous [[conspiracy theories]], which include accusations of involvement of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], sitting [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Cuban Prime Minister]] [[Fidel Castro]], the [[KGB]], or even some combination thereof.

In 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was the only person responsible for assassinating Kennedy. In 1979, the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy, although it did not identify any individuals or groups other than Oswald.&lt;ref name="HCSA-S"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0048a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The HSCA reasoned that a second gunman probably also fired at Kennedy, but acoustic evidence that the HSCA accepted in reaching its conclusions was later discredited by another set of experts.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=377}}&lt;ref name="Campbell2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ballard C.

== Background ==
{{See also|Assassination of John F. Kennedy in popular culture}}
[[File:wanted for treason.jpg|thumb|right|Handbill circulated on November 21, 1963, one day before the assassination.]]
[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated by gunshot while traveling in a motorcade in an open-top [[SS-100-X|limousine]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] at 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm CST on Friday, November 22, 1963; Texas Governor [[John Connally]] was wounded, but survived. Within two hours, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was arrested for killing Dallas policeman [[J. D. Tippit]] and arraigned that evening. Shortly after 1:30&amp;nbsp;am on Saturday, November 23, Oswald was arraigned for murdering President Kennedy as well.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Report, Chapter 5: Detention and Death of Oswald, [https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-5.html#chronology Chronology]. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tippit murder affidavit: [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0170a.htm text], [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0170b.htm cover].

Immediately after the shooting, many people suspected that the assassination was part of a larger plot,&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Peter |title=The Kennedy Assassination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRs2Tu714ZUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |year=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press Ltd. |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-1-934110-32-4 |page=75 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[broadcasting|broadcaster]]s speculated that Dallas [[Right-wing politics|right-wingers]] were involved.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; January 5, 1992"&gt;{{cite news |last=Krauss |first=Clifford |date=January 5, 1992 |title=28 Years After Kennedy's Assassination, Conspiracy Theories Refuse to Die |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/05/us/28-years-after-kennedy-s-assassination-conspiracy-theories-refuse-to-die.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruby's shooting of Oswald compounded initial suspicions.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt; Among conspiracy theorists, author [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] has been described as writing "the first literary shot" with his article, "Defense Brief for Oswald", in the ''[[National Guardian]]''{{'}}s December 19, 1963 issue.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F.

In 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Oswald had acted alone and that no credible evidence supported the contention that he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the president.&lt;ref name="WCR-C6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also indicated that then-Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], then-Defense Secretary [[Robert S. McNamara]], then-Treasury Secretary [[C. Douglas Dillon]], then-Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], then-FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], then-CIA director [[John A. McCone]], and then-Secret Service Chief [[James J. Rowley]], each individually reached the same conclusion on the basis of information available to them.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=374}} During the [[trial of Clay Shaw]] in 1969, however, [[New Orleans]] District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]] challenged the [[single-bullet theory]] with evidence from the [[Zapruder film]], which he claimed indicated that a fourth shot from the [[Dealey Plaza|grassy knoll]] had caused the fatal shot to Kennedy's head.

In 1979, the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald did, in fact, assassinate Kennedy, but concluded that the Commission's report and the original FBI investigation were seriously flawed. The HSCA concluded that at least four shots were fired with a "high probability" that two gunmen fired at the President, and that a conspiracy to do so was probable.&lt;ref name="HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75"/&gt; The HSCA stated that the Warren Commission had "failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President".&lt;ref name="HCSA-S"/&gt; The [[John F. Kennedy assassination#Ramsey Clark Panel|Ramsey Clark Panel]] and the [[John F. Kennedy assassination#Rockefeller Commission|Rockefeller Commission]] both supported the Warren Commission's conclusions.

The last remaining documents under Section 5 of the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992]] were released on October 26, 2017, while the remaining ones that are still classified will only be analyzed for redactions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/nr18-05&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public opinion ===

Author David Krajicek describes Kennedy assassination enthusiasts as people belonging to "[[conspiracy theorists]]" on one side and "[[debunkers]]" on the other.&lt;ref name="Krajicek"/&gt; The great amount of controversy surrounding the event has resulted in bitter disputes between those who support the conclusion of the Warren Commission and those who reject it, or are critical of the official explanation with each side levelling toward the other accusations of "naivete, cynicism, and selective interpretation of the evidence".&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt;

Public opinion polls have consistently shown that most Americans believe there was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. However, on the question of a government cover-up, different polls show both a minority and a majority of Americans who believe the government was engaged in one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/article/8008|author=Karlyn Bowman|title=Most Americans Don't Know Much about Fast-Track|publisher=American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research|date=September 4, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same polls also show no agreement on who else may have been involved in the shooting. A 2003 [[Gallup (company)#Gallup Poll|Gallup Poll]] reported that 75% of Americans don't believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.&lt;ref name="Lydia Saad"/&gt; That same year an [[ABC News]] poll found that 70% of respondents suspected that the assassination involved more than one person.&lt;ref name=langer20031116&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/937a1JFKAssassination.pdf|author=Gary Langer|title=John F.

Michael Benson wrote that the Warren Commission received only information supplied to it by the FBI, and that its purpose was to [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] the [[lone gunman theory]].&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benson|first=Michael |title=Who's Who in the JFK Assassination: An A-to-Z Encyclopedia |year=2003|origyear=1993 |publisher=Citadel Press Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8065-1444-2 |page=xiii |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Senator and [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] member [[Richard Schweiker]] told author Anthony Summers in 1978 that he "believe[d] that the Warren Commission was set up at the time to feed pabulum to the American public for reasons not yet known, and that one of the biggest cover-ups in the history of our country occurred at that time".{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=243}}

[[James H. Fetzer]] took issue with a 1998 statement from Federal Judge and Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) Chairman [[John R. Tunheim]], who stated that no "[[smoking gun]]s" indicating a conspiracy or cover-up were discovered during their efforts in the early 1990s to declassify documents related to the assassination. Fetzer identified 16 "smoking guns" that he claims prove the official narrative is impossible, and therefore a conspiracy and cover-up occurred. He also claims that evidence released by the ARRB substantiates these concerns. These include problems with bullet trajectories, the murder weapon, the ammunition used, inconsistencies between the Warren Commission's account and the autopsy findings, inconsistencies between the autopsy findings and what was reported by witnesses at the scene of the murder, eyewitness accounts that conflict with x-rays taken of the President's body, indications that the diagrams and photos of the President's brain in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] are not the President's, testimony by those who took and processed the autopsy photos that the photos were altered, created, or destroyed, indications that the [[Zapruder film]] had been tampered with, allegations that the Warren Commission's version of events conflicts with news reports from the scene of the murder, an alleged change to the motorcade route that facilitated the assassination, an alleged lax Secret Service and local law enforcement security, and statements made by people who claim that they had knowledge of, or participated in, a conspiracy to kill the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfkresearch.com/prologue.htm|author=James H.

In 1966, [[Roscoe Drummond]] voiced skepticism about a cover-up in his syndicated column, saying, "If there were a conspiracy to cover up the truth about the assassination, it would have to involve the Chief Justice, the Republican, Democratic, and non-party members of the commission, the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, the distinguished doctors of the armed services—and the White House—a conspiracy so multiple and complex that it would have fallen of its own weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19661103&amp;id=bclOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aUkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4883,718763 | title=Those Warren Report Rumors | work=The Deseret News | date=November 3, 1966 | accessdate=December 23, 2014 | last=Drummond | first=Roscoe | authorlink=Roscoe Drummond |location=Salt Lake City, Utah | page=A26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- lengthier version of same column here: http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/D%20Disk/Drummon%20Roscoe/Item%2002.pdf --&gt;

== Allegations of witness tampering, intimidation, and foul play ==

=== Alleged witness intimidation ===
Richard Buyer wrote that many witnesses whose statements pointed to a conspiracy were either ignored or [[witness intimidation|intimidated]] by the Warren Commission.&lt;ref name="Buyer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Buyer |first=Richard |title=Why the JFK Assassination Still Matters: The Truth for My Daughter Kennedy and for Generations to Come |year=2009 |publisher=Wheatmark |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=1-60494-193-6 |page=162 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness'', a 1992 biography of [[Jean Hill]], Bill Sloan wrote that Warren Commission assistance counsel [[Arlen Specter]] attempted to humiliate, discredit, and intimidate Hill into changing her story. Hill also told Sloan that she was abused by Secret Service agents, harassed by the FBI, and received death threats.&lt;ref name="Sloan"&gt;{{cite book |title=JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness |last=Sloan |first=Bill |author2=Jean Hill |year=1992 |publisher=Pelican Publishing Company |location=Gretna, Louisiana |isbn=1-58980-672-7 |pages=101, 186, 212, 219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPKo3kC3YtIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later book by Sloan, ''JFK: Breaking the Silence'', quotes several assassination eyewitnesses as saying that Warren Commission interviewers repeatedly cut short or stifled any comments casting doubt on the conclusion that Oswald had acted alone.

In his book ''Crossfire'', [[Jim Marrs]] gives accounts of several people who said they were intimidated by either FBI agents or anonymous individuals into altering or suppressing what they knew regarding the assassination. Some of those individuals include Richard Carr, Acquilla Clemmons, Sandy Speaker, and A. J. Millican.&lt;ref name="Marrs"&gt;{{cite book |last= Marrs |first= Jim |authorlink=Jim Marrs|title= Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy |year= 1989|publisher= Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, Inc|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-88184-648-5 |pages=318–319 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marrs also wrote that Texas School Book Depository employee Joe Molina was "intimidated by authorities and lost his job soon after the assassination",{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=87}} and that witness Ed Hoffman was warned by an FBI agent that he "might get killed" had he revealed what he observed in [[Dealey Plaza]] on the day of the assassination.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=88}}

=== Witness deaths ===
Allegations of mysterious or suspicious deaths of witnesses connected with the Kennedy assassination originated with [[Penn Jones, Jr.]],&lt;ref name="HCSA-IV"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=957 |type= |edition= |series= |volume=IV |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=454–468 |chapter=Testimony of Jacqueline Hess |chapterurl=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=77882}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|pp=1012, 1276}} and were brought to national attention by the 1973 film ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]''.&lt;ref name="HCSA-IV"/&gt;{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=1012}} Jim Marrs later presented a list of 103 people he believed died "convenient deaths" under suspicious circumstances. He noted that the deaths were grouped around investigations conducted by the Warren Commission, New Orleans D.A. [[Jim Garrison]], the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]], and the House Select Committee on Assassinations.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|pp=555–566}} Marrs pointed out that "these deaths certainly would have been convenient for anyone not wishing the truth of the JFK assassination to become public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assassinationresearch.com/v1n2/deaths.html|author1=Jim Marrs |author2=Ralph Schuster |title=A Look at the Deaths of Those Involved|publisher=Assassination Research|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Richard Belzer]] published ''Hit List: An In-Depth Investigation into the Mysterious Deaths of Witnesses to the JFK Assassination'' that examines the deaths of 50 people linked to the assassination and claims they were murdered as part of a cover-up.&lt;ref name="Elias"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elias |first=Marilyn |date=Winter 2013 |title=Conspiracy Act |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2013/winter/conspiracy-act |journal=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |issue=152 |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent Bugliosi described the death of journalist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]]—who said she was granted a private interview with Jack Ruby—as "perhaps the most prominent mysterious death" cited by assassination researchers.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=1014}}&lt;!-- Explanation of her prominence among conspiracy researchers (i.e. death after Jack Ruby interview) needed here. --&gt; According to author Jerome Kroth, Mafia figures [[Sam Giancana]], [[John Roselli]], [[Carlos Prio]], [[Jimmy Hoffa]], [[Charles Nicoletti]], Leo Moceri, [[Richard Cain]], [[Salvatore Granello]], and [[Dave Yaras]] were likely murdered to prevent them from revealing their knowledge.&lt;ref name="Kroth"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kroth |first=Jerome A. |title=Conspiracy in Camelot: The Complete History of the Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy |year=2003 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=0-87586-247-0 |page=195 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Matthew Smith, others with some tie to the case who have died suspicious deaths include [[Lee Bowers]], [[John Garrett Underhill, Jr.|Gary Underhill]], [[William C. Sullivan|William Sullivan]], [[David Ferrie]], [[Clay Shaw]], [[George de Mohrenschildt]], four showgirls who worked for Jack Ruby, and Ruby himself.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Matthew |title=Conspiracy: The Plot to Stop the Kennedys |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clLqGmlwS6QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |year=2005 |publisher=Citadel Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8065-2764-2 |pages=104–108 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated another alleged "mysterious death"—that of Rose Cheramie.&lt;ref name="HCSA-X"&gt;{{cite book |title=Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=156001 |volume=X |date=March 1979 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=197–205 |chapter=Rose Cheramie |chapterurl=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=1212&amp;relPageId=201 |ref={{harvid|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume X|1979}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee reported that Louisiana State Police Lieutenant Francis Fruge traveled to [[Eunice, Louisiana]], on November 20, 1963—two days before the assassination—to pick up Cheramie, who had sustained minor injuries when she was hit by a car.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=401}}{{sfn|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume X|1979|p=201}} Fruge drove Cheramie to the hospital and said that on the way there, she "... related to [him] that she was coming from Florida to Dallas with two men who were Italians or resembled Italians." Fruge asked her what she planned to do in Dallas, to which she replied: "... number one, pick up some money, pick up [my] baby, and ... kill Kennedy."{{sfn|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume X|1979|p=201}} Cheramie was admitted and treated at State Hospital in [[Jackson, Louisiana]] for alcohol and heroin addiction.

State Hospital physician Dr. Victor Weiss later told a House Select Committee investigator that on November 25—three days after the assassination—one of his fellow physicians told him that Cheramie had "stated before the assassination that President Kennedy was going to be killed".{{sfn|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume X|1979|p=200}} Dr. Weiss further reported that Cheramie told him after the assassination that she had worked for Jack Ruby and that her knowledge of the assassination originated from "word in the underworld".{{sfn|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume X|1979|p=201}} After the assassination, Lt. Fruge contacted Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz regarding what he had learned from Cheramie, but Fritz told him he "wasn't interested".{{sfn|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume X|1979|p=202}} Cheramie was found dead by a highway near [[Big Sandy, Texas]], on September 4, 1965; she had been run over by a car.{{sfn|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume X|1979|p=199}}

Another "suspicious death" cited by Jim Marrs was that of Joseph Milteer, director of the Dixie [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] of Georgia. Milteer was secretly tape-recorded thirteen days before the assassination telling Miami police informant William Somersett that the murder of Kennedy was "in the working". Milteer died in 1974 when a heater exploded in his house.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=562}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 3, "The Cover-Up"'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0131b.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported in 1979 that Milteer's information on the threat to the President "was furnished [to] the agents making the advance arrangements before the visit of the President" to Miami, but that "the Milteer threat was ignored by Secret Service personnel in planning the trip to Dallas." Robert Bouck, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Secret Service's Protective Research Section, testified that "threat information was transmitted from one region of the country to another if there was specific evidence it was relevant to the receiving region."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0132a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated the allegation "that a statistically improbable number of individuals with some direct or peripheral association with the Kennedy assassination died as a result of that assassination, thereby raising the specter of conspiracy".&lt;ref name="HCSA-IV"/&gt; The committee's chief of research testified: "Our final conclusion on the issue is that the available evidence does not establish anything about the nature of these deaths which would indicate that the deaths were in some manner, either direct or peripheral, caused by the assassination of President Kennedy or by any aspect of the subsequent investigation."&lt;ref name="HCSA-IV"/&gt;

Author [[Gerald Posner]] said that Marrs's list was taken from the group of about 10,000 people connected even in the most tenuous way to the assassination, including people identified in the official investigations, as well as the research of conspiracy theorists. Posner also said that it would be surprising if a hundred people out of ten thousand did not die in "unnatural ways". He noted that over half of the people on Marrs's list did not die mysteriously, but of natural causes, such as Secret Service agent [[Roy Kellerman]], who died of heart failure at age 69 in 1984, long after the Kennedy assassination, but is on Marrs's list as someone whose cause of death is "unknown". Posner also pointed out that many prominent witnesses and conspiracy researchers continue to live long lives.&lt;ref name="Posner2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Posner|title=Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Er9LPgAACAAJ|accessdate=July 8, 2013|year=2003|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3462-8|pages=489–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of evidence suppression, tampering, and fabrication ==
Allegations saying that the evidence against Oswald was either planted, forged, or tampered with has been a main argument among anybody who believe a conspiracy has taken place.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=984}}

=== Suppression of evidence ===

==== Ignored testimony ====
Some assassination researchers assert that witness statements indicating a conspiracy were ignored by the Warren Commission. In 1967, [[Josiah Thompson]] stated that the Commission ignored the testimonies of seven witnesses who saw gunsmoke right by the stockade fence on the grassy knoll, as well as an eighth witness who smelled gunpowder by the time the assassination occurred.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4xNdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MVoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1431%2C2577977 | title='3 Gunmen Involved in JFK's Slaying; 4 Bullets Fired' | date=November 16, 1967 | agency=UPI | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | newspaper=St. Joseph Gazette | location=St. Joseph, Missouri | pages=1A-2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Jim Marrs wrote that the Commission failed to ask for the testimonies of witnesses on the triple underpass whose statements pointed to a shooter on the grassy knoll.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=87}}

==== Confiscated film and photographs ====
Other researchers reported that witnesses who captured the assassination via photographs or film had their cameras confiscated by police or other authorities. Author Jim Marrs and documentary producer Nigel Turner both presented the account of [[Gordon Arnold]] who said that his film of the motorcade was taken by two policemen shortly after the assassination.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=88}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 2, "The Forces of Darkness"'', 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness, identified as Beverly Oliver, came forward in 1970 and said she was the "[[Babushka Lady]]" who is seen, in the [[Zapruder film]], filming the motorcade. She also said that after the assassination, she was contacted at work by two men who she thought "... were either FBI or Secret Service agents". According to Oliver, the men told her that they wanted to develop her film and return it to her within ten days, but they never did so.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=36}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==== Withheld documents ====
Richard Buyer and others have complained that many documents pertaining to the assassination have been withheld over the years, including documents from investigations made by the Warren Commission, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and the Church Committee.&lt;ref name="Buyer"/&gt; These documents individually included the President's autopsy records. Some documents still are not scheduled for release until 2029. Many documents were released during the mid-to-late 1990s by the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB) under the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992]]. However, some of the material released contains [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] sections. Tax return information, which identified employers and sources of income, has not yet been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/part03.htm|title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board|publisher=Assassination Records Review Board|date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of several secret documents related to the assassination, as well as the long period of secrecy, suggests to some the possibility of a cover-up. One historian noted, "There exists widespread suspicion about the government's disposition of the Kennedy assassination records stemming from the beliefs that Federal officials (1) have not made available all Government assassination records (even to the Warren Commission, Church Committee, House Assassination Committee) and (2) have heavily redacted the records released under FOIA in order to cover up sinister conspiracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/part03.htm|title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board, Chapter 1: The Problem of Secrecy and the Solution of the JFK Act|author=Athan G. Theoharis, Professor, Department of History, Marquette University|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ARRB, "All Warren Commission records, except those records that contain tax return information, are (now) available to the public with only minor redactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/part03.htm|title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board, Chapter 1: The Problem of Secrecy and the Solution of the JFK Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request filed by journalist [[Jefferson Morley]], the CIA stated in 2010 that it had over 1,100 documents in relation to the assassination, about 2,000 pages in total, that have not been released due to national security-related concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/11/the-kennedy-assassination-47-years-later-what-do-we-really-know/66722/| author=Jefferson Morley| title=The Kennedy Assassination: 47 Years Later, What Do We Really Know?| publisher=The Atlantic| date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tampering with evidence ===
Some researchers have alleged that various items of physical evidence have been tampered with, including the [[Single bullet theory|"single bullet"]] (also known as the "magic bullet" by some critics of official explanations), various bullet cartridges and fragments, the [[SS-100-X|presidential limousine]]'s windshield, the paper bag in which the Warren Commission said Oswald hid the rifle, the so-called "backyard" photos depicting Oswald holding the rifle, the Zapruder film, the photographs and radiographs obtained at Kennedy's autopsy, and the president's dead body itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Evidence_Tampering%3F Evidence Tampering]. Maryferrell.org. Retrieved on July 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photographs ====

==== Kennedy's body ====
In his 1981 book ''Best Evidence'', author [[David Lifton]] presented the thesis that President Kennedy's dead body had been altered between the Dallas hospital and the autopsy site at Bethesda for the purposes of creating erroneous conclusions about the number and direction of the shots.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]].

=== Fabrication of evidence ===

==== Murder weapon ====
The Warren Commission found that the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded Connally were fired from an [[John F. Kennedy assassination rifle|Italian 6.5mm Manlicher Carcano rifle owned by Oswald]].&lt;ref name="WCR-C1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Weitzman signed an affidavit the following day describing the weapon as a "7.65 Mauser bolt action equipped with a 4/18 scope, a thick leather brownish-black sling on it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfk.ci.dallas.tx.us/04/0433-001.gif|title=Seymour Weitzman's affidavit|date=November 23, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymfQdYoqKyEC&amp;pg=PA372&amp;lpg=PA372#v=onepage|author1=Ray La Fontaine |author2=Mary La Fontaine |title=Oswald Talked|publisher=Pelican|page=372 | isbn=978-1-56554-029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig claimed that he saw "7.65 Mauser" bullets stamped on the barrel of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Mark Lane interview of Roger Craig |year=1976 |title=Two Men in Dallas |publisher=Tapeworm Video Distributors |time= |id= |asin=B000NHDFBQ |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But when interviewed in 1968 by Barry Ernest, author of ''The Girl on the Stairs—The Search for a Missing Witness to the JFK Assassination'', Craig said: "I felt then and I still feel now that the weapon was a 7.65 German Mauser .... I was there. I saw it when it was first pulled from its hiding place, and I am not alone in describing it as a Mauser." So, in the videotaped interview he said he read Mauser on the rifle, and to Ernest he said that he felt it was a Mauser.&lt;ref&gt;The Girl on the Stairs by Barry Ernest (2013), p 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dallas District Attorney [[Henry Wade]] told the press that the weapon found in the Book Depository was a 7.65 Mauser, and the media reported this.&lt;ref name="WCR-C5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Addressing "speculation and rumors", the Warren Commission identified Weitzman as "the original source of the speculation that the rifle was a Mauser" and stated that "police laboratory technicians subsequently arrived and correctly identified the [murder] weapon as a 6.5 Italian rifle."&lt;ref name="WCR-A12"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

==== Bullets and cartridges ====
The Warren Commission determined that three bullets were fired at the presidential motorcade. One of the three bullets missed the vehicle entirely; another bullet hit President Kennedy and passed through his body before striking Governor Connally; and the third bullet was the fatal head shot to the President. Some claim that the bullet that passed through President Kennedy's body and hit Governor Connally — dubbed by critics of the Commission as the "magic bullet" — was missing too little mass to account for the total weight of bullet fragments later found by the doctors who operated on Connally at Parkland Hospital. Those making this claim included the governor's chief surgeon, Dr. Robert Shaw,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0061a.htm Testimony of Dr. Robert Shaw], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two of Kennedy's autopsy surgeons, Commander James Humes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0191b.htm Testimony of Commander James Humes], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 2, pp. 374–376.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lt. Colonel Pierre Finck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0195b.htm Testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Finck], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 2, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his book ''Six Seconds in Dallas'', author Josiah Thompson took issue with this claim. Thompson added up the weight of the bullet fragments listed in the doctor reports and concluded that their total weight "could" have been less than the mass missing from the bullet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/wound5.txt |title=Josiah Thompson, Six Seconds in Dallas, pages 147–151 |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Connally's death in 1993, forensic pathologist Dr. [[Cyril Wecht]] and the [[Assassination Archives and Research Center]] petitioned [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] to recover the remaining bullet fragments from Connally's body, contending that the fragments would disprove the Warren Commission's [[single-bullet theory|single-bullet]], single-gunman conclusion. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] replied that it "... would have [had] no legal authority to recover the fragments unless Connally's family gave [it] permission [to do so]." Connally's family refused permission.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew P. Smith, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', A-5,  June 19, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of multiple gunmen ==
[[File:Dealey Plaza 2003.jpg|thumb|[[Dealey Plaza]] in 2003.]]
The Warren Commission concluded that "three shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository in a time period ranging from approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds."&lt;ref name="WCR3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1964 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Chapter 3: The Shots from the Texas School Book Depository |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some assassination researchers, including Anthony Summers, dispute the Commission's findings. They point to evidence that brings into question the number of shots fired, the origin of the shots, and Oswald's ability to accurately fire three shots in such a short amount of time. These researchers suggest that multiple gunmen were involved.{{sfn|Summers|2013|pp=31-}}

=== Number of shots ===
Based on the "consensus among the witnesses at the scene" and "in particular the three spent cartridges", the Warren Commission determined that "the preponderance of the evidence indicated that three shots were fired".&lt;ref name="WCR3"/&gt; In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that there were four shots, one coming from the grassy knoll.&lt;ref name="HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalarch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/|title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives|publisher=United States National Archives|year=1979|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warren Commission, and later the House Select Committee on Assassinations, concluded that one of the shots hit President Kennedy in "the back of his neck", exited his throat, and struck Governor Connally in the back, exited the Governor's chest, shattered his right wrist, and implanted itself in his left thigh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0022a.htm Warren Report], chapter 1, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion became known as the "[[single bullet theory]]".{{sfn|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section A|1979|p=44}}

[[Mary Moorman]] said in a TV interview that immediately after the assassination, there were either three or four shots close together, that shots were still being fired after the fatal head shot, and that she was in the line of fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklancer.com/moorman_essay/moorman_essay_4.html JFK Lancer], ABC/WFAA interview of Mary Moorman filmed late in the afternoon of 11/22/63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Josiah Thompson]] concluded from a close study of the Zapruder film and other forensic evidence, corroborated by the eyewitnesses, that four shots were fired in Dealey Plaza, with one wounding Connally and three hitting Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

On the day of the assassination, [[Nellie Connally]] was seated in the presidential car next to Governor Connally, who was her husband. In her book ''From Love Field: Our Final Hours'', she said she believed that her husband was hit by a bullet separate from the two that hit Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5309638.stm Nellie Connally's statement] bbc.co.uk: September 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of the shots ===
[[File:JFK Wooden Fence.jpg|thumb|The wooden fence on the grassy knoll, where many conspiracy theorists believe another gunman stood.]]
The Warren Commission concluded that all of the shots fired at President Kennedy came from the sixth-floor window at the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository. The Commission based its conclusion on the "cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic experts and medical authorities", including onsite testing, as well as analysis of films and photographs conducted by the FBI and the US Secret Service.&lt;ref name="WCR3"/&gt;

In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations agreed to publish a report from Warren Commission critic [[Robert Groden]], in which he named "nearly [two] dozen suspected firing points in Dealey Plaza".&lt;ref name="HCSA-VI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=957 |volume=VI |year=1979 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=306–308 |ref={{harvid|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume VI|1979}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites included multiple locations in or on the roof of the Texas School Book Depository, the Dal-Tex Building, the Dallas County Records Building, the triple overpass, a storm drain located along the north curb of Elm Street, and the Grassy Knoll.&lt;ref name="HCSA-VI"/&gt; Josiah Thompson concluded that the shots fired at the motorcade came from three locations: the Texas School Book Depository, the Grassy Knoll, and the Dal-Tex Building.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

==== Testimony of eyewitnesses ====
According to some assassination researchers, the grassy knoll was identified by most witnesses as the area from where shots were fired.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=88}}&lt;ref name="Feldman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harold Feldman |date=March 1965 |title=Fifty-one Witnesses: The Grassy Knoll |trans-title= |journal=The Minority of One |volume=7 |series=64 |issue=3 |pages=16–25 |at= |chapter= |publisher=Menachem Arnoni |editor1-first=Menachem |editor1-last=Arnoni |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |url=http://spot.acorn.net/jfkplace/09/fp.back_issues/12th_Issue/51_wits.html |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 1965, Harold Feldman wrote that there were 121 witnesses to the assassination listed in the Warren Report, 51 of whom indicated that the shots that killed Kennedy came from the grassy knoll, while 32 said the shots originated from the Texas School Book Depository.&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt; In 1967, Josiah Thompson examined the statements of 64 witnesses and concluded that 33 of them thought that the shots emanated from the grassy knoll.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=847}}

In 1966, ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine credited Feldman with "advanc[ing] the theory that there were two assassins: one on the grassy knoll and one in the Book Depository".&lt;ref name="Esquire 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1966|title=A Primer of Assassination Theories: The Whole Spectrum of Doubt, from the Warren Commissioners to Ousman Ba|trans-title=|journal=Esquire|series=|pages=205 ff|at=|chapter=|id=|isbn=|issn=|oclc=|pmid=|pmc=|bibcode=|url=http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/conspiracy_theories/Primer/Primer_of_assassination_theories.html|laysource=|laysummary=|laydate=|quote=|ref=|separator=|postscript=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214235845/http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/Conspiracy_theories/Primer/Primer_of_assassination_theories.html|archivedate=February 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;!-- Scan of original article found here: http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/E%20Disk/Esquire%20Magazine/Item%2003.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Marrs also wrote that the weight of evidence suggested shots came from both the grassy knoll and the Texas School Book Depository.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=88}}

[[Lee Bowers]] operated a railroad tower that overlooked the parking lot on the north side of the grassy knoll. He reported that he saw two men behind the grassy knoll's stockyard fence before the shooting took place. The men did not appear to be acting together or doing anything suspicious. After the shooting, Bowers said that one of the men remained behind the fence and lost track of the second man whose clothing blended into the foliage. When interviewed by Mark Lane, Bowers noted that he saw something that attracted his attention, either a flash of light or smoke from the knoll, allowing him to believe "something out of the ordinary" had occurred there. Bowers told Lane that he heard three shots, the last two in quick succession. He stated that there was no way they could have been fired from the same exact rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Lee Bowers  |title=Rush to Judgment / The Plot to Kill JFK: Rush to Judgment |url= |medium= movie / videotape |publisher=Judgment Films / Mpi Home Video |date=August 31, 1994 |origyear=1967|isbn=9781556071461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers later purportedly said to his supervisor, Olan Degaugh, that he saw a man in the parking lot throw what looked like a rifle into one the cars.&lt;ref&gt;Matrix for Assassination: The JFK Conspiracy By Richard Gilbride (2009), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in that same 1966 interview, Bowers clarified that the two men he saw were standing in the opening between the pergola and the fence, and that "no one" was behind the fence once the shots were fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Myers |first=Dale K. |title=The Testimony of Lee Bowers, Jr|url=http://www.jfkfiles.com/jfk/html/badgeman_4.htm|work=Secrets of a Homicide: Badge Man|publisher=Oak Cliff Press|accessdate=November 17, 2014|year=2008|authorlink=Dale K.

He viewed the presidential motorcade from the Terminal Annex Building's roof. In an interview with Mark Lane, Price said that he believed the shots came from "just behind the picket fence where it joins the [triple] underpass".{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=39}}

==== Physical evidence ====
Several conspiracy theories posit that at least one shooter was located in the [[Dal-Tex Building]], located across the street from the [[Texas School Book Depository]].&lt;ref name="Esquire 1967"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1967|title=A Second Primer of Assassination Theories|journal=Esquire|series=|pages=104 ff|at=|chapter=|id=|isbn=|issn=|oclc=|pmid=|pmc=|bibcode=|url=http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/conspiracy_theories/Second_Primer/Second_primer.html|laysource=|laysummary=|laydate=|quote=|ref=|separator=|postscript=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007101304/http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/conspiracy_theories/Second_Primer/Second_primer.html|archivedate=October 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[L.

Some assassination researchers claim that FBI photographs of the presidential limousine show a bullet hole in its windshield above the rear-view mirror, and a crack in the windshield itself. When Robert Groden, author of ''The Killing of a President'', asked for an explanation, the FBI responded that what Groden thought was a bullet hole "occurred prior to Dallas".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Groden ''The Killing of a President'' 1993, pp. 142–144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, James.

Whitaker said that the limousine's removed windshield had a through-and-through bullet hole from the front. He said that he was directed by one of Ford's vice presidents to use the windshield as a template to fabricate a new windshield for installation in the limousine. Whitaker also said he was told to destroy the old one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assassinationscience.com/golais.html|title=Review of Murder in Dealey Plaza from The Citizens' Voice|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Turner, Nigel.

==== Film and photographic evidence ====
Film and photographic evidence of the assassination have led viewers to different conclusions regarding the origin of the shots. When the fatal shot was fired, the President's head and upper torso moved backwards — indicating, to many observers, a shot from the right front. Sherry Gutierrez, a certified crime scene and bloodstain pattern analyst, concluded that "the [fatal] head injury to President Kennedy was the result of a single gunshot fired from the right front of the President."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiester|first=Sherry Pool Gutierrez|title=What the Blood Tells Us|url=http://www.kenrahn.com/Marsh/Ballistics/BloodEvidence.html|publisher=KenRahn.Com (originally published by "The Kennedy Assassination Chronicles")|accessdate=April 22, 2014|date=Winter 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Chambers believes that the fatal head shot is consistent with a high velocity (approx. 1,200&amp;nbsp;m/s; 4,000&amp;nbsp;ft/sec) rifle rather than the medium-velocity (600&amp;nbsp;m/s; 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft/sec) Mannlicher–Carcano.&lt;ref&gt;G Paul Chambers.

==== Acoustical evidence ====
According to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, a [[John F. Kennedy assassination Dictabelt recording|Dictabelt recording of the Dallas Police Department radio dispatch transmissions from the day of the assassination]] was analyzed to "resolve questions concerning the number, timing, and origin of the shots fired in Dealey Plaza".&lt;ref name="HCSA-IB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=66 |chapter=I.B. |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1b.html |ref={{harvid|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section B|1979}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that the source of the recording was from an open microphone on the motorcycle of H.B. McLain escorting the motorcade{{sfn|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section B|1979|p=78}} and that "the scientific acoustical evidence established a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F. Kennedy."{{sfn|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section B|1979|p=93}}

The acoustical analysis firm hired by the Committee recommended that they conduct an acoustical reconstruction of the assassination in Dealey Plaza so they could determine if any of the six impulse patterns on the dispatch tape were fired either from the Texas School Book Depository or from the grassy knoll. The reconstruction entailed firing from two locations in Dealey Plaza — the depository and the knoll—at particular target locations and recording the sounds through various microphones. The purpose for this was to determine if the sequences of impulses recorded during the reconstruction would match any of those within the dispatch tape. If they showed a positive result, then it would be possible to figure out if the impulse patterns on the dispatch tape were caused by shots fired from the depository and the knoll.&lt;ref name="history-matters.com"&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0057a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, at the behest of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, members of the Dallas Police Pistol Team participated in an acoustical reconstruction in which they would fire rifles and pistols from any of the locations selected by the researchers. During this reconstruction, the Dallas Police marksmen had no difficulty in hitting the targets. The Committee's firearms experts "... testified that given the distance and angle from the sixth floor window to the location of the President's limousine, it would have been easier to use the open iron sights." The Warren Commission tests were carried out on assuming that Oswald, whom they and the Committee concluded fired the shots, had used the telescopic sight.&lt;ref name="history-matters.com"/&gt;

An article in ''[[Science &amp; Justice]]'', a quarterly publication of Britain's Forensic Science Society, found there was a 96% certainty, based on analysis of audio recordings made during the assassination, that a shot was fired from the Grassy Knoll in front of and to the right of the President's limousine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/JFK/bbcgrassy.htm| author=George Lardner Jr.| title=Study Backs Theory of 'Grassy Knoll': New Report Says Second Gunman Fired at Kennedy|work=The Washington Post| date=March 26, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mirror of missing story"&gt;{{cite news|title=mirror of missing story|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A56560-2001Mar25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,103958,00.html| author=Frank Pellegrini| title=The Grassy Knoll Is Back|work=Time Magazine| date=March 26, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billings, ''The Plot to Kill the President'', Times Books, 1981, p. 103. {{ISBN|978-0-8129-0929-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has repeatedly stated that he was not yet in Dealey Plaza once the assassination occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Jaynes, ''The Scene of the Crime'', [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/jaynes/mclain.htm Afterward].&lt;/ref&gt; McLain asked the Committee, {{"'}}If it was my radio on my motorcycle, why did it not record the revving up at high speed plus my siren when we immediately took off for Parkland Hospital?{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0261b.htm Separate Views of Hons.

In 1982, a panel of 12 scientists appointed by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], including Nobel laureates [[Norman Ramsey]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], unanimously concluded that the acoustic evidence submitted to the HSCA was "seriously flawed", was recorded after the President was shot, and did not indicate any additional gunshots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10264 |title=Report of the Committee on Ballistic Acoustics |publisher=Nap.edu |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their conclusions were later published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Reexamination of Acoustic Evidence in the Kennedy Assassination | author=Committee on Ballistic Acoustics, National Research Council | journal=Science |date=October 1982 | volume=218 | issue=8 | pages=127–133 | doi=10.1126/science.6750789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 article in ''[[Science &amp; Justice]]'',  D.B. Thomas wrote that the NAS investigation was itself flawed. He concluded that with a 96.3% certainty, there were at least two gunmen firing at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B.

Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Linsker R., Garwin R.L., Chernoff H., Horowitz P., Ramsey N.F., [http://jfk-records.com/ScienceAndJustice_45%284%29_207-226%282005%29.pdf "Synchronization of the acoustic evidence in the assassination of President Kennedy"].

==== Medical evidence ====
Some researchers have pointed to the large number of doctors and nurses at Parkland hospital who reported that a major portion of the back of the President's head may have been blown out, which strongly suggests that he was hit from the front. {{sfn|Summers|2013|pp=31-}}{{sfn|Marrs|1989|pp=55–89}}

Some critics skeptical of the official "[[single bullet theory]]" have stated that the bullet's trajectory, which hit Kennedy above the right shoulder blade and passed through his neck (according to the autopsy), would have had to change course to pass through Connally's rib cage and fracture his wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hluBF0hAyvIC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;sqi=2#v=onepage&amp;q=kennedy%20fbi%20three%20shots%20five%20seconds|author1=Michael Newton |author2=John L.

=== Oswald's marksmanship ===
The Warren Commission examined the capabilities of the Carcano rifle and ammunition, as well as Oswald's military training and post-military experience, and determined that Oswald had the ability to fire three shots within a time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.&lt;ref name="WCR4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their report, an army specialist using Oswald's rifle was able to duplicate the feat and even improved on the time. The report also states that the Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch test fired Oswald's rifle 47 times and found that it was "quite accurate", comparing it to the accuracy of an [[M14 rifle]]. Also contained in the Commission report is testimony by [[Marine Corps]] Major Eugene Anderson confirming that Oswald's military records show that he qualified as "[[sharpshooter]]" in 1956.

According to official [[Marine Corps]] records, Oswald was tested in shooting in December 1956, scoring 212 (slightly above the minimum for qualification as a sharpshooter—the intermediate category), but in May 1959, he scored 191 (earning the lower designation of marksman).&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Report, Chapter 4: Oswald's Marine Training, [https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html#marine]. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest marksmanship category in the Marine Corps is 'Expert' (220).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/marine-corps-weapons-qualification-course.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Oswald's confirmed marksmanship in the USMC, conspiracy theorists like Walt Brown and authors such as [[Richard H. Popkin]] contend that Oswald was a notoriously poor shot, that his rifle was inaccurate, and that no reconstruction of the event has ever been able to duplicate his ability to fire three shots within the time frame given by the Warren Commission.&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Aaronovitch|title=Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t7lC3nmFq8C&amp;pg=PT107|accessdate=March 21, 2012|date=February 4, 2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-59448-895-5|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=xxxviii}}

=== Role of Oswald ===
The Warren Commission and other federal investigations ruled that Oswald either acted alone or conspired with others in the assassination, citing his actions in the years leading up to the event. Evidence of Oswald's pro-communist and radical tendencies include his defection to Russia, the New Orleans branch of the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]] he had organized, and also various public and private statements made by him espousing Marxism and other leftist ideologies. Others have argued that his behavior was in fact a carefully-planned ruse as part of an effort by U.S. intelligence agencies to infiltrate subversive groups and conduct counter-intelligence operations in communist countries, and that his role in the assassination was that of either an agent or an informant of the government trying to expose the plot behind the assassination.&lt;ref name="WCReport_0342b p. 660"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0342b.htm Speculations and Rumors: Oswald and U.S. Government Agencies], Warren Commission Report, Appendix XII, p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Broderick|Miller|2008|pp=206–207}}{{sfn|Marrs|1989|pp=189–196, 226–235}}&lt;ref name="Goldman"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Magazines%20And%20Articles/Newsweek%2004-28-75/Item%2001.pdf | title=Dallas: New Questions and Answers | date=April 28, 1975 | accessdate=January 3, 2013 | author=Peter Goldman | author2=John J. Lindsay | newspaper=Newsweek | location=New York | page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswald himself claimed to be innocent, denying all charges and even declaring to reporters that he was "just a [[Fall guy|patsy]]". He also insisted that the photos of him holding a rifle had been faked, an assertion contradicted by statements made by his wife, Marina, and the analysis of photographic experts such as Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt of the FBI.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Oswald's role as FBI informant was investigated by Lee Rankin and others of the Warren Commission, but their findings were inconclusive. Several FBI employees had made statements indicating that Oswald was indeed a paid informant, but the commission was nonetheless unable to verify the veracity of those claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=60439#relPageId=3&amp;tab=page], J.

Gordon Shanklin, his supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0113a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Destruction_of_the_Oswald_Note Destruction of the Oswald Note], Mary Ferrell Fountation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summers|first=Anthony|title=Not in Your Lifetime|year=2013|publisher=Open Road|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4804-3548-3|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers suggest that Oswald served as an active agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, often pointing to how he attempted to defect to Russia but was, however, able to return without difficulty (even receiving a repatriation loan from the State Department&lt;ref&gt;The Warren Report, Appendix 8, p. 712, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0368b.htm Biography of Lee Harvey Oswald]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acorn.net/jfkplace/03/JA/DR/.dr19.html Investigation of Assassination of President John F.

A former roommate of Oswald, James Botelho (who would later become a California judge) stated in an interview with [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] that he believed Oswald was involved in an intelligence assignment in Russia,{{sfn|Marrs|1989|pp=110–111}}{{sfn|Douglass|2010|p=40}} although Botelho did not mention any of those suspicions in his testimony to the Warren Commission years earlier.

=== Bernard Weissman ===
[[File:welcome mr kennedy to dallas small.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Advertisement in the November 22, 1963, ''Dallas Morning News'', placed by Bernard Weissman and three others.]]

According to the Warren Commission, the publication of a full-page, paid advertisement critical of Kennedy in the November 22, 1963, ''Dallas Morning News'', which was signed by "The American Fact-Finding Committee" and noted Bernard Weissman as its chairman, was investigated to determine whether any members of the group claiming responsibility for it were connected to Oswald or to the assassination.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=293–299}} The Commission stated that "The American Fact-Finding Committee" was a fictitious sponsoring organization and that there was no evidence linking the four men responsible for the genesis of the ad with either Oswald or Ruby, or to a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=293–299}}

Related to the advertisement, Mark Lane testified during the Warren Commission's hearings that an informant whom he refused to name told him that Weismann had met with Tippit and Ruby eight days before the assassination at Ruby's Carousel Club.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=293–299}} The Commission reported that they "found no evidence that such a meeting took place anywhere at any time"{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=298}} and that there was no "credible evidence that any of the three men knew each other".{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Lane later stated that he initially learned of the meeting through reporter Thayer Waldo of the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''.&lt;ref name="Playboy; February, 1967"&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 1967 |title=Playboy Interview: Mark Lane |url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Magazines%20And%20Articles/Playboy%20Interview%20of%20Mark%20Lane/Item%2001.pdf |journal=Playboy |location= |publisher= |pages=60–61 |accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lane, a "prominent Dallas figure" who frequented Ruby's Carousel Club told Waldo, and later Lane, that he observed the meeting of the three men at the club.&lt;ref name="Playboy; February, 1967"/&gt; He said, "I had promised the man he would not be involved; he was a leading Dallas citizen; he was married, and the stripper he was going with had become pregnant."&lt;ref name="Playboy; February, 1967"/&gt; Despite not having revealed to the Warren Commission that Waldo was his original source of the alleged meeting, Lane disputed their findings and complained that they failed to ask Waldo about it.&lt;ref name="Gavzer &amp; Moody"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gavzer |first1=Bernard |last2=Moody |first2=Sid |date=June 26, 1967 |title=Special Report; Who Really Killed President Kennedy |url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Garrison%20News%20Clippings/1967/67-06/67-06-105.pdf |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |location=San Francisco |page=41 |agency=AP |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hugh Aynesworth]], the source of the allegation whose identity Lane promised not to reveal was Carroll Jarnagin,&lt;ref name="Aynesworth"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aynesworth |first1=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Aynesworth |last2=Michaud |first2=Stephen G. |year=2003 |chapter=Bribery, Coercion and Opportunists in the "Big Easy" |title=JFK: Breaking the News |url= |location=Richardson, Texas |publisher=International Focus Press |page=231 |isbn=9780963910363}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Dallas attorney who had also claimed to have overheard a meeting between Oswald and Ruby.&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;{{cite news |last=Eaton |first=Leslie |date=February 19, 2008 |title=New Trove Opened in Kennedy Killing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/us/19dallas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aynesworth wrote: "Several people in Dallas were well aware of Jarnagin's tale, and that he later admitted making it all up."&lt;ref name="Aynesworth"/&gt;

=== Unnamed accomplice(s) in the murder of J. D. Tippit ===
The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald "killed Dallas Police Officer [[J. D. Tippit]] in an apparent attempt to escape."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=195}} The evidence that formed the basis for this conclusion was: "(1) two eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit and seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with revolver in hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw fire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge cases found near the scene of the shooting were fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of all other weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald's possession at the time of his arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald, and (4) Oswald's jacket was found along the path of flight taken by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=176}}

Some researchers have alleged that the murder of Officer Tippit was part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. Jim Marrs hypothesized that "the slaying of Officer J. D. Tippit may have played some part in [a] scheme to have Oswald killed, perhaps to eliminate co-conspirator Tippit or simply to anger Dallas police and cause itchy trigger fingers."{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=585}} Researcher James Douglass said that "... the killing of [Tippit] helped motivate the Dallas police to kill an armed Oswald in the Texas Theater, which would have disposed of the scapegoat before he could protest his being framed."{{sfn|Douglass|2010|p=287}} Harold Weisberg offered a simpler explanation: "Immediately, the [flimsy] police case [against Oswald] required a willingness to believe. This was proved by affixing to Oswald the opprobrious epithet of 'cop-killer.'"{{sfn|Douglass|2010|p=287}} [[Jim Garrison]] alleged that evidence was altered to frame Oswald, stating: "If Oswald was innocent of the Tippit murder the foundation of the government's case against him collapsed."&lt;ref name="Garrison"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garrison |first1=Jim |authorlink1=Jim Garrison |title=On the Trail of the Assassins: My Investigation and Prosecution of the Murder of President Kennedy |url=http://scribblguy.50megs.com/tippit.htm  |year=1988 |publisher=Sheridan Square Press |isbn=978-0-941781-02-2 |page=197 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics doubt that Tippit was killed by Oswald and assert he was shot by other conspirators.{{sfn|Perry|2003|p=391}}&lt;ref name="Bonokowski"/&gt; They allege discrepancies in witness testimony and physical evidence that they think call into question the Commission's conclusions regarding the murder of Tippit. According to Jim Marrs, Oswald's guilt in the assassination of Kennedy is placed in question by the presence of "a growing body of evidence to suggest that [he] did not kill Tippit".{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=340}} Others say that multiple men were directly involved in Tippit's killing. Conspiracy researcher [[Kenn Thomas]] has alleged that the Warren Commission omitted testimony and evidence that two men shot Tippit and that one left the scene in a car.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kenn |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-link=Kenn Thomas |title=Cyberculture Counterconspiracy: A Steamshovel Web Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBLhW_rNZcoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |volume=2 |year=2000 |publisher=The Book Tree |location=Escondido, California |isbn=978-1-58509-126-3 |page=63 |chapter=The Tippit Connection |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBLhW_rNZcoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage |ref={{harvid|Thomas|2000}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Alexander—the Dallas assistant district attorney who recommended that Oswald be charged with the Kennedy and Tippit murders—later became skeptical of the Warren Commission's version of the Tippit murder. He stated that the Commission's conclusions on Oswald's movements "don't add up", and that "certainly [Oswald] may have had accomplices."{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=108}}

According to [[Brian McKenna]]'s review of Henry Hurt's book, ''Reasonable Doubt'', Hurt reported that "Tippit may have been killed because he impregnated the wife of another man" and that Dallas police officers lied and altered evidence to set up Oswald to save Tippit's reputation.&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite news |title=JFK: A distinguished American journalist has joined the unofficial sleuths tracking the killers and those who covered up, from Montreal to Mexico City and back again |author=Brian McKenna |authorlink=Brian McKenna |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X6gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1623%2C5250251 |newspaper=The Gazette |location=Montreal |date=April 19, 1986 |page=B7 |accessdate=April 14, 2012 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Allegations regarding witness testimony and physical evidence ====
The Warren Commission identified Helen Markham and Domingo Benavides as two witnesses who actually saw the shooting.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|pp=166–167}} Conspiracy theorist [[Richard Belzer]] criticized the Commission for, in his description, "relying" on the testimony of Markham whom he described as "imaginative".&lt;ref name="Belzer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belzer |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Belzer |title=UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don't Have to Be Crazy to Believe |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yDrJa9-7irUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |year=2000 |publisher=Ballantine Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-345-42918-6 |chapter=Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak No Evil |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDrJa9-7irUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT50#v=onepage |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Marrs also took issue with Markham's testimony, stating that her "credibility ... was strained to the breaking point".{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=340}} Joseph Ball, senior counsel to the Commission, referred to Markham's testimony as "full of mistakes", characterizing her as an "utter screwball".{{sfn|Summers|2013|pp=104–105}} The Warren Commission addressed concerns regarding Markham's reliability as a witness and concluded: "However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham's testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of Tippit."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|pp=166–167}}

Domingo Benavides initially said that he did not think he could identify Tippit's assailant and was never asked to view a police lineup,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0231a.htm Testimony of Domingo Benavides], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, pp. 451–52.&lt;/ref&gt; even though he was the person closest to the killing.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=341}} Benavides later testified that the killer resembled pictures he had seen of Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0231b.htm Testimony of Domingo Benavides], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; Other witnesses were taken to police lineups. However, critics have questioned these lineups as they consisted of people who looked very different from Oswald.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=341}}&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy'', Part 5, "The Witnesses", 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, witnesses who did not appear before the Commission identified an assailant who was not Oswald. Acquilla Clemons said she saw two men near Tippit's car just before the shooting.&lt;ref name="Turner, Nigel 1991"&gt;Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 4, "The Patsy"'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that after the shooting, she ran outside of her house and saw a man with a gun whom she described as "kind of heavy". She said he waved to the second man, urging him to "go on".{{sfn|Summers|2013|pp=105–106}} Frank Wright said he emerged from his home and observed the scene seconds after the shooting. He described a man standing by Tippit's body who had on a long coat and said the man ran to a parked car and drove away.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=342}}{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=106}}

Critics have questioned whether the cartridge cases recovered from the scene were the same as those that were subsequently entered into evidence. Two of the cases were recovered by witness Domingo Benavides and turned over to police officer J.&amp;nbsp;M. Poe. Poe told the FBI that he marked the shells with his own initials, "J.M.P." to identify them.&lt;ref name="Commission Exhibit No. 2011"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh24/html/WH_Vol24_0217a.htm Commission Exhibit No. 2011], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 24, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant Gerald Hill later testified to the Warren Commission that it was he who had ordered police officer Poe to mark the shells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0029a.htm Testimony of Gerald Lynn Hill], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 7, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poe's initials were not found on the shells produced by the FBI six months later.&lt;ref name="Commission Exhibit No. 2011"/&gt;{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=343}} Testifying before the Warren Commission, Poe said that although he recalled marking the cases, he "couldn't swear to it".{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=343}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0039a.htm Testimony of J.&amp;nbsp;M.

Sergeant Gerald Hill examined one of the shells and radioed the police dispatcher, saying: "The shell at the scene indicates that the suspect is armed with an automatic .38 rather than a pistol."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0451b.htm Commission Exhibit No. 1974], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Oswald was reportedly arrested carrying a ''non''-automatic .38 Special revolver.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=342}}{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=65}}

==== Allegations regarding timeline ====
The Warren Commission investigated Oswald's movements between the time of the assassination and the shooting of Tippit, to ascertain whether Oswald might have had an accomplice who helped him flee the Book Depository. The Commission concluded "... through the testimony of seven witnesses [that] Oswald was always alone."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=252}} According to their final report, Oswald was seen by his housekeeper leaving his rooming house shortly after 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm and had enough time to travel nine-tenths of a mile (1.4&amp;nbsp;km) to the scene where Tippit was killed at 1:16&amp;nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Some Warren Commission critics believe that Oswald did not have enough time to get from his house to the scene where Tippit was killed.{{sfn|Perry|2003|p=391}} The Commission's own test and estimation of Oswald's walking speed demonstrated that one of the longer routes to the Tippit shooting scene took 17 minutes and 45 seconds to walk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0222b.htm Testimony of William W.

Conspiracy researcher Robert Groden believes that Tippit's murder may have occurred earlier than the time given in the Warren Report. {{sfn|Groden|1995|pp=134–137}} He notes that the Commission established the time of the shooting as 1:16&amp;nbsp;pm from police tapes that logged Domingo Benavides's use of the radio in Tippit's car.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Witness Helen Markham stated in her affidavit to the Dallas Sheriff's department that Tippit was killed at "approximately 1:06 pm."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfk.ci.dallas.tx.us/04/0444-001.gif Affidavit of Helen Markham]&lt;/ref&gt; She later affirmed the time in testimony before the Warren Commission, saying: "I wouldn't be afraid to bet it wasn't 6 or 7 minutes after 1."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0157b.htm Testimony of Mrs. Helen Markham], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Groden|1995|p=136}} She initially told the FBI that the shooting occurred "possibly around 1:30&amp;nbsp;pm."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10406&amp;relPageId=82 Commission Document 5], FBI Gemberling Report of November 30, 1963, re: Oswald.&lt;/ref&gt; In an unpublished manuscript titled ''When They Kill a President'', Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig stated that when he heard the news that Tippit had been shot, he noted that the time was 1:06&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Roger.

Warren "Butch" Burroughs, who ran the concession stand at the [[Texas Theater]] where Oswald was arrested, said that Oswald came into the theater between 1:00 and 1:07&amp;nbsp;pm; he also claimed he sold Oswald popcorn at 1:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.—the "official" time of Officer Tippit's murder.{{sfn|Douglass|2010|pp=290, 466}}&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nigel.

== Unidentified witnesses ==
[[File:Umbrella Man.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Following the assassination of President Kennedy the "umbrella man" can be seen sitting on the sidewalk next to the "dark complected man" on the right side of the photograph.]]
Some conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination have focused on witnesses to the assassination who have not been identified, or who have not identified themselves, despite the media attention that the Kennedy assassination has received.

=== Umbrella man ===
{{main|Umbrella Man (JFK assassination)}}
The so-called "umbrella man" was one of the closest bystanders to the president when he was first struck by a bullet. The "umbrella man" has become the subject of conspiracy theories after footage of the assassination showed him holding an open umbrella as the Kennedy motorcade passed, despite the fact that it was not raining at the time. One conspiracy theory, proposed by assassination researcher Robert Cutler, suggests that a dart with a paralyzing agent could have been fired from the umbrella, disabling Kennedy and making him a "sitting duck" for an assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/TUM.txt | title=The Umbrella System: Prelude to an Assassination |author1=Richard E. Sprague |author2=Robert Cutler | journal=Gallery Magazine |date=June 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1975, CIA weapons developer Charles Senseney told the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] that such an umbrella weapon was in the hands of the CIA in 1963.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB58/RNCBW25.pdf Testimony of Charles A. Senseney, Special Operations Division at Fort Detrick], "Unauthorized Storage of Toxic Agents", Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, pp. 159–178, September 18, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A more prevalent conspiracy theory holds that the umbrella could have been used to provide visual signals to hidden gunmen.&lt;ref name="Marrs, Jim 1989 pp. 29-33"&gt;Marrs, Jim. Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy, (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 1989), pp. 29–33. {{ISBN|0-88184-648-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Louie Steven Witt came forward and identified himself as the "umbrella man". Testifying before the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]], Witt stated he brought the umbrella to heckle Kennedy and protest the [[appeasement]] policies of the president's father, [[Joseph Kennedy]]. He added: "I think if the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' had a category for people who were at the wrong place at the wrong time, doing the wrong thing, I would be No. 1 in that position, without even a close runner-up."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130411021928/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xYE0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2esFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4213,2390518 The Miami News—Google News Archive Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have noted a number of inconsistencies with Witt's story, however, and do not believe him to be the true "umbrella man".{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=30}}

The "umbrella man" is the subject of a 2011 documentary short by [[Errol Morris]], for ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Umbrella Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000001183275/the-umbrella-man.html|accessdate=November 21, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 21, 2011|author=Errol Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark complected man ===
{{main|Dark complected man}}
An unidentified individual who is referred to by some conspiracy theorists as the "dark complected man" can be seen in several photographs, taken seconds after the assassination, sitting on the sidewalk next to the "umbrella man" on the north side of Elm Street. Louie Steven Witt, who identified himself as the "umbrella man", said he was unable to identify the other individual, whose dark complexion has led some conspiracy theorists to speculate Cuban government involvement, or Cuban exile involvement, in the assassination of Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Marrs, Jim 1989 pp. 29-33"/&gt;

=== Possible witnesses ===
Some conspiracy theories focus on individuals that it is claimed can be seen in photographs of the assassination. Both "badge man" and "black dog man" have been suggested as possible assassins of President Kennedy.

==== Badge man ====
{{Main|Badge Man}}
[[File:Badgeman.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Some conspiracy theorists believe that "badge man" could have fired the fatal shot that killed President Kennedy.]]
"Badge man" and "tin hat man" are figures on the grassy knoll who it is alleged can be seen in the [[Mary Moorman]] photo, taken approximately one-sixth of a second after President Kennedy was struck with the fatal head wound. The figures were first discovered by researchers Jack White and Gary Mack and are discussed in a 1988 documentary called ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'', where it is alleged a third figure can also be seen on the grassy knoll, possibly the eyewitness [[Gordon Arnold]]. The "badge man" figure—so called as he appears to be wearing a uniform similar to that worn by a policeman, with a badge prominent—helped fuel conspiracy theories linking Dallas Police officers, or someone [[police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]], to the assassination.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=88}}

==== Black dog man ====
{{Main|Black dog man}}
[[Image:Blackdogman.PNG|thumb|right|"Black Dog Man"]]
Another "figure" that has been the subject of conspiracy is the so-called "black dog man" figure who can be seen at the corner of a retaining wall in the Willis and Betzner photo of the assassination. In an interview, Marilyn Sitzman told Josiah Thompson that she saw a young black couple who were eating lunch and drinking Cokes on a bench behind the retaining wall and, therefore, it is possible that the "black dog man" figure is actually the black woman and her child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/organ3.htm|title="Smoke" on the Grassy Knoll in the Wake of the JFK Assassination|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the woman has never come forward to identify herself.

In ''[[The Killing of A President]]'', [[Robert Groden]] argues that the "black dog man" figure can be seen in a pyracantha bush in frame 413 of the Zapruder film. The [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] concluded that a head of an individual could be seen but that this individual was situated in front of, rather than behind the bushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0069a.htm|title=History Matters Archive—HSCA Appendix to Hearings—Volume VI, pg|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Miller argues that this individual is actually the eyewitness Emmett Hudson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklancer.com/miller/mysteryman.html|title=JFK Lancer|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiracy theorists consider four or five groups, alone or in combination, to be the primary suspects in the assassination of Kennedy: the [[CIA]],{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=xiv}}&lt;ref name="Meagher"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meagher |first1=Michael |last2=Gragg |first2=Larry D. |title=John F.

=== New Orleans conspiracy ===
{{Further|Trial of Clay Shaw|David Ferrie}}
Soon after the assassination of President Kennedy, Oswald's activities in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], during the spring and summer of 1963, came under scrutiny. Three days after the assassination, on November 25, 1963, New Orleans attorney [[Dean Andrews Jr.|Dean Andrews]] told the FBI that he received a telephone call from a man named [[Clay Bertrand]], on the day of the assassination, asking him to defend Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0379b.htm Commission Exhibit No. 1931], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 726.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh26/html/WH_Vol26_0370b.htm Commission Exhibit No. 3094], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 26, pp. 704–705.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews would later repeat this claim in testimony to the Warren Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh11/html/WC_Vol11_0171a.htm Testimony of Dean Andrews], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, pp. 331–334.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ciravolo.jpg|thumb|[[David Ferrie]] (second from left) with Lee Harvey Oswald (far right) in the New Orleans [[Civil Air Patrol]] in 1955.]]
Also, in late November 1963, an employee of New Orleans [[private investigator]] [[Guy Banister]] named [[Jack Martin (investigator)|Jack Martin]] began making accusations that fellow Banister employee [[David Ferrie]] was involved in the JFK assassination. Martin told police that Ferrie "was supposed to have been the getaway pilot in the assassination."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0058b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Ferrie had outlined plans to kill Kennedy and that Ferrie might have taught Oswald how to use a rifle with a telescopic sight. Martin claimed that Ferrie had known Oswald from their days in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol, and that he had seen a photograph, at Ferrie's home, of Oswald in a Civil Air Patrol group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=219 FBI Interview of Jack S. Martin], November 25, 1963 &amp; November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, pp. 217–18, 309–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrie denied any association with Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=288 FBI Interview of David Ferrie], November 25, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later discovered that Ferrie had attended [[Civil Air Patrol]] meetings in New Orleans in the 1950s that were also attended by a teenage Lee Harvey Oswald.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; In 1993, the [[PBS]] television program ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' obtained a photograph taken in 1955 (eight years before the assassination) showing Oswald and Ferrie at a [[Civil Air Patrol]] cookout with other C.A.P. cadets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/glimpse/ferrie.html PBS ''Frontline'' "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald"], broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Oswald's and Ferrie's association in the Civil Air Patrol in 1955 is relevant to their later possible association in 1963 is a subject of debate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt;&lt;ref name="Summers, Anthony 2013 pp. 284-285"&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]].

According to several witnesses, in 1963, both Ferrie and Banister were working for lawyer [[G. Wray Gill]] on behalf of Gill's client, New Orleans Mafia boss [[Carlos Marcello]], in an attempt to block Marcello's deportation to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0057a.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0066a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; On the afternoon of November 22, 1963—the day [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated and the day Marcello was acquitted in his deportation case—New Orleans private investigator [[Guy Banister]] and his employee, [[Jack Martin (investigator)|Jack Martin]], were drinking together at a local bar. On their return to Banister's office, the two men got into a heated argument. According to Martin, Banister said something to which Martin replied, "What are you going to do—kill me like you all did Kennedy?". Banister drew his .357 magnum revolver and [[pistol whip|pistol-whipped]] Martin several times. Martin, badly injured, went by ambulance to [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0067b.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, in the spring of 1963, Oswald had written to the [[New York City]] headquarters of the pro-Castro [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]], proposing to rent "a small office at my own expense for the purpose of forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0266b.htm Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 2], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; As the sole member of the New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Oswald ordered 1,000 leaflets with the heading, "Hands Off Cuba" from a local printer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0402a.htm FBI Report of Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities for Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, pp. 770, 773.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 1963, Oswald passed out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets in front of the [[International Trade Mart]] in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Open Road, 2013), pp. 247-. {{ISBN|978-1-4804-3548-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Oswald's leaflets had the address "544 Camp Street" hand-stamped on it, apparently by Oswald himself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0064a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was in the "Newman Building", which from October 1961 to February 1962 housed the [[Cuban Revolutionary Council]], a militant anti-Castro group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0064a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, pp. 123–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marrs, Jim.

Banister's office was involved in anti-Castro and private investigative activities in the New Orleans area. (A CIA file indicated that in September 1960, the CIA had considered "using Guy Banister Associates for the collection of foreign intelligence, but ultimately decided against it".)&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Marrs|Marrs, Jim]].

In the late 1970s, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) investigated the possible relationship of Oswald to Banister's office. While the committee was unable to interview [[Guy Banister]] (who died in 1964), the committee did interview his brother Ross Banister. Ross "told the committee that his brother had mentioned seeing Oswald hand out Fair Play for Cuba literature on one occasion. Ross theorized that Oswald had used the 544 Camp Street address on his literature to embarrass Guy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0066b.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guy Banister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, would later tell author [[Anthony Summers]] that she saw Oswald at Banister's office, and that he filled out one of Banister's "agent" application forms. She said, "Oswald came back a number of times. He seemed to be on familiar terms with Banister and with the office."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Open Road, 2013), p. 276-. {{ISBN|978-1-4804-3548-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated Roberts's claims and said that "because of contradictions in Roberts' statements to the committee and lack of independent corroboration of many of her statements, the reliability of her statements could not be determined."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0067a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 8, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy. Garrison's investigation led him to conclude that a group of [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] extremists, including David Ferrie and Guy Banister, were involved with elements of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Garrison would later claim that the motive for the assassination was anger over Kennedy's attempts to obtain a peace settlement in both Cuba and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Jim Garrison Interview"&gt;[http://www.jfklancer.com/Garrison2.html Jim Garrison Interview], ''Playboy'' magazine, Eric Norden, October 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Garrison|Garrison, Jim]].

''On The Trail of the Assassins'', (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), pp. 85–86. {{ISBN|0-941781-02-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison further believed that Shaw, Banister, and Ferrie conspired to set up Oswald as a patsy in the JFK assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Garrison|Garrison, Jim]]. ''On The Trail of the Assassins'', (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), pp. 26–27, 62, 70, 106–110, 250, 278, 289. {{ISBN|0-941781-02-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 1967, Garrison arrested and charged Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy. On January 29, 1969, Clay Shaw was brought to trial on these charges, and the jury found him not guilty.

In 2003, Judyth Vary Baker—whose employment records show that she worked at the [[Reily Foods Company|Reily Coffee Company]] in New Orleans at the same time Oswald did—appeared in an episode of the television documentary series, ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''.&lt;ref name="Turner, Nigel 2003"&gt;Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 8, "The Love Affair"'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Baker claimed that in 1963 she was recruited by Dr. [[Canute Michaelson]] to work with Dr. [[Alton Ochsner]] and Dr. [[Mary S. Sherman|Mary Sherman]] on a clandestine CIA project to develop a biological weapon that could be used to assassinate Fidel Castro. According to Baker, she and Oswald were hired by Reily in the spring of 1963 as a "cover" for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Judyth. ''Me and Lee'', (Walterville: Trine Day LLC, 2010), p. 150. {{ISBN|978-0-9799886-7-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker further claimed that she and Oswald began an affair, and that later Oswald told her about [[Merida, Yucatan|Merida]], Mexico—a city where he suggested they might begin their lives over again.&lt;ref name="Turner, Nigel 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doctormarysmonkey.com/jvb/index.htm JudythVaryBaker.com]&lt;/ref&gt; According to John McAdams, Baker presents a "classic case of pushing the limits of plausibility too far".&lt;ref name=McAdams&gt;{{cite book|last=McAdams|first=John|title=JFK Assassination Logic: How to Think About Claims of Conspiracy|year=2011|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9781597974899|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OJeNytAOZkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|authorlink=John C.

Reitzes of ''jfk-online.com.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, other researchers, including James Fetzer, have concluded that Baker's claims are credible.

=== CIA conspiracy ===
{{main|CIA Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory}}
Addressing speculation that Oswald was a CIA agent or had some relationship with the Agency, the Warren Commission stated in 1964 that their investigation "revealed no evidence that Oswald was ever employed [by the] CIA in any capacity."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 12|1964|pp=659-660}} The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported similarly in 1979 that "[t]here was no indication in Oswald's CIA file that he had ever had contact with the Agency" and concluded that the CIA was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=I.C. The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaeton Fonzi]], an investigator for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, wrote that investigators were pressured not to look into the relationship between [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and the CIA. He stated that CIA agent [[David Atlee Phillips]], using the pseudonym "Maurice Bishop", was involved with Oswald prior to the Kennedy assassination in connection with anti-Castro Cuban groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Investigation-Gaeton-Fonzi/dp/0980121353| author=Gaeton Fonzi| title=The Last Investigation| publisher=The Mary Ferrell Foundation| year=2008| ISBN=0-9801213-5-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, former U.S. Army [[Military intelligence|Intelligence]] officer and [[National Security Agency]] executive assistant [[John M. Newman]] published evidence that both the CIA and FBI deliberately tampered with their files on Lee Harvey Oswald both before and after the assassination. Furthermore, he found that both agencies withheld information that might have alerted authorities in Dallas that Oswald posed a potential threat to the President. Subsequently, Newman expressed a belief that CIA chief of counter-intelligence [[James Angleton]] was probably the key figure in the assassination. According to Newman, only Angleton "had the access, the authority, and the diabolically ingenious mind to manage this sophisticated plot." However, Newman surmised that the cover operation was not under James Angleton, but under [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]] (the former CIA director, and later Warren Commission member, who had been dismissed by Kennedy after the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]]).&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=John M. |authorlink=John M.

In 1977, the FBI released 40,000 files pertaining to the assassination of Kennedy, including an April 3, 1967 memorandum from Deputy Director [[Cartha DeLoach]] to Associate Director [[Clyde Tolson]] that was written less than a month after President Johnson learned from [[J.

=== Military-industrial complex ===
In the farewell speech given by U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] before he left office on January 17, 1961, warned the nation about the power of the military establishment and the arms industry. "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the [[military-industrial complex]]. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/17/132942244/ikes-warning-of-military-expansion-50-years-later| title=Ike's Warning Of Military Expansion, 50 Years Later| publisher=NPR| date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some conspiracy theorists have argued that Kennedy planned to end the involvement of the United States in Vietnam, and was therefore targeted by those who had an interest in sustained military conflict, including the Pentagon and defense contractors.{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=207}}

Former [[Texas Senator]] [[Ralph Yarborough]] in 1991 stated: "Had Kennedy lived, I think we would have had no Vietnam War, with all of its traumatic and divisive influences in America.  I think we would have escaped that."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Yarborough, interviewed in the documentary ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy'', Part 5, "The Witnesses"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author James Douglass, Kennedy was assassinated because he was turning away from the [[Cold War]] and seeking a negotiated peace with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=11206&amp;comments=1 |author=George M.

[[Oliver Stone]]'s film, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', explored the possibility that Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy involving the military-industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE5DC1230F933A15751C1A967958260| author=Vincent Canby| title=J.F.K.; When Everything Amounts to Nothing| work=The New York Times| date=December 20, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Fletcher Prouty]], Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Kennedy, and the person who inspired the character "Mr. X" in Stone's film, wrote that Kennedy's assassination was actually a [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55972-130-1| title=JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F.

=== Secret Service conspiracy ===
The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that it investigated "alleged Secret Service complicity in the assassination" and concluded that the Secret Service was not involved.&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"/&gt; However, the HSCA declared that "the Secret Service was deficient in the performance of its duties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0129a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its findings, the HSCA noted: (1) that President Kennedy had not received adequate protection in Dallas, (2) that the Secret Service possessed information that was not properly analyzed, investigated, or used by the Secret Service in connection with the President's trip to Dallas, and (3) that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade were inadequately prepared to protect the President from a sniper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0130a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 229-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The HSCA specifically noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No actions were taken by the agent in the right front seat of the presidential limousine [[Roy Kellerman]] to cover the President with his body, although it would have been consistent with Secret Service procedure for him to have done so. The primary function of the agent was to remain at all times in close proximity to the President in the event of such emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0132b.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 234-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some argue that the lack of Secret Service protection occurred because Kennedy himself had asked that the Secret Service make itself discreet during the Dallas visit.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|pp=29, 38}} However, Vince Palamara, who interviewed several Secret Service agents assigned to the Kennedy detail, disputes this. Palamara reports that Secret Service driver Sam Kinney told him that requests—such as removing the bubble top from the limousine in Dallas, not having agents positioned beside the limousine's rear bumper, and reducing the number of Dallas police motorcycle outriders near the limousine's rear bumper—were not made by Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/neigh_south/19980125bjfk5.asp| author=Mary Anne Lewis| title=JFK's death is often focus of his research| publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| date=January 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palamara, Vince.

[[Colin McLaren]], a former Australian police detective sergeant, was inspired by Bonar Menninger's ''[[Mortal Error]]'',&lt;ref name=TSGKd&gt;''To Howard Donohue, a man who epitomised the very reason we demand dedicated and precise forensic science at the forefront of unravelling complex crime.

McLaren, Colin (October 23, 2013). JFK: The Smoking Gun (Kindle Locations 18-20). Hachette Australia. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; to approach the assassination of Kennedy as a [[cold case]] investigation,&lt;ref&gt;''I carried the book in my cabin luggage when I winged my way homeward. By the time I arrived in Australia I had read it again and was charged with a desire to undertake a cold-case forensic study into the killing of the 35th President of the United States.'' McLaren, Colin (October 23, 2013). JFK: The Smoking Gun (Kindle Locations 225-227). Hachette Australia.

After more than four years of research,&lt;ref&gt;http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/09/02/author-discusses-jfk-the-smoking-gun/&lt;/ref&gt; he published a book titled ''JFK: The Smoking Gun'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-7336-3044-6 |title=JFK: The Smoking Gun |last=McLaren |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin McLaren }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was accompanied by a documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Shooting_holes_in_theory_that_a_Secret_Service_agent_killed_President_Kennedy.html |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |title=Shooting holes in theory that a Secret Service agent killed President Kennedy |first=Peter |last=Mucha |newspaper=philly.com |publisher=Interstate General Media |date=November 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an investigator, McLaren focuses on the existing witness testimony, including testimony from people present at [[John F.

Here was a great ballistics theory but with no supportive evidence or, as detectives say, 'all meat and no potatoes'—no forensic analysis of the testimonies to support his premise.'' McLaren, Colin (October 23, 2013). JFK: The Smoking Gun (Kindle Locations 219-225). Hachette Australia. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than just dismiss the ballistics tests carried out for the Warren Commission as inexpert, their testimony to the commission, including their qualifications, is quoted and critiqued,&lt;ref&gt;''Dr Light went on to say that Olivier's theory relating to JFK's head wound and Connally's wrist wound was 'barely conceivable'.'' McLaren, Colin (October 23, 2013). JFK: The Smoking Gun (Kindle Locations 3036-3037). Hachette Australia. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and also any cross-examination. He quotes many more witnesses than Donahue or Menninger as having believed that shots were fired at ground level, and observes a pattern of concealment of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Leading a witness is prone to interjection from the judge. Strangely, this was not the case at the Warren Commission, where leading questions were commonplace.'' McLaren, Colin (October 23, 2013). JFK: The Smoking Gun (Kindle Locations 3072-3073). Hachette Australia. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion, like those of Reppert and of Menninger, is that Donahue is correct in both the broad theory and the details.

Questions regarding the forthrightness of the Secret Service increased in the 1990s when the [[Assassination Records Review Board]]—which was created when Congress passed the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992|JFK Records Act]]—requested access to Secret Service records. The Review Board was told by the Secret Service that in January 1995, in violation of the JFK Records Act, the Secret Service destroyed protective survey reports that covered JFK's trips from September 24 through November 8, 1963.&lt;ref name="ARRB-ES"&gt;{{cite book |author=Assassination Records Review Board |authorlink1=Assassination Records Review Board |title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/review-board/report/arrb-final-report.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |date=September 30, 1998 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Executive Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, James.

=== Cuban exiles ===
The House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that anti-Castro Cuban groups, as groups, were not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved".&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"/&gt;

With the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] that brought Fidel Castro to power, many Cubans left Cuba to live in the United States. Many of these exiles hoped to overthrow Castro and return to Cuba. Their hopes were dashed with the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, and many blamed President Kennedy for the failure.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=205}}

The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that some militant Cuban exiles might have participated in Kennedy's murder. These exiles worked closely with CIA operatives in violent activities against Castro's Cuba. In 1979, the committee reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Kennedy's popularity among the Cuban exiles had plunged deeply by 1963. Their bitterness is illustrated in a tape recording of a meeting of anti-Castro Cubans and right-wing Americans in the Dallas suburb of Farmer's Branch on October 1, 1963.&lt;ref name="aarclibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0081b.htm Findings of the House Select Committee on Assassinations], HSCA Final Report, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author [[Joan Didion]] explored the Miami anti-Castro Cuban theory in her 1987 book ''Miami''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/24/nnp/miami.html|title=James Chace, "Betrayals and Obsession", NY Times, October 25, 1987, on Joan Didion's book MIAMI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joan Didion, "MIAMI", New York, Simon &amp; Schuster, 238pp. 1987&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed Marita Lorenz's testimony regarding Guillermo Novo, a Cuban exile who was involved in shooting a bazooka at the U.N. building from the East River during a speech by [[Che Guevara]]. Allegedly, Novo was affiliated with Lee Harvey Oswald and Frank Sturgis and carried weapons with them to a hotel in Dallas just prior to the assassination. These claims, though put forth to the House Assassinations Committee by Lorenz, have never been substantiated. [[Don DeLillo]] dramatized the Cuban theory in his 1988 novel ''[[Libra (novel)|Libra]]''.

=== Organized crime conspiracy ===
The House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the national syndicate of organized crime, as a group, was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved".&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"/&gt; [[G. Robert Blakey|Robert Blakey]], who was chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, would later conclude in his book, ''The Plot to Kill the President'', that [[New Orleans]] Mafia boss [[Carlos Marcello]] was likely part of a Mafia conspiracy behind the assassination, and that the Mafia had the means and the opportunity required to carry it out.&lt;ref&gt;Blakey, Robert (1981). The Plot to Kill the President. New York: Times Books. {{ISBN|0812909291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/biographies/oswald/interview-g-robert-blakey/ PBS ''Frontline'' "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald"], Interview: G.

Government documents have revealed that some members of the Mafia worked with the Central Intelligence Agency on assassination attempts against [[Cuba]]n leader [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/leipzig/texts2/cnn03077.htm CIA offered money to Mafia].

When Maheu contacted Roselli, Maheu hid the fact that he was sent by the CIA, instead portraying himself as an advocate for international corporations. He offered to pay $150,000 to have Castro killed, but Roselli declined any pay. Roselli introduced Maheu to two men he referred to as "Sam Gold" and "Joe".

In his memoir, ''Bound by Honor'', [[Bill Bonanno]], son of New York Mafia boss [[Joseph Bonanno]], disclosed that several Mafia families had long-standing ties with the anti-Castro Cubans through the Havana casinos operated by the Mafia before the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Many Cuban exiles and Mafia bosses disliked President Kennedy, blaming him for the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=205-}} They also disliked his brother, then Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]], who had conducted an unprecedented legal assault on organized crime.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=224-}}{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=208}} This was especially provocative because several Mafia "families" had allegedly worked with JFK's father, [[Joseph Kennedy]], to get JFK elected.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Ronald.

In his book, ''Contract on America'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Scheim|title=Contract on America|publisher=Shapolsky Publishers|year=1988|isbn=0-933503-30-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Scheim provided evidence that Mafia leaders [[Carlos Marcello]], [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], and [[Jimmy Hoffa]] ordered the assassination of President Kennedy. Scheim cited in particular a 25-fold increase in the number of out-of-state telephone calls from Jack Ruby to associates of these crime bosses in the months before the assassination, and to an attempted confession by Jack Ruby while in prison. [[David E. Kaiser]] has also suggested mob involvement in his book, ''The Road to Dallas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/KAIASS.html|author=David Kaiser|title=The Road to Dallas|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative reporter [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] concluded that Fidel Castro worked with organized crime figures to arrange the JFK assassination. In his book ''Peace, War, and Politics'', Anderson claimed that Mafia member Johnny Roselli gave him extensive details of the plot. Anderson said that although he was never able to independently confirm Roselli's entire story, many of Roselli's details checked out. Anderson said that Oswald may have played a role in the assassination, but that more than one gunman was involved. Johnny Roselli, as previously noted, had worked with the CIA on assassination attempts against Castro.

The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] program ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' presented additional claims of organized crime involvement.&lt;ref&gt;"The Men Who Killed Kennedy: The Definitive Account of American History's Most Controversial Mystery".  History Channel, 1988, 1991, 1995. This information appears in part 2, "The Forces of Darkness" under the sections titled, "The Contract" and "Foreign Assassins".&lt;/ref&gt; Christian David was a [[Corsican Mafia]] member interviewed in prison. He said that he was offered the assassination contract on President Kennedy, but that he did not accept it. However, he said that he knew the men who did accept the contract. According to David, there were three shooters. He provided the name of one—[[Lucien Sarti]]. David said that since the other two shooters were still alive, it would break a code of conduct for him to identify them. When asked what the shooters were wearing, David noted their ''modus operandi'' was to dress in costumes such as official uniforms. Much of Christian David's testimony was confirmed by former Corsican member Michelle Nicole, who was part of the [[DEA]] witness protection program.

The book ''Ultimate Sacrifice'', by [[Lamar Waldron]] and [[Thom Hartmann]], attempted to synthesize these theories with new evidence. The authors argued that government officials felt obliged to help the assassins cover up the truth because the assassination conspiracy had direct ties to American government plots to assassinate Castro. Outraged at Robert Kennedy's attack on organized crime, mob leaders had President Kennedy killed to remove Robert from power. A government investigation of the plot was thwarted, the authors allege, because it would have revealed embarrassing evidence of American government involvement with organized crime in plots to kill Castro.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Sacrifice: John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the Murder of JFK'' (2005), by Lamar Waldron, with Thom Hartmann; Carroll &amp; Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1441-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that JFK was seriously considering dropping Johnson from the ticket in favor of NC Governor [[Terry Sanford]] should Kennedy run in 1964 has been cited as a possible motive for Johnson's complicity in the assassination. In 1968, Kennedy's personal secretary [[Evelyn Lincoln]] wrote in her book, "''Kennedy and Johnson''" that President Kennedy had told her that Lyndon B. Johnson would be replaced as Vice President of the United States. That conversation took place on November 19, 1963, just three days before the assassination of President Kennedy and was recorded that evening in her diary and reads as follows:

{{quote|As Mr. Kennedy sat in the rocker in my office, his head resting on its back he placed his left leg across his right knee. He rocked slightly as he talked. In a slow pensive voice he said to me, 'You know if I am re-elected in sixty-four, I am going to spend more and more time toward making government service an honorable career. I would like to tailor the executive and legislative branches of government so that they can keep up with the tremendous strides and progress being made in other fields.' 'I am going to advocate changing some of the outmoded rules and regulations in the Congress, such as the seniority rule. To do this I will need as a running mate in sixty-four a man who believes as I do.' Mrs. Lincoln went on to write "I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary. Now I asked, 'Who is your choice as a running-mate?' 'He looked straight ahead, and without hesitating he replied, 'at this time I am thinking about Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina. But it will not be Lyndon.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lincoln|first1=Evelyn|title=Kennedy and Johnson|date=1968|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|page=205|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PR9CAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sanford|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2003, researcher Barr McClellan published the book ''Blood, Money &amp; Power''.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan, Barr, ''Blood, Money &amp; Power: How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K.'', Hannover House 2003. {{ISBN|0-9637846-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan claims that Johnson, motivated by the fear of being dropped from the Kennedy ticket in 1964 and the need to cover up various scandals, masterminded Kennedy's assassination with the help of his friend, [[Austin]] attorney [[Edward A. Clark]]. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper's nest likely belonged to Johnson's associate [[Malcolm "Mac" Wallace]], and that Mac Wallace was, therefore, on the sixth floor of the Depository at the time of the shooting. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates, including [[Clint Murchison, Sr.|Clint Murchison]] and [[H. L. Hunt]]. McClellan states that the assassination of Kennedy allowed the oil depletion allowance to be kept at 27.5 percent. It remained unchanged during the Johnson presidency. According to McClellan, this resulted in a saving of over $100 million to the American oil industry. McClellan's book subsequently became the subject of an episode of Nigel Turner's ongoing documentary television series, ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''. The episode, "The Guilty Men", drew angry condemnation from the Johnson family, Johnson's former aides, and former Presidents [[Gerald Ford]] (who was a member of the [[Warren Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Gerald R. (2007). A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission. The FlatSigned Press. {{ISBN|978-1-934304-02-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Jimmy Carter]] following its airing on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]. The History Channel assembled a committee of historians who concluded the accusations in the documentary were without merit, and The History Channel apologized to the Johnson family and agreed not to air the series in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Kutler|Kutler, Stanley I.]] [http://hnn.us/articles/why-history-channel-had-apologize-documentary-blamed-lbj-jfks-murder "Why the History Channel Had to Apologize for the Documentary that Blamed LBJ for JFK's Murder"].

[[Madeleine Brown]], who alleged she was the mistress of Johnson, also implicated him in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. In 1997, Brown said that Johnson, along with H. L. Hunt, had begun planning Kennedy's demise as early as 1960.

Historian [[Michael L.

=== Cuban government conspiracy ===
In its report, the Warren Commission stated that it had investigated "dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial contact between Oswald and agents of the Cuban Government" and had found no evidence of Cuban involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=305, 374}} The House Select Committee on Assassinations also wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Cuban Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy".&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"/&gt; However, some conspiracy theorists continue to allege that [[Fidel Castro]] ordered the assassination of Kennedy in retaliation for the CIA's previous attempts to assassinate him.{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=208}}&lt;!-- Source needed for Castro denying this. --&gt;

In the early 1960s, [[Clare Boothe Luce]], wife of [[Time-Life]] publisher [[Henry Luce]], was one of a number of prominent Americans who sponsored anti-Castro groups. This support included funding exiles in commando speedboat raids against Cuba. In 1975, Clare Luce said that on the night of the assassination, she received a call from a member of a commando group she had sponsored. According to Luce, the caller's name was "something like" Julio Fernandez and he claimed he was calling her from New Orleans.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=392-}}&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), pp. 53–54. {{ISBN|1-56025-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Luce, Fernandez told her that Oswald had approached his group with an offer to help assassinate Castro. Fernandez further claimed that he and his associates eventually found out that Oswald was a communist and supporter of Castro. He said that with this new-found knowledge, his group kept a close watch on Oswald until Oswald suddenly came into money and went to [[Mexico City]] and then Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 54. {{ISBN|1-56025-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, according to Luce, Fernandez told her, "There is a Cuban Communist assassination team at large and Oswald was their hired gun."{{sfn|Summers|1998|p=323}}

Luce said that she told the caller to give his information to the FBI. Subsequently, Luce would reveal the details of the incident to both the [[Church Committee]] and the HSCA. Both committees investigated the incident, but were unable to uncover any evidence to corroborate the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0044a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations] Appendix to Hearings, Vol. X, pp. 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1967, CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] told President Lyndon Johnson that the CIA had tried to assassinate Castro. Helms further stated that the CIA had employed members of the Mafia in this effort, and "... that CIA plots to assassinate Fidel Castro dated back to August of 1960—to the Eisenhower Administration." Helms also said that the plots against Castro continued into the Kennedy Administration and that Attorney General Robert Kennedy had known about both the plots and the Mafia's involvement.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200406/holland The Assassination Tapes, by Max Holland] The Atlantic Monthly, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On separate occasions, Johnson told two prominent television newsmen that he believed that JFK's assassination had been organized by Castro as retaliation for the CIA's efforts to kill Castro. In October 1968, Johnson told veteran newsman [[Howard K. Smith]] of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] that "Kennedy was trying to get to Castro, but Castro got to him first." In September 1969, in an interview with [[Walter Cronkite]] of [[CBS]], Johnson said in regard to the assassination, "[I could not] honestly say that I've ever been completely relieved of the fact that there might have been international connections", and referenced unnamed "others". Finally, in 1971, Johnson told his former speechwriter Leo Janos of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine that he "never believed that Oswald acted alone".&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;

In 1977, Castro was interviewed by newsman [[Bill Moyers]]. Castro denied any involvement in Kennedy's death, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would have been absolute insanity by Cuba. ... It would have been a provocation. Needless to say, it would have been to run the risk that our country would have been destroyed by the United States. Nobody who's not insane could have thought about [killing Kennedy in retaliation].&lt;ref name="Bill Moyers 1977"/&gt;{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Soviet government conspiracy ===
The Warren Commission reported that they found no evidence that the Soviet Union was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=374}} The House Select Committee on Assassinations also wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Soviet Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy".&lt;ref name="HCSA-IC"/&gt;

According to some conspiracy theorists, the Soviet Union, with [[Nikita Khrushchev]] motivated by having to back down during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], was responsible for the assassination.{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=208}}

According to a 1966 FBI document, Colonel Boris Ivanov—chief of the KGB Residency in New York City at the time of the assassination—stated that it was his personal opinion that the assassination had been planned by an organized group, rather than a lone individual. The same document stated, "... officials of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed there was some well-organized conspiracy on the part of the 'ultraright' in the United States to effect a '[[coup d'état|coup]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~oah/nl/98feb/jfk.html#d1 |title=JFK Assassination Records Review Board Releases Top Secret Records |publisher=Indiana.edu |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, the high-ranking [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]] intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], said that he had a conversation with [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] who told him about "ten international leaders the [[Kremlin]] killed or tried to kill", including Kennedy. He claimed that "among the leaders of Moscow's satellite intelligence services there was unanimous agreement that the KGB had been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy."&lt;ref name="Pacepa0"&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ= "The Kremlin's Killing Ways"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808171854/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ%3D |date=August 8, 2007 }}, Ion Mihai Pacepa, [[National Review Online]], November 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Pacepa later released a book, ''Programmed to Kill: Lee Harvey Oswald, the Soviet KGB, and the Kennedy Assassination'', in 2007. Similar views on the JFK assassination were expressed by Robert Holmes, former First Secretary at the British Embassy in Moscow, in his 2012 book ''Spy Like No Other''.

=== Decoy hearse and wound alteration ===
[[David Lifton]] presented a scenario in which conspirators on [[Air Force One]] removed Kennedy's body from its original bronze casket and placed it in a shipping casket, while en route from Dallas to Washington. Once the presidential plane arrived at [[Andrews Air Force Base]], the shipping casket with the President's body in it was surreptitiously taken by helicopter from the side of the plane that was out of the television camera's view. Kennedy's body was then taken to an unknown location—most likely [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]]. ''Best Evidence: Disguise and Deception in the Assassination of John F.

Part of Lifton's theory comes from a House Select Committee on Assassinations report of an interview of Lt. Richard Lipsey on January 18, 1978, by committee staff members Donald Purdy and Mark Flanagan. According to the report, Lt. Richard Lipsey said that he and General Wehle had met President Kennedy's body at Andrews Air Force Base. Lipsey "... placed [the casket] in a hearse to be transported to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Lipsey mentioned that he and Wehle then flew by helicopter to Bethesda and took [the body of] JFK into the back of Bethesda." Lipsey said that "a decoy hearse had been driven to the front [of Bethesda]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://karws.gso.uri.edu/Marsh/Jfk-conspiracy/LIPSEY.TXT Interview of Lt. Richard A. Lipsey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145804/http://karws.gso.uri.edu/Marsh/Jfk-conspiracy/LIPSEY.TXT |date=September 3, 2006 }}, by House Select Committee on Assassinations investigators Andy Purdy and Mark Flanagan, JFK Document No. 014469, January 18, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; With Lipsey's mention of a "decoy hearse" at Bethesda, Lifton theorized that the casket removed by Lipsey from Air Force One—from the side of the plane exposed to television—was probably also a decoy and was likely empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/arrb/index38.htm |title=Testimony of David Lifton |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]].

Laboratory technologist Paul O'Connor was one of the major witnesses supporting another part of David Lifton's theory that somewhere between Parkland and Bethesda the President's body was made to appear as if it had been shot only from the rear. O'Connor said that President Kennedy's body arrived at Bethesda inside a body bag in "a cheap, shipping-type of casket", which differed from the description of the ornamental bronze casket and sheet that the body had been wrapped in at Parkland Hospital.&lt;ref name="Turner, Nigel 1988 1"&gt;Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 1, "The Coup D'Etat"'', 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor said that the brain had already been removed by the time it got to Bethesda,&lt;ref name="Turner, Nigel 1988 1"/&gt; and that there were "just little pieces" of brain matter left inside the skull.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]]. ''Best Evidence: Disguise and Deception in the Assassination of John F. Kennedy'', (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, 1988), p. 604. {{ISBN|0-88184-438-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher [[David Wrone]] dismissed the theory that Kennedy's body was surreptitiously removed from the presidential plane, stating that as is done with all cargo on airplanes for safety precautions, the coffin and lid were held by steel wrapping cables to prevent shifting during takeoff and landing and in case of air disturbances in flight.&lt;ref name="Wrone"/&gt; According to Wrone, the side of the plane away from the television camera "was bathed in klieg lights, and thousands of persons watched along the fence that bent backward along that side, providing, in effect, a well-lit and very public stage for any would-be body snatchers".&lt;ref name="Wrone"/&gt;

=== Federal Reserve conspiracy ===
Jim Marrs, in his book ''Crossfire'', presented the theory that Kennedy was trying to rein in the power of the [[Federal Reserve]], and that forces opposed to such action might have played at least some part in the assassination.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=275}}&lt;ref name=Silber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|title=The Fed and Its Enemies; The central bank is at the center of controversy.

A 2010 article in ''[[Research (magazine)|Research]]'' magazine discussing various controversies surrounding the Federal Reserve stated that "the wildest accusation against the Fed is that it was involved in Kennedy's assassination."&lt;ref name=Silber/&gt; Critics of the theory note that Kennedy called for and signed legislation phasing out Silver Certificates in favor of Federal Reserve Notes, thereby enhancing the power of the Federal Reserve; and that Executive Order 11110 was a technicality that only delegated existing presidential powers to the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] for administrative convenience during a period of transition.&lt;ref name=Silber/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward 1996"/&gt;

=== Israeli government conspiracy ===
Immediately following Kennedy's death, speculation that he was assassinated by a "[[Antisemitic conspiracy theories|Zionist conspiracy]]" was prevalent in much of the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name=Bass&gt;{{cite book|last=Bass|first=Warren|title=Support Any Friend: Kennedy's Middle East and the Making of the U.S.-Israel Alliance|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199884315|pages=243–244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npk0XuEHHpQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=January 16, 2013|chapter=A Time To Cut Bait|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=npk0XuEHHpQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these views were that [[Zionist]]s were motivated to kill Kennedy due to his opposition to an [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israeli nuclear program]], that Lyndon B. Johnson received orders from Zionists to have Kennedy killed, and that the assassin was a Zionist agent.&lt;ref name=Bass/&gt;

According to [[Michael Collins Piper]] in ''Final Judgment: The Missing Link in the JFK Assassination Controversy'', Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] orchestrated the assassination after learning that Kennedy planned to keep Israel from obtaining nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=Goldwag&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldwag|first=Arthur|title=Cults, Conspiracies, and Secret Societies: The Straight Scoop on Freemasons, the Illuminati, Skull &amp; Bones, Black Helicopters, the New World Order, and Many, Many More|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780307456663|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDbM5GeMgXIC|page=178|chapter=Conspiracies: The Kennedy Assassinations|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDbM5GeMgXIC&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper said that the assassination "was a joint enterprise conducted on the highest levels of the American CIA, in collaboration with organized crime—and most specifically, with direct and profound involvement by the Israeli intelligence service, the [[Mossad]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=College lecturers blame JFK's death on Israelis|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z1IpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MmsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3861%2C3207784|accessdate=January 16, 2013|newspaper=Sun Journal|date=August 22, 1997|agency=AP|location=Lewiston, Maine|page=7A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also alleges involvement of [[Meyer Lansky]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;ref name=Goldwag/&gt; In 2004, [[Mordechai Vanunu]] stated that the assassination was Israel's response to "pressure [Kennedy] exerted on ...

Within the Secret Service during those chaotic months, "rumors were flying" about Cuban dissidents and right-wing southerners who were stalking Kennedy for a chance to kill him, Bolden wrote. The security threat in Chicago in early November 1963 involved former Marine Thomas Arthur Vallee, who was arrested after police found an M-1 rifle, handgun, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his vehicle. A high-powered rifle was confiscated from another suspected conspirator in Chicago shortly before Kennedy's trip there was canceled, Bolden said.

* ''[[Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK]]'' (1992) by Bonar Menninger ({{ISBN|0-312-08074-3}}) alleges that while Oswald did attempt to assassinate JFK and did succeed in wounding him, the shot that struck him in the head was accidentally fired by Secret Service agent George Hickey, who was riding in the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine. The theory alleges that after the first two shots were fired the motorcade sped up while Hickey was attempting to respond to Oswald's shots and he lost his balance and accidentally pulled the trigger of his [[AR-15]] and shot JFK. Hickey's testimony says otherwise: "''At the end of the last report'' (shot) I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, ''and turned to the rear.''" (italics added).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfkassassination.net/russ/m_j_russ/Sa-hicke.htm |title=George Hickey's Warren Commission testimony |publisher=Jfkassassination.net |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Hickey sued Menninger in April 1995 for what he had written in ''Mortal Error''.

His conclusions were: (1) that Oswald killed Kennedy due to extreme feelings of inadequacy versus his wife's professed admiration for JFK, and (2) that the KGB never sought intelligence information from Oswald during his time in the USSR as they did not trust his motivations. {{ISBN|1-55972-210-X}}.
* [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery]]'' (1995) concludes that Oswald was guilty, but holds that the evidence may point to a second gunman on the grassy knoll, who, purely by coincidence, was attempting to kill JFK at the same time as Oswald. "If there was indeed another shot, it was not necessarily fired by a conspirator of Oswald's.

Oswald's role was to shoot John Connally. Bruce Roberts, author of the Gemstone File papers, claimed that the JFK assassination scenario was modeled after a supposed attempted assassination of President F.D. Roosevelt.

Shortly after this, he reincorporated [[Santorini]], which had been ruled by [[Domenico Pisani]], husband of his niece [[Fiorenza Crispo]], into the Duchy.{{sfn|Frazee|Frazee|1988|pp=78, 95}} His raising of taxes made him very unpopular among the Greek population of [[Naxos]], however. They rebelled under their own magnates (''archontes''), and the Crispi and the other Catholic families loyal to them were shut in the island's citadel (Kastro) and were besieged by the rebels. Only the timely arrival of [[galley]]s from the [[Knights Hospitaller]] of [[Rhodes]] rescued Crispo and put an end to the revolt.{{sfn|Frazee|Frazee|1988|p=78}}

The discontent did not subside, however, and in 1494 John was killed, apparently by poison, by the locals, who sent an embassy to [[Venice]] requesting for the [[Republic of Venice|Republic]] to assume control of the island, as John's sole heir, his son [[Francesco III Crispo]], was underage.{{sfn|Frazee|Frazee|1988|p=78}} In the end, Francesco assumed his father's position in 1500.

==Family==
He was married to a Morosini and had issue: 

# [[Francesco III Crispo]]

He also had a Mistress, his cousin, Maria Crispo, daughter of Nicholas Crispo Lord of Syros (Sira).

They had issue: 

 # A daughter, name currently unknown. 

# A son, Nicholas Antonio Crispo de Syra (Sira). married to Taddea Sommaripa fled to Rhodes Island circa 1520.

[[File:Assistant United States Attorney Jonathan Paul Luna.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Luna]]
'''Jonathan Paul Luna''' (October 21, 1965 – December 4, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]] found dead under mysterious circumstances in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], [[Pennsylvania]] while serving as an [[Assistant United States Attorney]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. Luna had been stabbed 36 times with his own [[penknife]] and then [[drowned]] in a [[Stream|creek]] next to his car in rural Lancaster County. Investigations have proven inconclusive, and there is debate on whether Luna's death was [[murder]] or [[suicide]].

== Personal life ==
Luna was born on 21 October 1965, and grew up in the Patterson [[housing project]] near [[Yankee Stadium]] in the [[South Bronx]], [[New York City]]. His father was [[Filipino people|Filipino]], and his mother an [[African-American]] from the [[American South]]. Luna received his undergraduate degree from [[Fordham University]]. He later studied at the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]], where he was roommates with [[Reggie Shuford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/a-decade-later-prosecutor-lunas-death-still-a-mystery/2013/12/10/211e2ab8-f563-11e2-aa2e-4088616498b4_story.html|title=A decade later, prosecutor Luna's death still a mystery|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at [[Arnold &amp; Porter]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1993 to 1994 and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] from 1994 to 1997. Luna served as a [[prosecutor]] in the [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] borough of New York City before moving to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] to become an [[Assistant United States Attorney]]. Luna married Angela Hopkins, an [[obstetrician]], on August 29, 1993, and they had two children.

== Death ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
At 11:38 pm on the night he died, Luna left the Baltimore courthouse and went northeast on I-95. He used his [[E-ZPass]] on I-95 into Delaware but not on the [[New Jersey Turnpike|New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]s. After three toll interchanges, he switched to buying toll tickets.
At 12:57 am, $200 was withdrawn from Luna's bank account from the ATM at the JFK Plaza service center near [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], [[Delaware]]. At 02:47 am he crossed the Delaware River toll bridge to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and at 03:20 am his debit card bought gas at the Sunoco [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]] service plaza.

At 04:04 am his car exited the turnpike at the Reading-Lancaster interchange. The toll ticket had a spot of his blood on it suggesting that he was already injured. His car was parked at the back of the Sensenig &amp; Weaver Well Drilling company at 1439 Dry Tavern Road, [[Denver, Pennsylvania]] (Brecknock Township) before it was later driven into the creek.

At 05:00 am the first employee of Sensenig &amp; Weaver arrived, and half an hour later at 05:30 am the car was noticed, with its lights off and the front end into the stream. Blood was smeared over the driver's door and the front left of the car. Luna was face down in the stream under the car engine. He was wearing a suit and a black overcoat with his court ID around his neck. A pool of blood was found on the rear seat floor. Although stabbed 36 times with his own penknife around the chest and neck plus a head injury, the death was due to drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Debra|title=Still a murder mystery: Who killed federal prosecutor Jonathan Luna?|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/still_a_murder_mystery_who_killed_federal_prosecutor_jonathan_luna/|website=ABA Journal|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No suspects or motive for murder were determined. The federal authorities (FBI) lean toward calling it a [[suicide]] and came to the conclusion he was alone from the time he left his office until his body was found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-md.luna30nov30-story.html|title=5 years later, prosecutor's death still a mystery|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|work=baltimoresun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the local Lancaster County authorities, including two successive coroners, ruled it a homicide. Additional evidence collected during the investigation captured a second blood type and a partial print, as well as some grainy footage from near the time of the gas station purchase made with Luna's credit card at the Sunoco service plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bal-probe0109,0,5329212.story|title=Probe in killing of prosecutor Luna stalls|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|work=baltimoresun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation remains ongoing, and there is an unclaimed federal reward of $100,000 for information leading to a conviction.

== Theories ==

=== Suicide ===
It was initially reported that Luna did not have the expected substantial defense wounds on his hands and that many of the wounds are shallow which are called "hesitation" wounds in a suicide victim. Some suggested motives for suicide were that Luna was to take a polygraph test concerning $36,000 which disappeared from a bank robbery case that he had prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Danny|title=Jonathan Luna and the FOIA request|url=http://thedailyrecord.com/2014/08/02/jonathan-luna-and-the-foia-request/|website=The Daily Record|accessdate=12 December 2017|date=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luna had a charge card which his wife, Angela, did not know about.&lt;ref name="peopleDec2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hewitt|first=Bill|title=Who Killed Jonathan Luna?|journal=[[People Magazine]]|date=22 December 2003|volume=60|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20149007,00.html|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His name was on an Internet dating site and he had a $25,000 credit card debt.&lt;ref name="peopleDec2003" /&gt; There is also an accidental suicide theory that Luna was fabricating a kidnapping and attack and that he went too far.

=== Homicide ===
The Lancaster County coroner who performed the autopsy ruled Luna's death a homicide by drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-md.luna30nov30,0,2938855.story|title=5 years later, prosecutor's death still a mystery|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|work=baltimoresun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luna left his glasses, which he needed to drive, and his cell phone on his desk. He had called defense attorneys earlier in the night saying he would fax over documents that night but they never arrived. The pool of blood in the back seat would suggest Luna was in back and someone else was driving. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Inquest ==
In early February 2007, a private investigator and an attorney, both hired by Luna's family, filed a petition for a [[mandamus|writ of mandamus]] in order to force the Lancaster County coroner to conduct an [[inquest]] into Luna's death, after an earlier request was declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL Radio]] | url = http://wbal.com/news/story.asp?articleid=54479  | accessdate = 2007-02-26 | date = 2007-02-26 | title = Private Investigator Wants Jonathan Luna Case Reopened |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231617/http://wbal.com/news/story.asp?articleid=54479 |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that occurred in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].

This section does '''not''' include [[List of rampage killers#School massacres|school massacres]]; [[List of rampage killers#Workplace killings|workplace killings]]; [[List of rampage killers#Religious, political or racial crimes|religious, political, or racial crimes]]; or mass murders that took place primarily in a [[List of rampage killers#Domestic violence|domestic environment]], like familicides, which are covered in their own categories. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another [[felony]], like robbery, are also excluded.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

In '''''Marais v The Master''''', an important case in the [[Law of succession in South Africa|South African law of succession]], the [[testator]], who had divorced from his wife in 1972, bequeathed his entire [[Estate (law)|estate]] to her in 1977. Before his death, he wrote words on his copy of the [[Will and testament|will]] and on a letter from his [[Lawyer|attorney]], attempting to revoke the will and direct that his mother was to be his sole heir. The court held that there had been a clear intention to revoke the will and to nominate his mother as sole beneficiary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">'''Metachirality''' is a stronger form of [[chirality]].
It applies to objects or systems that are [[chiral]] (not identical to their [[mirror image]]) and where, in addition, their mirror image has a [[symmetry group]] that differs from the symmetry group of the original object or system.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John H.; Burgiel, Heidi; Goodman-Strauss, Chaim (2008). ''The Symmetries of Things'', p. 353. A K Peters Ltd., London. {{ISBN|978 1 56881 220 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many familiar chiral objects, like the capital letter 'Z' embedded in the plane, are not metachiral.
The symmetry group of the capital letter 'Z' embedded in the plane consists of the [[identity transformation]] and a rotation over 180˚ (a half turn).
In this case, the mirror image has the same symmetry group.
In particular, asymmetric objects (that only have the identity transformation as symmetry, like a human hand) are not metachiral,
since the mirror image is also asymmetric.
In general, two-dimensional objects and bounded three-dimensional objects are not metachiral.

An example of a metachiral object is an infinite [[helical staircase]].
A [[helix]] in 3D has a ''handedness'' (either left or right, like [[screw thread]]), whereby it differs from its mirror image.
An infinite helical staircase, however, does have symmetries:
[[screw operation]]s, that is, a combination of a [[translation]] and a [[rotation]].
The symmetry group of the mirror image of an infinite helical staircase also contains screw operations.
But they are of the opposite handedness and, hence,
the symmetry groups differ.
Note, however, that these symmetry groups are [[isomorphic]].

Of the 219 [[space group]]s, 11 are metachiral.
A nice example of a metachiral spatial structure is the [[Laves_graph|K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshikazu Sunada|Sunada, Toshikazu]] (Feb. 2008). "Crystals That Nature Might Miss Creating", ''Notices of the AMS'', Volume 55, Number 2, pages 208-215. [http://www.newton.ac.uk/preprints/NI07042.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Triamond,

'''''Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime''''' is a 2001 American [[documentary film]] in which actors [[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]] discuss the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[science fiction]] franchise and its effects on their lives. Shatner and Nimoy portrayed the characters [[James T. Kirk]] and [[Spock]] respectively in the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|1960s ''Star Trek'' television series]], the [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|1970s animated television series]], and [[Star Trek (film series)|their film sequels]]. They talk about differences they had with [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of ''Star Trek'', and about the strained relationships between Shatner and some of the other cast members. It was in this film that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with [[alcoholism]] while he was acting in the original television series. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after suffering from alcoholism.

''Mind Meld'' was produced to advertise Shatner's personal website. Filming took place at Nimoy's home on September 5, 2001, and [[Billy West]] narrated the [[title sequence]]. The film's title refers to a fictional practice in ''Star Trek''—a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|mind meld]] is a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link that [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] are able to create with other organisms. ''Mind Meld'' was released for sale on Shatner's website on November 6, 2001, coinciding with the release of the [[director's cut]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. ''Mind Meld'' attracted some notoriety because of an unintended sound in one scene that became a popular subject of [[flatulence humor]] among [[Trekkie|''Star Trek'' fans]] and on [[morning zoo]] radio programs. Shatner denied being the source of this sound in multiple interviews; he and ''Mind Meld'''s director, Peter Jaysen, attributed it to equipment on set.

The film received mixed reviews from critics. Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an "F", and said that the only people likely to watch the film were extreme ''Star Trek'' fans and people interested in hearing Shatner's supposed flatulence. Laurence Lerman of ''Video Business'' praised the film for not "rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of ''Star Trek'' conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs",&lt;ref name=Video/&gt; and instead for dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of ''Star Trek''.

Both men describe ''Star Trek'' as having put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding the legitimacy of consistently portraying an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], and other struggles with his acting career at the time.&lt;ref name=Talk/&gt; "It took me a while," Nimoy says, "but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that I never had to worry about work ever since ''Star Trek'' went on the air."&lt;ref name=Buckman/&gt; Nimoy reveals that he was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] at the time of the original ''Star Trek'' series—something that was not publicly known before ''Mind Meld''.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt; He developed "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to [[Sandra Zober]], his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress [[Susan Bay]] in 1988, he has been a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]].&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;

Shatner says that acting in ''Star Trek'' was "life-consuming" and left him "barely any time for family", and that this was the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife.&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|title=Bar Trek: Search for Spock|author=Mackenzie, Drew|page=4|date=October 11, 2001|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes a subsequent succession of sexual partners,&lt;ref name=Talk/&gt; including, he says, ''Star Trek'' actresses.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt; He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner,&lt;ref name=Edmonton/&gt; and of his third wife, [[Nerine Kidd]], who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|title=Jim Beam Me Up Scotty: Spock Tells of Booze Battle|date=October 31, 2001|page=20|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt; Another topic is Nimoy's [[fine-art photography]], which deals with spirituality and sensuality.

''Mind Meld'' was produced as a way of advertising Shatner's personal website,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; williamshatner.com, which offered features including the Shatner and Friends fan club's quarterly newsletter, semi-regular updates on Shatner's life, and a photograph of Shatner with the gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]].&lt;ref name=Press&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Press]]|title=To Boldy Go...|date=July 16, 2002|author=Henzell, John|page=36|location=Christchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatner said that another reason they decided to make the film was because Nimoy was visibly getting old.&lt;ref name=Province/&gt;{{efn|Shatner is older than Nimoy by four days, with both born in 1931.&lt;ref name=Province/&gt;}} Shatner asked Nimoy if he would be willing to discuss his experiences with alcoholism in the film, and Nimoy agreed.

Around 52 minutes and 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner is talking about the other ''Original Series'' actors disliking him,&lt;ref name=Talk/&gt; he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of flatulence is audible.

[[Howard Stern]] played the sound on [[The Howard Stern Show|his radio show]] several times,&lt;ref name=Dawson79/&gt; including when Shatner appeared on the show to promote his upcoming television series ''[[Iron Chef USA]]''&lt;ref name=York/&gt; on November 13, 2001.&lt;ref name=Dawson80&gt;Dawson (2006), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; When Stern asked about the sound, Shatner said it had been produced by the [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]].&lt;ref name=Dawson80/&gt; A similar claim was made on Shatner's website, where the noise was attributed to a squeaky [[Jib (camera)|jib]].&lt;ref name=Talk/&gt; On [[Conan O'Brien]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night]]'' program on November 14,&lt;ref name=Dawson80/&gt; Shatner called it "outrageous" that Buckman should assume him to be the source of the sound rather than Nimoy. O'Brien responded, "You're the captain! You outrank him! It's your responsibility!"&lt;ref name=York/&gt; Pressed further by O'Brien on the sound's provenance, Shatner suggested that it may have been a dog bark or a bird call.&lt;ref name=York/&gt; According to Jaysen, the sound did not emanate from Shatner, and was most likely caused by cables rubbing against each other while a camera moved.&lt;ref name=New/&gt; "It was probably some machine that nobody heard", Shatner said in a September 2002 interview. "The controversy is over."&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[New York Post]]|date=September 21, 2002|title=Capt. Kirk Sees Trek Reality|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Dawson devoted an entire chapter of his 2006 ''Modern History of the Fart'' to Shatner's alleged flatulence in ''Mind Meld'', which he compares to the sound of someone stepping on a [[tribble]].&lt;ref name=Dawson79/&gt;{{efn|This is a ''Star Trek'' in-joke; in the ''Star Trek'' universe, tribbles are small, hairy extraterrestrials that reproduce rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson &amp; Bauer (2011), p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;}} G. Noel Gross of [[DVD Talk]] compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the [[Zapruder film]].&lt;ref name=Talk/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Shatner Nimoy Laugh Dragon Con 2009.jpg|thumb|alt=William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy|In his review of ''Mind Meld'', Mike Clark of ''[[USA Today]]'' called the discussion between Shatner ''(left)'' and Nimoy ''(right)'' "surprisingly frank".&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;]]
Sarah Sloboda of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that ''Mind Meld'' "provides a genuine glimpse of the lives of the stars shadowed by the roles that defined their public [[persona]]s, and the mutual experience that binds them as friends".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Gross praised the [[video quality]], but criticized the DVD functionality and features. He also wrote that "even in the heavier parts of this conversation, there's a warmth and comradery there that's rife with good humor".&lt;ref name=Talk/&gt; Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an F, saying that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme ''Star Trek'' fans are people interested in hearing the sound alleged to be Shatner's flatulence, which Brown said can be clearly heard. He called the film "seemingly interminable" and said the discussion between Shatner and Nimoy shows that they "rival black holes in sheer self-absorption".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Brown, Scott|title=Space Oddity|date=November 9, 2001|issue=624|page=88|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Henzell, writing for ''[[The Press]]'' of New Zealand, ''Mind Meld''{{'}}s trailer took its subject matter so seriously that it became comical.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

Vern Perry of the ''[[Orange County Register]]'' called the film fascinating, writing that it skilfully combined humor and earnestness. He wrote that it was moving to see the two actors talk about their personal lives with such vulnerability—particularly when Nimoy discusses his experiences with alcoholism.&lt;ref name=Orange&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Orange County Register]]|author=Perry, Vern|page=E8|date=April 27, 2002|title=Japan's 'Rashomon' a Classic|location=Santa Ana, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Stacy of ''[[OC Weekly]]'' reported being "thoroughly charmed" by the film, and called "the affection between [Shatner and Nimoy] obvious and touching."&lt;ref name=Weekly/&gt;

Laurence Lerman of ''Video Business'' praised ''Mind Meld'' for not "rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of ''Star Trek'' conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs", but instead dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name=Video/&gt; Mike Clark of ''[[USA Today]]'' praised Shatner's interviewing abilities and wrote that the film was engaging.

'''Misotheism''' is the "hatred of [[God]]" or "hatred of the [[Deity|gods]]" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] adjective μισόθεος "hating the gods", a compound of [[wikt:μῖσος|μῖσος]] "hatred" and [[wikt:|θεός]] "god"). In some varieties of [[polytheism]], it was considered possible to inflict punishment on gods by ceasing to worship them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Thus, Hrafnkell, protagonist of the eponymous ''[[Hrafnkels saga]]'' set in the 10th century, as his temple to [[Freyr]] is burnt and he is enslaved, states that "I think it is folly to have faith in gods", never performing another [[blót]] (sacrifice), a position described in the sagas as ''goðlauss'', "godless".  [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Teutonic Mythology'' observes that:
{{quote|It is remarkable that Old Norse legend occasionally mentions certain men who, turning away in utter disgust and doubt from the heathen faith, placed their reliance on their own strength and virtue. Thus in the [[Sólarljóð|Sôlar lioð]] 17 we read of Vêbogi and Râdey ''á sjálf sig þau trûðu,'' "in themselves they trusted".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Grimm: [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/grimmst/001_02.php Teutonic Mythology] Chapter 1. page 2. (Grimm's Teutonic Mythology Translation Project.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In [[monotheism]], the sentiment arises in the context of [[theodicy]] (the [[problem of evil]], the [[Euthyphro dilemma]]). A famous literary expression of misotheistic sentiment is [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]'', composed in the 1770s.

A related concept is [[dystheism]] ({{lang-grc|δύσ θεος}} "bad god"), the belief that a god is not wholly [[good and evil|good]], and is possibly evil. [[Trickster]] gods found in polytheistic belief systems often have a dystheistic nature. One example is [[Eshu]], a trickster god from [[Yoruba religion]] who deliberately fostered violence between groups of people for his own amusement, saying that "causing strife is my greatest joy."

The concept of the [[Demiurge]] in some versions of ancient [[Gnosticism]] also often portrayed the Demiurge as a generally evil entity.

Many [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities since prehistoric times have been assumed to be neither good nor evil (or to have both qualities). Thus dystheism is normally used in reference to the Judeo-Christian God. In [[conceptions of God]] as the [[summum bonum]], the proposition of God not being wholly good would be an [[oxymoron]].

A historical proposition close to "dystheism" is the ''deus deceptor'' "[[evil demon]]" (''{{lang|fr|dieu trompeur}}'') of [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', which has been interpreted by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] critics as the [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] proposition that God exhibits malevolent intent. But [[Richard Kennington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=René Descartes: Critical Assessments|editor=Georges Joseph Daniel Moyal|pages=139|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-02358-0|author=Richard Kennington|chapter=The 'Teaching of Nature' in Descartes' Soul Doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=146|title=On Modern Origins: Essays in Early Modern Philosophy|author=Richard M. Kennington|chapter=The Finitude of Descartes' Evil Genius|year=2004|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0815-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that Descartes never declared his "evil genius" to be omnipotent, but merely no less powerful than he is deceitful, and thus not explicitly an equivalent to God, the singular omnipotent deity.

==Terminology==
*''[[:wikt:misotheism|Misotheism]]'' first appears in a dictionary in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[New English Dictionary]], under ''miso-''; also explicitly in 1913, [http://www.1913dictionary.com/dictionary/word/misotheism/ Noah Webster's Dictionary of the English Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929065752/http://www.1913dictionary.com/dictionary/word/misotheism/ |date=2007-09-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek μισόθεος is found in Aeschylus (''[[The Oresteia|Agamemnon]]'' 1090). The English word appears as a [[nonce word|nonce]]-coinage, used by [[Thomas de Quincey]] in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;"On Christianity As An Organ of Political Movement" (1846).&lt;/ref&gt; It is comparable to the original meaning of Greek ''[[ἄθεος|atheos]]'' of "rejecting the gods, rejected by the gods, godforsaken". Strictly speaking, the term connotes an attitude towards the gods (one of hatred) rather than making a statement about their nature. [[Bernard Schweizer]] (2002) stated "that the English vocabulary seems to lack a suitable word for outright hatred of God... &lt;nowiki&gt;[even though]&lt;/nowiki&gt; history records a number of outspoken misotheists", believing "misotheism" to be his original coinage. Applying the term to the work of [[Philip Pullman]] (''[[His Dark Materials]]''), Schweizer clarifies that he does not mean the term to carry the negative connotations of [[misanthropy]]: ''"To me, the word connotes a heroic stance of humanistic affirmation and the courage to defy the powers that rule the universe."''&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Schweizer, 'Religious Subversion in ''His Dark Materials'' in: Millicent Lenz, Carole Scott (eds.) ''His Dark Materials Illuminated: Critical Essays On Philip Pullman's Trilogy'' (2005), p. 172, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[:wikt:Dystheism|Dystheism]]'' is the belief that [[Existence of God|God exists]] but is not wholly [[good and evil|good]], or that he might even be [[evil]]. The opposite concept is ''[[Omnibenevolence|eutheism]]'', the belief that [[God]] exists and is wholly good. ''Eutheism'' and ''dystheism'' are straightforward Greek formations from ''eu-'' and ''dys-'' + ''[[theism]]'', paralleling ''[[atheism]]''; {{lang|grc|δύσθεος}} in the sense of "godless, ungodly" appearing e.g. in [[Aeschylus]] (''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'' 1590). The terms are [[nonce word|nonce]] coinages, used by [[University of Texas at Austin]] philosophy professor [[Robert Koons|Robert C. Koons]] in a 1998 [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203180444/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/philosophy/faculty/koons/356/lec19.html lecture]. According to Koons, "eutheism is the thesis that God exists and is wholly good, [... while] dystheism is the thesis that God exists but is not wholly good." However, many proponents of dystheistic ideas (including [[Elie Wiesel]] and David Blumenthal) do not offer those ideas in the spirit of ''hating'' God.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''. pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work notes God's apparent evil or at least indifferent disinterest in the welfare of humanity, but does not express hatred towards him because of it. A notable usage of the concept that the gods are either indifferent or actively hostile towards humanity is in the [[Cthulhu mythos]] of [[H.P. Lovecraft]].
*''Maltheism'' is an ad-hoc coining appearing on [[Usenet]] in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Apparently coined by Paul Zimmerman in August 1985, on [http://groups.google.com/group/net.origins/browse_thread/thread/2511f7a6ccacd6a9/7179db188c826528?lnk=st&amp;q=%22Damager+God%22&amp;rnum=5#7179db188c826528 net.origins] referring to the misotheistic belief that God was in fact not a "Creator-God" but a "Damager-God".&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the belief in God's malevolence inspired by the thesis of [[Tim Maroney]] that "even if a God as described in the Bible does exist, he is not fit for worship due to his low moral standards."&lt;ref&gt;Original Usenet posting of Maroney's "Even If I Did Believe" essay, [http://groups.google.com/group/net.religion/msg/30925fd2c9a20cbd? 31 December 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; The same term has also seen use among designers and players of [[GURPS|role-playing games]] to describe a world with a malevolent deity.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor et al. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Antitheism]]'' is direct opposition to theism. As such, it is generally manifested more as an opposition to belief in a god (to theism per se) than as opposition to gods themselves, making it more associated with [[antireligion]], although [[Buddhism]] is generally considered to be a religion despite its status with respect to theism being more nebulous. Antitheism by this definition does not necessarily imply belief in any sort of god at all, it simply stands in opposition to the idea of theistic religion. Under this definition, antitheism is a rejection of theism that does not necessarily imply belief in gods on the part of the antitheist. Some might equate any form of antitheism to an overt opposition to God, since these beliefs run contrary to the idea of making devotion to God the highest priority in life, although those ideas would imply that God exists, and that he wishes to be worshiped, or to be believed in.&lt;ref&gt;See the example of Viktor Frankl in Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''. p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain forms of ''[[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]'' make the assertion that the thing worshiped as God in this world is actually an evil impostor, but that a true benevolent deity worthy of being called "God" exists beyond this world. Thus, the [[Gnostic]]s (see [[Sethian]], [[Ophites]]) believed that God (the deity worshiped by Jews, Greek Pagan philosophers and Christians) was really an evil creator or [[demiurge]] that stood between us and some greater, more truly benevolent real deity. Similarly, [[Marcionism|Marcionites]] depicted God as represented in the [[Old Testament]] as a wrathful, malicious demiurge.

==Theodicy==
{{Main|Theodicy|Problem of evil|Holocaust theology}}
Dystheistic speculation arises from consideration of the [[problem of evil]] — the question of why God, who is supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, would allow evil to exist in the world. Koons notes that this is only a theological problem for a eutheist, since a dystheist would not find the existence of evil (or God's authorship of it) to be an obstacle to theistic belief. In fact, the dystheistic option would be a consistent non-contradictory response to the problem of evil. Thus Koons concludes that the problem of [[theodicy]] (explaining how God can be good despite the apparent contradiction presented in the problem of evil) does not pose a challenge to ''all'' possible forms of theism (i.e., that the problem of evil does not present a contradiction to someone who would believe that God exists but that he is not necessarily good).

This conclusion implicitly takes the first horn of the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], asserting the independence of [[good and evil]] [[morality]] from God (as God is defined in [[monotheistic]] belief). Historically, the notion of "good" as an absolute concept has emerged in parallel with the notion of God being the singular entity identified with good. In this sense, dystheism amounts to the abandonment of a central feature of historical monotheism: the de facto association of God with the [[summum bonum]].

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote: ''"This world could not have been the work of an all-loving being, but that of a devil, who had brought creatures into existence in order to delight in the sight of their sufferings."''

Critics of [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s doctrines of [[predestination]] frequently argued that Calvin's doctrines did not successfully avoid describing God as "the author of evil".

Much of [[Holocaust theology|post-Holocaust theology]], especially in [[Judaism|Judaic]] theological circles, is devoted to a rethinking of God's goodness. Examples include the work of David R. Blumenthal, author of ''Facing the Abusing God'' (1993) and John K. Roth, whose essay "A Theodicy of Protest" is included in ''Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy'' (1982):
{{quote|Everything hinges on the proposition that God possesses—but fails to use well enough—the power to intervene decisively at any moment to make history's course less wasteful. Thus, in spite and because of his sovereignty, this God is everlastingly guilty and the degrees run from gross negligence to mass murder...
To the extent that &lt;nowiki&gt;[people]&lt;/nowiki&gt; are born with the potential and power to &lt;nowiki&gt;[do evil things]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, credit for that fact belongs elsewhere. "Elsewhere" is God's address.&lt;ref&gt;Roth et al. (1982) - Extracted from a [http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Articles/Philosophy_of_religion/Evil/roth_theodicy_protest2.html review] of Roth's essay, in which the author comments that "Roth is painting a picture of God as the ultimate example of a bad and abusive parent!"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deus deceptor==
{{Main|Deus deceptor}}
The ''deus deceptor'' (French ''dieu trompeur'') "deceptive god" is a concept of Cartesianism.
[[Voetius]] accused Descartes of blasphemy in 1643. [[Jacques Triglandius]] and [[Jacobus Revius]], theologians at [[Leiden University]], made similar accusations in 1647, accusing Descartes of "hold[ing] God to be a deceiver", a position that they stated to be "contrary to the glory of God". Descartes was threatened with having his views condemned by a [[synod]], but this was prevented by the intercession of the [[Prince of Orange]] (at the request of the French Ambassador Servien).&lt;ref name=Janowski&gt;{{cite book |title=Cartesian Theodicy: Descartes' quest for certitude |first=Zbigniew |last=Janowski |pages=62–68 |publisher=Springer  |year=2000 |series=Archives Internationales D'Histoire des Idees/International Archives of the History of Ideas |isbn=978-0-7923-6127-5 |lccn=99059328 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2d3ekBs57jUC&amp;lpg=PP62&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The accusations referenced a passage in the ''First Meditation'' where Descartes stated that he supposed not an optimal God but rather an evil demon "[[wikt:summe|summe]] [[wikt:potens|potens]] &amp; [[wikt:callidus|callidus]]" ( "most highly powerful and cunning"). The accusers identified Descartes' concept of a deus deceptor with his concept of an [[evil demon]], stating that only an omnipotent God is "summe potens" and that describing the evil demon as such thus demonstrated the identity. Descartes' response to the accusations was that in that passage he had been expressly distinguishing between "the supremely good God, the source of truth, on the one hand, and the malicious demon on the other". He did not directly rebut the charge of implying that the evil demon was omnipotent, but asserted that simply describing something with "some attribute that in reality belongs only to God" does not mean that that something is being held to actually ''be'' a supreme God.&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;

The evil demon is omnipotent, Christian doctrine notwithstanding, and is seen as a key requirement for Descartes' argument by Cartesian scholars such as [[Alguié]], Beck, [[Émile Bréhier]], Chevalier, Frankfurt, [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Anthony Kenny]], Laporte, Kemp-Smith, and Wilson. The progression through the ''First Meditation'', leading to the introduction of the concept of the evil genius at the end, is to introduce various categories into the set of dubitables, such as mathematics (i.e. Descartes' addition of 2 and 3 and counting the sides of a square). Although the hypothetical evil genius is never stated to be one and the same as the hypothetical "deus deceptor," (God the deceiver) the inference by the reader that they are is a natural one, and the requirement that the deceiver is capable of introducing deception even into mathematics is seen by commentators as a necessary part of Descartes' argument. Scholars contend that in fact Descartes was not introducing a new hypothetical, merely couching the idea of a deceptive God in terms that would not be offensive.&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;

[[Paul Erdős]], the eccentric and extremely prolific [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[mathematician]], referred to the notion of ''deus deceptor'' in a humorous context when he called God "the Supreme Fascist", who deliberately hid things from people, ranging from socks and passports to the most elegant of mathematical proofs. A similar sentiment is expressed by [[Douglas Adams]] in ''[[The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]'' in reference to the temptation of [[Adam and Eve]] by God:
:''[God] puts an apple tree in the middle of [the Garden of Eden] and says, do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting "Gotcha." It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten it...Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in the end.''

==Scripture==
{{Main|Ethics in the Bible#God's benevolence}}
There are various examples of arguable dystheism in the [[Bible]], sometimes cited as arguments for [[atheism]] (e.g. [[Bertrand Russell]] 1957), most of them   from the [[Pentateuch]].
A notable exception is the [[Book of Job]], a classical case study of [[theodicy]], which can be argued to consciously discuss the possibility of dystheism (e.g. [[Carl Jung]], ''[[Answer to Job]]'').

[[Thomas Paine]] wrote in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' that "whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of God."&lt;ref name="Paine1819"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Political and Miscellaneous Works of Thomas Paine ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA13|year=1819|publisher=R. Carlile|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Paine's perspective was a [[deism|deistic]] one, critical more of common beliefs about God than of God himself.

The [[New Testament]] contains references to an "evil god", specifically the "prince of this world" (John 14:30, {{lang|grc|ο του κοσμου τουτου αρχων}}) or "god of this world" (2 Corinthians 4:4, {{lang|grc|ο θεος του αιωνος τουτου}}) who has "blinded the minds of men".
Mainstream [[Christian theology]] sees these as references to [[Satan]] ("the Devil"), but [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], [[Marcionism|Marcionites]], and [[Manicheanism|Manicheans]] saw these as references to [[Yahweh]] (God) himself.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
References to God as wrathful or violent are more sparse in the New Testament than in the Old, but a number of antitheist speakers, notably [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Matt Dillahunty]], have drawn attention to a number of passages.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Misotheism in art and literature==
Misotheistic and/or dystheistic expression has a long history in the arts and in literature. [[Bernard Schweizer]]’s book ''Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism'' is devoted to this topic. He traces the [[history of ideas]] behind misotheism from the [[Book of Job]], via Epicureanism and the twilight of Roman paganism, to [[deism]], [[anarchism]], Nietzschean philosophy, [[feminism]], and radical humanism. The main literary figures in his study are [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Algernon Swinburne]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Rebecca West]], [[Elie Wiesel]], [[Peter Shaffer]], and [[Philip Pullman]]. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium for the expression of God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism, while ingeneously veiling their blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Schweizer, ''Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:
* [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]''
* the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]]&lt;ref&gt;Iwan Bloch, ''Marquis De Sade: His Life and Works'' (2002), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem "Apparently With No Surprise" depicts God as approving of suffering in the world, relating the tale of a flower "beheaded" by a late frost as the sun "measure[s] off another day for an approving God".
* [[Mark Twain]] (himself a Deist) argued against what he saw as the petty God many followed in a posthumously published book, ''The Bible According to Mark Twain: Writings on Heaven, Eden, and the Flood''. He talks, in part, about the African "sleeping sickness", [[malaria]].
* [[Ivan Karamazov#Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov|Ivan Karamazov]] in Fyodor [[Dostoyevsky]]'s 1879 ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' articulates what might be termed a dystheistic rejection of God. Koons covered this argument in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203201814/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/philosophy/faculty/koons/356/lec20.html lecture immediately following] the one [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203180444/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/philosophy/faculty/koons/356/lec19.html referenced above]. It was also discussed by [[Peter S. Fosl]] in his essay titled "[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031200636/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/portal_article.php?id=23 The Moral Imperative to Rebel Against God]".
* Konrad, the protagonist of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s ''[[Dziady (poem)|Forefathers' Eve]]'', calls God a [[tsar]].

In more recent times, the sentiment is present in a variety of media:

===Poetry and drama===
The characters in several of [[Tennessee Williams]]' plays express dystheistic attitudes, including the Rev. T. Lawrence Shannon in ''[[The Night of the Iguana]].''

[[Robert Frost]]'s poem "Design" questions how God could have created death if he were benevolent.

In Jewish author [[Elie Wiesel]]'s play ''[[The Trial of God]]'' (1979), the survivors of a [[pogrom]], in which most of the inhabitants of a 17th-century Jewish village were massacred, put God on trial for his cruelty and indifference to their misery. The play is based on an actual trial Wiesel participated in that was conducted by inmates of the [[Auschwitz]] [[concentration camp]] during the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[holocaust]], but it also references a number of other incidents in Jewish history including a similar trial conducted by the [[Hasidic]] [[Rabbi]] [[Levi Yosef Yitzhak of Berdichev]]:{{quote|Men and women are being beaten, tortured and killed. True, they are victims of men. But the killers kill in God's name. Not all? True, but let one killer kill for God's glory, and God is guilty. Every person who suffers or causes suffering, every woman who is raped, every child who is tormented implicates Him. What, you need more? A hundred or a thousand? Listen, either he is responsible or he is not. If he is, let's judge him. If he is not, let him stop judging us.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}}}

===Modern literature===
Several non-Jewish authors share Wiesel's concerns about God's nature, including [[Salman Rushdie]] (''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', ''[[Shalimar the Clown]]'') and [[Anne Provoost]] (''In the Shadow of the Ark''):
{{quote|Why would you trust a God that doesn't give us the right book? Throughout history, he's given the Jewish people a book, he's given the Christians a book, and he's given the Muslims books, and there are big similarities between these books, but there are also contradictions. ... He needs to come back and create clarity and not ... let us fight over who's right. He should make it clear. So, my personal answer to your question, "Should we trust [a God who can't get things right]", I wouldn't.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of [https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/faithandreason104_print.html interview] with Anne Provoost by [[Bill Moyers]] for his "Faith and Reason" PBS TV series&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The writing of [[Sir Kingsley Amis]] contains some misotheistic themes; e.g. in ''[[The Green Man (Kingsley Amis novel)|The Green Man]]'' (God's appearance as the young man), and in ''[[The Anti-Death League]]'' (the anonymous poem received by the chaplain).

===Speculative fiction===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
A number of [[speculative fiction]] works present a dystheistic perspective, at least as far back as the works of [[Lovecraft Mythos|H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s influential philosophical [[short novel]] ''[[Star Maker]]''.

By the 1970s, [[Harlan Ellison]] even described dystheism as a bit of a [[science fiction]] cliché. Ellison himself has dealt with the theme in his "[[The Deathbird]]", the title story of ''[[Deathbird Stories]]'', a [[short story collection|collection]] based on the theme of (for the most part) malevolent modern-day gods. [[Lester del Rey]]'s "[[Evensong (short story)|Evensong]]" (the first story in Harlan Ellison's much-acclaimed ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' anthology), tells the story of a fugitive God hunted down across the universe by a vengeful humanity which seeks to "put him in his place". "[[Faith of Our Fathers (short story)|Faith of Our Fathers]]" by [[Philip K. Dick]], also from the same anthology, features a horrifying vision of a being, possibly God, who is all-devouring and amoral. [[Philip Pullman]]'s previously mentioned trilogy, ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', presented the theme of a negligent or evil God to a wider audience, as depicted in the 2007 film ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'' based on the first book of this trilogy.

The original series of [[Star Trek: The Original Series|''Star Trek'']] featured episodes with dystheistic themes, amongst them "[[The Squire of Gothos]]", "[[Who Mourns for Adonais?]]", "[[For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky]]", and "[[The Return of the Archons]]". In "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]", the pilot episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] informs [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], a [[trickster]] with god-like powers similar to the antagonist in the aforementioned "Squire of Gothos" episode, that 24th-century humans no longer had any need to depend upon or worship god figures. This is an amplification of the tempered anti-theistic sentiment from "Who Mourns for Adonais?", in which Captain [[James T. Kirk]] tells [[Apollo]] that "Mankind has no need for ''gods'', we find the ''one'' quite adequate." In ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' it is revealed that the Klingon creation myth involves the first Klingons killing the gods that created them because, ''"They were more trouble than they were worth."''

In the film ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'', anti-hero protagonist Richard B. Riddick stated his own belief, ''"Think someone could spend half their life in a slam with a horse bit in their mouth and not believe? Think he could start out in some liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and not believe? Got it all wrong, holy man. I absolutely believe in God... and I absolutely hate the fucker."''

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'', which is mostly about religious institutions, ends with an appearance by Yahweh which is far from complimentary.

The Athar, a fictional organization from the [[Faction (Planescape)|D&amp;D's Planescape Campaign Setting]] denies the divinity of the setting's deities. They do, however, tend to worship "[[Deism|The Great Unknown]]" in their place.

In the 2013 film ''[[Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners]]'', Holly Jones and her husband Isaac lost their faith in God after their son died of an unspecified disease. Since then, they have been kidnapping and murdering children in order to make other parents lose faith in God and turning them into revenge-driven hollow shells of their former selves, i.e. spreading their misotheism to other people. As Holly Jones states to Keller Dover near the end of the film, ''"Making children disappear is the war we wage with God. Makes people lose their faith, turns them into demons like you."''

===Popular music===
''Misotheism'' is a 2008 [[album]] by Belgian [[black metal]] band ''Gorath''.

Dystheistic sentiment has also made its way into popular music, evincing itself in controversial songs like "[[Dear God (XTC song)|Dear God]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtcidearecords.co.uk/lyrics/lyrics_details.php?trackid=125 "Dear God"], performed by [http://www.xtcidearecords.com XTC] (written by [[Andy Partridge]])&lt;/ref&gt; by the band [[XTC]] (later covered by [[Sarah McLachlan]]) and "[[Blasphemous Rumours]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.depechemode.com/lyrics/blasphemousrumours.html "Blasphemous Rumours"], performed by [http://www.depechemode.com Depeche Mode] (written by Martin L. Gore)&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Depeche Mode]], which tells the story of a teenage girl who attempted suicide, survived, and turned her life over to God, only to be hit by a car, wind up on life support, and eventually die. A good deal of [[Gary Numan]]'s work, specifically the album ''Exile'', is laden with misotheistic themes.

The output of Oscar-winning songwriter/composer [[Randy Newman]] also includes several songs expressing dystheistic sentiment, including the ironic "[[He Gives Us All His Love]]" and the more overtly maltheistic "God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randynewman.com/tocdiscography/disc_sail_away/tocdiscography/disc_sail_away/lyricssailaway#godssong "God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113234311/http://www.randynewman.com/tocdiscography/disc_sail_away/tocdiscography/disc_sail_away/lyricssailaway |date=2006-11-13 }}, performed by [http://www.randynewman.com/ Randy Newman] (written by Randy Newman)&lt;/ref&gt; both from his acclaimed 1972 album ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]''. In the latter song, Newman bemoans the futility of dealing with God whose attitude towards humanity he sees as one of contempt and cruelty.

The song "God Made" by [[Andrew Jackson Jihad]] proposes dystheism and has an implied hatred for God. More specifically, their song "Be Afraid of Jesus" is about a vengeful Christ although this could be a critique of fundamentalist hate speech.

"God Am" by [[Alice in Chains]] from their self-titled release has many misotheistic themes about the perceived apathy of God towards the evil in this world.

American [[death metal]] bands [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] and [[Morbid Angel]] base much of their lyrics around misotheism in name and in concept. Many bands in the [[black metal]] genre, such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Gorgoroth (band)|Gorgoroth]] and [[Darkthrone]] express extreme misotheism in their lyrics and actions, which involved burning down churches during the early 1990s.

===Modern art===
In 2006, Australian artist Archie Moore created a paper sculpture called "Maltheism", which was considered for a [[Telstra]] Art Award in 2006. The piece was intended as a representation of a church made from pages of the Book of [[Deuteronomy]]: {{quote|...and within its text is the endorsement from God to [[Moses]] for invasion of other nations. It says that you have the right to invade, take all their resources, kill all the men (non-believers) and make no treaty with them.&lt;ref&gt;From the educational resource pamphlet accompanying the presentation of the [http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/museums/magnt/education/pdf/natsiaa_education_resource.pdf 23rd Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916122845/http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/museums/magnt/education/pdf/natsiaa_education_resource.pdf |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Mutation''' is a [[genetic operator]] used to maintain [[genetic diversity]] from one generation of a population of [[genetic algorithm]] [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosomes]] to the next. It is analogous to biological [[mutation]]. Mutation alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state. In mutation, the solution may change entirely from the previous solution. Hence GA can come to a better solution by using mutation. Mutation occurs during evolution according to a user-definable mutation probability. This probability should be set low. If it is set too high, the search will turn into a primitive random search.

The classic example of a mutation operator involves a probability that an arbitrary [[bit]] in a [[genome (genetic algorithm)|genetic sequence]] will be changed from its original state. A common method of implementing the mutation operator involves generating a [[random variable]] for each bit in a sequence. This random variable tells whether or not a particular bit will be modified. This mutation procedure, based on the biological [[point mutation]], is called single point mutation. Other types are inversion and floating point mutation. When the gene encoding is restrictive as in permutation problems, mutations are swaps, inversions, and scrambles.

The purpose of mutation in GAs is preserving and introducing diversity. Mutation should allow the algorithm to avoid [[local minimum|local minima]] by preventing the population of chromosomes from becoming too similar to each other, thus slowing or even stopping evolution. This reasoning also explains the fact that most GA systems avoid only taking the [[Fitness function|fittest]] of the population in generating the next but rather a random (or semi-random) selection with a weighting toward those that are fitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| url = http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/genetic-algorithms/crossover-mutation.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For different genome types, different mutation types are suitable:

* '''Bit string mutation'''
::The mutation of bit strings ensue through bit flips at random positions.

::Example:
::{|
|1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| || || || || ↓ || || 
|- 
|1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0
|}

::The probability of a mutation of a bit is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{l}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the binary vector. Thus, a mutation rate of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; per mutation and individual selected for mutation is reached.

* '''Flip Bit'''
This mutation operator takes the chosen genome and inverts the bits 
(i.e. if the genome bit is 1, it is changed to 0 and vice versa).

* '''Boundary'''
This mutation operator replaces the genome with either lower or upper bound randomly.
This can be used for integer and float genes.

* '''Non-Uniform'''
The probability that amount of mutation will go to 0 with the next generation is increased by using non-uniform mutation operator. It keeps the population from stagnating in the early stages of the evolution. It tunes solution in later stages of evolution. This mutation operator can only be used for integer and float genes.

* '''Uniform'''
This operator replaces the value of the chosen gene with a uniform random value selected between the user-specified upper and lower bounds for that gene. This mutation operator can only be used for integer and float genes.

* '''Gaussian'''
This operator adds a unit Gaussian distributed random value to the chosen gene. If it falls outside of the user-specified lower or upper bounds for that gene, the new gene value is clipped. This mutation operator can only be used for integer and float genes.

* '''Shrink'''
This operator adds a random number taken from a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to the original value of each decision variable characterizing the entry parent vector.  &lt;ref&gt;Claudio Comis Da Ronco, Ernesto Benini, A Simplex-Crossover-Based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm, IAENG Transactions on Engineering Technologies, Volume 247 of the series Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering pp 583-598, 2013 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-007-6818-5_41&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4284">'''Pelesit''' is a [[Malay language|Malay]] term for an inherited spirit or demon which serves a master. It is found in early Malay [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lesg5YSXckQC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=pelesit+ghost+malay&amp;lr= Asian Horror Encyclopedia By Laurence C. Bush]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The Pelesit is reared by a woman as a shield for protection, guidance, and most probably as a weapon to harm other people. In that way it is associated with a [[black magic]] practitioner. It is the female version of [[Hantu Raya]] which confers great power on the owner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gE-BAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=pelesit+ghost+malay&amp;dq=pelesit+ghost+malay Hantu hantu By James Noel McHugh]&lt;/ref&gt;

In old Malay culture some people chose to live alone thus isolating themselves from society. They practiced black magic in order to gain strength, power, protection, beauty, but not popularity. Some gained a certain level of popularity or renown but there were others who remained in secrecy and refused to mingle with people.

This practice is popular among Malays who are [[animists]] and involved in the so-called ''Saka'' (the inheritance of a spirit from one generation to another). Pelesit is commonly associated with the [[katydid]] since it has the ability to turn itself into one.

Pelesit is one of the ghost mentioned in "Hikayat Abdullah", written by [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]], much to the amusement of Sir [[Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles]], his employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ms icon}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=VihYSsllnjQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=abdullah+munshi+pelesit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S5RWudtCvI&amp;sig=F9ioXipZ5mkdM_4dUz03K9exsr0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=abrxTK6PK4qivQPI-aWfDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Hikayat Abdullah By Hamzah Hamdani, Abdullah (Munshi)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Typically the owner, the [[Bomoh]] ([[shaman]]), uses the spirit in an exploitative way for monetary gain. The pelesit is first used to attack someone randomly, then the same Bomoh will be called to exorcise the so-called demon inside the victim (while the spectators have no idea that the bomoh is playing tricks on them). Later, a certain amount of money is given to the bomoh as a token of appreciation.

A bomoh keeps his pelesit in a small bottle&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.my/books?id=nPc8_QNIopoC&amp;q=Pelesit+small+bottle&amp;dq=Pelesit+small+bottle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y Publications, Volume 50&lt;br&gt;Folklore Society (Great Britain)&lt;br&gt;1902 - Folklore]&lt;/ref&gt;  and offers it his own [[blood]] every full [[moon]].

== Problem ==
Pelesit is a dark spirit revered by shamans in Malay culture. It feeds on blood and works as a servant for its master.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.my/books?id=asf6n9hoHMUC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Pelesit+small+bottle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Pelesit%20small%20bottle&amp;f=false The Memoirs of Mustapha Hussain: Malay Nationalism Before UMNO&lt;br&gt;By Mustapha Hussain]&lt;/ref&gt;  It demonizes people and causes chaos in society. Pelesit must have a continuous host and therefore needs to be passed down from one generation to the next. It should always be taken care of and fed constantly because if not, the demon will soon create havoc among the local inhabitants of its master's village, especially after the master's death.

==In popular culture==
*In Kijiya, a Malaysian [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/komku komku] series, a Pelesit is the creature that appear after the tsunami which is the main enemy of the human after the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gempakstarz.com/products_novel_details.php?id=324 Publisher website for Kijiya]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7386">'''Political Terror Scale''' is a yearly measure of state inflicted political terror. It was developed in the early 1980s by researchers at [[Purdue University]] and is currently managed by Mark Gibney of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=369}}

==Introduction==
The Political Terror Scale is a yearly measure of terror inflicted upon a population. "Terror" is defined as state terror, or violations of physical and personal integrity rights carried out by the state or its agents. Examples of political terror include extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and political imprisonment.

Originally, only 59 countries were coded for within the database between 1976 and 1983. In 1984, Mark Gibney took over as manager of the database and expanded the list of countries coded to 180 and the range of years to the most recent years available (currently 2012).{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=369}}The Political Terror Scale uses three sources to code each country: [[State Department|The State Department's]] ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,'' the ''Annual Report'' from [[Amnesty International]] and most recently the ''World Report'' from [[Human Rights Watch]].{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=372}}The database can be viewed and downloaded from its [http://www.politicalterrorscale.org website].

==The Coding Process==
===The Scale===
The Political Terror Scale is a five-point fixed scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/Data/Documentation.html|title=Documentation: Coding Rules|work=The Political Terror Scale|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Countries are under a secure rule of law, people are not imprisoned for their views, and torture is rare or exceptional. Political murders are rare
# There is a limited amount of imprisonment for nonviolent  political activity. However, a few persons are affected; torture and beating are exceptional. Political murder is rare.
# There is extensive political imprisonment. Execution or other political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited detention, with or without trial, for political views is accepted.
# The practices of Level 3 are expanded to larger numbers. Murders, disappearances, and torture are part of life. In spite of its generality, on this level terror affects primarily those who interest themselves in politics or ideas.
# The terrors of Level 4 have been extended to the whole population. The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals.

The scale is based on the assessment of violence along three dimensions:scope, intensity, and range. '''Scope''' is the type of violence carried out by the state, '''Intensity''' refers to the frequency at which the state employs a given type of violence, and '''Range''' is the portion of the population targeted for abuse (can also be thought of as the selectivity of violence).&lt;ref&gt;Wood and Gibney 2010, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=373}}

===The Coders===
The principle researchers consist of professors from several universities.
* '''Mark Gibney''' - Belk Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Linda Cornett''' - Chair and Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Reed Wood''' - Assistant Professor of the School of Politics and Global Studies at [[Arizona State University]].
* '''Peter Haschke''' - Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Daniel Arnon''' - PhD Student at [[Emory University]].

Coding is also supplemented by undergraduate and graduate students from several universities. Research assistants for the 2012-2013 year are: Daniel Arnon, Gray Barrett, Minori Hinds, and Kelsey Tavares of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]], Alexander Liffiton and Rachel Olson of Arizona State University, Max Scott of the [[London School of Economics]], and Shea Streeter, a recent graduate of the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/About/Researchers/|title=Researchers|work=The Political Terror Scale|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Process===
The data for each country is analyzed by at least two senior coders and undergraduate assistants. Each nation receives two scores - one from the State Department's report and one from Amnesty International's report. Coders agree with each other regarding a country's score at a rate of roughly 85%. If coders cannot come to an agreement than a third coder will settle the dispute. Due to the contextual nature of the source data, coding is highly subjective, and coders are instructed to ignore their own personal biases or knowledge when determining a country's score. Coders are also instructed to give countries the benefit of any doubt when scoring. If a coder cannot decided between two numbers, they are instructed to use the lower number when scoring.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=|pp=372-374}}

===Challenges and Examples===
The Political Terror Scale only measures acts of political terror inflicted by the state. Due to this fact, it may be difficult to score countries when it is not immediately clear which groups are committing acts of violence. [[Colombia]] is a perfect example of this dilemma, as although overall violence has decreased since 2000, violence from local militias and paramilitary groups has continued at a relatively stable rate. Although the government has attempted to mitigate the violence, certain actors within the government have either allowed the violence to continue or contributed to it in some way. Therefore, Colombia's score reflects the close level of involvement between government and private actors.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=371}}

Another challenge is that the Political Terror Scale only measures actual violations of physical or integrity rights or acts of violence and therefore countries ruled by truly repressive and coercive regimes may receive low scores. Nations who are successful at oppressing their citizens or who have committed acts of violence in the past to deter resistance generally do not have to commit many acts of violence in order to maintain control. For example, the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] would score low on the Political Terror Scale and that score would not reflect the overall level of oppression present in that society.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=370}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12556">'''Postnaturalism''' is the theory of the '''postnatural''', a term coined to describe organisms that have been intentionally and heritably altered by humans. Postnaturalism is a cultural process whereby organisms are bred to satisfy a specific cultural purpose. It can be used to read these organisms, which serve as insights into our culture by reflecting desires and beliefs prevalent at the time of breeding. This has direct implications for the [[evolution]]ary path of these organisms,&lt;ref name="CPNH"&gt;{{cite web | title =About | work = | publisher =Center for PostNatural History | date = | url =http://www.postnatural.org/About | accessdate = April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whittling down undesirable traits to leave only those culturally sought out. Postnaturalism argues that in so doing, humans have and continue to actively alter the evolutionary path of a postnatural organism to suit our cultural desires. The agricultural practice of [[monoculture]], for instance, is just one example of postnatural organisms who have been bred to such an extent that the modern-day species look nothing like their pre-[[Neolithic Revolution|neolithic]] counterparts. The breeding of these species for this purpose can be seen to be reflected in notable diet changes during this period,&lt;ref name ="Nutrition"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richards | first=MP | date=2002 | title=A brief review of the archaeological evidence for Palaeolithic and Neolithic subsistence | url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v56/n12/pdf/1601646a.pdf | journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 56 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601646 | access-date = May 5, 2015 | pmid=12494313 | pages=16 p following 1262}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proliferated during ensuing sedentism and urbanisation.&lt;ref name ="Nutrition"/&gt;

Postnaturalism is a highly selective process. For every organism that has become used in our society, there are countless more that have remained non-postnatural for whatever reason ranging from a perceived lack of future use from them or traits that make them too difficult to farm. One such example is the golden orb-weaver spider which produces a strong, light and useful silk, however they are known to be cannibalistic and thus impossible to farm on a large scale.&lt;ref name="SpiderSilk"&gt;{{cite web | author = Ferguson, Cat | title = Mixing Spider DNA and Goat Embryos Produces Milk With a Side of Silk  | work = | publisher = takepart | date = April 10, 2014 | url = http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/04/10/gmo-goats | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postnatural History==
Postnatural history is defined as the "study of the origins, habitats, and evolution of organisms that have been ''intentionally'' and ''heritably'' altered by humans", which serves as a "record of the influence of human culture on evolution".&lt;ref name="CPNH" /&gt; So termed to differentiate it from traditional [[natural history]] studies, it is the subject of a storefront in [[Pittsburgh]], United States called the [[Center for PostNatural History]], which builds on this concept to produce an array of displays of organisms which are all postnatural.&lt;ref name="CPNH" /&gt;

==Domestication==
The commencement of the postnatural can be considered to date back to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] civilisation's early interaction with wild species. Here, [[domestication]] occurred as a way of adapting the environment around prehistoric people to suit their needs and desires through a gradual process of refinement. Domestication succeeds through the heritable continuation of an organism's [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]] allowing each generation to continue on from their previous generation. In its simplest terms, domestication alters a species through survival to a change in habitat, food source, or other significant change. These changes can be sought for a variety of different reasons including physical attributes, behavioural characteristics, lifespan, and adaptability to a change in environment.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 0-393-31755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective breeding==
Postnatural practices include [[selective breeding]], a process by which humans purposefully breed certain organisms for particular biological traits. The practice was known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Buffum, Burt C. |title=Arid Agriculture; A Hand-Book for the Western Farmer and Stockman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rmbur_Am8vgC&amp;pg=PA232|date=2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4086-6710-1|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been commonly used continuing to this day. [[Michael Pollan]] argues that [[Charles Darwin]] saw this process and considered it artificial, rather than natural, selection, but in terms of evolutionary progress this distinction becomes irrelevant to the species; the change is irreversible all the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pollan, Michael |title=The Botany of Desire: A Plants-Eye View of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_L_2yTfOEEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+botany+of+desire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hlg5VdavMYmKNsbUgNAH&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA|date=2001|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|isbn=0-375-76039-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simply because evolution is understood to be unable to 'undo' previous changes, but, particularly in proteins,&lt;ref name="EvolutionProgression"&gt;{{cite web | author=Coghlan, Andy | title =For proteins, evolution can't go backwards  | work = | publisher =New Scientist | date = September 23, 2009| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17841-for-proteins-evolution-cant-go-backwards.html#.VUvzE_lVikp | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues along in a progression of its biological structure depending on what traits are required for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rush, J.H. |title=The Dawn of Life|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Dawn-Life-J-Rush/dp/0451021924|date=1962|publisher=Signet, First Printing Edition|isbn=0-451-02192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Huxley, Julian | editor-last=Newman | editor-first=James Roy | title=What is Science?

==Induced Mutation==
Induced mutation in the context of postnaturalism is the process whereby a specific genetic mutation - usually a rare occurrence - is selectively isolated by people and encouraged to reproduce in future offspring. This differs from the general understanding of a mutation that was induced by treatment from a particular chemical agent in a living species.&lt;ref name="InducedMutation"&gt;{{cite web | title =induced mutation  | work = | publisher =The Free Dictionary by Farlex | date = | url =http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/induced+mutation | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of this is the albino rat which possesses, in the wild a notoriously fatal genetic make-up&lt;ref name="AlbinoRat"&gt;{{cite web | author = Royer, Nichole | title =The Pink-Eyed White Rat  | work = | publisher =American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association | date = October 12, 2014 | url =http://www.afrma.org/pewrats.htm | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it much easier to identify to predators, a coat which drew interest in breeders so as to distinguish them from their more unhygienic-looking sewer counterparts prevalent in major cities in the 1800s. So numerous were rats in industrial cities, they became the subject of a sport based on their extermination, [[rat-baiting]].&lt;ref name="Rat-baiting"&gt;{{cite web | title =Rats II: Man vs Vermin  | work = | publisher =History House Inc | date = | url =http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/rats_2/ | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The albino rat thus became distinguished from the regular unsightly sewer rat and even became sold as pets, the owning of one as a child allegedly the basis for Beatrix Potter's book ''Samuel Whiskers''.&lt;ref name="AlbinoRat"/&gt;

==Genetic Engineering==
[[Genetic Engineering]] can be considered to be the purposeful alteration of the genetic makeup of an organism through the introduction of genes from sources not belonging to that organism. The isolation of a particular gene and introduction of another is often achieved through the use of [[biotechnology]] more broadly.&lt;ref name = "GEng"&gt;{{cite web | author = MacDonald Glenn, Linda | title = Ethical Issues in Genetic Engineering and Transgenics | work = | publisher = American Institute of Biological Sciences | date = November 2013 | url = http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/glenn.html | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Genetic engineering is a contentious topic and even in searching for a definition, there are several alternatives available highlighting the variation in perceptions around what is considered to be the goal and process of genetic engineering.&lt;ref name ="GEng1"&gt;{{cite web | title = What is genetic engineering and how does it work? | work = | publisher = University of Nebraska, Lincoln | date = | url = http://agbiosafety.unl.edu/basic_genetics.shtml | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng2"&gt;{{cite web | title = What Is Genetic Engineering? | work = | publisher = Union of Concerned Scientists | date = | url = http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/our-failing-food-system/genetic-engineering/what-is-genetic-engineering.html#.VVpOqhFFDIU | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng3"&gt;{{cite web | title = genetic engineering | work = | publisher = Tech Target | date = | url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/genetic-engineering | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng4"&gt;{{cite web | author = Melina, Remy | title = What's Genetic Engineering | work = | publisher = Live Science | date = June 15, 2010 | url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/genetic-engineering | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, genetic engineering embodies much of what is considered postnatural, but doing so with the next level of technology than used in previous methods such as those mentioned in the above sections. Increased use of advanced technology allows for improved precision and accuracy of methods, and carrying out of transgenics, whilst the use of laboratories as settings is designed to prevent the release of experimented organisms into the wild unless cleared with the relevant protocols and regulations beforehand.

==Concerns over postnaturalism's proliferation in monoculture==
The current agricultural practice of monoculture is intricately connected with postnaturalism, particularly now much of common contemporary agricultural practice has become mechanised. This mechanisation sometimes requires universality to comply with existing tools, machines and practices, such as the breeding of chickens to be a uniform size to ensure they fit into [[Chicken harvester|chicken harvesting]] machines.&lt;ref name = "Chicken-catchingMachines"&gt;{{cite web | author = Free From Harm Staff Writers | title = 17 Chicken Facts the Industry Doesn’t Want You to Know | work = | publisher = Free From Harm | date = August 28, 2014 | url = http://freefromharm.org/animalagriculture/chicken-facts-industry-doesnt-want-know/ | accessdate = June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions rather than breed a particular species to a uniform size, some parts of organisms have been so heavily bred and altered that [[dystocia]] can regularly occur, such as with the [[Belgian Blue]] cattle whose birth canal regularly becomes constricted or even entirely blocked due to the birth canal's reduced size and the increased size of calves.&lt;ref name = "Cheville256" /&gt; The result is the routine scheduling of [[Caesarian section]]s.&lt;ref name="Cheville256"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheville, Norman F. |title=Introduction to veterinary pathology| date=1999| publisher=Wiley-Blackwell| isbn=978-0-8138-2496-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-OF4rmihIUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Educational Vet Video|title=Video of Cow Caesarean Section|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2HJNAgoels|work=VetPulse TV in Practice|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| taxon = Protulophila
| authority = Rovereto, 1901
}}

'''''Protulophila''''' is a [[genus]] of [[symbiotic]] or [[commensal]] [[colony (biology)|colonial]] [[Hydrozoa]], known from very small [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroid]]s. These marine hydroids live in the shelly tubes of [[serpulid]] tube worms, which are [[annelid]]s.

The genus ''Protulophila'' was named by Rovereto in 1901, from fossil material. For many years scientists knew these animals only from fossils, and the genus was thought to have become [[extinct]] about four million years ago. However, in 2014, animals of this genus were discovered within [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]] (NIWA) museum material that had been live-collected in New Zealand in 2008. ''Protulophila'' can be regarded as a [[living fossil]].

==History==
Fossil remains of ''Protulophila''  were previously known only from marine deposits in Europe and the Middle East, deposits that date from about 150 million years ago to 4 million years ago, when the genus was thought to have become extinct. In 2014, fossils of the genus that were less than one million-years-old were found in [[Whanganui]], New Zealand by NIWA scientists. The scientist then wondered if perhaps the genus might still be [[Extant taxon|extant]] in New Zealand. A search of [[NIWA]]'s invertebrate collection during 2014 revealed specimens of ''Protulophila'' in preserved material of serpulid tube worms which had been live-collected in 2008, in 20 m of water in [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)|Queen Charlotte Sound]], near [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11264245|title=Thought to be dead for 4m years but alive in NZ|work=The New Zealand Herald|first=Nicolas|last=Jones|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientists, led by [[marine biologist]] Dr. Dennis Gordon, are planning to collect some fresh material so that [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]] can be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/news/northern-hemisphere-fossil-discovered-living-in-new-zealand|publisher=NIWA Taihoro Nukarangi website|title=Northern Hemisphere Fossil discovered living in New Zealand|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The other life stage==
Colonial Hydrozoa usually have two very different life stages. All the material that has so far been found of ''Protulophila'' is the hydroid or polypoid stage of the organism, a stage in which individual polyps are connected together in a colony. It is likely that there is also a medusoid (small pelagic jellyfish-like) stage, but the medusoid stage in this genus is currently either unknown, or may possibly have been named but has not yet been recognized as being the same organism as the hydroid stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/news/northern-hemisphere-fossil-discovered-living-in-new-zealand|publisher=NIWA Taihoro Nukarangi website|title=Northern Hemisphere Fossil discovered living in New Zealand|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dr. Gordon commented: "Many hydroid species have a two-stage life cycle and often the two stages have never been matched. Our discovery may thus mean that we are solving two puzzles at once.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/news/northern-hemisphere-fossil-discovered-living-in-new-zealand|publisher=NIWA Taihoro Nukarangi website|title=Northern Hemisphere Fossil discovered living in New Zealand|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public execution in Dębica.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of the execution]]

A '''public execution in Dębica''' was carried out in 1946 when three members of the Polish anti-communist [[Freedom and Independence]] (WiN) organization were publicly executed by the communist Polish authorities in the market square of [[Dębica]] in southeastern [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=Chodakiewicz&gt;{{cite book|last=Chodakiewicz|first=Marek Jan|title=After the Holocaust: Polish-Jewish Conflict in the Wake of World War 2|year=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0880335119|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
On August 23, 1944 German soldiers left the town of Dębica, and the [[Red Army]] units captured it. However, the frontline remained on the [[Wisłoka]] river for a few months, until the beginning of 1945. [[Wehrmacht]] artillery shelled Dębica, soldiers of the [[Armia Krajowa]], cooperating with the Soviets, fought the enemy. After some time the Nazis were relentlessly pushed to the west and left their positions and the whole area of Dębica County was in Soviet hands.

However, Soviet advance was regarded by many as yet another occupation. Behavior of some Red Army units and the [[NKVD]] confirmed this notion - they persecuted Polish patriots, arrested and imprisoned them. Thousands of members of the Home Army were either shot or sent to [[Siberia]]. Under the circumstances, several members of the resistance movement decided to hide in the forests and to continue struggle for free Poland. After dissolution of the Home Army, a new organization, [[Freedom and Independence]] (''Wolność i Niezawisłość'' - WiN) was created in mid-1945.

==WiN in Dębica area==
WiN was an anti-Communist organization, whose purpose was to rid Poland of Soviet occupiers. Among numerous units across the country, one was a group led by Jan Stefko (aka "Mściciel" - "The Avenger"). In the spring of 1946 Stefko's unit, with some 30 members, was staying in the area of [[Sędziszów Małopolski]]. There, an exchange of fire occurred between them and agents of the Communist secret services from the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|Ministry of Public Security]] (MBP).

After this incident, the group moved towards [[Mielec]], where in the village of [[Przecław]] it attacked Communist forces which were staying at a palace of the Rey family, which had been nationalized. WiN members faced no resistance, they took jewelry and some paintings and left.

==Capture of the group==
On the way towards [[Jasło]], the unit was caught in a trap set by soldiers of the Polish Army, militiamen and agents of UB. Four persons were killed, 16 captured and 10 managed to flee, together with Jan Stefko. The caught WiN members were charged and three of them were sentenced to death.

On Wednesday, July 10, 1946, Dębica's main square was full of people, as this was the market day. Two gallows were set - one in the square, another in the vicinity of the St. Jadwiga church. The purpose of the execution was obvious - to intimidate the population of the town.

==The execution==
It is difficult to establish how many people witnessed the event. At some point a truck entered the square, carrying three young men, members of WiN. The hangman, whose name probably was Stanisław Swieca,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} haltered all of them and soon afterward the truck drove off, leaving the condemned in the air.

The square was surrounded by the Communist agents who checked everything, making sure the execution was carried out without any obstacles. However, some witnesses claim that the head of one of the condemned men got out of the halter, but this was quickly fixed. Deaths were announced by doctor Roman Lic and Marian Stoklosa from [[Rzeszów]] prosecutor's office.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} None of the killed had a trial, they were only allowed to confess to a priest.

==Photograph==
Most probably, the whole incident would have been forgotten, had it not been for a photograph, taken by Józef Stec. The snapshot was taken from a window of a building, delivered to London and published in several newspapers in the West. Stec was quickly captured and imprisoned, he spent many years behind bars.

Because of attempts to save [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]], Raoul Wallenberg has been the subject of numerous humanitarian honours in the decades following his [[declared death in absentia|presumed death]]. In 1981, US Congressman [[Tom Lantos]], one of those saved by Wallenberg, sponsored a bill making Wallenberg an [[honorary citizen of the United States]], the second person ever to receive this honour.

==Early life==
[[File:Kappsta Raoul Wallenberg.jpg|thumb|left|Wallenberg was born in this summer villa. It was burned down in 1933. It is at 59.340862 N, 18.166985 E.]]
Wallenberg was born in 1912 in [[Lidingö Municipality|Lidingö]], near [[Stockholm]], where his maternal grandparents, Professor Per Johan Wising and his wife Sophie Wising, had built a summer house in 1882. His paternal grandfather, Gustaf Wallenberg, was a diplomat and envoy to [[Tokyo]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Sofia]].

His parents, who married in 1911, were Raoul Oscar Wallenberg (1888–1912), a [[Swedish Navy|Swedish naval officer]], and Maria "Maj" Sofia Wising (1891–1979). His father died of cancer three months before he was born, and his maternal grandfather died of pneumonia three months after his birth. His mother and grandmother, now both suddenly widows, raised him together.&lt;ref name  =ROB/&gt; In 1918, his mother married Fredric von Dardel;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raoul-wallenberg.eu/researcher/dardel/|title=Raoul Wallenberg's family, the von Dardel|work=Searching for Raoul Wallenberg|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they had a son, [[Guy von Dardel]],&lt;ref name="raoul-wallenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raoul-wallenberg.eu/articles/guy-von-dardel-introduction-to-the-report-of-the-independent-consultants/|title=Guy von Dardel’s introduction to the report of the Independent consultants  «  Searching for Raoul Wallenberg|publisher=Raoul-wallenberg.eu|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter, Nina Lagergren.

After high school and his compulsory eight months in the Swedish military, Wallenberg's paternal grandfather sent him to study in Paris. He spent one year there, and then, in 1931, he matriculated at the [[University of Michigan]] in the United States to study architecture.&lt;ref name=ROB/&gt;  Although the [[Wallenberg family]] was rich, he worked at odd jobs in his free time and joined other young male students as a passenger rickshaw handler at [[Chicago]]'s [[Century of Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raoul-wallenberg.eu/background/3%C2%A0-raoul-wallenberg-university-and-training/|title=03. Raoul Wallenberg; University and Training:|work=Searching for Raoul Wallenberg|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used his vacations to explore the United States, with hitchhiking being his preferred method of travel. About his experiences, he wrote to his grandfather saying, "When you travel like a hobo, everything's different. You have to be on the alert the whole time. You're in close contact with new people every day. Hitchhiking gives you training in diplomacy and tact."&lt;ref name=TWS&gt;{{cite web |first=Penny |last=Schreiber |url=http://www.wallenberg.umich.edu/college.html |title=The Wallenberg Story |accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raoul Wallenberg young.jpg|right|thumb|Wallenberg as a youth]]
Wallenberg was aware of his one-sixteenth Jewish ancestry, and proud of it. It came from his great-great-grandfather (his maternal grandmother's grandfather) Michael Benedicks, who immigrated to Stockholm in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFDNcB4NGdQC|title=Raoul Wallenberg: The Mystery Lives on|author=Harvey Rosenfeld|website=Google Books|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/family-tree/index/6000000013333388727|title=Raoul Gustaf Wallenberg's Family Tree|website=Geni.com|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Ingemar Hedenius]] (one of the leading Swedish philosophers) recalls a conversation with Raoul dating back to 1930, when they were together in an army hospital during military service:

{{quote|We had many long and intimate conversations. He was full of ideas and plans for the future. Although I was a good deal older - you could choose when to do your service - I was enormously impressed by him. He was proud of his partial Jewish ancestry and, as I recall, must have exaggerated it somewhat. I remember him saying, 'A person like me, who is both a Wallenberg and half-Jewish, can never be defeated'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Bierman |title=Righteous Gentile |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |location=London |year=1981 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He graduated from university in 1935, but upon his return to Sweden, he found his American degree did not qualify him to practice as an architect. Later that year, his grandfather arranged a job for him in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], in the office of a Swedish company that sold construction material. After six months in South Africa, he took a new job at a branch office of the Holland Bank in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; He returned to Sweden in 1936, securing a job in Stockholm with the help of his uncle and godfather, Jacob Wallenberg, at the Central European Trading Company,&lt;ref&gt;The company name is sometimes translated as the "Mid-European Trading Company"&lt;/ref&gt; an export-import company trading between Stockholm and central Europe, owned by Kálmán Lauer, a Hungarian Jew.

== World War II ==
{{see also|Hungary in World War II}}
Beginning in 1938, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], under the regency of [[Miklós Horthy]], passed a series of [[Racial antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] measures modeled on the so-called [[Nuremberg Race Laws]] enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, reducing the number of Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kálmán  Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the [[Axis powers]] in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=NYT03301980&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lester |first1=Elenore |last2=Werbell |first2=Frederick E. |title=The Last Hero of Holocaust. The Search for Sweden's Raoul Wallenberg |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=30 March 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupied-France]] during the early years of [[World War II]]. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove valuable to him later.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html |title=Raoul Wallenberg &amp;#124; Jewish Virtual Library|publisher= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the situation in Hungary had begun to deteriorate as the tide of the war began to turn decisively against Germany and its allies. Following the catastrophic Axis defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (in which Hungarian troops fighting alongside German forces suffered a staggering 84% casualty rate) the regime of Miklos Horthy began secretly pursuing peace talks with the United States and the United Kingdom. Upon learning of Horthy's duplicity, Adolf Hitler ordered the [[Operation Margarethe|occupation of Hungary]] by German troops in March 1944. The [[Wehrmacht]] quickly took control of the country and placed Horthy under [[house arrest]]. A pro-German [[puppet government]] was installed in Budapest, with actual power resting with the German military governor, [[Brigadeführer|SS-Brigadeführer]] [[Edmund Veesenmayer]]. With the Nazis now in control, the relative security from [[the Holocaust]] enjoyed by the Jews of Hungary came to an end. In April and May 1944 the Nazi regime and its accomplices began the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to [[extermination camp]]s in Nazi-[[General government|occupied Poland]]. Under the personal leadership of [[Obersturmbannführer|SS-Obersturmbannführer]] [[Adolf Eichmann]], who would later be tried and hanged in Israel for his major role in the implementation of the Nazis' [[Final Solution]], deportations took place at a rate of 12,000 people per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/526.html |title= PROLOGUE: Roots of the Holocaust |page=526 |website= The Holocaust Chronicle |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment by the War Refugee Board===
The persecution of the Jews in Hungary soon became well known abroad, unlike the full extent of the Holocaust. At the end of May 1944, [[George Mantello]] publicized two important reports. One of the reports was probably Rabbi [[Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl]]'s five-page abridged version of the 33-page [[Auschwitz Protocols]]: both the [[Vrba–Wetzler report]] and Rosin-Mordowicz report. The reports described in detail the operations of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] extermination camp.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171020114256/http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/saviors/diplomats/list/george-mandel-mantello-485/]&lt;/ref&gt; The second was a 6-page Hungarian report, that detailed the ghettoization and deportation of 435,000 Hungarian Jews, as updated to 19 June 1944, by towns, to Auschwitz.&lt;ref name= "Kranzler2000p87"&gt;{{cite book| author= David Kranzler |title=The Man Who Stopped the Trains to Auschwitz: George Mantello, El Salvador, and Switzerland's Finest Hour |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Cx3yenDCQC |year=2000 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |isbn=978-0-8156-2873-6 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's publication resulted in [[Winston Churchill]]'s letter: "There is no doubt that this persecution of Jews in Hungary and their expulsion from enemy territory is probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Winston Churchill]], in a letter to his Foreign Secretary dated 11 July 1944, wrote, "There is no doubt that this persecution of Jews in Hungary and their expulsion from enemy territory is probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world...."

Following the report's publication, the administration of US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] turned to the newly created [[War Refugee Board]] (WRB) established as a result of activism by the "Bergson Group" led by [[Hillel Kook]]&lt;ref name="shoahpdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bergson Group|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205990.pdf |publisher=Shoah Resource Center, The International School for Holocaust Studies |accessdate=9 June 2017|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- {{Citation needed|reason=mistake|date=February 2014}} Actually, there is zero mistake and honestly, no citation is needed because it is common knowledge. --&gt; and later by Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr]] and team in search of a solution to the humanitarian crisis in Hungary. In spring 1944, President Roosevelt dispatched [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]] official [[Iver C. Olsen]] to Stockholm as a representative of the WRB. Olsen was tasked specifically by the President with finding a way to aid the Hungarian Jews. This, however, was not the sole reason for Olsen being posted to Sweden. In addition to his duties with the WRB, Olsen was also secretly functioning as the chief of [[Economic warfare|currency operations]] for the Stockholm branch of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the United States' wartime espionage service.&lt;ref name="usnews9540"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820011710/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540.htm |archivedate=20 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee's first choice to lead the mission was Count [[Folke Bernadotte]], the vice-chairman of the Swedish [[Red Cross]] and a member of the [[Swedish Royal Family]]. When Bernadotte's proposed appointment was rejected by the Hungarians, Lauer suggested Wallenberg as a potential replacement.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt; Olsen was introduced to Wallenberg by Lauer in June 1944 and came away from the meeting impressed and, shortly thereafter, appointed Wallenberg to lead the mission.&lt;ref name=TWS/&gt; Olsen's selection of Wallenberg met with objections from some US officials who doubted his reliability, in light of existing commercial relationships between businesses owned by the Wallenberg family and the German government. These differences were eventually overcome and the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] agreed to the American request to assign Wallenberg to its [[legation]] in Budapest as part of an arrangement in which Wallenberg's appointment was granted in exchange for a lessening of American diplomatic pressure on neutral Sweden to curtail their nation's [[free-trade]] policies toward Germany.&lt;ref name="usnews9540_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540_2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820014639/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540_2.htm |archivedate=20 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|Mission to Budapest}}

== Mission to Budapest ==
When Wallenberg reached the Swedish legation in Budapest in July 1944, the campaign against the Jews of Hungary had already been under way for several months. Between May and July 1944, Eichmann and his associates had deported over 400,000 Jews by freight train. Of those deported all but 15,000 were sent directly to the German Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in southern [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="library"/&gt; By the time of Wallenberg's arrival there were only 230,000 Jews remaining in Hungary. With fellow Swedish diplomat [[Per Anger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ilya |last=Garger |title=Milestones: Died. Per Anger. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501020909-346286,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312173605/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C501020909-346286%2C00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2 September 2002 |archive-date=12 March 2016 |accessdate=13 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he issued "protective passports" (German: ''Schutz-Pass''), which identified the bearers as Swedish subjects awaiting repatriation and thus prevented their deportation. Although not legal, these documents looked official and were generally accepted by German and Hungarian authorities, who sometimes were also bribed.&lt;ref name=NYT03301980/&gt; The Swedish legation in Budapest also succeeded in negotiating with the German authorities so that the bearers of the protective passes would be treated as Swedish citizens and be exempt from having to wear the [[yellow badge]] required for Jews.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt; When the German government said the travel passes were invalid, Wallenberg appealed for help from [[Baroness Elisabeth Kemény]], wife of Baron [[Gábor Kemény (politician, 1910–1946)|Gábor Kemény]], Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs in Budapest. She convinced her husband to have 9,000 passes honoured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Hundreds-Honor-Wallenberg-At-Concert/id-c6fa5d03d0c40bf271f4805b06626646|title=Hundreds Honor Wallenberg At Concert|website=Apnewsarchive.com|access-date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the money raised by the board, Wallenberg rented 32 buildings in Budapest and declared them to be [[extraterritorial]], protected by [[diplomatic immunity]]. He put up signs such as "The Swedish Library" and "The Swedish Research Institute" on their doors and hung oversized Swedish flags on the front of the buildings to bolster the deception. The buildings eventually housed almost 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=TWS/&gt;

Sandor Ardai, one of the drivers working for Wallenberg, recounted what Wallenberg did when he intercepted a trainload of Jews about to leave for Auschwitz:

{{quote|... he climbed up on the roof of the train and began handing in protective passes through the doors which were not yet sealed. He ignored orders from the Germans for him to get down, then the [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] men began shooting and shouting at him to go away. He ignored them and calmly continued handing out passports to the hands that were reaching out for them. I believe the Arrow Cross men deliberately aimed over his head, as not one shot hit him, which would have been impossible otherwise.

Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member [[Pál Szalai]] to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan to blow up the Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT03301980/&gt;

According to [[Giorgio Perlasca]], who posed as the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Consul (representative)|consul-general]] to [[Hungary]] in the winter of 1944 and saved 5218 [[Jews]], [[Pál Szalai]] lied to save his life during his criminal trial, and the history of the saving is different.&lt;ref name="ushm"&gt;[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], ''[https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn504674 Oral history interview with Giorgio Perlasca]'', 5 September 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mixeritalia"&gt;Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Mixer, ''Giorgio Perlasca'', [[Giovanni Minoli]], Rai, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varese"&gt;VareseNews, ''[http://www.varesenews.it/2010/05/gli-uomini-giusti-muoiono-di-sabato/147029/ Gli uomini giusti muoiono di sabato]'', 22 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mixerisraele"&gt;Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Fondazione Giorgio Perslasca, ''Giorgio Perlasca - il mixer israeliano in ebraico'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Raoul Wallenberg (who was already dead at the time of the Szalai's deposition) saved hundreds of people but was not directly involved in the plan to save the ghetto. While Perlasca was posing as the Spanish consul-general, he learned of the intention to burn down the ghetto. Shocked and incredulous, he asked for a direct hearing with the Hungarian interior minister Gábor Vajna, in the basement of the Budapest City Hall where he had his headquarter, and threatened legal and economic measures against the "3000 Hungarian citizens" (in fact, a much smaller number) declared by Perlasca as residents of Spain, and similar treatment to Hungarian residents in two Latin American republics, to force the minister to withdraw the project.  This actually happened in the following days.&lt;ref name="mixeritalia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mixerisraele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ushm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="varese" /&gt;

On 29 October 1944, elements of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] under Marshal [[Rodion Malinovsky]] launched an [[Budapest offensive|offensive against Budapest]] and by late December the city had been encircled by Soviet forces.

=== Disputes regarding his death ===

Several former prisoners have claimed to have seen Wallenberg after his reported death in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4181427.stm |title=Search for Swedish Holocaust hero  |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=17 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1949, former German Colonel [[Theodor von Dufving]], a prisoner of war, provided statements concerning Wallenberg.

The prisoner claimed that he was a Swedish diplomat and said he was there "through a great error".&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

[[Nazi hunter]] [[Simon Wiesenthal]] searched for Wallenberg and collected several testimonies. For example, British businessman [[Greville Wynne]], who was imprisoned in the Lubyanka prison in 1962 for his connection to [[KGB]] [[defector]] [[Oleg Penkovsky]], stated that he had talked to, but could not see the face of, a man who claimed to be a Swedish diplomat.&lt;ref name="Alan Levy 2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Levy |title=Nazi Hunter: The Wiesenthal File |location=London |publisher=Robinson |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on [[Wrangel Island]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Raoul Wallenberg: The Mystery Lives On |last=Rosenfeld |first=Harvey |year=2005 |publisher=iUniverse |location= |isbn=0-595-35544-7 |page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFDNcB4NGdQC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Raoul Wallenberg Is Alive!

They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary be opened to impartial researchers.

In 2012, Russian [[lieutenant-general]] Vasily Khristoforov, head of the registration branch of the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Russian Federal Security Service]], said that the Wallenberg case was still open. He dismissed allegations of a continuing cover-up; referring to the legacy Soviet agency from which his department sprang, Khristoforov said: "This is another state and a different special service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/newsflash/index.ssf/story/russia-says-the-wallenberg-case-is-still/c7372c74d2a9436db517116e0d506033 |newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]] |location=New Orleans |title=Russia says the Wallenberg case is still open (link broken) |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |page=A7 |issue=Saint Tammany Edition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130020912/http://www.nola.com/newsflash/index.ssf/story/russia-says-the-wallenberg-case-is-still/c7372c74d2a9436db517116e0d506033 |archivedate=30 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Declared death ''in absentia'' ===
On 29 March 2016, an announcement was made by the [[Swedish Tax Agency]] that a petition to have Wallenberg [[Declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']] had been submitted. It stated that if he does not report to the Tax Agency before 14 October 2016, he will be declared dead legally: "''Raoul Wallenberg kallas jämlikt 7 § (2005:130) om dödförklaring att senast den 14 oktober 2016 anmäla sig hos Skatteverket''."&lt;ref name="inabsentia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eriksson|first1=Martin|last2=Töpffer|first2=Michael|title=Raoul Wallenberg begärs dödförklarad|trans-title=Petition to declare Raol Wallenberg dead|date=29 March 2016|url=http://www.expressen.se/dinapengar/raoul-wallenberg-begars-dodsforklarad/|newspaper=[[Expressen]]|accessdate=31 March 2016 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Svensson|first1=Frida|title=Raoul Wallenberg begärs dödförklarad|trans-title=Petition to declare Raol Wallenberg dead|date=29 March 2016|url=http://www.svd.se/raoul-wallenberg-kommer-dodforklaras-i-host |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=31 March 2016 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallenberg was declared dead in October 2016. Consistently with the approach used in cases where the circumstances of death were not known, the Swedish tax agency recorded the date of his death as 31 July 1952, five years after he went missing.&lt;ref name="BBCNews_20161031"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37824692|title= Sweden declares Holocaust hero Raoul Wallenberg officially dead|work= BBC News|date=31 October 2016|access-date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Expressen&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/raoul-wallenberg-dodforklarad/|title= Raoul Wallenberg har förklarats död|publisher=Expressen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to US intelligence==
In May 1996, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) released thousands of previously classified documents regarding Raoul Wallenberg, in response to requests filed under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref name="usnews9540"/&gt; The documents, along with an investigation conducted by the newsmagazine ''[[US News and World Report]]'', appeared to confirm the long-held suspicion that Wallenberg was an American [[Asset (intelligence)|intelligence asset]] during his time in Hungary. In addition to Wallenberg's name appearing on a roster found in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]&lt;ref name="usnews9540_4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540_4.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112011248/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540_4.htm |archivedate=12 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |title=The Angel Was a Spy  - US News and World Report|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which listed the names of operatives associated with the CIA's wartime predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the documents also included a 1954 memo from an anonymous CIA source that identified a Hungarian-exile living in Stockholm who, according to the author: "assisted…in inserting Roul {{sic}} Wallenberg into Hungary during WWII as an agent of OSS."&lt;ref name="usnews9540_2"/&gt; Another declassified memorandum written in 1990 by the curator of the CIA's [[CIA Library|Historical Intelligence Collection]] William Henhoeffer, characterized the conclusion that Wallenberg was working for the OSS while in Budapest as being "essentially correct".&lt;ref name="usnews9540"/&gt;

More telling was a communique sent on 7 November 1944 by the OSS, [[Secret Intelligence Branch]] in [[Bari, Italy]], which apparently acknowledged that Wallenberg was acting as an unofficial [[liaison officer|liaison]] between the OSS and the [[Anti-fascism|Hungarian Independence Movement]] (MFM), an underground [[Resistance during World War II|anti-Nazi resistance organization]].&lt;ref name="raoulwallenberg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/news/raoul-wallenberg-s-unexplored/|title=Raoul Wallenberg’s Unexplored Intelligence Connections In Hungary «  The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation|publisher=raoulwallenberg.net|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSS message notes Wallenberg's contacts with Geza Soos, a high-ranking MFM leader and further explains that Soos "may only be contacted" through the Swedish legation in Budapest, which was Wallenberg's workplace and also served as the operational center for his attempts to aid the [[Hungarian Jews]]. The same message's assertion that Wallenberg "will know if he (Soos) is not in Budapest" is also curious, in that by November 1944 Soos was in hiding and knowledge of his whereabouts would only have been available to individuals closely involved with the MFM.&lt;ref name="usnews9540_3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540_3.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112003814/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/960513/archive_009540_3.htm |archivedate=12 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |title=The Angel Was a Spy  - US News and World Report|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is given further weight by additional evidence&lt;ref name="usnews9540_3"/&gt; suggesting that communications from the MFM to US intelligence were transmitted first to Stockholm and then relayed to Washington via Iver C. Olsen, the American OSS operative who initially recruited Wallenberg to go to Budapest in June 1944.

This particular disclosure has given rise to speculation as to whether, in addition to his efforts to rescue the Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Hungary's pro-Nazi government]] on behalf of the OSS.&lt;ref name="usnews9540_2"/&gt; This would also seem to add some credence to the potential explanation that it was his association with US intelligence that led to Wallenberg being targeted by Soviet authorities in January 1945.&lt;ref name="usnews9540_4"/&gt; Several other humanitarians who had helped refugees during World War II disappeared behind the Iron Curtain in the period 1949/50, several years after Wallenberg's disappearance. OSS ties may have been of interest to the Soviets, but are not a complete explanation because some of those detained, i.e. Hermann Field and Herta Field, had not worked for the OSS. All of these humanitarians, however, like Wallenberg, had interacted with a large number of anti-fascist and socialist refugees during the War, and this experience was used in the Stalin regime's factional politics and show trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Rescue-Flight-American-Relief-Workers/dp/0803225253 |last=Subak |first=Susan Elisabeth |title= Rescue and Flight: American Relief Workers Who Defied the Nazis |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |year= 2010 |pages=342 |isbn=978-0803225251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
{{main|Wallenberg family}}
In 2009, reporter [[Joshua Harris Prager|Joshua Prager]] wrote an article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' profiling the long-term toll that Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance had on his family. His mother, Maj, and his stepfather, Fredrik von Dardel, spent the rest of their lives searching for their son. They both committed suicide by overdosing on pills two days apart in 1979. Their daughter, Nina Lagergren, Raoul's half-sister, attributed their suicide to their despair about never finding their son. Lagergren and Raoul's half-brother Guy von Dardel established organizations and worked to find their brother or confirmation of his death. At the request of their parents, they were to assume he was alive until the year 2000.&lt;ref name=WSJ2009-02-28/&gt;

During the war, the Wallenberg bank, [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]], collaborated with the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. considered [[Jacob Wallenberg (1892–1980)|Jacob Wallenberg]] strongly pro-German, and in 1945, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1989/11/08/archive/authors-claim-wallenberg-family-assisted-nazis-in-banking-deals|title=Authors Claim Wallenberg Family Assisted Nazis in Banking Deals|date=8 November 1989|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gowland|first=Rob|date=19 June 1996|title=Banks' nazi connections exposed|url=|journal=The Guardian (Socialist Party of Australia)|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Alan Lelchuk]] who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may have chosen not to use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/fiction-as-a-means-to-uncover-the-truth|title=Fiction as a Means to Uncover the Truth|access-date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Wallenberg myth===
In a 2004 paper, Hungarian historian and Holocaust survivor [[Randolph L. Braham]] discussed the mythologizing of Wallenberg's rescue activities. Braham notes that Wallenberg's rescue activities did not start in earnest until the Arrow Cross coup in October 1944, and reached their greatest proportions during the siege. He found that through personal heroism and diplomatic support, Wallenberg managed to save about 7,000 to 9,000 Jews. Hovever, during the Cold War, his death was exploited in Western anti-Soviet propaganda; in order to make the "Soviet crime" seem worse, his rescue operations were greatly exaggerated. Wallenberg was incorrectly identified as the savior of all Jews in Budapest, or at least 100,000 of them, in official statements as well as many popular books and documentaries. As a result, the rescue efforts of other agents in Budapest has been marginalized or ignored.&lt;ref name="Braham"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braham |first1=Randolph L. |authorlink1=Randolph L. Braham |title=Rescue Operations in Hungary: Myths and Realities |journal=East European Quarterly |date=2004 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=183-184 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]], who puts the number of lives saved by Wallenberg at 4,500, states Lutz and other neutral emissaries saved more Jews, but Wallenberg was the only one who frequently confronted the Nazis and their Arrow Cross accomplices. Although "fact and fiction mixed" in the testimony of Jewish survivors about Wallenberg after the war, Bauer writes, Wallenberg's "fame was certainly justified by his extroadinary exploits". Bauer also points out that the focus on heroic actions taken by Wallenberg and other non-Jewish rescuers obscures the heroism of Jews who also carried out rescue actions in Budapest in the final months and were forgotten after liberation. According to Bauer, Wallenberg had a modest personality and "would have been the first" to reject fictionalized anecdotes and exaggerated totals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda|authorlink=Yehuda Bauer |title=Jews for Sale?: Nazi-Jewish Negotiations, 1933–1945 |date=1994 |location=New Haven|publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=9780300059137  |ref=harv |language=en|pp=234, 238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Brinkmann''' (born 28 August 1893 in [[Greene (Einbeck)|Greene]]; died nach 1973&lt;ref name="Holtz1"&gt;Bärbel Holtz, ''Die Protokolle des Preußischen Staatsministeriums'', S. 536&lt;/ref&gt;) was a German economist and Secretary of State in the time of Nazism.

After he had finished school, Brinkmann studied legal science and economics. After the outbreak of the first World War he joined German army and served as an artillerist. 1916 he left the army because of an injury. He moved to banks and worked since 1919 in [[Göttingen]] for the [[Reichsbank]]. 1923 he overtook the guidance of intern revision of the Reichsbank in [[Berlin]] and worked later in the directory. Afterwards he was member of board of Reichsbank[[Hamburg]]. 1931 he became director of the Reichsbank in [[Aschaffenburg]].

==Period of Nazism==
After the [[seizure|transfer of power to the Nazis]] he was in spring of 1933, board member at the German Golddiskontbank and 1937 at the Reichsbank&lt;ref name="Aly435"&gt;[[Götz Aly]], Bundesarchiv, [[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]]: ''Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europäischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933–1945.'' Band 2: ''Deutsches Reich 1938 – August 1939''. München 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-486-58523-0}}, S. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ministry of Economic Affairs]] Brinkmann in 1934 initially was working under the new Minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]] as a general officer and was promoted there in 1938 to the State Council. In early February 1938, he was appointed the Reich Economics Ministry State Secretary. From 1938 to 1939 he was also on the board of the Hermann Göring Reichswerke. From January 1939 Brinkmann was briefly vice president of the Reichsbank&lt;ref name="Aly435"/&gt; (. SS No. 308 241) and received in November 1938 to the rank of [[Oberführer]]&lt;ref name="Aly435"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dws-xip"&gt;[http://www.dws-xip.pl/reich/biografie/lista4/lista4.html Rudolf Brinkmann] bei www.dws-xip.pl&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he became in 1939 a member of NSDAP is unsecure.&lt;ref name="Aly435" /&gt; Brinkmann was a board member of the VEW and [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref name="Holtz1"/&gt;

Mid February 1939 Brinkmann was on leave due to illness and placed into pending status. In May 1939, due to the duration of his illness, Brinkmann was evidently acute [[bipolar disorder|manic-depressive illness]], what has been described as "severe nervous breakdown"&lt;ref&gt;Willi A. Boelcke: ''Die deutsche Wirtschaft 1930–1945'', Droste, 1983, S. 191f.&lt;/ref&gt; he was then admitted to a mental hospital in [[Bonn]], where he remained until the end of World War II in a closed hospital.&lt;ref name="Aly435" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bähr u. a.: ''Der Flick-Konzern im Dritten Reich''.

'''Shep''' (1 May 1971 – 17 January 1987) was a famous ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[dog]], a [[border collie]].  Shep was bought by the [[BBC]] to replace [[Patch (dog)|Patch]], one of [[Petra (dog)|Petra]]'s puppies, born in 1965.  He became the main Blue Peter dog when Petra died in 1977.

Shep is remembered by British [[TV]] viewers as inseparable from ''[[Blue Peter]]'' presenter [[John Noakes]].  Shep was excitable, and Noakes would often have to restrain him.  Noakes' common refrain, "Get down, Shep!", became a [[catchphrase]], and [[The Barron Knights]] released a [[song]] with that title.  Shep left ''Blue Peter'' when Noakes departed in June 1978.

Shep also appeared with Noakes in six series of ''[[Go With Noakes]]'', from 1976 to 1980. Noakes left ''Blue Peter'' on 26 June 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC programme catalogue entry for Blue Peter, transmission date 26.6.78|url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LCH2460H||accessdate=30 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the BBC offered to let him keep Shep, as the dog had lived with him since his TV debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/get-down-shep-blue-peters-13107409|title='Get down Shep!' – Blue Peter's action man John Noakes dies aged 83 after battle with Alzheimer's|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Shep living with Noakes, the dog was always legally owned by the BBC and in rules that also applied to himself whilst under contract to the BBC, he could not use Shep for advertising or commercial purposes.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15315656.Obituary___John_Noakes__popular_presenter_of_Blue_Peter_in_the_1960s_and_70s/|title=Obituary – John Noakes, popular presenter of Blue Peter in the 1960s and 70s|publisher=The Herald|accessdate=29  May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noakes was paid a stipend to cover all Shep's costs from the ''Blue Peter'' budget (as was Peter Purves for 'Petra' and later Simon Groom for 'Goldie') and as part of the agreement to keep Shep after leaving the show, Noakes agreed to continuing the no-advertising condition.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Biddy. Blue Peter: The Inside Story. Interpet Ringpull BBC Books 1989. {{ISBN|978-0948955501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, shortly after leaving the show, Noakes was furious to discover that what he called his "dog money" ceased to be paid and he confronted [[Biddy Baxter]] in a phone call. Baxter was adamant that since Shep had left ''Blue Peter'', the programme should no longer be responsible for any of Shep's costs, although she did sympathise with some of his argument and felt that the BBC should pay Noakes for Shep to appear in ''Go With Noakes'' or for 'personal appearances' the dog made. Regardless, she later wrote that Noakes was too angry to discuss the matter and the two rarely spoke again.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Biddy. Blue Peter: The Inside Story. Interpet Ringpull BBC Books 1989. {{ISBN|978-0948955501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this angry confrontation, Noakes relinquished Shep, who went to live with Edith Menzies.

Noakes subsequently appeared in a series of television advertisements for [[Spillers]] "Choice Cuts" dog food, using a dog that was indistinguishable from Shep but named Skip.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|4NKgekO9bAo|IL004 002 Spillers Choice Cuts Dog Food John Noakes Blue Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clear subterfuge led to a deeper rift between him and Baxter.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Biddy (1989), ''Blue Peter The Inside Story'', Interpet Ringpull [[BBC Books]]; {{ISBN|978-0-948955-50-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noakes called her a "stupid woman" in a televised 2008 documentary celebrating the show's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/406281dd3ba24b2f858069665371dde6|title=Blue Peter at 50|website=Genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiXmIQ5g2J0 |title=Blue peter appeals |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shep died in 1987, and Noakes often became emotional when asked about him; he openly wept on an edition of ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' when hostess [[Anne Robinson]] asked him about the dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a96692/anne-robinson-makes-blue-peter-star-cry.html Showbiz - News - Anne Robinson makes 'Blue Peter' star cry - Digital Spy]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The '''Slime''' is the mascot of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' [[role-playing video game]] franchise. Originally inspired by the game ''[[Wizardry]]'' to be a weak and common monster for the video game ''[[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]]'', Slime has appeared in almost every ''Dragon Quest'' game since. The character's popularity led to the appearance of many varieties of slimes, including [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] characters, and even emerging as the protagonist of the ''[[Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime|Rocket Slime]]'' video game series.

The Slime has been placed on a multitude of different kinds of merchandise. The Slime's friendliness, limited power, and appealing form have caused the Slime to become a popular character and symbol of the ''Dragon Quest'' series.

==Character design==
The inspiration for the Slime came to [[Yuji Horii]], the creator of ''[[Dragon Quest]]'', from a role-playing game called ''[[Wizardry]]''. "I was really hooked on 'Wizardy,' the PC game, ... There's...slime-looking characters ..., so I got the inspiration from it. I was doodling the slime-looking character and I took it to [[Akira Toriyama|Mr. Toriyama]], who did the character design, and he made it the Slime we see today."&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt; Horii said that when it was originally conceived, the Slime was "a pile of goo", but Toriyama's design came back as a tear-drop which they considered "perfect".&lt;ref name=yh/&gt;

==Attributes==
===Personality===
In most appearances of the Slime, it is an antagonist, and occasionally a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]. In some ''Dragon Quest'' titles, slimes also appear as friendly [[non-player character]]s and peaceful inhabitants of cities.&lt;ref name="probably"/&gt; Friendly slimes usually greet players with the phrase, "I'm not a bad slime!".&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; Slimes, like many monsters in the ''Dragon Quest'' series, have a certain verbal [[tic]], "slurp".&lt;ref name="slurp"/&gt; Slimes also replace certain words or syllables with the word "goo" (''e.g.'' "human" becomes "gooman"), or other words relating to slime or goo, when they speak.&lt;ref name="slurp"/&gt;

===Outward appearance===
There are many different types of slimes found throughout the ''Dragon Quest'' and ''Rocket Slime'' series. These include slimes in different colors, bubble slimes, which look like pools of slime, nautical slimes that wear [[conch]] shells, the rare metal slimes, which have high defense, give out large amounts of [[experience point]]s, and tend to flee from battle, healslimes, which have tentacles, and king slimes, which are very large slimes wearing crowns and come in various versions, such as regular or metal.&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt;

==Appearances==
The Slime made its first appearance in ''[[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]]'' as the first and weakest enemy in the game, and has made a similar appearance in all subsequent ''Dragon Quest'' titles.&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt; In ''[[Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride|Dragon Quest V]]'', the monster is an easy recruit that learns a variety of [[Magic (gaming)|magic spells]]. The Slime is also the protagonist of its own spinoff series, beginning with ''[[Slime (series)|Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest]]'', a Japanese [[Game Boy Advance]] title.&lt;ref name="rocketslimes"/&gt; It was followed by ''[[Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime]]'', which was released worldwide for the [[Nintendo DS]], and the Japanese-exclusive title, ''Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]].&lt;ref name="rocketslimes"/&gt; These games follow a nation of slimes who are intelligent and civilized, but also cute and somewhat comical.&lt;ref name=dojo/&gt; In the North American [[Game localization|localization]] of the ''Dragon Quest'' games for the Nintendo DS, joking references and puns are made about slimes.&lt;ref name="there"/&gt; Slime also appeared in three [[Fictional crossovers in video games|crossover games]] along with characters from [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' franchise: ''[[Itadaki Street Mobile|Itadaki Street DS]]'', ''[[Mario Sports Mix]]'', and ''[[Fortune Street]]''.&lt;ref name="slurp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sportsmix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="street"/&gt;

==Analysis==
Reviewers have seen the slime as symbolic of the ''Dragon Quest'' series in the same way that the [[Moogle]] represents ''[[Final Fantasy]]''.&lt;ref name="ed"/&gt; ''Dragon Quest'' creator Yuji Horii speculated that the popularity of the slime may come from its cuteness, how it is easy to defeat, and while the protagonists change in every ''Dragon Quest'' game, the slime is always there.&lt;ref name="there"/&gt; [[GamesRadar]] speculated that the intense "grinding", or fighting of enemies in the ''Dragon Quest'' series exposed players to an abundance of slimes, but a positive association was created by their familiarity.&lt;ref name="grinding"/&gt; Yoshiki Watabe, producer of ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]]'', hypothesized its popularity came from it being a "well designed character", but "simple", being accessible to anyone.&lt;ref name="rocketslimes"/&gt;

==Cultural impact==
===Merchandise===
As the most recognizable symbol of the best-selling [[video game]] series in [[Japan]], the Slime has been featured prominently in ''Dragon Quest''-related merchandise.&lt;ref name="grinding"/&gt; It has its own section called 'Smile Slime' on the Square Enix JP shopping website.&lt;ref name=crystal/&gt;&lt;ref name="smileslime"/&gt; Slime merchandise includes [[plush]] toys, pencil cases, keychains, [[game controller]]s, a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]], and several boardgames including one titled ''Dragon Quest Slime Racing''.&lt;ref name=crystal/&gt;&lt;ref name="smileslime"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dragon/&gt;&lt;ref name=product/&gt;&lt;ref name="boardgame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="venture"/&gt; In Japan, pork filled steam buns shaped like slimes have been sold.&lt;ref name="buns"/&gt; For ''Dragon Quest's'' 25th anniversary, special items were sold including [[business cards]], tote bags, and crystal figurines.&lt;ref name=crystal/&gt;

===Reception===
The ''Dragon Quest'' Slime has received positive reception from critics and fans, being called the "most prolific" of all the "memorable" monsters from the series and is one of the most recognizable characters in gaming.&lt;ref name=yh/&gt;&lt;ref name=kurt/&gt; The Slime has also been called cute and charming by several critics, especially when reviewing ''Rocket Slime''.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt; [[GamesRadar]] listed it as the most lovable blob in video games, calling them the "equivalent of training wheels" due to how easy they are to defeat typically, but also saying that their weird smile makes players think twice about killing them.&lt;ref name=blob/&gt; They also listed it as a character they wished they knew less about.&lt;ref name="less"/&gt; They stated that while they started out as nothing more than things for players to kill and not feel guilty about, the playable role of a Slime in the ''[[Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime|Dragon Quest Heroes]]'' series made them realize they were more than just generic enemies.&lt;ref name="less"/&gt; In the January 2010 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', the editors listed the Slime among its Favorite Punching Bags, a list including [[Goomba]]s and [[Octorok]]s.&lt;ref name="powermarch"/&gt; They wrote that "The Slimes are just so cute and friendly-looking, it's almost hard to slay them. But you know, a hero's gotta do what a hero's gotta do."&lt;ref name="powermarch"/&gt;

'''Strategic essentialism''', a major concept in [[postcolonial theory]], was introduced in the 1980s by the [[India]]n [[literary critic]] and [[literary theory|theorist]] [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=G. Ritze and J.M. Ryan |title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2010 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a political tactic in which minority groups, nationalities, or ethnic groups mobilize on the basis of shared gendered, cultural, or political identity to represent themselves. While strong differences may exist between members of these groups, and amongst themselves they engage in continuous debates, it is sometimes advantageous for them to temporarily "essentialize" themselves and to bring forward their group identity in a simplified way to achieve certain goals, such as [[wikt:equal rights|equal rights]] or [[antiglobalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B. Ashcroft et al. |title=Key Concepts in Post-colonial Studies |date=1998 |pages=159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spivak's understanding of the term was first introduced in the context of cultural negotiations, never as an anthropological category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Susan Abraham |year=2009 |title=Strategic Essentialism in Nationalist Discourses: Sketching a Feminist Agenda in the Study of Religion |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/266799 |journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|volume=25, Number 1|pages=156–161 |via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2008 book ''Other Asias,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Other Asias |author=[[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=978-1405102070 |location=Malden, MA |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spivak disavowed the term, indicating her dissatisfaction with how the term has been deployed in nationalist enterprises to promote (non-strategic) [[essentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=G. Ritze and J.M. Ryan |title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2010 |page=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The concept also comes up regularly in [[queer theory]], [[feminist theory]], [[deaf studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paddy Ladd |title=Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pr649oNCaSMC&amp;pg=PA81 |date=2003 |publisher=Multilingual Matters Ltd. |isbn=1-85359-546-2 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically in the work of [[Luce Irigaray]], who refers to it as [[mimesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Virpi Lehtinen |title=Luce Irigaray's phenomenology of feminine being |publisher=State University of New York Press |date=2014 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural abuse''' is the process by which an individual is dealt with unfairly by a system of harm in ways that the person cannot protect themselves against, cannot deal with, cannot break out of, cannot mobilise against, cannot seek justice for, cannot redress, cannot avoid, cannot reverse and cannot change.

Every system contains at least one level at which structural abuse occurs, when the actions of the system takes over the actions of individuals within that system to create structures by which abuse of others occurs.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Structural abuse should not be confused with [[structural violence]]. Structural violence refers to action committed by a larger society, such as [[racism]] or [[classism]] in an entire society. Structural abuse refers to actions that are not necessarily endorsed by the broader society.

==Classes==
There are three kinds of structural abuse:
# Imposed interference with an individual's personal space-time-energy control; 
# "Normal" interferences with an individual's ability to control relationships and their construction; 
# Missing connections that harness the physical, mental and emotional energies of a person over a protracted period, thus causing damage to both the relationship and the physical and emotional wellbeing of the person being kept waiting.

Structural abuse is indirect, and exploits the victim on an emotional, mental and psychological level. It manifests itself in specific situations within each cultural, social, corporate and family framework.

== Impacts ==

Structural abuse is also called societal abuse. It has four permanent impacts upon the individuals subjected to it:
* Cognitive abuse by which the meaning of the world is changed forever
* Sexual abuse in which a person's identity is changed for life
* Emotional abuse by which the capability to function in a human manner is impaired
* Physical abuse that is imposed upon an individual or group by a personal, social, commercial or cultural system of dominance.

An example of how surface-level structural abuses are accepted by the community is where a political journalist{{Who|date=August 2011}} in Australia presented a review of the day's work within the Australian Parliament in August 2011. During the one-minute presentation, consisting of 18 points, she began eight new points with the word "Now". "Now" is a fixation cue for viewers to forget about the past and the future, but to concentrate only on the "now" time frame. The use of the word was surplus to the data she presented, and even contradictory to it. The regularity of the word "Now", its placement at the front of each point by which the interpretation of each point is shaped, and the later repetitive use of the word by the anchor journalist steering the news program, who does not normally use such a control habit, showed that the word was a verbal dissociative cue by which hypnotic states are induced.

Other examples include:
*  Standing over another in a dominating manner;
*  Calling people unkind{{clarify|this smacks of appeal to pity and pov terminology|date=May 2014}} names;
*  Snatching belongings of another, refusing to return them immediately;
*  Being late for meetings;
*  Talking over other people, thus excluding them from participating in the discussion;
*  Touching another in a sexual manner without their verbal or body language permission;
*  Punching people on the arm as "a gesture of friendship";
*  Torturing newcomers to the organisation as a form of Rites of Passage.

'''Cues indicating a Structurally Abusive Corporate System'''

Structural Abuse Indicators include the inability of an outsider to make contact on a personal level with the people who work within an organisation. Cafe meetings turn discussions into plagiarisable events, while lack of agendas for high performance meetings create heightened levels of feeling threatened which impacts on how such meetings are approached. Being kept on hold with music blaring down the earpiece is structural abuse because by listening for the resumption of the discussion there is no escape from the sound.

'''Structurally abusive political systems'''

Making promises which are not kept is a category of political structural abuse. Unkept promises fixate the expectations that people create from such promises. Expectations that create physical arousal states and a physical, emotional, intellectual and behavioural mindset by which to accommodate the fulfillment of those promises. When those visualisations of the future and its mobilisation of personal responsiveness is not satisfied in a timely or appropriate manner the result is an extended period of physiological arousal which can turn into stress and emotional depression over time. Hence the anger responses of electorates to the unkept promises of politicians, as well as the frustrated responses of victims of abuses of court processes (e.g. "protective" orders) to the [[abuse of discretion]] exhibited by misfeasant court and law enforcement officers who can claim to be acting under authority or color of law.

'''Community Control Functions of Structural Abuse'''

All categories of structural abuse involve the manipulative control of time, energy, focus and connection between people, groups and organisations, in the service of one side, and to the disservice of the other.

Most people call structural abuse "bad manners" or "rudeness", since it generally breaks conventions by which there is mutual control within each situation.

Each instance of structural abuse breaks down the positive relationship between the two parties, creating for those being abused increasingly negative relationships built on expectations of exploitation, snatching of time, waste of effort, missing redress, and feelings of entrapment from which it is hard to escape.

'''Dealing with structural abuse'''

Structural abuse is helped by talking therapies in which those abused find a listener, and then find their voice by which to begin to remove the power of the abusing system to continue to harm their inner identities.

Currently in most countries, there is no formal [[law]] that has been formulated against structural abuse, protecting the victim from such abuse, and enabling him or her to approach the [[court]] for relevant justice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In management theory, the thesis that '''Structure follows Strategy''' was proposed by the historian [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]]. This means that a corporate structure is created in order to implement a given corporate strategy.

==Thesis==
Chandler substantiated his '''Structure follows Strategy''' thesis based on four case studies of American conglomerates that dominated their industry from the 1920s onward. Chandler described how the chemical company [[Du Pont]], the automobile manufacturer [[General Motors]], the energy company [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] and the retailer [[Sears Roebuck]] managed a growth and diversification strategy by adopting the revolutionary multi-division form. The M-Form is a corporate federation of semi-independent product or geographic groups plus a headquarters that oversees the corporate strategy and coordinates interdependencies. 

Although the organizational M-form was implemented differently by each of the organizations, Chandler showed that the need to restructure arose from a strategic shift driven by new technologies and market changes. The M-form emerged and co-evolved with the development of the transportation and communication industries thereby creating the opportunity to manage across time and space.

He described [[corporate strategy]] as the determination of long-term goals and objectives, the adoption of courses of action and associated allocation of resources required to achieve goals; he defined structure as the design of the organization through which strategy is administered. Changes in an organization's strategy led to new administrative problems which, in turn, required a new or refashioned structure for the successful implementation of the new strategy.

Chandler's thesis argued that new organizational forms are no more than a derivative of strategy as he defined it.

==Antithesis==
Hall and Saias inverted Chandler's thesis, suggesting that '''Strategy Follows Structure'''. For example, they point out that a multidivisional structure biases a firm towards a conglomerate strategy.

==Synthesis==
[[Henry Mintzberg]] offered a balanced view, arguing that the relationship between strategy and structure is reciprocal. "Structure follows strategy ... as the left foot follows the right."

This article is about the concept in biology. For the concept in physics, see [[Symmetry breaking]].

'''Symmetry breaking''' is the process by which uniformity is broken, or the number of points to view invariance are reduced, to generate a more structured and improbable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Rong|author2=Bruce Bowerman |title=Symmetry Breaking in Biology|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2010|volume=2|issue=3|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003475|pmid=20300216|pages=a003475|pmc=2829966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, symmetry breaking is the event where symmetry along a particular axis is lost to establish a polarity.  [[Cell polarity|Polarity]] is a measure for a biological system to distinguish poles along an axis.  This measure is important because it is the first step to building complexity.  For example, during organismal development, one of the first steps for the embryo is to distinguish its [[Ventral#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal-ventral axis]].  The symmetry-breaking event that occurs here will determine which end of this axis will be the ventral side, and which end will be the dorsal side.  Once this distinction is made, then all the structures that are located along this axis can develop at the proper location.  As an example, during human development, the embryo needs to establish where is ‘back’ and where is ‘front’ before complex structures, such as the spine and lungs, can develop in the right location (where the lungs is placed ‘in front’ of the spine).  This relationship between symmetry breaking and complexity was articulated by [[P.W. Anderson]].  He speculated that increasing levels of broken symmetry in many-body systems correlates with increasing complexity and functional specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Philip W.|title=More is Different|journal=Science|year=1972|volume=177|issue=4047|pages=393–396|doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393|pmid=17796623}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a biological perspective, the more complex an organism is, the higher number of symmetry-breaking events can be found.  Without symmetry breaking, building complexity in organisms would be very difficult.

The importance of symmetry breaking in biology is also reflected in the fact that it’s found at all scales.  Symmetry breaking can be found at the macromolecular level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Fei|title=The Signaling Mechanisms Underlying Cell Polarity and Chemotaxis|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002980|pmid=20066099|pages=a002980|pmc=2773618}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at the subcellular level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Jonathan|title=Cellular Polarity in Prokaryotic Organisms|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=6|pmid=20457568|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003368|pages=a003368|pmc=2882128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and even at the tissues and organ level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=James W.|title=Remodeling epithelial cell organization: Transitions between front-rear and apical-basal polarity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a000513|pages=a000513|pmc=2742086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It’s also interesting to note that most asymmetry on a higher scale is a reflection of symmetry breaking on a lower scale.  Cells first need to establish a polarity through a symmetry-breaking event before tissues and organs themselves can be polar.  For example, one model proposes that left-right body axis asymmetry in vertebrates is determined by asymmetry of [[Cilium|cilia]] rotation during early development, which will produces a constant, unidirectional flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babu|first=Deepak|author2=Sudipto Roy |title=Left–right asymmetry: cilia stir up new surprises in the node|journal=Open Biology|year=2013|volume=3|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=A.

this itself seems to be controlled from the macromolecular level by the cytoskeleton.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several examples of symmetry breaking that are currently being studied.  One of the most studied examples is the cortical rotation during ''Xenopus'' development, where this rotation acts as the symmetry-breaking event that determines the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing embryo.  This example is discussed in more detail below.
&lt;br&gt;Another example that involves symmetry breaking is the establishment of dendrites and axon during [[neuron]] development, and the PAR protein network in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. It is thought that a protein called shootin-1 determines which outgrowth in neurons eventually becomes the axon, at it does this by breaking symmetry and accumulating in only one outgrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toriyama|first=Michinori|author2=Tadayuki Shimada |author3=Ki Bum Kim |author4=Mari Mitsuba |author5=Eiko Nomura |author6=Kazuhiro Katsuta |author7=Yuichi Sakumura |author8=Peter Roepstorff |author9=Naoyuki Inagaki  |title=Shootin1: A protein involved in the organization of an asymmetric signal for neuronal polarization|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=2006|volume=175|issue=1|pages=147–157 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200604160 |pmid=17030985 |pmc=2064506}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PAR protein network works under similar mechanisms, where the certain PAR proteins, which are initially homogenous throughout the cell, break their symmetry and are segregated to different ends of the zygote to establish a polarity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motegi|first=Fumio|author2=Geraldine Seydoux |title=The PAR network: redundancy and robustness in a symmetry-breaking system|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=2013|volume=368|issue=1629|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0010|pages=20130010|pmc=3785961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cortical Rotation==
'''Cortical rotation''' is a phenomenon that seems to be limited to ''Xenopus'' and few ancient [[Teleostei|teleosts]], however the underlying mechanisms of cortical rotation have conserved elements that are found in other [[chordate]]s.  Research in this area is on-going and changes to the model described below are to be expected.
In fact, the origin of asymmetry in cell division, cell polarity and the mechanism that breaks the symmetry continue to be topics of intense research.  Since the early 1990s, many discoveries have been made leading to a sound model of the mechanism for symmetry breaking.  This article will focus solely on symmetry breaking in the ''[[Xenopus]]'' embryo, an animal model that has wide application.

A sperm can bind a ''Xenopus'' egg at any position of the pigmented animal hemisphere; however once bound this position then determines the dorsal side of the animal.  The dorsal side of the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] is always directly opposite the [[sperm]] entry point.  The reason being the sperm's [[centriole]] acts as an organizing center for the egg’s [[microtubule]]s. While this observation has been known for quite some time, the question of how all of this works is more complicated.  The molecular mechanisms driving dorsal-ventral asymmetry are a fine example of simplicity and complexity inherent in biology.

==Molecular mechanisms==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Xenopus cortical rotation.jpg|thumb|Schematic of ''Xenopus'' embryo showing some of the molecular mechanisms during cortical rotation.  The sperm centriole acts as a (-) end organizer for microtubules in the cytoplasm of the embryo.  The microtubules grow outward toward the plus end and interact with an area of the embryo call the cortex, which has microtubules that organize (+ end) in the direction of the cortical rotation.  The cortex and cytoplasm are differentiated by density, as the cytoplasm contains the dense yolk of the embryo.
During cortical rotation, microtubules are linked via kinesin motors to elements within the cortex (which are linked to the plasma membrane) and the movement along the microtubules allow the kinesin motors to physically shift the cortex.  This alone does not explain dorsal-ventral axis development, as it has been shown to occur without polymerized microtubules, thus movement of these dorsal-determining elements can occur independent of the cortical microtubule array.  These elements, a signalosome which incompasses Dsh, Wnt 11 (mRNA), β-catenin (mRNA), Fz-7, GSK3, likely occur together in vessicles. VegT acts with Wnt 11 at the dorsal side to activate Xnr1 and Nodal genes that propagate development. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
A series of experiments utilizing UV irradiation, cold temperature and pressure (all of which cause microtubule depolymerization) demonstrated that without polymerized microtubules cortical rotation did not occur and resulted in a mutant ventral phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerhart J, Danilchik M, Doniach T, Roberts S, Rowning B, Stewart R |title=Cortical rotation of the ''Xenopus'' egg: consequences for the anteroposterior pattern of embryonic dorsal development |journal=Development |volume=107 |issue=Suppl |pages=37–51 |year=1989 |pmid=2699856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study also revealed that mutant phenotype could be rescued (returned to normal) by physically turning the embryo, thus mimicking cortical rotation and demonstrating that microtubules were not the determinant of dorsal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(80)90082-2 |vauthors=Scharf SR, Gerhart JC |title=Determination of the dorsal-ventral axis in eggs of ''Xenopus laevis'': complete rescue of UV-impaired eggs by oblique orientation before first cleavage |journal=Dev.

To identify these elements, researchers looked for mRNA and protein that demonstrated localization to either the vegetal pole or the dorsal side of the embryo to find candidates.  The early candidates for the determinant were β-catenin and disheveled (Dsh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heasman J, Crawford A, Goldstone K, Garner-Hamrick P, Gumbiner B, McCrea P, Kintner C, Noro CY, Wylie C |title=Overexpression of cadherins and underexpression of beta-catenin inhibit dorsal mesoderm induction in early ''Xenopus'' embryos |journal=Cell |volume=79 |issue= 5|pages=791–803 |year=1994 |pmid=7528101 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90069-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.146.2.427 |vauthors=Miller JR, Rowning BA, Larabell CA, Yang-Snyder JA, Bates RL, Moon RT |title=Establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis in ''Xenopus'' embryos coincides with the dorsal enrichment of dishevelled that is dependent on cortical rotation |journal=J.

The Dsh protein was fused to a GFP and tracked during cortical rotation, it was observed to be in vesicles that were couriered along microtubules to the dorsal side.  This led researchers to look into other candidates of the Wnt pathway.  Wnt 11 was found to be located specifically at the vegetal pole prior to cortical rotation and is moved to the dorsal side where it activates the [[wnt signaling pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tao Q, Yokota C, Puck H, Kofron M, Birsoy B, Yan D, Asashima M, Wylie CC, Lin X, Heasman J |title=Maternal wnt11 activates the canonical wnt signaling pathway required for axis formation in ''Xenopus'' embryos |journal=Cell |volume=120 |issue= 6|pages=857–71 |year=2005 |pmid=15797385 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT, a T-box transcription factor, is localized to the vegetal cortex and upon cortical rotation is released in a gradient fashion into the embryo to regulate mesoderm development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang J, King ML |title=''Xenopus'' VegT RNA is localized to the vegetal cortex during oogenesis and encodes a novel T-box transcription factor involved in mesodermal patterning |journal=Development |volume=122 |issue=12 |pages=4119–29 |date=December 1996 |pmid=9012531 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9012531}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT activates Wnt expression, so while not acted on or moved during cortical rotation, it is active in dorsal-ventral axis formation.

The question still remains, how are these molecules being moved to the dorsal side?  This is still not completely known, however evidence suggests that microtubule bundles within the cortex are interacting with kinesin (plus-end directed) motors to become organized into parallel arrays within the cortex and this motion of the motors is the cause of the rotation of the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marrari Y, Rouviere C, Houliston E |title=Complementary roles for dynein and kinesins in the ''Xenopus'' egg cortical rotation |journal=Dev Biol |volume=271 |issue= 1|pages=38–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15196948 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.03.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also unclear is whether Wnt 11 is the main dorsal determinant or is β-catenin also required, as these two molecules have both been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for dorsal development.  This along with all of the other factors are important for activating Nodal genes that propagate normal dorsoventral development.

'''''The Mutant Virus: Crisis in a Computer World''''' is an [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] [[video game]] produced by [[ASC Games]]. It was made in April 1992.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:The Mutant Virus - Crisis in a Computer World Glider Gun.jpg|thumb|left|A screen shot showing [[Glider (Conway's Life)|Gliders]] being created by a [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Gosper Glider Gun]]]]
The plot centers around [[protagonist]], Ron, and his fight to eliminate a virus out of a global A.I. that is responsible for every aspect of technology in the game's present day. If Ron is unable to extinguish the virus, humanity will be thrown back to the Stone Age. The player controls a miniature "space ship" that shoots anti-virus and other variations of the weapon to try to contain the virus in that room.

The virus in the game is a [[cellular automaton]] following the rules of [[Conway's Game of Life]], with the exception that each cell is either a virus cell (green) or a clean cell (light blue).  As new cells are created, they either become virus cells or clean cells depending on which type makes up the majority of their neighbors.

'''Vlassis Bonatsos''' ({{lang-gr|Βλάσσης Μπονάτσος}}) (November 30, 1949 – October 14, 2004) was a popular [[Greece|Greek]] entertainer and singer. 

== Biography ==
His father was a judicial officer and his mother was a piano teacher. Vlassis started his music career by creating a group named "'''PELOMA BOKIOU'''" ("ΠΕΛΟΜΑ ΜΠΟΚΙΟΥ") in the early 1970s. The band members came up with the name after combining syllables of their last names: Da'''PE'''ris, '''LO'''gothetis, '''MA'''rinakis, '''BO'''natsos and '''KIOY'''rktsoglou. In the early 1980s he costarred in the legendary theatrical play "[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]" starring [[Aliki Vougiouklaki]] (Αλίκη Βουγιουκλάκη) and him as [[Che Guevara|Che]]. He maintained a relationship with the "national" Star of Greece (Vougiouklaki was used to be called that) for several years. Then he took up acting and starred in Greek movies, but his fame reached its peak in the 1990s when he started participating in popular TV series such as "Aparadektoi" (1991). He is also remembered as a presenter of iconic TV shows and gameshows on Greek TV including the Greek version of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (named in Greek: ''Kontres''). In ''Kontres'' his memorable catchphrase was "Tora!!!!!" (Now!!!) with a characteristic sudden raise in his voice (almost yelling). He died suddenly in 2004, aged 54. According to the press his death cause was [[Asphyxia|asphyxiation]], due to [[obstructive laryngitis]].

'''Walter de Merton''' ([[circa|c.]] 1205&amp;nbsp;– 27 October 1277) was [[Bishop of Rochester]] and founder of [[Merton College, Oxford]].

==Life==

Walter was probably born at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] in [[Surrey]] or educated there. He came of a land-owning family at [[Basingstoke]]; beyond that there is no definite information about the date or place of birth. His mother was [[Christina Fitz-Oliver]] and his father [[William de Merton|William]]. By 1237 both his parents were dead, and Walter was a clerk in holy orders. In 1241 Walter already held a number of livings in various parts of the country; in 1256 he was an agent for [[Walter of Kirkham]] [[Bishop of Durham]] in a lawsuit.  Walter was also [[prothonotary]] of the chancery in 1258.

Walter rose to prominence as a skilled lawyer and negotiator.  When Henry III went to France to negotiate the Treaty of Paris, Walter was left behind as a trusted royal servant.  On 29 March, the Justiciar ordered 100 barons to muster in London for a secret meeting that would take them overseas.  Only a few days later Walter could be seen at Maldon, Surrey assisting in the registration of the Justiciar's army.  The writs were pre-dated, then considered a new procedure at some risk to the messengers' delivery of the writs to Sheriffs in the locality.  Walter also helped in the complex financial dealing with King Louis IX of France, when he reached London on 30 April.  In return for a promise of peace, Henry received 12,500 Livres, the equivalent of 500 Knights Fees.  By 1264, this would be a total of 134,000 Livres of subsidy from the King of France.  Walter played an invaluable part in the administration of Henry's revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Powicke, ''Henry III and the Lord Edward'' (1947), p.413-4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1259, Walter had suitably impressed the king that he was granted a [[prebend]]ary of [[St. Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]], London.

On 12 July 1261 [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] made him [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]], in place of [[Nicholas of Ely]].&lt;ref name=Handbook85&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; A month earlier the Papal Bulls in support of Henry's coup d'etat had ensured it was safe for the King to return to the Tower of London.  With a mercenary at his back, he had marched from Dover over Whitsun.  In London, Walter was reinstalled as Chancellor in a 'resumption of royal power', having been briefly challenged by the baronial movement.  Walter provided legal arguments for the collection of [[Tallage]], rejection of the baronial constitution, appointment of royal Sheriffs, and a renewed attempt to justify the collection of Customs.  Now only a cussed [[Philip Basset]], among the barons, remained aloof from the fray, when the King's new ministrations emerged against the Provisions of Oxford.  As one of the arbitrators, Walter met the barons with Walerand and Basset.  He was probably not the king's first choice among the nobility, but the sticking-point remained the method by which to appoint sheriffs, from 'faithful men and people' in the shires.  Later that month of May, he had helped define ''Jus regalitatis'', a law that prohibited criticism of the King; a flagrant breach of the commitment at Oxford.  A year later Henry would describe the sheriffs as ''bachelarii regis qui tenent comitatus'' or his bachelors.  For the regents were men of the second rank, not nobles, yet they owed their elevated status entirely to royal service.&lt;ref&gt;''Close Rolls, 1261-4,'' p.177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter quickly acquired lucrative sinecures in 1262, like the new prebendary of [[Exeter]] and, instituted a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Wells Cathedral]].  The following year when de Montfort was at the height of his powers, Walter was urged by the bishop of Worcester to accept a form of peace ''satis competens et honesta.''&lt;ref&gt;Foedera, I, i, p.427.&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter could have been a member of Richard of Cornwall's deputation sent from Windsor to greet Montfort's army coming east from London and Kent.  But on 16 July, when the King surrendered peace terms, and three days later de Montfort assumed power, Walter also left office.&lt;ref&gt;''Close Rolls, 1261-3,''p.242.; Powicke, p.439.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1261, two manors in Surrey were set aside for the support of "scholars residing at the schools" at [[Merton Priory]]; it was the beginning of Merton College.  In 1264 Walter drew up statutes for a "house of the scholars of Merton", at [[Old Malden|Malden]] in Surrey; ten years later these scholars were transferred to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and a permanent house established.  Merton College, thus founded and endowed, was one of the earliest examples of collegiate life at Oxford.  De Merton's statutes provided for a common corporate life under the rule of a warden, but as vows were to be taken and scholars entering a monastic order forfeited their scholarship, the college was really a place of training for the secular clergy. Freed of the responsibilities of government, Walter turned his attention to his college again.  The statutes were redrafted and scholars moved permanently to Oxford.  They were established on the site of the parish church of St John whose [[advowson]] he had obtained in the early 1260s and where he had been buying adjoining houses and halls since 1264.  In 1270 he bought [[Kibworth Harcourt]], Leicestershire as part of the confiscated estate of Saer de Harcourt, an erstwhile supporter of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]].  While labouring for the establishment of Merton College, the barons emerged triumphant.  Walter, a partisan friend of Henry III, was removed from the chancellorship in 1263.  He was not immediately restored after the king's victory, but he did renew his acquaintance with the royal circle, by now at Windsor.

==Edward and Chancellor Merton==
Walter is mentioned as a [[Justiciar]] in 1271.  He was re-appointed as Lord Chancellor, four days after Henry III's death.&lt;ref name=Handbook85/&gt; For the first two years of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] he was in all but name regent of England during the King's absence abroad.  He was tasked with investigation into the 20,000 Marks collected (1266) from Tallage, about which many complaints had sparked the ire of the Citizens of London.  Violent clashes on the streets worried the King Edward in his first year on the throne.  The ''vulgus'' (common people) clamoured for heads at the Guildhall, and the election of the baronial party.  Merton argued that the ''communa'' election was a matter for Parliament, whereas the Aldermanic vote clashed with the other jurisdiction.  Merton's joint tribunal appointed before Henry III's death, was redundant, until Edward I could appoint a royal warden.  On 11 November, Edward wisely moved, prompted by his Chancellor, to enable counsellors to control the 'men of Belial'.  The violence subsided: Merton successfully negotiated the elected [[Walter Hervey (Mayor)|Walter Hervey]] as Mayor, and so he "announced before all the people at the cross of St Paul's that the aldermen had agreed to have Walter as mayor for that year." The contemporary historian, Matthew Paris, who died in 1275, left voluminous histories about these events.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronica maiorum et vicecomitum', pp.148-53, 155.; Powicke, pp.590-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the king's absence he stood in his place, effective Regent of England.  Edward commanded the respect of his household and wardrobe anticipating a welcome return.  This is signified in a letter of 9 August sent from Melun, France in which Walter was promised full support.&lt;ref&gt;''Foedera'', I, ii, p.505.&lt;/ref&gt; On Edward's return Walter was dismissed as Lord Chancellor on 21 September 1274, in favour of [[Robert Burnell]], who became a strong ally of the Edwardian regime.&lt;ref name=Handbook85/&gt; Walter's compensation was the [[Bishop of Rochester|Bishopric of Rochester]], where he was elected in late July and consecrated on 21 October 1274;&lt;ref name=Handbook267&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BHORoch&gt;[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33873 British History Online Bishops of Rochester] accessed on 30 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He eagerly awaited in anticipation the appointment of a Warden of the new Merton College.  For the last three years of his life Walter divided his time between his duties in Rochester and the supervision of his fledging academic house.  On a journey back from Oxford in 1277, while fording the [[Medway]], he fell from his horse; and died two days later on 27 October 1277 from his injuries.  He was buried in [[Rochester Cathedral]], and is described in the ''Annales monastici'' as a man of liberality and great worldly learning, ever ready in his assistance to the religious orders.&lt;ref name=Handbook267/&gt;

A '''watch system,''' '''watch schedule,''' or '''watch bill''' is a method of assigning regular periods of work duty aboard ships and some other areas of employment. A watch system allows the ship's crew to operate the ship 24&amp;nbsp;hours a day for the duration of long voyages or operations.

Many watch systems incorporate the concept of '''dogging''', whereby one watch is split into two shorter watches so that there is an odd number each day.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt; Doing so allows crew members to have a different watch schedule each day.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt; Often, the [[dog watch]]es are set at dinner time to allow the entire crew to be fed in short order.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;

In the traditional [[Royal Navy]] watch system (a system used by most other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies), 'watch' refers to a period of time and to a grouping of personnel. Those members of the crew whose work must be done at all times of the day – known as 'watch-keepers' – are assigned to one of two watches: the [[Starboard]] or the [[Port (nautical)|Port]] watch.  These can be further divided into two parts, e.g. First Port, Second Starboard. These two watches – or more usually the four parts of watches – alternate in working the following watches:

* First watch: 2000 to 0000&lt;ref name="usni357"&gt;USNI, 1996:357.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Middle watch: 0000 to 0400&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Morning watch: 0400 to 0800&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Forenoon watch: 0800 to 1200&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Afternoon watch: 1200 to 1600&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* First [[dog watch]]: 1600 to 1800&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Last [[dog watch]]: 1800 to 2000&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;

The Royal Navy traditional submarine three watch system is 2 on 4 off during the day (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and 3 on 6 off during the night (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.).

The same arrangement of watch times can also be used with a crew divided into three sections.  This gives each sailor more time off-duty, sometimes allowing sleeping periods of over seven hours. Names for the three watches—instead of Port and Starboard—vary from ship to ship. Naming schemes such as "[[Foremast]]", "[[Mainmast]]" and "[[Mizzen]]" and "Red", "White" and "Blue" are common.

The so-called "five-and-dime" arrangement splits the day into five-hour watches, with the exception of a four-hour watch from 22:00 to 02:00.

The "Six-Hour-Shift" splits the day in four 6-hour watches, permitting a three section crew to maximize rest time in a 3-day working cycle. Also, this watch systems takes into better account the meal times (of a 4 meal-a-day system), so that the ingoing team will be fed first, then stand watch, while the outgoing team will be relieved of watch, and then proceed to the messdeck.

Aboard [[United States]] [[submarine]]s, the crew is typically divided into three sections, with each section standing 8 hours of watch followed by 16 hours off-watch. This schedule has been a fairly recent change to submariner work and rest routines. For nearly 45 years prior to 2015, submariners were on 18-hour days with 6 hours of watch followed by 12 hours off watch. The 12 hours off-watch were further divided into the first 6 hours being used for maintenance, cleaning, and entertainment; while the second 6 hours were usually for sleeping.

Note that this arrangement resulted in one of the sections having two watches in one (24-hour) day, and there were no dog watches. Also, watch reliefs occurred no later than the bottom of the hour (2330, 0530, 1130, 1730). Typically, the first 30 minutes of the hour were used for the oncoming section to eat while the second 30 minutes of the hour were used for the off-going section to eat.

Some warships now use the one-in-two system, also known as 7s and 5s, for the duration of the watches.  This gives the sailors a longer sleeping period than the traditional two-watch system, while still maintaining the ability for the ship to function.  Meals are generally scheduled around the watch turnovers at 0700, 1200, and 1700; sometimes a light midnight meal is provided for the 0000 turnover.

Various alternative watch schedules have been devised, which are typically referred to as '''Swedish watches'''.  Although there is no standard for what constitutes a Swedish watch, the variations all feature some element of extended watches to accommodate longer time off. Like the traditional watch system, they begin at 2000&amp;nbsp;hours. Some popular variations have durations of 6, 6, 4, 4, 4 and 5, 5, 5, 5, 4.

On [[merchant ship]]s, watchstanders typically stand watch for three periods of four consecutive hours. This system has a couple of advantages: it is easy to remember and it is consistent. For example, a member of watch team 1 will only have to remember that he is on the "4–8" watch, and knows that he goes on watch at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. This scheme also allows inexperienced watchstanders to stand watch from 8–12&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 8–12&amp;nbsp;p.m., when senior watchstanders are likely to be awake and ready to assist in case of trouble. 

By custom, in a ship with five deck officers the junior third mate takes the 8 to 12 watch, the senior third mate the 12 to 4 watch, and the second mate the 4 to 8 watch. This enables the second officer, who is the ship's navigator, to take morning and evening star sights. In ships with only four deck officers, the third officer will stand the 8 to 12, the second officer the 12 to 4, and the Chief Mate (equivalent to the Executive Officer in a navy ship) the 4 to 8 watch. The reason for this is to enable the Chief Mate to assign work to the deck gang before the ship's day begins, and to inspect it before going on watch at 1600 hours.

'''Älgen Stolta''' (in Swedish, "Älgen" means "the moose" and "Stolta" means "proud") was a [[moose]] that became known for participating in a [[harness racing|trot racing]] event in [[Falun]], Sweden, in 1907.

== History ==
In the early 1900s, an elk cow (adult female) died, leaving her year-old calf behind. Different sources claim the cow was a killed by a passing train, others that it drowned, but they agree it happened near the [[Dalälven|Dalälven river]] close to [[Älvkarleby]] in [[Uppland]]. Its live female calf was taken to Johan Blad, the foreman at Älvkarleö's railway park. Blad knew a [[Lineman (technician)|lineman]] called Anders Gustav Jansson who lived in Älvkarleby and had a reputation for animal husbandry, so he asked for his help with the elk which they named Stolta.&lt;ref name=digitaltmuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/things/lgen-stolta-drar-spark-med-frmannen-johan/S-UM/RR0413|title=Älgen Stolta drar spark med förmannen Johan Blad och banvakten Anders Jansson vid tömmarna, Älvkarleö, Uppland 1908|trans-title=Stolta pulls sled with the foreman Johan Leaves and lineman Anders Jansson at the reins, Älvkarleö, Upland 1908|publisher=digitaltmuseum.se|accessdate=28 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727203313/http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/things/lgen-stolta-drar-spark-med-frmannen-johan/S-UM/RR0413|archivedate=27 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=digital&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/things/lgen-stolta-drar-gigg-med-tv-mn-i/S-UM/RR0414 |title=Älgen Stolta drar gigg med två män i Järnvägsparken, Älvkarleö, Älvkarleby socken, Uppland 1908|trans-title=The elk Stolta pulls a gig with two men in the railway park, Älvkarleö, Älvkarleby parish, Uppland 1908| publisher=digitaltmuseum.se |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stolta was raised like a tame horse;&lt;ref name=Swedishnewspaper&gt;{{cite web |url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522%25C3%2584lgen%2BStolta%2522%26start%3D30%26sa%3DN%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D536&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://magasin.kb.se:8080/searchinterface/page.jsp%3Fid%3Dkb:51198%26recordNumber%3D145%26totalRecordNumber%3D483&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSmFnnpMMDKgrMHpnsHby0BGpYVA |title=Från konungens Dalabesök|trans-title=From the King's visit to Dalarna |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 March 1909 |website= |publisher=Dalpilen |accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; doing forestry work, pulling carts and sleds with material, and also used to pull a sled carrying tourists between the railway station and the tourist hotel near the waterfall in Älvkarleby.&lt;ref name=digitaltmuseum/&gt;&lt;ref name=digital/&gt;
