Funding for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation ceased in 2014.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/head-of-defunct-aboriginal-healing-foundation-laments-loss-of-mental-health-programs-1.2858181|title=Head of defunct Aboriginal Healing Foundation laments loss of mental-health programs|last=|first=|date=April 13, 2016|work=CTV News|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Aboriginal Healing Foundation was created on March 30, 1998.  It was established following consultations with residential school survivors, the [[Assembly of First Nations]], the [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami|Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]], the [[Indigenous Peoples Assembly of Canada|Congress of Aboriginal Peoples]], the [[Métis National Council]], and the [[Native Women's Association of Canada]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/annual-report-99.pdf|title=Aboriginal Healing Foundation 1999 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=1999|website=|publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation was to foster sustainable healing strategies in Indigenous communities in Canada that begin to address the impacts of the residential school system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/pr-june-23-1998.pdf|title=Aboriginal Healing Foundation completes election of directors; Board to manage $350 million healing fund|last=|first=|date=June 23, 1998|website=|publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation was initially provided with $350 million of funding from the Canadian government to care out this work with residential school survivors and Indigenous communities across Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Foundation was designed as an organization to be responsible for the management of the Canada government's healing strategy related to residential schools. This strategy was part of the "Gathering Strength, Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan" established by the federal government on January 7, 1998.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015725/1100100015726|title=Address by the Honourable Jane Stewart Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on the occasion of the unveiling of Gathering Strength — Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan|last=|first=|date=January 7, 1998|work=|publisher=Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Government of Canada|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original mandate of the Foundation was set to end on March 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.algomau.ca/main/node/20177|title=Aboriginal Healing Foundation fonds|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Engracia De Jesus Matias Archives and Special Collections|publisher=Algoma University|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first chair of the Foundation was [[Georges Erasmus]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=Summer 1999|title=Healing residential school survivors, their families &amp; descendants: AHF funding to community projects|url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/summer-99.pdf|magazine=Healing Words|publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|volume=1|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original board of directors was composed of 17 people, including Garnet Angeconeb, Charlene Belleau, Jerome Berthelette, Paul Chartrand, Angus Cockney, Ken Courchene, Wendy John, Richard Kistabish, Cerrielynn Lamouche, Ann Meekitjuk-Hanson, Teressa Nahanee, Dorris Peters, Viola Robinson, Grant Severight, Cindy Swanson, and Charles Weaselhead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2005 the Aboriginal Healing Foundation was granted an additional $40 million through the 2005 federal budget.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/september-29-2014-press-release.pdf|title=Aboriginal Healing Foundation Closes After 16 Years of Operation|last=|first=|date=September 30, 2014|website=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|publisher=|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement of 2007 resulted in an additional $125 million of funding for the Healing Foundation and a prolonged mandate for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/schedule_m.pdf|title=Funding Agreement: Aboriginal Healing Foundation and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as Represented by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development|last=|first=|date=2006|website=Residential Schools Settlement Agreement|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this funding was through the federal government.  Additionally under the settlement agreement the 50 [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] entities associated with the settlement agreement were required to pay $29 million to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation which would be used for community healing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-scrapped-appeal-of-residential-school-settlement-ruling/article29704211/|title=Federal government killed appeal of residential-school settlement ruling|last=|first=|date=April 20, 2016|work=|publisher=The Globe and Mail|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been debate about the Church's obligations to pay this amount and in 2013 the Canadian government pursued legal action for $1.6 million that the Catholic entities had not paid the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/legal-misstep-lets-catholics-off-hook-for-residential-schools-compensation/article29657424/|title=Legal misstep lets Catholic Church off hook for residential schools compensation|last=|first=|date=April 17, 2016|work=|publisher=The Globe and Mail|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/catholic-church-withholding-millions-from-victims-alleges-government-1.2542363|title=Catholic Church withholding millions from victims, alleges government|last=Walker|first=Connie|date=February 18, 2016|work=CBC News|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its operation the Foundation received $515 million from the Government of Canada. The Foundation also generated $537,146,681 in interest on this funding which was further used to fund community projects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In 2010 funding for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation was cut by [[Stephen Harper]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada|conservative]] government.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rabble.ca/news/2010/03/funding-cuts-catastrophe-residential-school-survivors|title=Funding cuts a catastrophe for residential school survivors|last=Rolbin-Ghanie|first=Maya|date=March 30, 2010|work=Rabble|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This cut in funding resulted in the closure of the Foundation in 2014.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  It also resulted in the discontinuation of funding to many community based healing initiatives and the closure of many healing programs regionally in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/plight-of-inuit-healing-centre-in-ottawa-highlights-north-s-lack-of-mental-health-care-1.3448218|title=Plight of Inuit healing centre in Ottawa highlights North's lack of mental health care|last=Sahar Zerehi|first=Sima|date=February 15, 2016|work=CBC News|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/ti-mamisarvik-healing-centre-1.3442166|title=Tungasuvvingat Inuit to suspend Mamisarvik Healing Centre|last=|first=|date=February 10, 2016|work=CBC News|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the closure of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation its research library, records, and archives were donated to the [[Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre]] at [[Algoma University]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sootoday.com/local-news/residential-school-archive-moves-to-algoma-university-136019|title=Residential school archive moves to Algoma University|last=Helwig|first=David|date=July 6, 2011|work=SooToday|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funded Community Projects ==
The first funding cycle of the Foundation operated in the form of a [[Request for proposal|call for proposals]] that was sent out on December 3, 1998.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The call was open to communities and survivor groups and focused on three thematic areas of programming: 1) Developing and Enhancing Aboriginal Capacity and Community Therapeutic Healing; 2) Healing Centers; 3) Restoring Balance, Honour, and History.  This first batch of funding resulted in $19.4 million being awarded to projects across Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Funded community groups included:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca/funded-projects/1999-2000|title=Funded Projects Fiscal Year 1999-2000|last=|first=|date=2007|website=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|publisher=|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding Evaluation ===
During its operation the Aboriginal Healing Foundation funded over 1,500 community based healing initiatives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Foundation was subject to government funding audits and the Foundation also conducted community based program evaluations of the initiatives which received funding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/inac-evaluation.pdf|title=Evaluation of Community-Based Healing Initiatives Supported Through the Aboriginal Healing Foundation|last=|first=|date=December 7, 2009|website=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada|publisher=Evaluation, Performance Measurement, and Review Branch, Government of Canada|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2009 [[Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada|Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]] (INAC) evaluation of the Foundation programming reviewed the administration files of Foundation funded projects; conducted staff and subject expert interviews; and conducted community [[Case study|case studies]] which included interviews with healing project participants.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Final Report of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation|last=Brant Castellano|first=Marlene|last2=Archibald|first2=Linda|publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|year=2006|isbn=9781897285220|location=Ottawa|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evaluation found the Foundation had been very successful in administering funding and contributing to community healing but that there was still much ongoing work in communities to be done.  INAC also indicated that there was a strong need for [[Community-based program design|community based]] healing initiatives to continue and recommended continued funding of the Foundation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Research Mandate ==
In addition to funding community based healing initiatives the Aboriginal Healing Foundation had a research mandate that was dedicated to creating a [[knowledge base]] relating to the long term community and health impacts of residential schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ahf.ca/downloads/research-compendium.pdf|title=A Compendium of Aboriginal Healing Foundation Research|last=|first=|publisher=Aboriginal Healing Foundation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-897285-94-7|location=Ottawa|pages=1–2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research mandate was outlined in the 1998 agreement that the Foundation signed with the Government of Canada and resulted in the Foundation seeking out researchers, scholars, and authors to write publications on residential schools, reconciliation, health, and other issues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first research director of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation was [[Gail Guthrie Valaskakis]] (2000-2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naho.ca/journal/2008/01/07/in-memoriam-dr-gail-guthrie-valaskakis-1939-2007/|title=In Memoriam Dr. Gail Guthrie Valaskakis (1939-2007) {{!}} Journal of Aboriginal Health|website=www.naho.ca|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the death of Valaskakis in 2007, Jonathan Dewar served as research director from 2007 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naisa.org/jonathan-dewar.html|title=Jonathan Dewar - Native American and Indigenous Studies Association|website=www.naisa.org|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the work of research branch of the organization published numerous books, including:

An '''accountable care organization''' ('''ACO''') is a healthcare organization that ties payments to quality metrics and the cost of care. ACOs in the United States are formed from a group of coordinated health-care practitioners. They use alternative payment models, normally, [[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]]. The organization is accountable to patients and third-party payers for the quality, appropriateness and efficiency of its services. According to the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], an ACO is "an organization of health care practitioners that agrees to be accountable for the quality, cost, and overall care of Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service program who are assigned to it".&lt;ref name="cms"&gt;{{cite web |title=Medicare "Accountable Care Organizations" Shared Savings Program – New Section 1899 of Title XVIII, Preliminary Questions &amp; Answers |publisher=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services |url=https://www.aace.com/files/cmspremlimqa.pdf |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "Accountable Care Organization" was first used by [[Elliott S. Fisher|Elliott Fisher]] in 2006 during a discussion of the [[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]]. The term was included in the federal [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;Gold J.  [https://www.npr.org/2011/04/01/132937232/accountable-care-organizations-explained Accountable Care Organizations, Explained. Kaiser Health News] NPR. Jan 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It resembles the definition of [[Health maintenance organization|Health Maintenance Organization]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (HMO) that emerged in the 1970s. Like an HMO, an ACO is "an entity that will be 'held accountable' for providing comprehensive health services to a population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnhpcalifornia.org/2010/10/the-history-and-definition-of-the-%E2%80%9Caccountable-care-organization%E2%80%9D/|title=California Physicians Alliance – Single Payer Health Insurance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model builds on the Medicare Physician Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/demoprojectsevalrpts/md/itemdetail.asp?itemid%3DCMS1198992 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602204612/http://www.cms.gov/demoprojectsevalrpts/md/itemdetail.asp?itemid=CMS1198992 |archivedate=2011-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Practice Demonstration and the Medicare Health Care Quality Demonstration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/DemoProjectsEvalRpts/MD/itemdetail.asp?filterType%3Dnone%26filterByDID%3D-99%26sortByDID%3D3%26sortOrder%3Ddescending%26itemID%3DCMS023618%26intNumPerPage%3D10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603022217/https://www.cms.gov/DemoProjectsEvalRpts/MD/itemdetail.asp?filterType=none&amp;filterByDID=-99&amp;sortByDID=3&amp;sortOrder=descending&amp;itemID=CMS023618&amp;intNumPerPage=10 |archivedate=2011-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; established by the 2003 [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act]].

Medicare approved 32 Pioneer accountable care organizations in December 2011; of which 19 remained active through 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Pioneer-ACO-Model/|title=Pioneer ACO Model|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, Medicare had approved 404 Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACOs, covering over 7.3 million beneficiaries in 49 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/Downloads/All-Starts-MSSP-ACO.pdf|title=MSSP ACO Fact Sheet|website=cms.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2014 reporting period, MSSP ACOs saved a combined $338 million, or $63 per beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pulsepilot.com/directory/leaderboard/regions|title=Nationwide Summary by State|work=Pulse Pilot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
[[Mark McClellan]], Elliott Fisher and others defined three core accountable care organization principles:
* Provider-led organizations with a strong base of primary care that are collectively accountable for quality and per capita costs across the continuum of care
* Payments linked to quality improvements and reduced costs
* Reliable and increasingly sophisticated performance measurement, to support improvement and provide confidence that savings are achieved through care improvements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McClellan M, McKethan AN, Lewis JL, Roski J, Fisher ES |title=A National Strategy to Put Accountable Care Into Practice |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=982–90 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0194 |pmid=20439895 |journal=Health Aff (Millwood)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost savings ==
The model places financial responsibility on providers in hopes of improving care management and limiting unnecessary expenditures, while providing patients freedom to select their medical service providers.&lt;ref&gt;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-148, §&amp;nbsp;3022 124 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ACO's model of fostering clinical excellence while simultaneously controlling costs depends on its ability to "incentivize hospitals, physicians, post-acute care facilities, and other providers involved to form linkages and facilitate coordination of care delivery".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By increasing care coordination, ACOs were proposed to reduce unnecessary medical care and improve health outcomes, reducing utilization of acute care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Elliott S.|last2=McClellan|first2=Mark B.|last3=Bertko|first3=John|last4=Lieberman|first4=Steven M.|last5=Lee|first5=Julie J.|last6=Lewis|first6=Julie L.|last7=Skinner|first7=Jonathan S.|date=2009-03-01|title=Fostering Accountable Health Care: Moving Forward In Medicare|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/2/w219|journal=Health Affairs|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=w219–w231|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.2.w219|issn=0278-2715|pmc=2656392|pmid=19174383}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CMS estimates, ACO implementation as described in ACA was estimated to lead to an estimated median savings of $470 million from 2012–2015.&lt;ref name="Human Services 2011"/&gt;

== Pioneer savings ==

On July 7, 2013 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the results of the Pioneer ACO demonstration. According to them, costs for more than 669,000 beneficiaries served by Pioneer ACOs grew by 0.3 percent in 2012. Costs for others grew by 0.8 percent in the same period. CMS stated that 19 out of 32 pioneer ACOs shared savings with CMS. The Pioneer ACOs earned an estimated $76 million. Two Pioneer ACOs generated losses totaling an estimated $4 million. According to CMS the savings were due, in part, to reduction in hospital admissions and readmissions.&lt;ref name="cms.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-Releases/2013-Press-Releases-Items/2013-07-16.html|title=2013-07-16 – Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New York State ACO Model ==
Public Health Law (PHL) Article 29-E requires the Department of Health (Department) to establish a program governing the approval of Accountable Care Organizations. PHL § 2999-p defines an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) as "an organization of clinically integrated health care providers that work together to provide, manage, and coordinate health care (including primary care) for a defined population; with a mechanism for shared governance; the ability to negotiate, receive, and distribute payments; and accountability for the quality, cost, and delivery of health care to the ACO's patients" and that has been issued a certificate of authority by the Department.
The Greater Buffalo United Accountable Care Organization was the 1st Medicaid and Commercial ACO in New York State. It received 1 of 10 NCQA ACO recognitions in the country. The model of integrated health care and high level results displayed by Greater Buffalo United Accountable Care Organization (GBUACO) have been set as the building ground for other ACOs in the state. 

== Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ==
The US [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) proposed the initial set of guidelines for  ACOs under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (PPACA Section 3201) on March 31, 2011. These guidelines stipulate the necessary steps that physician, hospital and other health care provider groups must complete to become an ACO. Section 3022 authorized CMS to create the MSSP begin signing ACO contracts by January 2012.&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acofp.org/Practice_Management/ACO/Medical_Home/ Accountable Care Organizations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128091201/http://www.acofp.org/Practice_Management/ACO/Medical_Home/ |date=January 28, 2012 }}. [[American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians]].&lt;/ref&gt; ACA intended for MSSP to promote "accountability for a patient population and coordinate[s] items and services under part A and B, and encourage[s] investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes for high quality and efficient service delivery".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aace.com/files/cmspremlimqa.pdf Medicare "Accountable Care Organizations Shared Savings Program – New Section 1899 of Title XVIII, Preliminary Questions &amp; Answers"]. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.&lt;/ref&gt; MSSP ensures that ACOs are a permanent option under Medicare. However, the specifics of ACO contracts are left to the discretion of the DHHS Secretary, which allows the ACO design to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. [https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/sharedsavingsprogram/downloads/aco_providers_factsheet_icn907406.pdf What Providers Need to Know: Accountable Care]. (Washington DC, 2011) 2:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

MSSP is a three-year program during which ACOs accept responsibility for the overall quality, cost and care of a defined group of Medicare Fee-For-Services (FFS) beneficiaries. Under the program, ACOs accept a minimum of 5,000 beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/state-accountable-care-organizations |title=The State of Accountable Care Organizations: A Conversation With Health Policy and Management Expert Stephen M. Shortell, PhD, MPH, MBA |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provider network is required to include sufficient primary care physicians to serve its enrollees.&lt;ref name="Human Services 2011"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Medicare Shared Savings Program: Accountable Care Organizations; Proposed Rules. 76. Fed. Reg. 67 (April 7, 2011) 8&lt;/ref&gt; The ACO must define processes to promote evidence-based medicine and patient engagement, monitor and evaluate quality and cost measures, meet patient-centeredness criteria and coordinate care across the care continuum. Prior to applying to MSSP, an ACO must establish appropriate legal and governance structures, cooperative clinical and administrative systems and a shared savings distribution method. The ACO may not participate in other shared savings programs during the MSSP period. An ACO may include professionals (e.g., [[Doctor of Medicine|Doctors of Medicine]] (M.D.) or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.), physician assistants, [[nurse practitioners]], clinical nurse specialists) in group practice arrangements, networks of individual practices, partnerships or joint venture arrangements between hospitals and ACO professionals, hospitals employing ACO professionals, or other Medicare providers and suppliers" as determined by the Secretary.&lt;ref name="Human Services 2011" /&gt;

ACO's incentive payments are determined by comparing the organization's annual costs relative to CMS-established benchmarks. These benchmarks are based on an estimation of the total FFS expenditures associated with management of a beneficiary based on FFS payment in the absence of an ACO. CMS updates benchmarks by the projected absolute amount of growth in national per capita expenditures as well as by beneficiary characteristics. CMS establishes a minimum savings rate (MSR) that is calculated as a percentage of the benchmark (2%) that ACO savings must exceed in order to qualify for shared savings. The MSR accounts for normal variation in health care spending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While Medicare continued to offer FFS, ACOs can choose one of two payment models (one-sided or two-sided model) based on the degree of risk and potential savings they prefer. A one-sided model ACO shared savings for the first two years and savings or losses during the third year. The maximum sharing percentage for this model is 50%. In a two-sided model, ACOs shared in savings and losses for all three years. In both cases, ACO savings must exceed 2% in order to qualify for shared savings. The maximum sharing percentage for this model is 60%. In both models the shared loss cap is 5% in the first year, 7.5% in the second year, and 10% in the third year. Aspects regarding financial risk and shared savings were altered in the final regulations.&lt;ref name="Human Services 2011" /&gt;

After the initial March, 2011 regulations, CMS received feedback regarding streamlining the governance and reporting burdens and improving the potential financial return for ACOs willing to make the necessary, and often substantial, investments to improve care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthaffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief.php?brief_id=23|title=Accountable Care Organizations (Updated)|website=Health Affairs – Health Policy Briefs|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20, 2011, DHHS released the final MSSP regulations. The final regulations allowed for broader ACO governance structures, reduced the number of required quality measures and created more opportunities for savings while delaying risk bearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berwick DM | year = 2011 | title = Making good on ACOs' promise – the final rule for the Medicare Shared Savings Program | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 365 | issue = 19| pages = 1753–56 | doi=10.1056/nejmp1111671| pmid = 22013899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providers' financial incentives were increased. Under the one-sided model, providers have the opportunity to engage in ACOs and any savings above 2% without any financial risk throughout the three years. Under the two-sided model, providers will assume some financial risk but will be able to share in any savings that occur (no 2% benchmark before provider savings accrue). In addition, the quality measures required were reduced from 65 to 33, decreasing the monitoring that providers claimed were overwhelming. Community health centers and rural health clinics were allowed to lead ACOs.&lt;ref name="kaiserhealthnews.org"&gt;Galewitz P, Gold J.

Appendix. Healthcare.gov. October 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final regulations required ACOs to:&lt;ref name="MedicareSharedSavings"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/sharedsavingsprogram/|title=Overview Shared Savings Program|publisher=CMS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Become accountable for the quality, cost, and overall care of its Medicare FFS beneficiaries
* Enter into an agreement with the Secretary to participate in the program 3 or more years
* Establish a formal legal structure allowing the organization to receive and distribute shared savings payments to participating providers
* Include sufficient primary care ACO professionals for its Medicare FFS beneficiaries 
* Accept at least 5,000 beneficiaries 
* Provide the Secretary with such information as the Secretary determines necessary to support the assignment FFS beneficiaries, the implementation of quality and other reporting requirements and the determination of payments for shared savings
* Establish a leadership and management structure that includes clinical and administrative systems
* Define processes to promote evidence-based medicine and patient engagement; report on quality and cost measures; coordinate care, such as through the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring
* Demonstrate that it meets patient-centeredness criteria specified by the Secretary, such as the use of patient and caregiver assessments or the use of individualized care plans
* Not participate in other Medicare shared savings programs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckersasc.com/news-analysis/50-things-to-know-about-the-proposed-aco-regulations.html|title=50 Things to Know About the Proposed ACO Regulations|author =Scott Becker|author2=R.

* Take responsibility for distributing savings to participating entities
* Establish a process for evaluating the health needs of its service population

=== Payment models ===
CMS introduced the one-sided and two-sided payment model. The one-sided model offered shared savings for the first two years and added shared losses for the third year.&lt;ref name=usfr5823/&gt;{{rp|19618–20}} In the two-sided model, ACOs shared savings and losses for all three years. Although the ACO assumed less financial risk in the one-sided model, ACOs have a maximum sharing rate of 50% in the one-sided model and a higher maximum sharing rate of 60% in the two-sided model, provided that the minimum threshold of 2% is reached. For both models, the shared loss cap increases each year.&lt;ref name=usfr5823/&gt;{{rp|19621}} Initial feedback raised concerns regarding ACO's financial risk and possible cost savings. On October 20, 2011, DHHS released the final regulations that altered providers' financial incentives. Under the one-sided model, providers no longer assumed any financial risk throughout the three years and continued to share in cost savings above 2%. Under the two-sided model, providers assumed some financial risk, but share in any savings that occur (no 2% benchmark before provider savings accrue).&lt;ref name="kaiserhealthnews.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="healthcare.gov" /&gt;

=== Quality measures ===
CMS established five domains in which to evaluate ACO performance. The five domains are "patient/caregiver experience, care coordination, patient safety, preventative health, and at-risk population/frail elderly health".&lt;ref name=usfr5823/&gt;{{rp|19570}}

== Stakeholders ==

=== Providers ===
ACOs are composed mostly of hospitals, physicians and other healthcare professionals. Depending on the ACO's level of integration and size, providers may include health departments, social security departments, safety net clinics and home care services.&lt;ref name="Miller, H.D. 2009"&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=H.D. |year=2009 |title=How to Create Accountable Care Organizations |url=http://www.chqpr.org/downloads/howtocreateaccountablecareorganizations.pdf |publisher=Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various providers within an ACO work to provide coordinated care, align incentives and lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Accountable Care Organizations – AHA Research Synthesis Report |year=2011|pp=1–18|url=http://www.aha.org/research/cor/accountable/index.shtml|publisher=American Hospital Association Committee on Research|website=www.aha.org|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACOs are different from HMOs in that they allow providers much freedom in developing infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keckley |first1=Paul H. |last2=Hoffmann |first2=M. |year=2011 |title=Accountable Care Organizations: A new model for sustainable innovation |publisher= Deloitte Center for Health Solutions |pp=1–19 |url=https://www.utmb.edu/2020/knowledge_base/pdfs/Disruptive%20Technology%202013/Accountable%20Care%20Organizations_A%20New%20Model%20for%20Sustainable%20Innovation_Deloitte.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any provider or provider organization may assume the leadership role.

=== Payers ===
Medicare is the ACOs primary payer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Medicare Payment Advisory Commission |year=2009 |title=Report to the Congress – Improving Incentives in the Medicare Program |url=https://www.aacom.org/docs/default-source/grad-medical-education/jun10_entirereport.pdf?sfvrsn=2 |pp=39–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other payers include private insurances and employer-purchased insurance. Payers may play several roles in helping ACOs achieve higher quality care and lower expenditures. Payers may collaborate with one another to align incentives for ACOs and create financial incentives for providers to improve healthcare quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Case-Studies/2009/Jul/Organizing-for-Higher-Performance-Case-Studies-of-Organized-Delivery-Systems.aspx|title=Organizing for Higher Performance: Case Studies of Organized Delivery Systems – Series Overview, Findings, and Methods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patients ===
ACO's patient populations primarily consist of Medicare beneficiaries. In larger and more integrated ACOs, the patient population may also include homeless and uninsured people.&lt;ref name="Miller, H.D. 2009" /&gt; Patients may play a role in the healthcare they receive by participating in decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Springgate BF|last2=Brook RH|date=2011-05-04|title=ACcountable care organizations and community empowerment|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2011.547|journal=JAMA|volume=305|issue=17|pages=1800–01|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.547|pmid=21505120|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pilots and learning networks ==
A range of ACO pilots took place uniting commercial insurers and state Medicaid programs (New Jersey, Vermont, Colorado, etc.) in advance of MSSP. The [[Brookings Institution]] and Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice run the ACO Learning Network, a member-driven network of over 80 members that provides tools for operating ACOs. Led by McClellan and Fisher, Brookings and Dartmouth worked since 2007 to foster ACO adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acolearningnetwork.org/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305033559/http://www.acolearningnetwork.org/about/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-03-05 |title=About – ACO Learning Network |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier runs an ACO Implementation and Readiness Collaborative. The American Medical Group Association (AMGA) runs an ACO Development Collaborative and Implementation Collaborative. In 2010, [[Blue Shield of California]], [[Dignity Health]] and Hill Physicians Medical Group formed an ACO that covers 41,000 individuals in the California Public Employees Retirement System ([[CalPERS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/accountable-care-organization-featuring-shared-global-risk-stimulates-development |title=Accountable Care Organization Featuring Shared Global Risk Stimulates Development of Initiatives To Improve Care, Reduces Inpatient Use and Costs |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Hennepin County Medical Center]] partnered with NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center, Metropolitan Health Plan, and Hennepin County's Human Services and Public Health Department to form an ACO called Hennepin Health. By February 2013, Hennepin Health had enrolled 6,000 clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/county-based-accountable-care-organization-medicaid-enrollees-features-shared-risk |title=County-Based Accountable Care Organization for Medicaid Enrollees Features Shared Risk, Electronic Data Sharing, and Various Improvement Initiatives, Leading to Lower Utilization and Costs |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent ACO-like initiatives emerged in Massachusetts, Illinois and California. The Brookings-Dartmouth ACO Learning Network published the ACO Toolkit, an implementation guide. The results were mixed: some organization's efforts yielded financial benefits while others experienced trouble balancing costs with savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2010/07/27/health-policy-brief-accountable-care-organizations/|title=Health Policy Brief: Accountable Care Organizations|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
The lack of specificity regarding how ACOs should be implemented, the [[American Hospital Association]] estimated that ACO formation would incur high startup costs and large annual expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aha.org/content/11/11apr-aco-workahead.pdf |publisher=American Hospital Association |year=2011 |title=The Work Ahead: Activities and Costs to Develop an Accountable Care Organization |pp=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACOs risk violating antitrust laws if they are perceived to drive up costs through reducing competition and lower quality of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2011/10/20/276458.pdf |publisher=FTC and the Department of Justice |year=2011 |title=Statement of Antitrust Enforcement Policy Regarding Accountable Care Organizations Participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program Final Policy Statement |pp=1–18 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the issue of antitrust violation, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] offered a voluntary antitrust review process for ACOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/October/11-at-1384.html |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |year=2011 |title=Department of Justice/Federal Trade Commission issue final statement of antitrust policy enforcement regarding accountable care organizations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant challenges confront [[Primary care physician|primary-care physicians]] who join an ACO via a group practice, hospital-medical practice alignment, or another joint venture—such as an [[independent practice association]] (IPA). Physician groups need a robust [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) system that is capable of advanced reporting, disease registries and patient population care-management. Organizations that achieved their [[Medical home|Patient Centered Medical Home]] (PCMH) accreditation have mastered these functions and are thus further along the road to meeting ACO metrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicianspractice.com/aco/content/article/1462168/2023211 Westgate, Aubrey "Top 4 ACO Considerations for Physicians"]. "Physicians Practice". February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==England==
{{See also|Sustainability and transformation plan}}
[[NHS England]] produced a contract in August 2017 for use by accountable care organisations, which are to be integrated care systems with full responsibility for all health and care services in their area. Accountable care organisations are contractually integrated, unlike [[accountable care system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What’s the difference between an ACS and an ACO?|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/what’s-difference-between-acs-and-aco|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=Health Care Leader|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Problems with the application of [[value-added tax]] have prevented the creation of a single contract for health and social care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS leaders forced to scale back ACO plans|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/central-manchester-university-hospitals-nhs-foundation-trust/nhs-leaders-forced-to-scale-back-aco-plans/7020863.article?|accessdate=24 December 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audrey Josephine Cahn''' (17 October 1905 – 1 April 2008) was an Australian [[microbiologist]] and [[nutritionist]].&lt;ref name=eas/&gt;

The daughter of Professor [[William Alexander Osborne]] and Ethel Elizabeth Goodson, a medical practitioner and industrial hygienist, she was born '''Audrey Josephine Osborne''' in [[Melbourne]] and grew up on the campus of the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=flesch&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.unimelb.edu.au/culturalcollections/research/collections11/11_Flesch-GotAway11.pdf |title=The ones that got away |last=Flesch |first=Juliet |journal=University of Melbourne Collections |date=December 2012 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at the University in 1929 and, later, received a diploma in [[dietetics]]. She first worked as a microbiologist and food analyst for [[Kraft Foods Inc|Kraft]].&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/a-scientist-ahead-of-her-times/2008/05/11/1210444243844.html |title=A scientist ahead of her times |newspaper=The Age |date=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, she married Leslie Cahn, an architect.&lt;ref name=flesch/&gt; She was employed as chief dietician at [[St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne|St Vincent's Hospital]], at the Victorian Mental Hygiene Department and at the [[Royal Perth Hospital]]. During [[World War II]], she was chief dietician at the Heidelberg Military Hospital. From 1947 to 1959, she was a dietetics lecturer at the University of Melbourne; from 1959 until 1968, when she retired, she was chief lecturer in nutrition and applied dietetics at the University.&lt;ref name=eas/&gt;

She was a founding member of the Dietetics Association. Cahn was among the first experts to recommend reducing fat intake and substituting [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s for [[saturated fat]]s.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; She helped conduct a [[longitudinal study]] of child growth in Melbourne (1954–1971) which allowed the growth patterns of Australian children to be compared with children in Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name=flesch/&gt;

The '''Brno Reservoir''', previously known as the '''Kníničky Reservoir''' ({{lang-cs|Brněnská přehrada}}, also known as ''Prýgl'' in [[Hantec slang]]) is a dam on the [[Svratka (river)|Svratka]] River right outside the city of [[Brno]], Czech Republic. The construction of a [[levee]] on the 56th river kilometre of the Svratka River, together with flooding of a valley with the Kníničky village in, created the Brno Reservoir. The reservoir used to serve as a water reserve for Brno (water from the Vír Dam and from water wells in [[Březová nad Svitavou]] are used today), a place for recreation, and also a source of [[electric power]]. Administrator of the Brno Reservoir is a state-owned enterprise Povodí Moravy, s.p.

== Basic Information ==
[[File:Hraz Brněnské přehrady.jpg|left|thumb|Brno Dam]]
[[File:Krajina pod hrází Brněnské přehrady.jpg|left|thumb|View from the levee]]
The idea of creating a dam on the Svratka River began at the beginning of the 20th century; however, its reconstruction was realized as late as 1936–1940. The main investor was the then Ministry of Public Works. Apart from Brno, it was also “the Moravian-Silesian Land” (a former territory), which took a financial interest of 25% in it.

The water storage begins under the weir at the Tejkalův Mill in [[Veverská Bítýška]] and spans nearly 10&amp;nbsp;km to the dyke on the border of the [[Brno-Bystrc]] and Brno-Kníničky districts. The flooded area covers 259 ha. The inactive storage reaches up to 7.6 million m³; the reserve space is 10.8 million m³. The concrete solid dam is 7.14 m wide in corona and 120 m long. It rises 23.5 m above the bottom at an altitude of 233.72 m.

[[Hydroelectricity]] uses one [[Kaplan turbine]] with an output of 2.88 MW (the installed output is 3.1 MW). In case of an island operation (that is, independently, disconnected from network system, such as in case of a breakdown of the [[electric power transmission]]), the turbine can be used to set a gas combustion turbine in the heating plant “Červený mlýn” in motion. A [[small hydro]] in Brno-Komín serves as a buffer tank.

At the end of the [[Second World War]] the retreating [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] placed mines in the nearby roads, a barrel with [[trinitrotoluene]] on the levee (the explosives were originally supposed to be placed into the levee piping, but it was sealed with concrete due to an order to protect it from a sabotage), and also placed some machine guns in the house of the levee guard Šikula. The guard, together with a few people hidden in the power plant room, warned a convoy of the Red Army, but Šikula was shot and wounded. There is a plaque of his at the levee today.

== Tourism ==
[[File:Parník na přehradě.jpg|right|thumb|One of the boats on the reservoir]]
Brno Reservoir is a popular recreational area with both locals and visitors. There are vast forests on both sides of the reservoir and thus there are opportunities not only for swimming and water sports, but also hiking and cycling. The [[Veveří Castle]] is a popular destination for tourists, too. It rises over a rock close to [[Veverská Bítýška]]. There is a bridge for cyclists and hikers over the dam close to the castle.

The dam can be visited all year round. Swimming in the water is safe. [[Cyanobacteria|Blue-green bacteria]] very rarely occur on the southern tip of the dam only.

== Culture ==
[[File:Ignis Brunensis 2010-05-26 (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Fireworks]] competition [[Ignis Brunensis]]]]
There is an important international [[Fireworks|firework]] competition [[Ignis Brunensis]] that is held annually at the end of May and beginning of June at the Brno Reservoir.

== Pollution ==
As a result of [[water pollution]] by communal sewage, the dam suffered from an extensive amount of blue-green bacteria for a long time. In 2010 the reservoir underwent a series of cleaning by chemical substances against the bacteria. These cleanings remain a subject of criticism and dispute, as some people claim they were nothing more than a pre-election trick, and that they will not bring any sufficient results in the long run. Since 2011, however, the water in the reservoir has been suitable for swimming.

== Boat rides ==
The Brno Public Transportation Office operates boat rides on the reservoir during summer season. The boats run from [[Bystrc|Bystrc harbour]] (“Přístaviště”) to [[Veveří Castle]] and some even to [[Veverská Bítýška]] (depending on water level). There are operating several new boats – Lipsko, Utrecht, and Vídeň – which are named after [[Leipzig]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Vienna]] (twin towns of Brno); and older ones called Brno, Dallas, and Veveří. The boats run every 45 minutes. Tickets can be purchased in the harbour at the ticket office.

== Sport ==
The reservoir serves as a popular place for sports, too. Apart from [[canoeing]], [[water skiing]], and [[yachting]], the dam is also used for [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Several rowing clubs operate there, such as ČVK Brno (Czech Rowing Club Brno) or TJ Lodní sporty Brno (TJ Water Sports Brno), with its most famous member [[Miroslava Knapková]] (the winner in rowing at the [[2012 Olympics]]).

== Events ==
Since 2011 there has been a dispute over a planned construction of a [[wakeboarding]] track.

[[Capital punishment]] is legal in [[Tonga]], but has not been imposed since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ballesteros|first1=Raissa Katrina Marie G.|title=From Abolition to a Solution: a Real Alternative to Capital Punishment|journal=Phil. L.J.|date=1999|volume=73|page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The country’s lack of executions puts it into the category of abolitionist in practice, where it retains the death penalty at law but has not imposed it in the last ten years. Tonga’s low rate of murder convictions form part of the reason for the lack of executions, as well as its courts’ apparent unwillingness to impose the penalty unless it appears absolutely necessary to do so.

==Legislation and case law==
In Tonga, the governing [[legislation]] regarding the death penalty is the Criminal Offences Act.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Offences Act (Tonga)&lt;/ref&gt; This Act includes death in its list of [[punishment]]s for [[crime|criminal behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;s 24(1)(e) Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; Capital punishment may be imposed for the crimes of [[murder]]&lt;ref&gt;s 91(1) Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; and [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;s 44 Criminal Offences&lt;/ref&gt; It may not be imposed on a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman.&lt;ref&gt;s 40 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on imposing the death penalty on a pregnant woman was added to the Criminal Offences Act via an amendment in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Offences Act s 40&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman convicted of murder or treason alleges that she is pregnant, the question is put to a jury as to whether they are satisfied she is indeed pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Offences Act s 41(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The jury who decides this will, as a general rule, be the same jury who convicted her.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Offences Act s 41(2)&lt;/ref&gt; A person under 15 years old cannot receive the death penalty for murder.&lt;ref&gt;s 91 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the wording of the Act, it is unclear whether a person under this age may receive death as punishment for treason.&lt;ref&gt;s 44 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the death penalty to be imposed, the [[List of monarchs of Tonga|King]] must assent. He must do so with the consent of the [[Privy Council of Tonga]].&lt;ref&gt;s 33(2) Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; The method of [[execution]] used is [[death by hanging]].&lt;ref&gt;s 33(1) Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; After the execution of the offender, a medical officer must supply a certificate of death.&lt;ref&gt;s 36 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement for a certificate of death was inserted by way of an amendment in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;s 36 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; The jury who convicted the offender, alongside a magistrate for the district in which the death sentence was executed, must hold an “inquest” into the body of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;s 37 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; The jury is to ascertain the identity of the deceased (that is, he or she is the offender they convicted).&lt;ref&gt;s 37(1) Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; The jury must also ensure that the “sentence of death was duly executed on the offender,” meaning that in addition to a medical certificate, the jury must ascertain that the offender is dead.&lt;ref&gt;s 37(1) Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have received the death sentence have their place of burial decided by the Tongan Privy Council – a place is chosen, and every offender executed will be buried in this place.&lt;ref&gt;s 38 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt; The Tongan Privy Council is also able to make “regulations” regarding executions, for the purposes of “guarding against any abuse in the execution,” “for giving greater solemnity thereto,” and to publicise outside of the prison that an execution is taking place.&lt;ref&gt;s 39 Criminal Offences Act&lt;/ref&gt;

The last executions in Tonga took place in 1982, when Flatoti Sole, Livingi Sole and Fili Esau were hanged for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capital Punishment in the British Commonwealth|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/common.html|website=capitalpunishmentuk|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga|Tongan Parliament]] discussed abolishing the death penalty, but decided to retain it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The last execution was carried out in 1982|url=http://english.nessunotocchicaino.it/notizia/the-last-execution-was-carried-out-in-1982-20001215|website=Hands Off Cain|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga|Tongan Legislative Assembly]] voted on a bill which proposed to introduce the death penalty for possession of illicit drugs. This bill was defeated by the Assembly by a vote of 10-7,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tonga|url=http://english.nessunotocchicaino.it/bancadati/asia-middle-east-australia-and-oceania/tonga-12000368|website=Hands Off Cain|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the death penalty, if Tonga continues to retain it, will not spread to become an applicable sentence for other crimes. It is an indication that Tonga wishes to reserve the death penalty for the very serious crimes of murder and treason.

The issue of capital punishment was raised in 2005, when Tevita Siale Vola became the first person in Tonga to be convicted of murder in 24 years.&lt;ref name="R v Vola [2005] TOLawRep 34"&gt;{{cite web|title=R v Vola [2005] TOLawRep 34|url=http://www.paclii.org/to/cases/TOLawRp/2005/34.html|website=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute|publisher=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Webster CJ did not impose the death penalty, on the basis that Vola's actions did not meet the threshold of "one of the rarest of rare cases where the alternative option of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R v Vola [2005] TOLawRep 34|url=http://www.paclii.org/to/cases/TOLawRp/2005/34.html|website=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute|publisher=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster CJ did not make any moral judgment on the death penalty, explaining that it was "a matter for the Government and Parliament" to decide whether the death penalty should be retained in Tonga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R v Vola [2005] TOLawRep34|url=http://www.paclii.org/to/cases/TOLawRp/2005/34.html|website=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute|publisher=Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment in ''R v Vola'' serves as an indicator that Tonga does not impose the death penalty lightly.

==International actions and other states' responses==
===General===
The United Nations presented a [[United Nations moratorium on the death penalty|moratorium on the death penalty]] in 2007. Tonga voted against this, and continued to do so in 2008, 2010, and 2012. However, more recently - in 2014 and 2016 - Tonga chose to abstain from voting on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The last execution was carried out in 1982|url=http://english.nessunotocchicaino.it/notizia/the-last-execution-was-carried-out-in-1982-20001215|website=Hands Off Cain|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates a shift in Tonga's thinking which is consistent with its abolitionist in practice status.

In the aftermath of the [[2006 Nuku‘alofa riots]], where several men were suspected of murder, it appeared that these men may never face trial. The [[Australia]]n government, which formed part of the investigative team for the riots, refused to hand over the autopsy reports of victims for fear of the death penalty being imposed on the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/1318360/1497738 |title=NZ embroiled in diplomatic row |publisher=ONE News |date=10 December 2007 |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a diplomatic move on Australia’s part, which sent a clear message to Tonga that it did not approve of its retention of the death penalty. However, this has not altered Tonga’s stance at law.

===Universal Periodic Review===

'''2008 Cycle'''

In the course of its first [[Universal Periodic Review]] cycle in 2008, Tonga received a recommendation from [[Italy]] to abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPR Report of the Working Group p 7|url=http://www.lan.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/TOSession2.aspx|publisher=OHCHR|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonga responded with a reminder that it had not imposed such a penalty since 1982, and that it welcomed “further opportunities for discussion and debate on this issue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPR Report of the Working Group p 18|url=http://www.lan.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/TOSession2.aspx|publisher=OHCHR|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following this cycle, Tonga made no efforts towards abolition of the death penalty. Given that Tonga has ratified few [[international human rights]] treaties, it has few international obligations regarding the death penalty.

'''2012 Cycle'''

The 2012 cycle brought similar recommendations, this time from a number of [[Sovereign state|States]]. These included recommendations from Australia, [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]] to ratify the [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|Second Optional Protocol]] to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which is aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. Tonga is neither a signatory to, nor has it ratified, the ICCPR. As such, Australia and the United Kingdom’s recommendations included a suggestion to ratify this Covenant as well. In its response, Tonga said that it had not considered ratifying the ICCPR. However, it referred to ''R v Vola'' as authority that the Tongan Courts are applying principles of the ICCPR despite its non-ratification status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPR National Report p 20|url=http://www.lan.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/TOSession2.aspx|publisher=OHCHR|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 UPR cycle, Italy and [[Slovakia]] each made separate recommendations regarding the imposition of the death penalty on people under 18. Italy suggested that Tonga “explicitly prohibit” this, with Slovakia recommending the “immediate” abolition of the death penalty for juvenile offenders. Italy specifically mentioned that this would be in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and a contemporary [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] of the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPR Report of the Working Group p 17|url=http://www.lan.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/TOSession2.aspx|publisher=OHCHR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonga has ratified the CRC, which prohibits capital punishment for people aged under 18, regardless of the offence committed.&lt;ref&gt;Article 37 Convention on the Rights of the Child&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonga's response during this cycle brought to light its determination to retain the death penalty. Despite being an abolitionist in practice, Tonga is essentially a retentionist state as it refuses to abolish capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baird|first1=Natalie|title=The Role of International Non-Governmental Organisations in the Universal Periodic Review of the Pacific Island States: Can "Doing Good" be Done Better?|journal=Melbourne Journal of International Law|date=2015|volume=16 |issue=2|page=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared to other countries===
Tonga joins 140 other countries which are abolitionist in law or practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death penalty in 2016: Facts and figures|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/04/death-penalty-2016-facts-and-figures/|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Pacific Island countries, only Tonga and [[capital punishment in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] retain the death penalty.

'''Chris Hughes''' (born 18 April 1975) is a British born TV [[hypnotist]], [[hypnotherapist]], [[Public speaking|speaker]], and [[entertainer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9056610|title=Britannica Library|website=library.eb.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for attempting to set a world record for the biggest online hypnosis event. The Socialtrance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialtrance.com/|title=#Socialtrance}}&lt;/ref&gt; live event was exclusively for users of [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] and attracted over 1,000,000 listeners from over 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/online/hypnotist-plans-to-put-facebookers-in-trance-1856768.html|title=Hypnotist plans to put Facebookers in trance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/6905862/Hypnotist-to-put-nation-in-a-trance-using-Twitter-and-Facebook.html|title=Hypnotist to put nation in a trance using Twitter and Facebook|date=30 December 2009|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/04/tech/main6053338.shtml|title=Hypnotist Using Web for Mass Trance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this event he has become increasingly well known for his modern approach to hypnosis. He featured and appeared on [[BBC One]], [[BBC Three]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] , [[Sky Living]], [[CNN Türk]], [[BBC Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and [[Talksport]] with [[Ian Collins (radio presenter)|Ian Collins]]. In the same year on the 31 May, over 13,500 people took part in the Socialtrance Stop Smoking Session for World No Tobacco Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/2010/announcement/en/index.html|title=WHO - World No Tobacco Day 2010|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/828266-could-twitter-and-facebook-help-you-quit-the-fags|title=Could Twitter and Facebook help you quit the fags?|date=28 May 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; once again for users of Facebook and Twitter.

On World Hypnotism Day, 4 January 2011, Socialtrance returned with a weight loss session for charity which over 30,000 people attended. The live 30 minute hypnosis webcast was designed to modify the eating habits of all participants. At the end of the session a weight loss MP3 was released on iTunes and all other major music sites with all proceeds from the download donated to Diabetes UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.org.uk/|title=Diabetes UK - Know diabetes. Fight diabetes|website=Diabetes UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 Hughes appeared on [[Sky Living]]'s ''Slave to Food''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyliving.sky.com/claire-richards-slave-to-food|title=Sky Witness|website=Sky}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Steps (group)|Steps]] singer [[Claire Richards]]. During the first episode Hughes is seen hypnotising Claire and trying to help change her relationship with food.

==Career==

== Biography ==
Baucom lives in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] where he is the Richard Lee Simpson Distinguished Professor of Psychology at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/clinpsy/people/faculty_fulltime.html#baucom |title=Psychology Department Faculty |year=2009 |publisher=UNC Department of Psychology |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a familiar face on campus, having received both his [[bachelor's degree]] and his [[Ph.D.]] from UNC. Baucom's son Brian is also a Clinical Psychologist. Brian worked in southern California where he received his Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

== Research description ==
[[File:couplesresearchers.JPG|thumb|left|Baucom with fellow couples researchers, Brian Baucom (Center) and Andrew Christensen (Right)]]
For over thirty years, Donald H. Baucom has focused his research on the dynamics of intimate relationships and how various factors contribute to distress, as well as joy, in couples. As a strong proponent of the [[scientist-practitioner model]] he is committed to the development of [[Evidence-based practice|empirically based]] effective interventions for partners in intimate relationships. In doing so, he has been a leader in the development of the theoretical, empirical, and clinical foundation of cognitive-behavioral therapy that is used for helping couples in distress. Baucom has spent his career observing the ways in which couples interact, and how these individual interaction styles can cause both distress and joy in relationships based on factors such as social support, health, and [[infidelity]].&lt;ref name=uncresearch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/clinpsy/people/baucomd.html |title=Baucom, Donald H. - Research |author=Don Baucom |date=n.d. |work= |publisher=UNC Department of Psychology |accessdate=2009-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527233139/http://www.unc.edu/depts/clinpsy/people/baucomd.html |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social Support:''' Baucom has been interested in the ways by which social support styles contribute to both positive and negative functioning during the course of a relationship.

'''Health:''' Baucom has studied the ways in which physiological/psychological health can become stressors in a dyad that can contribute to distress. For example, he has developed intervention studies based on the effects of anorexia, cancer, smoking, and arthritis with regards to couples functioning.

'''Infidelity:''' This area is of particular interest to Baucom due to the severity of the direct distress it causes to the relationship. He has collaborated with his colleagues to develop a self-help book for partners experiencing infidelity, and is in the process of creating a training manual to guide practitioners in the aid of couples dealing with infidelity.

'''Obsessive-compulsive disorder:''' Baucom has collaborated with experts on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to develop a couple-based cognitive-behavioral treatment approach for couples in which one partner has this anxiety-related disorder. The treatment involves primarily bringing the non-OCD partner into therapy and training him or her to be a coach to help with exposure and response prevention for the partner with OCD. The couple also learns effective communication strategies and techniques for reducing accommodation and avoidance behaviors together.

===CanThrive===
Currently, Baucom is working on a large-scale treatment study funded by the [[National Cancer Institute]] called CanThrive. This is a couple-based intervention focused on partnerships in which the female has breast cancer. This study observes and measures various aspects of communicated social support between both partners, and is interested in finding possible relationships between differences in social support and treatment outcomes for breast cancer. This study has the largest observationally coded sample of any couples study to date, and is based at both the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]]. Additionally, he is collaborating with colleagues conducting a similar study in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=uncresearch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canthrive.unc.edu/html/what.htm |title=What Is CanThrive? |date=n.d. |work= |publisher=CanThrive |accessdate=2009-11-07 }}

The '''Donjon de Houdan''' (Houdan Keep) is a medieval fortified tower in the ''[[Communes in France|commune]]'' of [[Houdan]] in the [[Yvelines]] ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' of [[France]].

== Architecture ==
Constructed around 1120-1137 by [[Amaury III of Montfort]], the [[keep|keep or donjon]] is the only vestige of the medieval [[castle]] of Houdan. It is a massive tower isolated from the town in the west, and is now used as a water tower.

The tower is cylindrical, 16 metres in diameter and 25 metres in height. It is flanked by four turrets 4.8 metres in diameter each at cardinal points on the central cylinder. The walls of the tower have an average thickness of three metres.

The tower consists of three levels: a ground floor, and two higher floors. The interior floors and roof have disappeared. An access door was located 6 metres above the ground level and once gave access to the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] floor. Another entrance was located in one of the turrets.

The donjon is thought to have been one of the earliest experiments in improving flanking fire from the battlements (reduction of "dead ground"), and a transitional form between the rectangular keeps of the 11th to 12th centuries, and widespread adoption of cylindrical keeps in the 13th century. Other contemporary examples can be seen at [[Étampes]] and [[Provins]].

== History ==
* 1120–1137: construction of the keep
* 1840: classified as an official historical building ({{lang-fr|[[monument historique]]}})
* 1880: installation of a 200 kilolitre cistern in the keep, transforming it into a water tower ({{lang-fr|château d'eau}})
* 1903: acquisition of the keep by the town of Houdan, courtesy of the last private owner, a Dr. Aulet.

This tower has never been taken during its history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

{{Main article|Dyslexia|Management of dyslexia}}

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], people with [[dyslexia]], especially school children, can benefit from a range of support techniques including additional one-to-one literacy support from specialist teachers,&lt;ref name="ITNov16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/a-testing-system-for-leaving-cert-students-with-difficulties-1.2436860 |date=24 November 2015 |title=A Testing System for Students with Difficulties |accessdate=29 November 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-39003782.html |subscription=yes |deadurl=no |archivedate=2015 |last=McGuire |first=Peter |via=[[Highbeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer tools with text-to-speech, spelling correction and [[word prediction]]; coloured glasses, and many other methods.&lt;ref name="SESS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dyslexia |publisher=Special Education Support Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007213641/http://www.sess.ie/categories/specific-learning-disabilities/dyslexia |accessdate=29 November 2015 |deadurl=no |year=2015 |archivedate=7 October 2015 |url=http://www.sess.ie/categories/specific-learning-disabilities/dyslexia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques chosen for an individual vary according to their particular conditions. People in [[Northern Ireland]] are aided by the service available from [[Dyslexia support in the United Kingdom]].

==Mainstream education==

===Classroom aids===
Depending on the level of impairment, students may be offered support from a [[Special Needs Assistant]].

===Irish language exemption===
[[Irish language|Irish]] is a compulsory subject in general. Students with dyslexia can claim an exemption in order to focus on English language study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524105214/http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Irish-Exemption/Irish-Exemption.html |title=Irish Exemption |deadurl=no   |accessdate=29 November 2016 |year=2015 |archivedate=24 May 2015 |publisher=[[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Skills]] |url=http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Irish-Exemption/Irish-Exemption.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examinations===

'''Edward ("Ted") Hance Shortliffe''' (born 1947) is a Canadian-born American biomedical informatician, physician, and computer scientist. Shortliffe is a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in medicine. He was the principal developer of the clinical expert system [[MYCIN]], one of the first rule-based [[artificial intelligence]] expert systems, which obtained clinical data interactively from a physician user and was used to diagnose and recommend treatment for severe infections. While never used in practice (because it preceded the era of local-area networking and could not be integrated with patient records and physician workflow), its performance was shown to be comparable to and sometimes more accurate than that of Stanford infectious disease faculty.&lt;ref&gt;1. Rule-Based Expert Systems: The MYCIN Experiments of the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project -(edited by Bruce G. Buchanan and Edward H. Shortliffe; ebook version http://www.aaaipress.org/Classic/Buchanan/buchanan.html )&lt;/ref&gt; This spurred the development of a wide range of activity in the development of rule-based expert systems, knowledge representation, belief nets and other areas, and its design greatly influenced the subsequent development of computing in medicine.

He is also regarded as a founder of the field of [[biomedical informatics]], and in 2006 received one of its highest honors, the [[Morris F. Collen Award]] given by the [[American College of Medical Informatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1197/jamia.M2374 |title=Presentation of the 2006 Morris F. Collen Award to Edward H. (Ted) Shortliffe |year=2007 |last1=Greenes |first1=R. A. |last2=Buchanan |first2=B. G. |last3=Ellison |first3=D. |journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=376–85 |pmid=17557382 |pmc=2244891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has held administrative positions in academic medicine, research and national bodies including the [[Institute of Medicine]], [[American College of Physicians]], the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institutes of Health]], and [[National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), and been influential in the development of medicine, computing and biomedical informatics nationally and internationally. His interests include the broad range of issues related to integrated medical decision-support systems and their implementation, biomedical informatics and medical education and training, and the Internet in medicine.

In March 2007, he became founding dean of the [[University of Arizona]]'s [http://phoenixmed.arizona.edu College of Medicine - Phoenix] campus. He stepped down from this position in May 2008 and in January 2009 transferred his primary academic appointment to [[Arizona State University]] where he became [[professor]] of biomedical informatics. He maintained a secondary appointment as professor of basic medical sciences and of medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine (Phoenix Campus). In November 2009 he transferred his academic home to a part-time appointment as professor at the School of Biomedical Informatics, [[University of Texas Health Science Center]] at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he lived until November 2011. Since that time he has returned to New York City, where he continues as an adjunct professor of biomedical informatics at [[Columbia University]].

In July 2009, Shortliffe assumed a position as president and chief executive officer of the [[American Medical Informatics Association]], an organization that he helped to form between 1988 and 1990 when he was President of the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/professor-lead-national-biomedical-organization|title=Professor to lead national biomedical organization|date=2008-09-22|newspaper=ASU Now: Access, Excellence, Impact|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 he announced his intention to step down from this position in 2012.

== Biography and career ==
Shortliffe grew up in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], until his family moved to [[Connecticut]] when he was 6. He attended the Loomis School in Connecticut (now [[Loomis Chaffee School]]) and later Gresham's School in the United Kingdom. His father was a physician and hospital administrator; his mother, an English teacher. He has one brother and one sister.

As an undergraduate at [[Harvard]], he started working in the computer laboratory of G. Octo Barnett at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and realized that he could have a career spanning both medicine and computing.

After receiving an AB in [[applied mathematics]] ''magna cum laude'' from Harvard College in 1970, he received an [[M.D.]] (1976) and [[Ph.D.]] in Medical Information Systems (1975) from [[Stanford University]], with a dissertation on the MYCIN system, for which he also won the 1976 [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]] for outstanding computer scientists under the age of 30. He completed internal medicine house-staff training from 1976-1979 at Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford Hospital. In 1979 he joined the Stanford faculty in internal medicine and computer science, where he directed the Stanford University Medical EXpertimental computer resource (SUMEX) and subsequently the Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford (CAMIS), continuing his work on expert systems, including ONCOCIN (an oncology decision support program), T-HELPER, and other projects in the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project.&lt;ref&gt;Clancey WJ, Shortliffe EH, eds. Readings in medical artificial intelligence:the first decade. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He also simultaneously served as chief of general internal medicine and associate chair of medicine for primary care, and was principal investigator of the InterMed Collaboratory, which developed the science of computable guidelines for medical decision support.

In 1980 he founded one of the earliest formal degree programs in biomedical informatics at Stanford University, emphasizing a rigorous and experimentalist approach. From 2003-2007 he served on the Board of Directors of Medco Health Solutions, a large pharmacy benefits manager headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.

In 2000 he moved to [[Columbia University]] as chair of the department of biomedical informatics, deputy vice president ([[Columbia University Medical Center]]), senior associate dean for strategic information resources (College of Physicians and Surgeons), professor of medicine, professor of computer science, and director of medical informatics services for the New York-Presbyterian Hospital. He continued work on decision support guidelines including the development of the Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF3).&lt;ref&gt;Boxwala AA, Peleg M, Tu S, Ogunyemi O, Zeng QT, Wang D, Patel VL, Greenes RA, Shortliffe EH. `GLIF3: a representation format for sharable computer-interpretable clinical practice guidelines.' Journal of Biomedical Informatics 2004;37(3):147-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 2007 until May 2008 he served as the founding dean of the Phoenix campus of the University of Arizona's College of Medicine and from November 2009 to October 2011 he served as professor in the School of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, Texas. He has served as president and chief executive officer of the [[American Medical Informatics Association]] from 2009-2012 and continues to hold adjunct faculty appointments in biomedical informatics at [[Columbia University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/people/edward-shortliffe/|title=Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arizona State University]].

== Advisory activities ==
At age 39, Shortliffe was elected to the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (where he has served on the IOM executive council). He is also an elected member or fellow of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]], [[American Society for Clinical Investigation]], the [[Association of American Physicians]], and the [[American Clinical and Climatological Association]].

He is a founding member of the [[American Medical Informatics Association]] and was one of five founding fellows of the [[American College of Medical Informatics]]. He is a master of the American College of Physicians and was a member of that organization's Board of Regents from 1996-2002. He is [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Journal of Biomedical Informatics]]'' and serves on the [[editorial board]]s for several other biomedical informatics publications.

He has served on the oversight committee for the Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences (National Academy of Sciences) and the Biomedical Informatics Expert Panel ([[National Center for Research Resources]] at the National Institutes of Health). He also served on the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and on the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. Earlier he served on the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (National Research Council), the Biomedical Library Review Committee ([[National Library of Medicine]]), and was recipient of a research career development award from the latter agency.

He is the author of more than 300 publications including seven books.

'''Effective safety training''' is an unofficial phrase used to describe the training materials designed to teach [[occupational safety and health]] standards developed by the United States government labor organization, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). OSHA has produced many standards and regulations that affect employers and employees in the United States.  United States employers have a legal responsibility to educate employees on all [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] standards and the hazards that their employees may face while on the job, and providing effective safety training meets that responsibility.

==Introduction==

Employers must have an overall safety program including relative site specific safety information where applicable.   The safety training program should cover topics such as:&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Lawrence(J.D.), Barnett (2000). ''Safety Management Handbook: CCH Safety Professional Series''. Vol. 2 pg.9301–9307. Health and Human Resources, Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;
*accident prevention and safety promotion
*safety compliance
*accident and emergency response
*personal protective equipment
*safety practices
*equipment and machinery
*chemical and hazardous materials safety
*workplace hazards
*employee involvement

Employers must document all training.  Creating a training matrix will help keep track of who has been trained, when they were trained, the training topic, and when it is time for refresher training. Employees must also sign an official sign-in sheet provided by the employer that can serve as proof that employees received proper training.  The sign in sheet must have a broad description of what is being covered in the training. Tests or quizzes on the presented material can help gauge employee understanding of the material and highlight topics that need to be reviewed.

The non-English speaking population is consistently growing in many industries and it is important that employers provide bilingual training for those workers, as OSHA requires that '''all employees''' be properly trained.

Most employees display attitudes of disinterest and dread at the thought of attending a safety training, which can leave the trainer feeling frustrated and unappreciated.  It is the trainer's duty to make safety training fun and educational, which will help the trainees to retain the information, enjoy the course, and apply the learning to their work and lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyer, Barbara; Veasey, Alan; Oldfield, Kenneth; Craft-McCormick, Lisa (2000) ''Effective Safety and Health Training'', CRC Press {{ISBN|1-56670-396-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of a training program==

An effective training program can reduce the number of injuries and [[occupational fatality|deaths]], property damage, legal liability, illnesses, workers' compensation claims, and missed time from work.  An effective safety training program can also help a trainer keep the required OSHA-mandated safety training courses organized and up-to-date.
Safety training classes help establish a safety culture in which employees themselves help promote proper safety procedures while on the job. It is important that new employees be properly trained and embrace the importance of workplace safety as it is easy for seasoned workers to negatively influence the new hires. That negative influence however, can be purged with the establishment of new, hands-on, innovative effective safety training which will ultimately lead to an effective safety culture. A 1998 [[NIOSH]] study concluded that the role of training in developing and maintaining effective hazard control activities is a proven and successful method of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH (1998). ''Assessing Occupational Safety and Health Training: a Literature Review'', NIOSH Publication No. 98-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSHA's voluntary training guidelines==

OSHA issued voluntary training guidelines in 1992.  These guidelines serve as a model for trainers to use in developing, organizing, evaluating, and editing their safety training programs.  It is important for trainers to tailor the OSHA guidelines to their specific work site so that the training is relevant to the specific working conditions and not just a long generalized informational session.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many standards promulgated by OSHA explicitly require the employer to train employees in the safety and health aspects of their jobs. Other OSHA standards make it the employer's responsibility to limit certain job assignments to employees who are "certified," "competent," or "qualified"—meaning that they have had special previous training, in or out of the workplace. The term "designated" personnel means selected or assigned by the employer or the employer's representative as being qualified to perform specific duties. These requirements reflect OSHA's belief that training is an essential part of every employer's safety and health program for protecting workers from injuries and illnesses.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;US Department of Labor. ''Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines''. OSHA 2254 1998 (Revised). https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha2254.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OSHA's training guidelines follow a model that consists of:

*A. Determining if Training is Needed
*B. Identifying Training Needs
*C. Identifying Goals and Objectives
*D. Developing learning activities
*E. Conducting the training
*F. Evaluating program effectiveness
*G. Improving the program
*H. Training must align with job tasks.
**'''A. Determining if training is needed'''
You first have to determine if a situation can be solved using training. Training, or retraining as the case may be, could be required by an OSHA standard.  Training is an effective solution to problems such as employee lack of understanding, unfamiliarity with equipment, incorrect execution of a task, lack of attention, or lack of motivation.  Sometimes, however, the situation cannot be mitigated through the use of training and other methods, such as the establishment of engineering controls, may be needed to ensure worker safety.

**'''B. Identifying training needs'''
A [[job safety analysis]] and/or a [[job hazard analysis]] should be conducted with every employee so that it is understood what is needed to do the job safely and what hazards are associated with the job.  A safety trainer may observe the worker in his/her environment to adequately assess the worker's training needs.  Certain employees may need extra training due to the hazards associated with their particular job.  These employees should be trained not only on
how to perform their job safely but also on how to operate within a hazardous
environment.

**'''C. Identifying Goals and Objectives'''
It is important for the Trainer to identify necessary training material.  It is equally important that the trainer identify training material that is not needed to avoid unnecessary training and frustration from their trainees.

At the beginning of every safety training session the trainer should clearly iterate the objectives of the class.  The objectives should be delivered using action oriented words like:  the employee ..."will be able to demonstrate" or "will know when to"... which will help the audience understand what he/she should know by the end of the class or what to information to assimilate during the class. Clearly established objectives also help focus the evaluation process on those skill sets and knowledge requirements necessary to perform the job safely.

**'''D. Developing Learning Activities'''
Training should be hands-on and simulate the job as closely as possible.  Trainers can use instructional aids such as charts, manuals, PowerPoint presentations, and films.  Trainers can also include role-playing, live demonstrations, and round-table group discussions to stimulate employee participation. Games like "what's wrong with this picture" (it is usually good to use pictures of situations found at their specific location)" or "safety jeopardy" can be useful ways to make the training fun yet educational.

**'''E. Conducting the Training'''
Trainers should provide employees with an overview of the material to be learned and relate the training to the employees' experiences.  Employers should also reinforce what the employees have learned by summarizing the program's objectives and key points of training.  At the beginning of the training program, the trainer should show the employees why the material is important and relevant to their jobs.  Employees are more likely to pay attention and apply what they've learned if they know the benefits of the training.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

**'''F. Evaluating Program Effectiveness'''
Evaluation will help employers or supervisors determine the amount of learning achieved and whether an employee's performance has improved on the job. Among the methods of evaluating training are:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) Student opinion. Questionnaires or informal discussions with employees can help employers determine the relevance and appropriateness of the training program
***(2) Supervisors' observations.  Supervisors are in good positions to observe an employee's performance both before and after the training and note improvements or changes
***(3) Workplace improvements. The ultimate success of a training program may be changes throughout the workplace that result in reduced injury or accident rates
*** (4) Formal assessments.  Practical and written exams also assist in evaluating understanding of training material.  For example, for a lift-truck operator, a written and a practical exam would identify areas of training that may need to be revisited.  Furthermore administering a pre-test and post-test will establish a knowledge base line or reference point to measure training effectiveness.
**'''G. Improving the Program'''
As evaluations are reviewed, it may be evident the training was not adequate and that the employees did not reach the expected level of knowledge and skill.  As the program is evaluated, the trainer should ask:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) If a job analysis was conducted, was it accurate?
***(2) Was any critical feature of the job overlooked?
***(3) Were the important gaps in knowledge and skill included?
***(4) Was material already known by the employees intentionally omitted?
***(5) Were the instructional objectives presented clearly and concretely?
***(6) Did the objectives state the level of acceptable performance that was expected of employees?
***(7) Did the learning activity simulate the actual job?
***(8) Was the learning activity appropriate for the kinds of knowledge and skills required on the job?
***(9) When the training was presented, was the organization of the material and its meaning made clear?
***(10) Were the employees motivated to learn?
***(11) Were the employees allowed to participate actively in the training process?
***(12) Was the employer's evaluation of the program thorough?

==Computer and video training==

Computers and videos can be a great addition to a company's safety training program. As stand alone resources, they may not be adequate in meeting OSHA's training requirements as they are not site specific. Computer-based training can help meet the following training challenges&lt;ref&gt;Hubiak, Stacy (1998). "Click On to Effective Training," ''Safety and Health Magazine'', Sept., pg.116&lt;/ref&gt;
*Training employees in remote sites
*Employees who become bored with the same safety training
*Safety managers lack of time and resources to effectively train employees
*Providing a means of documenting and tracking student progress
*Lowering trainer fees or travel costs
*A self-paced, relaxed learning environment

==OSHA Medical Safety==

There is no more important places to regard the positive impact the OSHA regulations than in the healthcare and clinical settings. OSHA has been revolutionary in the medical field due to its ability to prevent the spread of diseases. Every clinical facility on US land, civilian or military is governed by OSHA's directives. To remain in accordance to the Federal regulations enacted by OSHA healthcare administrators must maintain an OSHA safety program and train their employees on an annual basis. Some of the topics that employees must be trained on include:
* Bloodborne Pathogen Standard
* Chemical Hazard Communications
* Tuberculosis Exposure Control
* Mercury Exposure
* Ionizing Radiation Exposure
* Fire Escape Plan
* Emergency Action Plan
* Electricity Safety
* Fire Safety Standard

The '''epidemiology of autism''' is the study of the incidence and distribution of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD).  A 2012 review of global [[prevalence]] estimates of [[autism spectrum disorders]] found a [[median]] of 62 cases per 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=Elsabbagh&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Elsabbagh M, Divan G, Yun-Joo Koh YJ ''et al.'' |title= Global prevalence of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |journal=Autism Res |date=2012 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=160–79 |pmid=22495912 |doi=10.1002/aur.239 |pmc=3763210}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of evidence from low- and middle-income countries though.&lt;ref name=Elsabbagh/&gt;

ASD averages a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;  The number of children known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; it is unclear whether prevalence has actually increased;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt; and as-yet-unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt;
The risk of autism is associated with several [[prenatal]] factors, including advanced [[Paternal age effect|paternal age]] and [[diabetes]] in the mother during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Gardener/&gt; ASD is associated with several [[genetic disorder]]s&lt;ref name=Zafeiriou/&gt; and with epilepsy.&lt;ref name=Levisohn/&gt;

[[Autism]] is a complex [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]. Many causes have been proposed, but its [[Etiology|theory of causation]] is still questionable and ultimately unknown.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Trottier G, Srivastava L, Walker CD |title= Etiology of infantile autism: a review of recent advances in genetic and neurobiological research |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |year=1999 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=103–15 |pmid=10212552 |pmc=1188990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Autism is believed to be largely [[Heritability|inherited]], although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear which genes are responsible.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Freitag CM |title= The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Little evidence exists to support associations with specific environmental exposures.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents]] that cause birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |date=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=189–99 |title= The teratology of autism |author=Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as childhood [[vaccine]]s, are [[Controversies in autism|controversial]] and the vaccine hypotheses lack any convincing [[Evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]].&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt;

==Frequency==
Although incidence rates measure autism risk directly, most epidemiological studies report other frequency measures, typically point or period prevalence, or sometimes cumulative incidence. Attention is focused mostly on whether prevalence is increasing with time.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

===Incidence and prevalence===
[[Epidemiology]] defines several measures of the frequency of occurrence of a disease or condition:&lt;ref name=Coggon&gt;{{vcite book |author= Coggon D, Rose G, Barker DJP |title= Epidemiology for the Uninitiated |url=http://www.bmj.com/epidem/epid.html |chapterurl=http://www.bmj.com/epidem/epid.2.html |chapter=Quantifying diseases in populations |publisher=BMJ |date=1997 |isbn=0-7279-1102-3 |edition=4th }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence rate]] of a condition is the rate at which new cases occurred per person-year, for example, "2 new cases per 1,000 person-years".
*The [[cumulative incidence]] is the proportion of a population that became new cases within a specified time period, for example, "1.5 per 1,000 people became new cases during 2006".
*The [[point prevalence]] of a condition is the proportion of a population that had the condition at a single point in time, for example, "10 cases per 1,000 people at the start of 2006".
*The [[period prevalence]] is the proportion that had the condition at any time within a stated period, for example, "15 per 1,000 people had cases during 2006".

When studying how diseases are caused, incidence rates are the most appropriate measure of disease frequency as they assess risk directly. However, incidence can be difficult to measure with rarer chronic diseases such as autism.&lt;ref name=Coggon/&gt; In autism epidemiology, point or period prevalence is more useful than incidence, as the disorder starts long before it is diagnosed, and the gap between initiation and diagnosis is influenced by many factors unrelated to risk. Research focuses mostly on whether point or period prevalence is increasing with time; cumulative incidence is sometimes used in studies of birth [[Cohort (statistics)|cohorts]].&lt;ref name=Newschaffer&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Newschaffer CJ, Croen LA, Daniels J ''et al.'' |author.= |title=The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |year=2007 |volume=28 |pages=235–258 |pmid=17367287 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144007 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903024137/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estimation methods===
The three basic approaches used to estimate prevalence differ in cost and in quality of results. The simplest and cheapest method is to count known autism cases from sources such as schools and clinics, and divide by the population. This approach is likely to underestimate prevalence because it does not count children who have not been diagnosed yet, and it is likely to generate skewed statistics because some children have better access to treatment.&lt;ref name="Scahill L 2008"&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Scahill L, Bearss K |title= The rise in autism and the mercury myth |journal=J Child Adolesc Psychiatr Nurs |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=51–53 |year=2009 |pmid=19200293 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2008.00152.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second method improves on the first by having investigators examine student or patient records looking for probable cases, to catch cases that have not been identified yet. The third method, which is arguably the best, screens a large sample of an entire community to identify possible cases, and then evaluates each possible case in more detail with standard diagnostic procedures. This last method typically produces the most reliable, and the highest, prevalence estimates.&lt;ref name="Scahill L 2008"/&gt;

===Frequency estimates===
Estimates of the [[prevalence]] of autism vary widely depending on diagnostic criteria, age of children screened, and geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Williams JG, Higgins JPT, Brayne CEG |title=Systematic review of prevalence studies of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Arch Dis Child |year=2006 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=8–15 |pmid=15863467 |doi=10.1136/adc.2004.062083 |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_Williams_etal_ADC.pdf |format=PDF |pmc=2083083 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418234727/http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_Williams_etal_ADC.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recent [[review]]s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

A 2006 study of nearly 57,000 British nine- and ten-year-olds reported a prevalence of 3.89 per 1,000 for autism and 11.61 per 1,000 for ASD; these higher figures could be associated with broadening diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Prevalence of disorders of the autism spectrum in a population cohort of children in South Thames: the Special Needs and Autism Project (SNAP)|author=Baird G, Simonoff E, Pickles A ''et al.'' |author.= |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9531 |pages=210–215 |date=2006 |pmid=16844490 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69041-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies based on more detailed information, such as direct observation rather than examination of medical records, identify higher prevalence; this suggests that published figures may underestimate ASD's true prevalence.&lt;ref name=Caronna&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=518–523 |title=Autism spectrum disorders: clinical and research frontiers |author=Caronna EB, Milunsky JM, [[Helen Tager-Flusberg|Tager-Flusberg H]] |doi=10.1136/adc.2006.115337 |pmid=18305076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study of the children in [[Cambridgeshire]], England used different methods to measure prevalence, and estimated that 40% of ASD cases go undiagnosed, with the two least-biased estimates of true prevalence being 11.3 and 15.7 per 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Scott FJ, Allison C ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Prevalence of autism-spectrum conditions: UK school-based population study |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=194 |issue=6 |pages=500–509 |year=2009 |pmid=19478287 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.059345 |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2009_BC_etal_BritishJournalPsychiatry_Prevalence.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331115510/http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2009_BC_etal_BritishJournalPsychiatry_Prevalence.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes with time===
Attention has been focused on whether the prevalence of autism is increasing with time. Earlier prevalence estimates were lower, centering at about 0.5 per 1,000 for autism during the 1960s and 1970s and about 1 per 1,000 in the 1980s, as opposed to today's 1–2 per 1000.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

The trend curves slightly upward.|Reports of autism cases per 1,000 children grew dramatically in the U.S. from 1996 to 2007.

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s, prompting investigations into several potential reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=364&amp;a=2618 |title= Notes on the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders |author= [[Lorna Wing|Wing L]], Potter D |publisher=National Autistic Society |date=1999 |accessdate=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More children may have autism; that is, the true frequency of autism may have increased.
* There may be more complete pickup of autism (case finding), as a result of increased awareness and funding. For example, attempts to sue vaccine companies may have increased case-reporting.
* The diagnosis may be applied more broadly than before, as a result of the changing definition of the disorder, particularly changes in [[DSM-III-R]] and DSM-IV.
*An editorial error in the description of the PDD-NOS category of Autism Spectrum Disorders in the DSM-IV, in 1994, inappropriately broadened the PDD-NOS construct.  The error was corrected in the DSM-IV-TR, in 2000, reversing the PDD-NOS construct back to the more restrictive diagnostic criteria requirements from the DSM-III-R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarification of the definition of Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm/practice-relevant-changes-to-the-dsm-iv-tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Successively earlier diagnosis in each succeeding cohort of children, including recognition in nursery (preschool), may have affected apparent prevalence but not incidence.
* A review of the "rising autism" figures compared to other disabilities in schools shows a corresponding drop in findings of mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713205936/http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=158 Five Easy Graphs], USDE figures&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Several environmental risk factors have been proposed to support the hypothesis that the actual frequency of autism has increased. These include certain foods, infectious disease, [[pesticides]].

The number of new cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Caucasian boys is roughly 50% higher than found in Hispanic children, and approximately 30% more likely to occur than in Non-Hispanic white children in the United States.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASD Data and Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |title = ASD Data and Statistics |website = CDC.gov |accessdate= 5 Apr 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140418153648/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |archivedate = 2014-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further study in 2006 concluded that the apparent rise in administrative prevalence was the result of diagnostic substitution, mostly for findings of mental retardation and learning disabilities.&lt;ref name=Shattuck/&gt; "Many of the children now being counted in the autism category would probably have been counted in the mental retardation or learning disabilities categories if they were being labeled 10 years ago instead of today," said researcher [[Paul Shattuck]] of the Waisman Center at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], in a statement.&lt;ref name="Shattuck2"&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu-ref.com/autism-child-rate Rise in Autism Rate Misleading, study says] CBC news quoting Paul Shattuck, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A population-based study in [[Olmsted County]], [[Minnesota]] county found that the cumulative incidence of autism grew eightfold from the 1980–83 period to the 1995–97 period. The increase occurred after the introduction of broader, more-precise diagnostic criteria, increased service availability, and increased awareness of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |date=2005 |volume=159 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |title= The incidence of autism in Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1976-1997: results from a population-based study |author=Barbaresi WJ, Katusic SK, Colligan RC, Weaver AL, Jacobsen SJ |doi=10.1001/archpedi.159.1.37 |pmid=15630056 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/159/1/37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, the reported number of autism cases grew 22-fold in the same location, suggesting that counts reported by clinics or schools provide misleading estimates of the true incidence of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Barbaresi WJ, Colligan RC, Weaver AL, Katusic SK |title= The incidence of clinically diagnosed versus research-identified autism in Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1976–1997: results from a retrospective, population-based study |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=464–470 |year=2008 |pmid=18791815 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0645-8 |pmc=2859841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Venezuela=====
A 2008 study in [[Venezuela]] reported a prevalence of 1.1 per 1000 for autism and 1.7 per 1000 for ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |date=2008 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=191–202 |title= Epidemiological findings of pervasive developmental disorders in a Venezuelan study |author=Montiel-Nava C, Peña JA |doi=10.1177/1362361307086663 |pmid=18308767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia====
A journal reports that the median prevalence of ASD among 2–6-year-old children who are reported in China from 2000 upwards was 10.3/10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|last1=Sun|first1=Xiang|last2=Allison|first2=Carrie|title=A review of the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Asia|journal=Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders|date=April 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=156–167|doi=10.1016/j.rasd.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Hong Kong=====
A 2008 Hong Kong study reported an ASD incidence rate similar to those reported in Australia and North America, and lower than Europeans. It also reported a prevalence of 1.68 per 1,000 for children under 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= J Child Neurol |date=2008 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=67–72 |title= Epidemiological study of autism spectrum disorder in China |author=Wong VCN, Hui SLH |doi=10.1177/0883073807308702 |pmid=18160559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Japan=====
A 2005 study of a part of [[Yokohama]] with a stable population of about 300,000 reported a cumulative incidence to age 7 years of 48 cases of ASD per 10,000 children in 1989, and 86 in 1990. After the vaccination rate of the triple [[MMR vaccine]] dropped to near zero and was replaced with MR and M vaccine, the incidence rate grew to 97 and 161 cases per 10,000 children born in 1993 and 1994, respectively, indicating that the combined MMR vaccine did not cause autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Honda H, Shimizu Y, Rutter M |title= No effect of MMR withdrawal on the incidence of autism: a total population study |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=572–579 |year=2005 |pmid=15877763 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01425.x |laysource=Bandolier |laysummary=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Vaccines/noMMR.html |laydate=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2004 Japanese autism association reported that about 360.000 people have typical kanner type autism.

==== Middle East ====

=====Israel=====
A 2009 study reported that the annual incidence rate of Israeli children with a diagnosis of ASD receiving disability benefits rose from zero in 1982–1984 to 190 per million in 2004. It was not known whether these figures reflected true increases or other factors such as changes in diagnostic measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Senecky Y, Chodick G, Diamond G, Lobel D, Drachman R, Inbar D |title= Time trends in reported autistic spectrum disorders in Israel, 1972–2004 |journal=Isr Med Assoc J |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=30–33 |year=2009 |pmid=19344009 |url=http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar09jan-05.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Saudi Arabia=====
Studies of autism frequency have been particularly rare in the [[Middle East]]. One rough estimate is that the prevalence of autism in [[Saudi Arabia]] is 18 per 10,000, slightly higher than the 13 per 10,000 reported in developed countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Al-Salehi SM, Al-Hifthy EH, Ghaziuddin M |title=Autism in Saudi Arabia: presentation, clinical correlates and comorbidity |journal=Transcult Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=340–347 |year=2009 |pmid=19541755 |doi=10.1177/1363461509105823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====

=====Denmark=====
In 1992, [[thiomersal]]-containing vaccines were removed in Denmark. A study at Aarhus University indicated that the rates of autism had stabilized and may be in decline after the removal of thiomersal from all vaccines. One co-author of the study stated "the incidence and prevalence are still decreasing in 2001". In 2003 Pediatrics magazine claimed that same study indicated that the cumulative incidence of autism in [[Denmark]] was stable until 1990, but then began to increase after the removal of thiomersal containing vaccines in 1992. The other doctor (Dr. Poul Thorsen) involved in the study omitted the 2001 data indicating dropping rates of autism. Thorsen was later charged with fraud and embezzlement while working with Aarhus University.&lt;ref&gt;http://mercury-freedrugs.org/docs/20110413_USAv_Thorsen_Indictment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Madsen KM, Lauritsen MB, Pedersen CB ''et al.'' |author.= |title= Thimerosal and the occurrence of autism: negative ecological evidence from Danish population-based data |journal=Pediatrics |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=604–606 |year=2003 |pmid=12949291  |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/112/3/604 |doi=10.1542/peds.112.3.604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====France=====
France made autism the national focus for the year 2012 and the Health Ministry now evaluates the rate of autism to be 67 per 10000 (1 out of 150).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autismegrandecause2012.fr/ Autisme Grande Cause] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404202501/http://www.autismegrandecause2012.fr/ |date=2012-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Fombonne]] made some studies in the years 1992 and 1997.

=====Germany=====
A 2008 study in [[Germany]] found that inpatient admission rates for children with ASD increased 30% from 2000 to 2005, with the largest rise between 2000 and 2001 and a decline between 2001 and 2003. Inpatient rates for all mental disorders also rose for ages up to 15 years, so that the ratio of ASD to all admissions rose from 1.3% to 1.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Epidemiology |date=2008 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=519–520 |title= Trends in autism spectrum disorder referrals |author=Bölte S, Poustka F, Holtmann M |doi=10.1097/EDE.0b013e31816a9e13 |pmid=18414094 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Norway=====
A 2009 study in [[Norway]] reported prevalence rates for ASD ranging from 0.21% to 0.87%, depending on assessment method and assumptions about non-response, suggesting that methodological factors explain large variances in prevalence rates in different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Posserud M, Lundervold AJ, Lie SA, Gillberg C |title=The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders: impact of diagnostic instrument and non-response bias |journal=Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |pmid=19551326 |doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0087-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
{{further information|Heritability of autism}}

As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; evidence from [[genetic epidemiology]] studies now suggests that it is one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter= Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author= [[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–178 |title= Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition= 2nd |editor= Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-521-54957-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first studies of twins estimated [[heritability]] to be more than 90%; in other words, that genetics explains more than 90% of autism cases.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; When only one identical twin is autistic, the other often has learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings, the risk of having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%,&lt;ref name=Folstein/&gt; much higher than the risk in controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=1994 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=877–900 |title= A case-control family history study of autism |author=Bolton P, Macdonald H, Pickles A ''et al.'' |author.= |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1994.tb02300.x |pmid=7962246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref name=Folstein&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B |title= Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder |journal=Nat Rev Genet |date=2001 |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=943–955 |doi=10.1038/35103559 |pmid=11733747 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASD is associated with several [[genetic disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Zafeiriou&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Brain Dev |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=257–272 |title= Childhood autism and associated comorbidities |author=Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 |pmid=17084999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since heritability is less than 100% and symptoms vary markedly among identical twins with autism, environmental factors are most likely a significant cause as well. If some of the risk is due to gene-environment interaction the 90% heritability estimate may be too high;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt; new twin data and models with structural genetic variation are needed.&lt;ref name=Sykes/&gt;

[[Genetic linkage]] analysis has been inconclusive; many [[Genetic association|association analyses]] have had inadequate power.&lt;ref name=Sykes&gt;{{vcite journal |journal= Expert Rev Mol Med |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=24 |pages=1–15 |title= Autism: the quest for the genes |author=Sykes NH, Lamb JA |pmid=17764594 |doi=10.1017/S1462399407000452 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have examined more than 100 candidate genes; many genes must be examined because more than a third of genes are expressed in the brain and there are few clues on which are relevant to autism.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

==Risk factors==

Autism is associated with several prenatal factors, including advanced age in either parent, diabetes, bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Gardener&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL |title=Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |year=2009 |pmid=19567888 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672 |pmc=3712619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism was found to be indirectly linked to prepregnancy obesity and low weight mothers.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moss |first=B.

A large 2008 population study of Swedish parents of children with autism found that the parents were more likely to have been hospitalized for a mental disorder, that schizophrenia was more common among the mothers and fathers, and that depression and [[personality disorder]]s were more common among the mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2008 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=e1357–1362 |title= Parental psychiatric disorders associated with autism spectrum disorders in the offspring |author=Daniels JL, Forssen U, Hultman CM ''et al.''  |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2296 |pmid=18450879 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/5/e1357 |laysummary=http://uncnews.unc.edu/news/health-and-medicine/mental-disorders-in-parents-linked-to-autism-in-children.html |laydate=2008-05-05 |laysource=UNC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known how many siblings of autistic individuals are themselves autistic. Several studies based on clinical samples have given quite different estimates, and these clinical samples differ in important ways from samples taken from the general community.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Rogers SJ |title=What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy?  |journal=Autism Res |volume= 2|issue= 3|pages=125–137|year=2009 |pmid=19582867 |doi=10.1002/aur.81 |pmc=2791538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism has also been shown to cluster in [[urban area|urban neighborhoods]] of high socioeconomic status. One study from California found a three to fourfold increased risk of autism in a small 30 by 40&amp;nbsp;km region centered on [[West Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite  journal |author=Mazumdar S, King M, Liu K ''et al.''  |title=the spatial structure of autism in California 1992–2001  |journal=Health and Place |volume= 16|pages=539–546|year=2009 |pmid=20097113  |doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2009.12.014|pmc=2835822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender Differences===

Boys have a higher chance for being diagnosed with autism than girls. The ASD sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with [[mental retardation]] and more than 5.5:1 without. Recent studies have found no association with [[socioeconomic status]], and have reported inconsistent results about associations with [[Race (human classification)|race]] or [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

[[RORA]] deficiency may explain some of the difference in frequency between males and females. RORA protein levels are higher in the brains of typically developing females compared to typically developing males, providing females with a buffer against RORA deficiency. This is known as the [[Female protective effect]]. RORA deficiency has previously been proposed as one factor that may make males more vulnerable to autism &lt;ref&gt;Valerie W.

==Comorbid conditions==
{{Further information|Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders}}
Autism is associated with several other conditions:
*'''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref name="Folstein"/&gt; and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.&lt;ref name="Zafeiriou"/&gt;
*'''[[Intellectual disability]]'''. The fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Learning in autism |author=Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title=Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor=Byrne JH (ed.-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol. ed.) |publisher=Academic Press |date=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=0-12-370504-5 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |chapterformat=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303191513/http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anxiety disorders, such as [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], are not commonly diagnosed in people with ASD because such symptoms are better explained by ASD itself, and it is often difficult to tell whether symptoms such as compulsive checking are part of ASD or a co-occurring anxiety problem. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in children with ASD has been reported to be anywhere between 11% and 84%.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{vcite journal |author= White SW, Oswald D, Ollendick T, Scahill L |title= Anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders |journal= Clin Psychol Rev |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=216–229 |year=2009 |pmid=19223098 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003 |pmc=2692135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guidelines International Network''' (G-I-N) is an international scientific association of organisations and individuals interested and involved in development and application of  [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] [[medical guideline|guidelines]]&lt;ref&gt;Burgers JS, Grol R, Klazinga NS, Mäkelä M, Zaat J, for the AGREE Collaboration. Towards evidence-based clinical practice: an international survey of 18 clinical guideline programs. Int J Qual Health Care 2003;15:31-45&lt;/ref&gt; and [[health care]] information. The network supports [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] health care and improved health outcomes by reducing inappropriate variation throughout the world.

== Membership and Organisation ==
The Network's membership consists of approximately 100 organisations working in the field of [[medical guideline]]s and other types of healthcare guidance as well as of around 150 individual experts (February 2017). The members represent about 46 countries from all continents.
The list of members is available on the G-I-N website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-i-n.net/membership/members-around-the-world G-I-N List of members]&lt;/ref&gt;
Being constituted as a Scottish Guarantee Company under Company Number SC243691, the Network is recognised as a [[Scottish Charity]] under Scottish Charity Number SC034047.

== History ==
Based upon the work of the international AGREE Collaboration for the quality of clinical practice guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;The AGREE Collaboration. Development and validation of an international appraisal instrument for assessing the quality of clinical practice guidelines: the AGREE project. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12571340 Qual Saf Health Care 2003;12:18-23.]&lt;/ref&gt; an organised network for organisations and experts working in the field of evidence-based guidelines was proposed in early 2002 at the first international guideline conference in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Miller J, Ollenschläger G. [http://www.aezq.de/aezq/uber/azq_veranstaltungen/cpg/cpg2002-en Globalisation of CPGs: Do we need an international guidelines network? Presentation, International Guideline Symposium CPG2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Guideline experts called for international standardized guideline methods, and information exchange in this field. The proposal was endorsed by health care agencies from all parts of the world such as [[AHRQ]] (USA), CBO (NL) [[German Agency for Quality in Medicine]], [[NICE]] (UK), SIGN (UK), and NZGG (NZ).
Against this background the Guidelines International Network G-I-N was founded in November 2002 in Paris with [[Günter Ollenschläger]] as founding chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ollenschlaeger|G. Ollenschläger]], C. Marshall, S. Qureshi et al.: Improving the quality of health care: using international collaboration to inform guideline programmes by founding the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N). [http://qshc.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/13/6/455   Qual Saf Health Care 2004;13:455-460]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and Aims ==
The goal of the network is to lead, strengthen and support collaboration and work within the guideline development, adaptation and implementation community.
G-I-N's main aims are:
* Promoting best practice&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. [http://www.leitlinien.de/mdb/edocs/pdf/literatur/coe-rec-2001-13.pdf Developing a methodology for drawing up guidelines on best medical practice. Recommendation Rec(2001)13 and explanatory memorandum. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; through the development of learning opportunities and capacity building, as well as the establishment of standards
* Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of evidence-based guideline development, adaptation, dissemination and implementation
* Building a Network and partnerships for guideline developing organisations, end users (such as health care providers, healthcare policy makers and consumers) and stakeholders.

== Activities ==
G-I-N has an International Guideline Library,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-i-n.net/library International Guideline Library]&lt;/ref&gt; the world's largest guideline library,{{citeneeded|date=August 2012}} containing regularly updated guidelines and publications of the G-I-N membership. As of February 2017 more than 6,000 documents were available.

The Network organises the annual G-I-N Conference&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-i-n.net/events G-I-N events]&lt;/ref&gt; around the globe:
2003 Edinburgh (UK), 2004 Wellington (NZ), 2005 Lyon (FR), 2007 Toronto (CA), 2008 Helsinki (FI),  2009 Lisbon (PT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-i-n.net/events/6th-conference 6th G-I-N Conference: Evidence translation in different countries.]&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 Chicago (US),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-i-n.net/events/7th-conference 7th G-I-N Conference: Integrating Knowledge.

Professor Dr. '''Gustavo Zubieta-Castillo''' MD (May 20, 1926 – September 17, 2015) was a [[Bolivia]]n [[physician]], high altitude medicine expert, physiologist, army surgeon, writer, painter, who has been named as the "Mountain Guru" at the St. John's Medical College in [[Bangalore, India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://altitudeclinic.com/blog/2010/01/the-mountain-guru/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Gustavo Zubieta-Castillo’s last breath in his beloved high altitude La Paz, Bolivia|url=http://altitudeclinic.com/blog/2015/09/prof-dr-gustavo-zubieta-castillos-last-breath-in-his-beloved-high-altitude-la-paz-bolivia/|publisher=Altitude Clinic|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked on high altitude [[physiology]]. Being born at 3800m in Oruro, Bolivia, and then studying medicine at the [[Universidad Mayor de San Andres]] in the city of [[La Paz]], at 3513 m above [[sea level]], all his work has focused on initially high altitude physiology and later evolved to high altitude pathology. He proposed new concepts and understanding of what was known as [[Chronic mountain sickness]]. This pathology characterized by an increase of [[red blood cells]], [[cyanosis]], [[ventilatory]] and [[respiratory]] alterations with [[pulmonary hypertension]] and hypertrophy of the right ventricle seen at high altitude, above the normal values for such altitude, was originally affirmed to be due to "loss of adaptation". He changed this interpretation, as he strongly stood for ''“The organic systems of human beings and all other species tend to adapt to any environmental change and circumstance within an optimal period of time, and never tend towards regression which would inevitably lead to death”''.&lt;ref&gt;http://altitudeclinic.com/blog/2010/07/forever-loss-of-adaptation-does-not-exist/&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has indeed changed the way high altitude diseases are interpreted.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

On July 9, 1970, Zubieta-Castillo was the founder of the first high altitude clinic in the world located in [[La Paz, Bolivia]] [http://www.altitudeclinic.com High Altitude Pathology Institute]. One of his theories is the proposal that man has the extraordinary capability to adapt to live in the hypoxic environment of the highest point on the planet Earth: the summit of [[Mt. Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;Zubieta-Castillo, G.; Zubieta-Calleja, GR, Zubieta-Calleja, L. Zubieta-Castillo, Nancy (2008). "Facts that Prove that Adaptation to life at Extreme Altitude (8842m) is possible". In Adaptation Biology and Medicine 5 (Suppl 5): 348–355.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2538">The '''Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland''' ('''HSENI''') is a [[Northern Ireland]] [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for the Economy]]. It is responsible for the encouragement, regulation and enforcement of [[occupational health and safety]] in Northern Ireland. Its functions are similar to those of the [[Health and Safety Executive]] in the rest of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.hseni.gov.uk/about_us.htm | title=About us | publisher=Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland | year=2006 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded as the Health and Safety Agency for Northern Ireland when the provisions of the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] were extended to the province in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work (Northern Ireland) Order 1978, [http://www.hseni.gov.uk/1978_order_original_text.doc SI 1978/1039 (NI 9)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327133536/http://www.hseni.gov.uk/1978_order_original_text.doc |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed '''Executive''' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1998/19982795.htm SI 1998/2795 (NI 18)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland, along with the [[Health and Safety Executive]] have both been involved as partners of the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Consultants Register ([[OSHCR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oshcr.org/ The Occupational Safety &amp; Health Consultants Register].

'''Healthcare in Nicaragua''' involves the collaboration of private and public institutions. Although [[Nicaragua]]'s health outcomes have improved over the past few decades with the efficient utilization of resources relative to other [[Central America]]n nations, it still confronts challenges responding to its population's diverse healthcare needs.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Angel-Urdinola D., Cortez R., Tanabe K. (2008). Equity, Access to Health Care Services and Expenditures on Health in Nicaragua. Health, Nutrition and Population of the World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

J., Domingo G., Quintanilla M., and de los Santos T. (2011). The Nicaraguan Health System. PATH.&lt;/ref&gt; However, limitations of current delivery models and unequal distribution of resources and medical personnel contribute to the persistent lack of quality care in more remote areas of Nicaragua, especially amongst rural communities in the Central and Atlantic region.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; To respond to the dynamic needs of localities, the government has adopted a decentralized model that emphasizes community-based preventative and primary medical care.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birn|first=A.

==== Before the 1979 Sandinista Revolution ====
Before the 1979 [[Sandinista Revolution]], the [[Nicaragua]]n health system consisted of four distinct agencies and independent health ministry offices in each province. There was little coordination amongst these institutions, and this system was fraught with provincial differences in salaries, administrative procedures, and more.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garfield|first=R. M.|last2=Taboada|first2=E.|date=1984-10-01|title=Health services reforms in revolutionary Nicaragua.|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.74.10.1138|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=74|issue=10|pages=1138–1144|doi=10.2105/AJPH.74.10.1138|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1651882}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this 1970s period, Nicaragua had one of the worst [[Life expectancy|life expectancies]] at birth and one of the highest levels of [[infant mortality]] in the regional area. Both of these measures have improved markedly up to 2016, average life expectancy now reaching 74.5 years.&lt;ref&gt;Golladay, F. (1980). Health sector policy paper. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/country/nicaragua&lt;/ref&gt;

There also existed an unequal distribution of health resources. Only 25% of the total health budget was controlled by the Ministry of Health, and 90% of the services went to 10% of the population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Braveman, P. et. al. (1985). Primary health care takes root in Nicaragua. World Health Forum. 6, 369–372.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though only a quarter of the population lived in the capital city of Managua, health professionals were disproportionately concentrated there. In 1972, half of all Nicaraguan doctors and more than two-thirds of nurses worked in Managua.&lt;ref&gt;Holland B., Davis J., Syncrisis, G. (1972). The Dynamics of Health, #9: Nicaragua. U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare. DHEW Pub. No. 74-50007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-revolution ====
After the 1979 Revolution, the new government established a new Unified National Health System that instated the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health (MINSA) at the head of health services throughout the nation. This system also integrated the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS) under MINSA's direction in order to make it financially feasible to provide a single national health service available to all Nicaraguan citizens, regardless of socioeconomic background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donahue|first=John|date=2009-02-02|title=The Politics of Health Care in Nicaragua before and after the Revolution of 1979|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.17730/humo.42.3.x737h47hqw3r2785|journal=Human Organization|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=264–272|doi=10.17730/humo.42.3.x737h47hqw3r2785}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the combination of these institutions, the INSS hospitals and clinics, previously only accessible to insured employees, then opened their doors to the larger population.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1984, in order to improve existing institutional infrastructure, 10% of the national budget was allocated to the health sector. From 1979 to 1984, the government also successfully pushed for the construction of 309 new primary healthcare facilities and the training of over 3,000 health professionals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the wake of the Revolution, MINSA promoted several prevention-based health efforts, one of the earliest being its Brigadista program. This Brigadista program involved the training of community health advocates, the majority of whom were chosen from the Sandinista Youth Organization, who were selected to be trained and transported to serve in underserved rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;Amador, C. (1980). Informe de la Situacion de Salud de Nicaragua. ''MINSA''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s the Nicaraguan government has been changing towards more market-oriented economic policies that have affected the health sector. This healthcare shift has involved increased private sector activity as well as the decentralization of public services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Levels ===
The current Nicaraguan public health system follows a decentralized model. This model consists of three distinct administrative levels, each associated with different health services. Levels include (1) the central level, (2) the SILAIS (Local Systems of Comprehensive Care) level, and (3) the municipal level. The Nicaragua Ministry of Health (MINSA) directs the central level and is committed to ensuring universal access to free health services.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

This decentralized model involves annual contracts between MINSA and local hospitals and health centers that are negotiated to set upcoming specific actions, goals, and funding allocation. The contract system is incentive based, and the amount of federal funding decided upon involves the consideration of institutional performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chalkley|first=Martin|last2=Malcomson|first2=James|date=2002-01-01|title=Cost sharing in health service provision: an empirical assessment of cost savings|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:pubeco:v:84:y:2002:i:2:p:219-249|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=84|issue=2|pages=219–249|issn=0047-2727|doi=10.1016/s0047-2727(01)00126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the public sector, the revenue generated from hospitals, healthcare centers, and SILAIS are consolidated and calculated by the Ministry of Finance before redistribution of certain percentages to the original institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jack | first1 = W. | year = 2003 | title = Contracting for health services: an evaluation of recent reforms in Nicaragua | url = | journal = Health Policy and Planning | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 195–204 | doi=10.1093/heapol/czg024}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The Pacayita Health Post in rural Catarina, Masaya, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|Pacayita health post in Catarina, Masaya, Nicaragua|329x329px]]

==== Model of Family and Community Health (MOSAFC) ====
With the intention of maintaining decentralization while expanding citizens' access to quality healthcare, the Nicaraguan government implemented a structural framework model entitled the Conceptual Model of Family and Community Health (MOSAFC) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muiser | first1 = Jorine | last2 = Sáenz | first2 = María del Rocío | last3 = Bermúdez | first3 = Juan Luis | year = 2011 | title = The health system of Nicaragua | url = | journal = Salud Pública de México | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 233–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As determined by Nicaragua's General Law of Health (No. 423) the overall aim of MOSAFC is to establish integrated networks of public and private service providers that work together to harbor the responsibility of addressing the health needs of specific populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drake | first1 = J. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Stakeholder perceptions of a total market approach to family planning in Nicaragua | url = | journal = Rev Panam Salud Publica | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 329–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching goals of this framework were to offer more efficient delivery of health services, improve patient satisfaction with services, and advance the financial protection of citizen's health.&lt;ref&gt;MINSA. (2007). Marco Conceptual del Modelo de Salud Familiar y Comunitario (MOSAFC). MINSA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare workers ===
There is an unequal distribution of healthcare workers throughout Nicaragua's different provinces. Most healthcare workers are located on the Pacific coast region, while there is a huge need for primary health professionals in the cities of [[Jinotega]] and [[Matagalpa]], as well as along the Caribbean coast.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the year 2000, while Managua contained 20% of the population, the city continued to harbor around half of the country's entire health care professionals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Nigenda, G. and Machado, M. (2000). From State to market: the Nicaraguan labour market for health personnel, ''15''(3): 312–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend can be explained by overall low financial incentives for health care personnel, especially for work in remote areas. The average monthly salary for a [[general practitioner]] in Nicaragua under MINSA is $544 USD while that of [[Honduras]] is $1,332 USD and that of [[Panama]] is $1,025 USD.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Roque. (2006). "Los salarios en Nicaragua". ''El Observador económico''.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, although 52% of Nicaraguan doctors are specialized in training, this specialization level fails to meet widespread community needs for primary care.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In order to improve the healthcare access of those living in more isolated areas, the public medical schools in Nicaragua require their graduates to perform two years of social service in high-need settings, after which they can opt to work in private institutions. This requirement aligns with MINSA's objective to encourage these graduates to work for the public health sector.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Amongst Nicaraguan doctors, there persists a lack of gender diversity. Nicaraguan women are underrepresented in the field of medicine, and within the healthcare field have an unemployment rate that is 3.5 times higher than that of men.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Women and children's health==

[[File:Women waiting outside a gynecological exam room in Masaya, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|Women waiting outside a gynecological exam room in Masaya, Nicaragua|424x424px]]

===Reproductive health===
Nicaragua's adolescent [[fertility rate]] is one of the highest in [[Latin America]]. Around half of women in Nicaragua give birth before the age of 20. Approximately one quarter of all the births in the country involve [[Teenage pregnancy|adolescent mothers]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Blandon L., et. al. Early childbearing in Nicaragua a continuing challenge, In Brief, New York: Guttmacher Institute, 2006, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of use of contraceptives contributes to this high pregnancy rate. Out of all sexually active female adolescents, only 7% utilize condoms and only 47% use any modern method of [[contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelaya|first=E.|last2=Peña|first2=R.|last3=García|first3=J.|last4=Berglund|first4=S.|last5=Persson|first5=L.

Effective family planning programs. Washington D.C.: World Bank, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Educational promotion of contraception is generally only conducted by nongovernmental agencies or women's groups, and it is popular belief among many that various forms of contraceptive methods are detrimental to one's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=S.|last1=Berglund|first2=J.|last2=Liljestrand|first3=F.

===Cervical cancer===
Nicaragua has one of the highest [[cervical cancer]] incidence rates in the world and the second highest morbidity rate in Latin America, second only to Haiti.&lt;ref name="Drain 199–205"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drain|first=Paul K.|last2=Holmes|first2=King K.|last3=Hughes|first3=James P.|last4=Koutsky|first4=Laura A.|date=2002-07-10|title=Determinants of cervical cancer rates in developing countries|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.10453/abstract|journal=International Journal of Cancer|language=en|volume=100|issue=2|pages=199–205|doi=10.1002/ijc.10453|issn=1097-0215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although screenings are provided through their national public health system, only 35% of women have had a [[Pap test|Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test]] by the age of 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claeys|first=P.|last2=Gonzalez|first2=C.|last3=Gonzalez|first3=M.|last4=Page|first4=H.|last5=Bello|first5=R.

The '''Illini 4000''' is a non-profit organization raising funds for cancer research and patient support services, as well as spreading awareness through annual cross-country bike rides.

== History ==
The Illini 4000 began as an idea between two [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] students, Jonathan Schlesinger and Anish Thakkar.  While both studying abroad in Spring 2006, Anish, who had been involved with early cancer detection research, thought that there was not enough available funding for cancer research.  Schlesinger, who had been affected by cancer by a family member, also wanted to contribute to research funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smilepolitely.com/sports/illini_4000_trek_across_america/ Smiley Politely: Illini 4000 Trek  Across America]&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon returning to campus in Fall 2006, the students combined their love for cycling with their determination in the fight against cancer and the Illini 4000 was born.  The organization began as a registered student organization at the university but soon became a 501(c)(3) Non-profit organization.&lt;ref name="conor"&gt;Personal Consultation with I4k president, Conor Canaday, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bicycle trips ==
Every summer since the Illini 4000 was born, the team sends 20-25 students on a cross country bicycle trip.  Each group of riders is named the Bike America Team and completes the journey beginning in late May and finishing in early August. Each day, the team rides between 40–110 miles with a support vehicle carrying their supplies. In the past, the Bike America teams have been able to visit the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington D.C.]], the [[UIC Medical Center]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="conor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://illini4000.org Illini 4000 Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2007, the first Bike America Team was on the organizations's first cross-country trip.  The trip started in New York City and ended in San Diego, California with 18 people riding.  In 2008, the 20 rider bike team rode from New York City to Seattle, Washington.  In 2009, the 23 riders rode from New York City to Portland, Oregon.  For the 2010 ride, 28 riders biked from New York City and finished in San Francisco, California. From 2011 through 2014, the Bike America Team rode from New York City to San Francisco, with the 2012 Team riding through Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="conor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

== Fundraising ==
To date, the Illini 4000 has looked primarily to their riders in regards to securing funds with which to both function as an organization and donate to various beneficiaries. 
Each rider of the Illini 4000 Bike America Team is required to fundraise $4,000. 

Corporate sponsors include [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]], Champaign Cycle, That’s Rentertainment, Isostatic, OILUBE, [[Netrust|NetTrust]], AMS Mechanical Systems, Rushville State Bank, Grove Dental Associates, St. Martin Bank &amp; Trust Co., and others.

== Beneficiaries ==
The Illini 4000 have chosen a variety of organizations including the [[American Cancer Society]], [[Camp Kesem]], the [[Livestrong Foundation|Lance Armstrong Foundation]], the [[Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation]], the Ishan Gala Foundation, [https://bepositive.org/ The Andrew McDonough B+ Foundation], [[TLC Camp]], Prairie Dragon Paddlers, and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign researcher Dr. Brendan Harley, to help us achieve our mission.

In 2015, Illini 4000 was able to donate $100,000 thanks to the fundraising efforts of the 2015 Trek Bike America Team. Of the $100,000, $46,000 went towards funding patient support services and the remaining $54,000 went to funding cancer research. The Beneficiaries donated to in 2015 include American Cancer Society, Camp Kesem, B+ Foundation, and Prairie Dragon Paddlers for patient support services; and Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, and University of Illinois for cancer research.

In 2018, Illini 4000 surpassed $1,000,000 in fundraising efforts since its beginnings. The 2018 Bike America team consists of 23 riders who will bike from New York City, New York to San Francisco, California from May 18 to August 3, 2018.

=== Illini 4000 Fellowship ===
In recognition of the funding from Illini 4000 in 2015 and the funding over the past several years totaling $214,000, Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation has named one of their Fellowship awards after Illini 4000. The first Illini 4000 Fellow was Rand Miller, who was studying how cancer evades current therapies.

== ''What People Do'' (film) ==
During the summer 2007 ride, documentary filmmaker Zachary Herrmann followed the Bike America team across the United States as he created the documentary ''What People Do''.  The film, which is now freely available for viewing online, was made for the production company ''Films That Move'' which is entirely made of volunteer filmmakers from across the country.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;[http://www.filmsthatmove.com/index.html Films That Move]&lt;/ref&gt;  The filming took place over the course of 4 months, in 7 states and gathered 35 hours of footage.

''What People Do'' was the first film created by the production company.  The goal of ''Films That Move'' is to make films that generate emotion while inspiring the audience to take action for a social cause.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;  They chose to follow the Illini 4000 based upon the politically divided state that the country was in at the time.  While on the journey, the filmmakers documented the generosity the team found during their nightly stay-overs as well as stories from the riders and their hosts.  The goal of these stories is to show that regardless of the condition of the country, there are still issues that can unite the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsthatmove.com/about.html Films That Move: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Kremasta''' ({{lang-el|Λίμνη Κρεμαστών}}) is the largest [[artificial lake]] in [[Greece]].  The construction of [[Kremasta Dam]] was completed in 1965 concentrating waters from four rivers: [[Achelous River|Acheloos]], [[Agrafiotis]], [[Tavropos]] and [[Trikeriotis]].  The water that is accumulated in the artificial lake is about {{convert|3.8|km3|acre.ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itia.ntua.gr/~nikos/dams/list%20of%20dams/r_Acheloos/acheloos%20dams.htm Acheloos dams]&lt;/ref&gt; It prevents flooding of the Acheloos, and supplies electricity to the national grid during peaks of demand. The power station at the dam is the biggest hydroelectric plant in Greece (rated power: 437.2 MW). It was constructed in 1966 and is owned by the [[Public Power Corporation of Greece]] (DEH A.E.). At the time of its construction, it was the largest earth-filled hydroelectric project in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;

The lake is located on the borders of [[Aetolia-Acarnania]] and [[Evrytania]]. There are two bridges over the lake (at [[Tatarna Bridge|Tatarna]] and Episkopi). The water of the lake penetrates along the beds of the rivers mentioned above, and forms a lot of fiords and small islands. The [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]] with shores on the lake are [[Agrinio]] and [[Amfilochia]] in Aetolia-Acarnania, and [[Agrafa (municipality)|Agrafa]] and [[Karpenisi]] in Evrytania.

'''Krisana Kraisintu''' ({{lang-th|กฤษณา ไกรสินธุ์}}, {{RTGS|Kritsana Kraisin}}, {{IPA-th|krìt.sā.nǎː krāj.sǐn|pron}}; born February 21, 1952) is a [[Thai people|Thai]] [[professor]], [[Thai people|Thai]] [[pharmacist]], pharmaceutical consultant in the local production and increased access to life-saving medicines in Africa, in particular, in the domains of malaria and HIV/AIDS-related drug production.

She was formerly Director of Research and Development Institute, Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. Between 2002–2007 Kraisintu worked as a Pharmaceutical Consultant for Action Medeor, a German aid organization which is a non-profit organization dealing with local production and distribution of medicines in Africa.

Currently, Kraisintu is the Honorary Dean of Faculty of Oriental Medicines, [[Rangsit University]] and a visiting Professor at the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, [[Ubon Ratchathani University]], Thailand. She is also a [[visiting Professor]] of Oriental Medicines at [[Harbin Institute of Technology]], China.

In 2009, she was given the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/20082/thai-aidsdrug-pioneer-wins-award Thai AIDS Drug pioneer wins award]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Krisana conducted research on anti-retroviral drugs without much support and successfully formulated a generic version of AZT (zidovudine), which treats HIV and reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission, in 1995. The product was introduced to the market at a fraction of the cost of the branded product. Her achievement raised the pharmaceutical and health profile of Thailand as the first developing country to manufacture generic HIV/AIDS drugs.[http://www.krisana.org/index.php/Bibliography-in-English/biography-krisana-kraisintu-ph-d.html]''

==Educational Background==
Kraisintu received her bachelor's degree in Pharmacy from [[Chiangmai University]], Thailand in 1975; M.Sc. in Pharmaceutical Analysis from [[Strathclyde University]], U.K. in 1978; and [[Ph.D.]] in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from [[University of Bath]], U.K. in 1981. She was also awarded an Honorary D.Sc. ([[Doctor of Science]]) from the University of Bath in 2009.

For the past 28 years, she has worked in the pharmaceutical industry in various roles of quality assurance, manufacturing, research and development and business development for the discovery, development and commercialization of chemical and natural pharmaceutical products.

The '''Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA)''' is legislation signed into [[United States]] law on September 26, 1996 that requires annual or lifetime dollar limits on [[mental health]] benefits to be no lower than any such dollar limits for medical and surgical benefits offered by a [[group Insurance|group health plan]] or [[health insurance]] issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan.&lt;ref name=DOLfactsMHPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: The Mental Health Parity Act |date=October 2008 |website=Employee Benefits Security Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fsmhparity.html |archive-date=16 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416004526/http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fsmhparity.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to MHPA and similar legislation, insurers were not required to cover mental health care and so access to treatment was limited, underscoring the importance of the act.

The MHPA was largely superseded by the [[Paul Wellstone]] and [[Pete Domenici]] '''Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA)''', which the [[110th United States Congress]] passed as [[rider (legislation)|rider]] legislation on the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP), signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] in October 2008.&lt;ref name=thomasMHPAEA/&gt; Notably, the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] extended the reach of MHPAEA provisions to many health insurance plans outside its previous scope.&lt;ref name=parityACA2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=Richard G. |last2=Beronio |first2=Kirsten |last3=Glied |first3=Sherry A. |authorlink3=Sherry Glied |date=2014  |title=Behavioral health parity and the Affordable Care Act |journal=Journal of Social Work in Disability &amp; Rehabilitation |volume=13|issue=1-2 |pages=31–43 |pmid=24483783 |pmc=4334111 |doi=10.1080/1536710X.2013.870512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The MHPA applies to group health plans for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1998.&lt;ref name=DOLfactsMHPA/&gt;  The original [[sunset provision]] provided that the parity requirements would not apply to benefits for services furnished on or after September 30, 2001.&lt;ref name=DOLfactsMHPA/&gt; It was extended six times, with the final extension running through December 31, 2007.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}}  Insurers promptly were able to "circumvent" the consumer protections arguably intended in the legislation by imposing maximum numbers of provider visits and/or caps on the number of days an insurer would cover for inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.  In essence, the law had little or no effect on mental health coverage by group insurance plans.  The rider on TARP prohibits all group health plans that offer mental health coverage from imposing any greater limit on co-pays, co-insurance, numbers of visits, and/or number of days covered for hospital stays due to mental health conditions.  The rider legislation was the culmination of a long campaign fought by Sen. [[Paul Wellstone]] (D-MN) and his successors to enact mental health parity at the federal level.  The new law's requirements will be phased in over several years.  Still unsure is whether non-"biologically-based" mental illnesses such as [[PTSD]] and [[eating disorders]] are mandated to be covered by the new law.

==Requirements==
Generally the act required parity of mental health benefits with medical and surgical benefits with respect to the application of aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits under a group health plan. It provided that [[employer]]s retain discretion regarding the extent and scope of mental health benefits offered to workers and their families, including cost sharing, limits on numbers of visits or days of coverage, and requirements relating to [[medical necessity]].

The law also contained three exemptions:
; No mental health coverage
: Business that chose not to provide mental health coverage.
; Small employers
: Businesses with less than 50 employees.
; Increased cost
: Businesses that documented at least one percent increase in premiums due to implementation of parity requirements.&lt;ref name=lessToMore1998/&gt;

==Issues with the MHPA==
Immediately after MHPA was enacted, insurers and employers began finding ways to circumvent the legislation. Larger emphasis on cost sharing, primarily implemented through higher [[copayment]]s, [[deductible]]s, and out-of-pocket maximums, was one strategy used by insurers. In addition, limits and caps on the number of visits with a care provider or number of days in a hospital visit were imposed.&lt;ref name=lessToMore1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=Gail  A. |last2=Rost |first2=Kathryn |last3=Burton |first3=Russell P.D. |last4=Bulycheva |first4=Maria |date=May 1998 |title=Mental health insurance in the 1990s: are employers offering less to more? |journal=Health Affairs |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=201–208 |pmid=9637976 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.17.3.201 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/17/3/201.full.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|201}} MHPA also did not provide benefits for substance abuse and dependency issues.&lt;ref name=DOLfactMHPAEA/&gt;{{rp|2}} Lastly, MHPA contained a [[sunset provision]] that meant that the law would go out of effect after a certain date. The original sunset date was extended six times, through 2007.

Similar to MHPA, MHPAEA requires parity in terms of total annual dollar limits, as well as aggregate lifetime benefits. It is important to note however, that MHPAEA does not explicitly require that any insurance plan offer benefits for mental health and substance abuse disorders.&lt;ref name=DOLfactMHPAEA/&gt;{{rp|1}} Instead, it enacts parity rules for plans that choose to offer both medical and surgical benefits as well as mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits.&lt;ref name=DOLfactMHPAEA/&gt;{{rp|1–2}} This includes out-of-network benefits.&lt;ref name=DOLfactMHPAEA/&gt;{{rp|3}} If plans choose to offer both types of benefits, MHPAEA mandates that insurers define and make available specific criteria for medical necessity when it comes to mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits. In addition, MHPAEA also requires that insurers provide specific information and reasons in the event that reimbursement or payment for treatment is denied.&lt;ref name=DOLfactMHPAEA/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Implementation challenges===
One main challenge to the implementation of MHPAEA is what is known as "carve-out" health benefits. This refers to mental health benefits that are purchased by employers separately from medical benefits.&lt;ref name=HealthPolicyMonitor&gt;{{cite web |first1=Emily |last1=Adrion |first2=Gerard |last2=Anderson |date=October 2009 |title=Mental Health Parity |url=http://www.hpm.org/en/Surveys/Johns_Hopkins_Bloomberg_School_of__Publ._H_-_USA/14/Mental_Health_Parity.html |website=Health Policy Monitor |publisher=Bertelsmann Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "carve-out" vendor may be separate from any number of other vendors providing medical benefits. The law would require the "carve-out" vendor to ensure parity with medical benefits provided by a separate vendor or vendors. In addition, the legislation itself did not create a mechanism to regularly monitor or evaluate the enforcement or implementation of the act.&lt;ref name=HealthPolicyMonitor/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1690">'''Microsurgical endodontics''' is that aspect of [[endodontics]] which evolved after the introduction of the [[Surgical Operating Microscope]] (SOM) to endodontics in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Selbst AG, Curd CM. The surgical operating microscope in endodontics. J Gt Houst Dent Soc 1994;66:10-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The recent addition of SOM's to endodontic therapy can allow better visualization and management of the surgical field by [[endodontists]] during endodontic procedures through magnification and greatly improved high intensity lighting. SOM's typically magnify in the 4X to 25X range. The other commonly used magnification aide, through lens eyeglass mounted surgical telescopes, provide 2.5X to 4.5X magnification. Surgical operating microscopes have a steep learning curve and require training, as well as patience and practice to master.

Some studies &lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein RA, Kim S. Long-Term Follow-Up of Cases Considered Healed One Year After Apical Microsurgery. J Endod 2002;28:378-383.&lt;/ref&gt; have demonstrated higher success rates in surgical procedures using SOM's when compared to direct vision. However, use of the surgical operating microscope routinely for endodontic procedures is not considered the standard of care in endodontics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guttman |first=JL |url=http://medind.nic.in/eaa/t05/i2/eaat05i2p5.pdf | title=Is Endodontics Becoming So Magnified That It Is Too Narrowly Focused? |publisher=Endodontology 2005;17:5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association for Children of Addiction''' (NACoA) was formed in February 1983 in [[California]], [[United States]] by 20 professionals concerned about the needs of family members of [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]]. NACoA is a membership and affiliate organization, and is incorporated as a not-for-profit [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) organization]].

NACoA's mission is "to eliminate the adverse impact of alcohol and drug use on children and families".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nacoa.org/ NACoA mission] Retrieved 2012-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The founders believed that by coming together and building consensus, core issues could be identified and services needed by [[Alcoholism in family systems|children of addiction]] (COAs) could be delivered and disseminated.  In 1992, NACoA relocated its national office to the suburbs of [[Washington, D.C.]] to develop a stronger presence in the national policy and program arenas. NACoA partners with other national non-profit organizations, private-sector groups and federal agencies for policy and program development in [[substance abuse]] research, prevention and treatment to expand and enhance delivery of information for and about COAs.

NACoA programs are designed to educate professionals in primary health care, the faith communities, [[social work]], education and the judicial communities, providing them with tools which will facilitate their ability to intervene and support children of alcoholic or drug-addicted parents. A [[toll-free telephone number]] provides information about the problem and what can be done to help. Nearly 50 affiliate members strengthen national outreach efforts. NACoA is the only organization working for children who have alcohol or other drug dependent parents on a national level.

The '''Norwegian Public Safety Network''' ({{lang-no|Nødnett}} literally ''Emergency Network'') is a [[public safety network]] system based on [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio]] (TETRA). Nødnett is implemented by the '''Directorate for Emergency Communication''' ({{lang-no|Direktoratet for nødkommunikasjon}}). The network is primarily used for internal and interdisiplinary communication by the [[police]], [[fire department]]s and [[health service]]s. Nødnett is also  used by several organisations participating in rescue and emergency work.  Planning of the network started in 1995 and in 2006 the contract to build it was awarded to [[Nokia Siemens Networks]]. As Nokia Siemens Networks was unable to complete the contract, it was passed on to [[Motorola Solutions]] in 2012. The critical infrastructure of Nødnett was finished and was operational in all districts of mainland Norway by December 1, 2015.

The network replaced nearly 300 local and regional networks which operataed independently for the fire, police and healthcare agencies. Nødnett allows functionality such as [[authentication]], [[encryption]] and higher reliability.

==Background and choice of technology==
[[File:Oslo Akershus VW Ambulanse in new colors - 2007.04.03.jpg|thumb|[[Ambulance]] operating in [[Oslo]]]]
Prior to the introduction of ''Nødnett'', Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The [[Norwegian Data Inspectorate]] had also instructed the agencies to [[encrypt]] their communications for reasons of [[privacy]]. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.&lt;ref name=stp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/Rpub/STP/20042005/001T03/PDFS/STP200420050001T03DDDPDFS.pdf |title=Framtidig radiosamband for nød- og beredskapsetatene |publisher=[[Government.no]] |author=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)]] |language=Norwegian |date=4 November 2004 |format=PDF |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFDS65yy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is using standardized technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway is a member of the [[Schengen Agreement]], which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt; In [[Oslo]], [[Akershus]] and [[Østfold]], the police had also been using [[Enhanced Digital Access Communication System]] since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politi.no/pdmt/Nyhet_9132.xhtml |title=Fra EDACS til Nødnett |author=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)]] |language=Norwegian |date=August 2001 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGNcxPVS}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the [[county municipality (Norway)|county municipalities]] between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, [[midwive]]s and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, [[Global System for Mobile Communication]] (GSM) and [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt;

Keeping the old systems and converting them to encrypted systems was also considered. This was estimated to cost NOK&amp;nbsp;500 million to install, but could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily. In particular, encryption would delay communications, which would be a problem for urgent communications. It was also uncertain whether the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt;

The government considered using a similar procurement solution to that in Denmark, where the spectrum was licensed to private enterprise, and the agencies purchase services from private telecommunications companies, based on conventional GSM technology. However, in Denmark this had not led to the desired results, with only [[Metropolitan Copenhagen]] being covered. Instead, the Norwegian Government chose to establish a government agency to build and operate the network. Use of the GSM and NMT450 network was insufficient because of lack of capacity in the conventional network in case of larger amounts of communication, lack of ability of group conversations, lack of priority systems and long dial-up times.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt;

Using conventional GSM systems was rejected also because GSM lacks many of the functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, [[dispatcher]] centers, and direct communication. In addition, [[Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway]] (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected because of the lack of trans-border functionality and the need for more [[base station]]s, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire [[rail transport in Norway|Norwegian railway network]]. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinkom.no/FILES/Hvorfor_ikke_GSM-R.doc |title=Hvorfor ikke GSM-R? |format=DOC |author=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)]] |language=Norwegian |date=August 2001 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFF0Xd8d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parliamentary hearing in 2002 both DNK director [[Tor Helge Lyngstøl]] and [[Minister of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Minister of Justice]], [[Odd Einar Dørum]], stated that the choice of TETRA would provide sufficient data capacity. In a parliamentary decision in 2004 it was decided to opt for the open [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) as a data transmission standard, which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by [[Motorola]]. The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.&lt;ref name=ipad&gt;{{cite news |title=Velger iPad framfor ny nødnett |last=Gjerde |first=Robert |last2=Foss |first2=Andreas Bakke |last3=Hagesæter |first3=Pål Vegard |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 August 2012 |language=Norwegian |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the annual cost of agency communication was NOK&amp;nbsp;175 million, while this had increased to NOK&amp;nbsp;260 million in 2004. The increase was largely caused by the increase in use of mobile telephones. The costs of the fire department networks was paid for by the [[municipalities of Norway|municipalities]], the health network paid for by the municipalities and the [[regional health authority (Norway)|regional health authorities]], and the police networks by the respective police districts.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt;

==Implementation==
Work with the system started in 1995, when the [[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision]] took initiative for a new mobile telecommunications platform. The issue was coordinated by the [[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice]], and the issue was first discussed politically in 1997, and in 1998 a project group was created. In 2001, a [[pilot project]] was established in [[Trondheim]], which included all three agencies. The trial was successful and terminated in June 2003. Later that year, the [[Parliament of Norway]] made the principal decision to establish the network. Quality control of the project was concluded in June 2004, and construction was estimated at NOK&amp;nbsp;3.6 billion.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt;

The procurement process was initially led by the Ministry of Justice and the Police, in cooperation with the [[Ministry of Health and Care Services (Norway)|Ministry of Health and Care Services]], the [[National Police Directorate (Norway)|National Police Directorate]], the [[Directorate for Health and Social Affairs (Norway)|Directorate for Health and Social Affairs]] and the [[Directorate for Civil Defence and Emergency Planning (Norway)|Directorate for Civil Defence and Emergency Planning]].&lt;ref name=enginfo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinkom.no/FILES/dnk_brochure_english_180x285_trykt_120907.pdf |title=Nødnett – New Public Safety Radio Network in Norway |author=Directorate for Emergency Communication |format=PDF |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFHaUvoU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public tender was launched in May 2005, and on 22 December 2006 the contract was signed with [[Nokia Siemens Networks]]. The project is the largest single [[information technology]] contract ever awarded in Norway.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt; The Directorate for Emergency Communication was established on 1 April 2007.&lt;ref name=enginfo /&gt;

Original plans called for the system to be built between 2007 and 2011. Implementation was planned in six phases, numbered zero through five. Between phases zero and one, an evaluation of the process was planned.&lt;ref name=enginfo /&gt;

By June 2007, the project was delayed by half a year. One of the major delays in the project has been the development of the software for the health sector's communication centers—which consist of emergency wards, casualty wards, emergency dispatch centers and aircraft coordination centers. The system is being developed by [[Frequentis]] in Austria, who have stated that they did not receive sufficient specifications. In December 2009, the state granted NOK&amp;nbsp;110 million extra for development of the system. Health workers will therefore be taking the network into use in May 2010, after the police and fire departments in [[Follo]] and [[Østfold]]. Representatives for the Police Directorate have criticized the implementation model and stated that in most other countries, the system was implemented first just for the police and afterwards taken into use by the fire and paramedic agencies. For instance, Østfold Police District had installed a new center in February 2008, but had to wait 21 months to take it into use while waiting for Public Safety Radio.&lt;ref name=tidsnod&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tu.no/it/article239796.ece |title=Tidsnød-nettet |last=Hamnes |first=Leif |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=11 March 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFHaUvoU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Police Directorate sees the use of the encrypted communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010.&lt;ref name=tidsnod /&gt; In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tu.no/it/article239834.ece |title=Oslo-politiet lukker sambandet |last=Hamnes |first=Leif |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=11 March 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFyDiFEd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsb.no/no/Ansvarsomrader/Nasjonal-beredskap/Nodnett/Aktuelt-nodnett/Brannvesenene-i-Ostfold-og-Follo-tar-i-bruk-Nodnett/ |title=Brannvesenene i Østfold og Follo tar i bruk Nødnett |publisher=[[Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning (Norway)|Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning]] |date=10 June 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uG1kOclb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the emergency health communication centers in Østfold and the casualty ward at [[Fredrikstad Hospital]] started using the system. This was followed by the emergency rooms in [[Halden]] and [[Aremark]], in [[Rakkestad]] and [[Sarpsborg]], and in [[Oslo]]. For the health sector, phase zero involved 40 communication centers, of which 20 were emergency rooms, 16 casualty wards at hospitals, one air ambulance coordination center and three emergency health communication centers, in addition to radios in the 150 ambulances that serves the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helsedirektoratet.no/nodnett/god_fremdrift__770304 |title=God fremdrift |publisher=[[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision]] |date=28 August 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFyzxvbS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official opening of the network took place on 17 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsb.no/no/Ansvarsomrader/Nasjonal-beredskap/Nodnett/Aktuelt-nodnett/Nodnett-apnes-offisielt/ |title=Nødnett åpnes offisielt |publisher=[[Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning (Norway)|Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning]] |date=16 August 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uG0hYkQ8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, [[Arne Johannesen]], the leader of the [[Norwegian Police Federation]], stated that he wanted to place the building of the radio network on hold and instead use the funding for a new information technology system for the police force, named D#2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tu.no/it/article264199.ece |title=– Frys nødnettet |last=Zachariassen |first=Espen |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=22 October 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uG4EQ3l3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNK carried out tests with the system in 2010 for [[firefighters]] using [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] in [[structure fire]]s, and found the system to be sufficient. Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year, and they found that the radio system was insufficient for their needs. Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only successful because of the use of additional directional gateway/repeater-radio equipment. Because of this firefighters in Oslo continued to use the old [[ultra-high frequency]] radios during indoor fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8297191 |title=Oslo brann - og redningsetat vraket nødnett-test |last=Zondag |first=Martin Herman Wiedswang |last2=Lydersen |first2=Trond |last3=Fjelldalen |first3=Helle |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=27 August 2012 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=28 August 2012 |archivedate=28 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AG3WXhEd |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Norwegian Police Security Service]]'s bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal family have opted to not use the new radio system, citing poor coverage indoors and while lying on the ground, even in downtown Oslo. The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies, which is a drawback in case of major incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8291617 |title=PST varsler om store problemer med nytt nødnett |last=Fjørtoft |first=Martin |last2=Zondag |first2=Martin Herman Wiedswang |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=23 August 2012 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=28 August 2012 |archivedate=28 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AG3WXhEd |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the [[joint rescue coordination center]]s, the [[Norwegian Air Ambulance]] and the [[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330 Squadron]] which operates [[Westland Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage. During the [[2011 Norway attacks]] at [[Utøya]], located in northern Buskerud, police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system.&lt;ref name=ipad /&gt;

==Organization==
Nødnett is owned by the Directorate for Emergency Communication, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. The ministry signed an agreement with Nokia Siemens Networks to install the system. In 2012, Motorola Solutions signed an agreement to take over the project.

The directorate is led by Tor Helge Lyngstøl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinkom.no/default.asp?pub=0&amp;sub=33&amp;labb=uk |title=Management |publisher=Directorate for Emergency Communication |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=14 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has its offices in [[Nydalen]] in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinkom.no/default.asp?pub=0&amp;sub=77&amp;labb=uk |title=Contact us |publisher=Directorate for Emergency Communication |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=14 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of constructing the network has been covered by the ministry.&lt;ref name=stp /&gt; The costs of operating and maintaining the network are covered by the users, who also purchase their own terminals. Payment to the directorate is by an annual subscription fee per terminal, based on the terminal's use. For a terminal only used for stand-by, the annual subscription cost is NOK&amp;nbsp;1,700 per year (2016), while that for a terminal in a control room is NOK&amp;nbsp;45,000 (2016). As the cost of running the network is fixed independently of the amount of traffic, there is no cost for using the network. As additional users start implementing the system, the costs per subscriber will be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinkom.no/FILES/20080813_-_nodnett_prisliste_for_nodetatene_versjon_2.pdf |title=Nødnett – prisliste for nødetatene |publisher=[[Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning (Norway)|Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning]] |date=13 August 2008 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGN7uPEf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network==
The Terrestrial Trunked Radio network has three components: the core net, which is a centralized computer center based on an [[Internet Protocol]] structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of about 2100 [[base station]]s with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.&lt;ref name=tidsnod /&gt;

All communication from mobile terminals to the base stations is encrypted with a [[key (cryptography)|key]] known only to the base station and the terminal. For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted all the way through the network from the one user to the other.

Nødnett ensures 100% population coverage and 86% area coverage, which exceeds any of the existing GSM networks. This includes good coverage indoors, to aid fire fighters, as well as full coverage of the coastline and coverage up to 2,500&amp;nbsp;meters (8,000&amp;nbsp;ft) height for aircraft. Nødnett gives full coverage along all [[Norwegian national road|national]] and county roads. The system also allows interoperability towards the [[maritime radio]]. The network also allows for transmission of data at a speed of 12-13 kbit/s.

There has been raised criticism against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental is the lack of indoor coverage.&lt;ref name=ipad /&gt; This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, [[Oslo Courthouse]] and [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.8300422 |title=Nødnettet: – Får ikke kontakt med legene på legevakta |last=Zondag |first=Martin Herman Wiedswang |last2=Lydersen |first2=Trond |last3=Fjelldalen |first3=Helle |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=29 August 2012 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 August 2012 |archivedate=30 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AIk9eRgJ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy [[sabotage]] and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.&lt;ref name=ipad /&gt;

==Terminals==
The system has two types of receivers: radio terminals, which can either be hand-held or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as [[hands free]], and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and [[smoke diving]]. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able to be part of several groups, or as [[walkie talkie]]s in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network.&lt;ref name=enginfo /&gt;

Control room terminals will have new functionality including identification of all users and radio terminal positioning, radio and telephone inquiries made on the same equipment, use of either loudspeakers or head sets, and allowing operators to listen to each other's conversations. Operators have access to telephone books and speed dials, touch screen operations of voice and data traffic, monitoring of other talk groups, simultaneous calls to several talk groups and access to voice logs.&lt;ref name=enginfo /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14856">A '''nursing diagnosis''' may be part of the [[nursing process]] and is a clinical judgment about individual, family, or community experiences/responses to actual or potential health problems/life processes. Nursing diagnoses foster the nurse's independent practice (e.g., patient comfort or relief) compared to dependent interventions driven by physician's orders (e.g., medication administration). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Perry|first2=Anne Griffin|last3=Stockert|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Hall|first4=Amy M.|title=Fundamentals of Nursing|date=2013|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-07933-4|page=223|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing diagnoses are developed based on data obtained during the [[nursing assessment]]. An actual nursing diagnosis presents a problem response present at time of assessment. Whereas a [[medical diagnosis]] identifies a disorder, a nursing diagnosis identifies problems that result from that disorder.&lt;ref name="NANDA_glossary"&gt;{{Citation |author=NANDA International (professional association of nurses) |title=Glossary of Terms |url=http://www.nanda.org/nanda-international-glossary-of-terms.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nursing diagnostic process is unique among others.

All nurses must be familiar with the steps of the nursing process in order to gain the most efficiency from their positions. In order to select the correct nursing diagnosis, the nurse must make quick and accurate conclusions from patient data during assessment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Perry|first2=Anne Griffin|last3=Stockert|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Hall|first4=Amy M.|title=Fundamentals of Nursing|date=2013|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-07933-4|page=222|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NANDA International==
''NANDA-International'' [[NANDA|formerly known as the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; is the primary organization for defining, distribution and integration of standardized nursing diagnoses worldwide. NANDA-I has worked in this area for nearly 40 years to ensure that diagnoses are developed through a [[peer-review]]ed process requiring standardised levels of evidence, definitions, defining characteristics, related factors and/or risk factors that enable [[nurses]] to identify potential diagnoses in the course of a nursing assessment. NANDA-I believes that it is critical that nurses are required to utilise standardised languages that provide not just terms (diagnoses) but the embedded knowledge from clinical practice and research that provides diagnostic criteria (definitions, defining characteristics) and the related or etiologic factors upon which nurses intervene. NANDA-I terms are developed and refined for actual (current) health responses and for risk situations, as well as providing diagnoses to support health promotion. Diagnoses are applicable to individuals, families, groups and communities.  The taxonomy is published in multiple countries and has been translated into 18 languages; it is in use worldwide. As research in the field of nursing continues to grow, NANDA-I continually develops and adds new diagnostic labels. 

Nursing diagnoses are a critical part of ensuring that the knowledge and contribution of nursing practice to patient outcomes are found within the [[electronic health record]] and can be linked to nurse-sensitive patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Brokel, J &amp; C Heath (2009).

==Structure==
The NANDA-I system of nursing diagnosis provides for four categories.
#Actual diagnosis
#:A clinical judgment about human experience/responses to health conditions/life processes that exist in an individual, family, or community. An example of an actual nursing diagnosis is: ''Sleep deprivation.''
#Risk diagnosis
#:Describes human responses to health conditions/life processes that may develop in a vulnerable individual/family/community. It is supported by risk factors that contribute to increased vulnerability. An example of a risk diagnosis is: ''Risk for shock.''
#Health promotion diagnosis
#:A clinical judgment about a person’s, family’s or community’s motivation and desire to increase wellbeing and actualise human health potential as expressed in the readiness to enhance specific health behaviours, and can be used in any health state. An example of a health promotion diagnosis is: ''Readiness for enhanced nutrition.''
#Syndrome diagnosis
#:A clinical judgment describing a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses that occur together, and are best addressed together and through similar interventions. An example of a syndrome diagnosis is: ''Relocation stress syndrome.''&lt;ref&gt;Herdman, TH (Ed.) (2009). Nursing diagnoses: definitions and classification 2009–2011. Wiley-Blackwell: Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

The diagnositic process requires a nurse to use critical thinking. In addition to knowing the nursing diagnoses and their definitions, the nurse becomes aware of defining characteristics and behaviors of the diagnoses, related factors to the diagnoses, and the interventions suited for treating the diagnoses. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Perry|first2=Anne Griffin|last3=Stockert|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Hall|first4=Amy M.|title=Fundamentals of Nursing|date=2013|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-07933-4|page=224|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Assessment
#: The first step of the nursing process is assessment. During this phase, the nurse gathers information about a patients psychological, physiological, sociological, and spiritual status. This data can be collected in a variety of ways. Generally, nurses will conduct a patient interview. Physical examinations, referencing a patient's health history, obtaining a patient's family history, and general observation can also be used to gather assessment data. Patient interaction is generally the heaviest during this evaluative stage.
#Diagnosis
#: The diagnosing phase involves a nurse making an educated judgement about a potential or actual health problem with a patient. Multiple diagnoses are sometimes made for a single patient. These assessments not only include a description of the problem or illness (e.g. sleep deprivation) but also whether or not a patient is at risk of developing further problems. These diagnoses are also used to determine a patient's readiness for health improvement and whether or not they may have developed a syndrome. The diagnoses phase is a critical step as it is used to determine the course of treatment.
#Planning
#: Once a patient and nurse agree of the diagnoses, a plan of action can be developed. If multiple diagnoses need to be addressed, the head nurse will prioritise each assessment and devote attention to severe symptoms  and high risk patients. Each problem is assigned a clear, measurable goal for the expected beneficial outcome. For this phase, nurses generally refer to the evidence-based [http://www.nursing.uiowa.edu/cncce/nursing-outcomes-classification-overview Nursing Outcome Classification], which is a set of standardised terms and measurements for tracking patient wellness. The [http://www.nursing.uiowa.edu/cncce/nursing-interventions-classification-overview Nursing Interventions Classification] may also be used as a resource for planning.
#Implementation
#: The implementing phase is where the nurse follows through on the decided plan of action. This plan is specific to each patient and focuses on achievable outcomes. Actions involved in a nursing care plan include monitoring the patient for signs of change or improvement, directly caring for the patient or performing necessary medical tasks, educating and instructing the patient about further health management, and referring or contacting the patient for a follow-up. Implementation can take place over the course of hours, days, weeks, or even months.
#Evaluation
#: Once all nursing intervention actions have taken place, the nurse completes an evaluation to determine if the goals for patient wellness have been met. The possible patient outcomes are generally described under three terms: patient;s condition improved, patient's condition stabilised, and patient's condition deteriorated. In the event where the condition of the patient has shown no improvement, or if the wellness goals were not met, the nursing process begins again from the first step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursingprocess.org/Nursing-Process-Steps.html|title=Nursing Process Steps|website=www.nursingprocess.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Néstor Alberto Braunstein''' (born 1941, in [[Bell Ville]]) is an [[Argentine people|Argentine]]-[[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[physician]], [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]].

==Biography==
Braunstein graduated as a physician in 1962, at the age of 20, and received his M.D. in 1965 from the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba]], Argentina, where he taught at college level as early as 1959. In 1974 he was forced into exile for political and academic reasons and moved to [[Mexico]] where he worked as a psychiatrist in different public institutions for the treatment of both children and adults. Braunstein is a naturalized citizen of Mexico.&lt;ref name="La Jornada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Braunstein plantea un debate acerca de cómo es el mexicano ante el diván|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/07/10/02an1cul.html|publisher=[[La Jornada]]|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a graduate studies professor, a practicing psychoanalyst and an active writer.

In 1978 he was banned from his duties and positions in all Mexican psychiatric institutions because of his critical epistemological views on the official taxonomies of the so-called [[mental illnesses]] (then [[DSM-III]] and [[CIE-10]].

Immediately after arriving in Mexico he published (with some chapters written by Marcelo Pasternac, Frida Saal and Gloria Benedito): ''Psicología: Ideología y ciencia'' in which he demolishes academic psychology and denounces its conceit as a ''true'' science. Instead, Braunstein proposed psychoanalysis as an alternative and as a methodological tool to deal with human subjectivity and to redirect the study of psychology. The book had enormous success: 24 editions were printed between 1975 and 2008 (more than 70,000 copies sold). This work helped to change the ideological landscape in almost every school of psychology in Spanish speaking countries of Latin America and the author was invited to lecture about his ideas on psychology and psychoanalysis to commemorate the 20th, 25th and 30th anniversary of the first edition of the book.

In 1980 he published a pioneering book dealing with Lacanian psychoanalysis, the first to appear in Mexico, ''Psiquiatría, teoría del sujeto, psicoanálisis. (Hacia Lacan)'' which was also received with general acclaim; 14 editions were printed and is widely read, referred to and quoted. Beginning in 1981 he became the editor of a continuously reprinted series of books, ''Coloquios de la Fundación'' with 13 titles published that helped to expand the knowledge of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in Latin America.

Between 1975 and 2005 he taught Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in the Graduate Studies Department of Clinical Psychology at the Facultad de Psicología of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] and since 2005 he has been teaching in the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras of that same institution. He is a member of the board and professor in the Ph.D. in Critical Theory of [[17, Instituto de Estudios Críticos]] [http://www.17.edu.mx] and Secretary of the Administrative Board of [[Siglo Veintiuno Editores]] [http://www.sigloxxieditores.com.mx].

In Mexico, he introduced [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s teachings by different means in different venues. He taught the first course devoted to Lacanian Studies (UNAM, 1977), published the first Mexican article on Lacan (''Lust'', Mexico, n° 1, 1979) and wrote the forementioned book ''Psiquiatría, teoría del sujeto, psicoanálisis (Hacia Lacan''. In 1980 he co-founded a pioneering institute devoted to the Lacanian clinic (Fundación Mexicana de Psicoanálisis). Braunstein was also the chairman and co-founder of the first officially recognized psychoanalytic teaching institution in the country (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Psicoanalíticos, 1982) where he taught until 2003.

He is active in the psychoanalytic lecturing circuit and has given opening or closing lectures in several international symposiums including the following: [[Bogota]] (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, 1991 [http://www.puj.edu.co/fhumanidades/curriculo/2002/semestre7/S-007.html], [[Beijing]] (Psychoanalysis International Symposium, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing April, 2001), [[Paris]] (Lacan, 100 ans, la Sorbonne, January 23, 2000), [[New York City]] (Columbia University and Fordham University, 1992 and 2008 [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cS2Ds20sUaMJ:www.apres-coup.org/mt/1987-2001%2520History.pdf]
Apres-Coup announcement of Columbia lectures, [[Madrid]] (Universidad Complutense, Master en Teoría Psicoanalítica 1993 and 1997) [http://www.ucm.es/info/psclinic/masters/psicoterapia/equipo_docente.html], [[Istambul]] (Istanbul'da Psykanaliz, Etkinlikleri Sürüyor, September, 2001), [[Rome]](Fondation Européennne pour la Psychanalyse, RSI /Eros-ion, Les peintures de [[Leonardo Cremonini]], May, 1999) and [[Santiago de Chile]] (Universidad Andrés Bello. Mención Psicoanálisis, April 2000) [http://www.psiconet.com.mx/chile/agenda/bello2.htm].

Beginning in 1985 he has traveled constantly to different cities of America and Europe imparting seminars on Lacanian psychoanalysis.

As a cultural journalist specializing in psychoanalysis he has written many articles for general and specialized Mexican newspapers (Excelsior, Uno Más Uno, Reforma, Este País, El Universal, Revista de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México). He is active as a member of the editorial boards in several psychoanalytic journals published in Spanish, French, Portuguese and English (see below) and he has translated a number of literary and psychoanalytic texts into Spanish.

==Works and ideas==

Braunstein recognizes the following authors as the main influences on his thought: Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Giorgio Agamben]].

His works have dealt with a variety of subjects in terms of the relationship between [[psychoanalysis]] and [[culture]]: [[philosophy]] from [[Plato]] to [[Wittgenstein]] and [[Derrida]]; [[literature]] from [[Sophocles]] to [[W. G. Sebald|Sebald]] and [[Christa Wolf]]; the [[visual arts]]; [[music]]; [[opera]]; [[film]] [[theater]]; [[history]]; [[theology]]; [[medicine]]; [[neuroscience]]; [[law]]; [[linguistics]]; [[anthropology]]; academic [[psychology]]; [[pedagogy]]; [[politics]]; psychiatry and daily life in the 21st century. Since 2003 he has turned his attention to the subject of memory, articulating the meaning and research on the ability to remember in psychoanalysis and its constant references ([[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]) and those sources that can be derived from other disciplines such as literature, philosophy, history and neuroscience.

In his best known work ''Goce'' ''Jouissance. A Lacanian Concept'', he argues that the nucleus that holds psychoanalytical clinic and theory together is the concept of jouissance, which can be minimally defined as "the ways in which a body is affected by language". In this sense he argues that psychoanalysis can be understood as a sort of science of jouissance in the speaking being, a sophisticated knowledge that has been carefully constructed, first by Freud, continued by Lacan and still ongoing.

In his last book published in French, ''Depuis Freud, Après Lacan'' (Ramonville, Érès, 2008) Braunstein posits his theory of three different periods in the history of psychoanalysis. They can be emblematically traced to the year 1900 (Freud's era, under the predominance of the ''discourse of the Master''), 1950 (Lacan's times, under the hegemony of the ''discourse of the Capitalist'') and our present age (year 2000), ruled by the omnipresent and anonymous ''discourse of the Markets''.

'''PSYCHLOPS''' ('''psychological outcome profiles''') is a type of [[psychological testing]], a [[Self-report inventory|tool]] used in [[primary care]] to measure mental health outcomes and as a [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life measure]].

It is also one intervention that has been adapted for use in children and adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in response to a demand for guidance on psychological interventions for people exposed to [[adversity]], including humanitarian disasters.

== Use in mental health care ==
PSYCHLOPS is a mental health outcome-measure tool used in primary care or community care settings and is self-completed. It measures mental health problems, quality of life, social functioning and wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Nationarchives"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130124045059/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_093677.pdf|title=Outcomes Compendium; helping you select the right tools for best mental health care practice in your field|last=National Institute for Mental Health in England|first=|publisher=Barts and The London Schoolof Medicine and Dentistry|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClinicalPsych2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnB8i0IFysMC&amp;pg=PT420|title=Issues in Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, and Counseling: 2011 Edition|publisher=ScholarlyEditions|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4649-6366-7|edition=11th|location=Atlanta, Georgia|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include the [[Beck Depression Inventory]], the [[CORE-OM]], [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7]] (GAD-7) and the [[PHQ-9|Patient Health Questionnaire]] (PHQ-9), amongst others.&lt;ref name="McQuaid"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-I78AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=What+you+really+need+to+know+about+counselling+and+psychotherapy+training+psychlops#v=onepage&amp;q=psychlops&amp;f=false|title=What You Really Need to Know about Counselling and Psychotherapy Training: An essential guide|last=McQuaid|first=Cathy|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-81333-4|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By comparing scores before, during and after completion of [[Psychotherapy|talking therapy]], the measure enables calculation of a change score. The change score indicates the change (improvement or deterioration) in perceived severity of problems during and following a course of talking therapy.&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015/&gt; PSYCHLOPS is a patient-generated outcome measure which means that measurement is based on items (issues) selected by patients rather than pre-specified items. By gathering information on patient-generated items, PSYCHLOPS contains a free text record (qualitative data) of the patient’s own perception of their problems which can be used for [[qualitative research]].&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="EvansPsych"/&gt;

===WHO===
It is also one intervention that has been adopted by the WHO in response to a demand for guidance on psychological interventions for people exposed to adversity. This includes people caught up in [[humanitarian crisis|humanitarian crises]] and incorporates common mental health problems in a variety of countries, cultures and settings.&lt;ref name="WHO2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/206417/WHO_MSD_MER_16.2_eng.pdf;jsessionid=57A3AC1192842C3A3BF962F546E3090A?sequence=1|title=Problem Management Plus (PM+)|last=|first=|date=|website=apps.who.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHOPMPlus2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/emergencies/PM_plus_2018/en/|title=Scaling up capacity for Problem Management Plus (PM+)|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO has included it in two of their mental health programmes, Programme Management Plus (PM+)&lt;ref name="WHO2016" /&gt;and Self Help Plus (SH+),&lt;ref name=Brown2018&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Felicity|last2=Carswell|first2=K|last3=Augustinavicius|first3=Jura|last4=Adaku|first4=A|last5=R.

===Children===
PSYCHLOPS has been adapted for use in children. Unlike a [[checklist]], "PSYCHLOPS Kids" allows children to identify their worries themselves.&lt;ref name=Kings2018&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/spotlight-article.aspx?id=8dcdc004-aaac-4290-9bb2-d208b1702427|title=New tool gets children's perspective on own mental health|last=|first=|date=29 May 2018|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KingsTool&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/june-2018/assessing-childrens-mental-health-concerns|title=Assessing children's mental health concerns {{!}} The Psychologist|last=|first=|date=|website=thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For children taking part in [[drama therapy]], they have the potential to recognise the impact of their therapy. The reliance on the support of school staff has been reported as one limitation.&lt;ref name="Haythorne2012"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dQMmpi2XJagC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=psychlops&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv_ZbPq8DdAhVLQMAKHczyDfoQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=psychlops&amp;f=false|title=Dramatherapy with Children, Young People, and Schools: Enabling Creativity, Sociability, Communication and Learning|last=Haythorne|first=Deborah|last2=Crockford|first2=Susan|last3=Godfrey|first3=Emma|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415670760|editor-last=Leigh|editor-first=Lauraine|location=|pages=192|language=en|chapter=19.

==Procedure==
PSYCHLOPS is completed by the individual person.&lt;ref name="Nationarchives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EvansPsych"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/PDF/CALCMPconf2013Chris%20Evans.pdf|title=The danger of trading measures but not meeting distressed minds: "outcome" measurement in MH and psychological therapies|last=Evans|first=Chris|date=|website=www.psychtc.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific sequence of questions is included in the questionnaire which address the respondent’s greatest and least worries. These concerns are then scored.&lt;ref name=Kings2018/&gt; Subsequently, the answers and scores can be used to evaluate their perception of the change in their problems as a result of counselling or other talking therapy.&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015/&gt; It uses a six-point scale rather than the seven used in its sister questionnaire, MYMOP.&lt;ref name="Bristol"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/primaryhealthcare/resources/mymop/sisters/psychlops/|title=Psychlops {{!}} Centre for Academic Primary Care {{!}} University of Bristol|last=Bristol|first=University of|website=www.bristol.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure encompasses answering four questions on one sheet, with the first question being “Choose the problem that troubles you most?” This is followed by scoring it on a six-point scoring range and recording the duration of the problem. An outcome score is calculated using the scores of each of the before, during and after questionnaires.&lt;ref name="Ashworth2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashworth|first=Mark|last2=I. Robinson|first2=Susan|last3=Godfrey|first3=Emma|last4=Shepherd|first4=Melanie|last5=Evans|first5=Chris|last6=Seed|first6=Paul|last7=Parmentier|first7=Henk|last8=Tylee|first8=Andre|date=1 January 2005|title=Measuring mental health outcomes in primary care: The psychometric properties of a new patient-generated outcome measure, 'PSYCHLOPS' ('psychological outcome profiles')|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/203827086|journal=Primary Care Mental Health|volume=3|pages=261–270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PSYCHLOPS was designed by an academic British [[general practitioner]]&lt;ref name="McQuaid"/&gt; and was adapted from the [[self-report inventory]], MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile), another outcome measure first published in 1996 and mainly used for people who present with physical, emotional, or social symptoms.&lt;ref name=NCOR&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncor.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MYMOP.pdf|title=National Council for Osteopathic Research; Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ncor.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
There has been debate as to whether to identify and measure individualized outcomes that are unique for each patient ([[idiographic]] approach) or to use standardized measures ([[nomothetic]] approach). Both measures have their advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/bitstream/10174/17420/1/Patient-generated%20outcome%20measures%20and%20development%20the%20therapeutic%20alliance.pdf|title=Patient-generated outcome measures and development the therapeutic alliance|last=Brinquete|first=Cláudia Sofia Velez|publisher= University of Évora, Social Science School|year=2015|isbn=|location=Department Psychology, University of Évora|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a patient-generated measure, PSYCHLOPS appears a more sensitive (responsive) measure of change following a mental health intervention than some other standardised measures.&lt;ref name=KendrickBMJ2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendrick|first=Tony|last2=Stuart|first2=Beth|last3=Leydon|first3=Geraldine M.|last4=Geraghty|first4=Adam W.

The aim of '''dementia prevention''' is to delay or prevent  [[dementia]]. Dementia prevention is a global health priority &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/dementia/action_plan_consultation/en/|title=Development of a draft global action plan on the public health response to dementia|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worlddementiacouncil.org/|title=Home {{!}} World Dementia Council|website=worlddementiacouncil.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/health/dementia.htm|title=Dementia - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and as such requires a global response.

==Lifestyle==

===Mental activity===
{{Main|Brain fitness}}
"Use it or lose it" might be applied to the brain when it comes to dementia. Intellectual activities help keep the mind in shape in later years. Activities such as reading, learning a new language, playing cards and board games and playing a musical instrument can postpone the onset and slow the progression of both [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] and [[vascular dementia]].&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/hsc/dementia/prevent.htm |title=Prevention of Dementia |work=Dementia: The Growing Crisis in West Virginia |date=February 2005 |first1=Eugenia |last1=Thoenen |author2=Health Statistics Center Statistical Staff |first3=James |last3=Doria |first4=Fred |last4=King |first5=Thomas N. |last5=Leonard |first6=Tom |last6=Light |first7=Philip |last7=Simmons |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-11-06|title=Bilingualism delays age at onset of dementia, independent of education and immigration status|url=http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2013/11/06/01.wnl.0000436620.33155.a4.abstract?sid=f43530ca-573d-4d57-bd1c-b3dfb1282084|journal=Neurology|volume=|doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000436620.33155.a4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk decrease is proportional to frequency of activity,&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt; with slower cognitive decline being associated with both late-life and early-life increased cognitive activity.&lt;ref name=Neurology20130703&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurology.org/content/early/2013/07/03/WNL.0b013e31829c5e8a |title=Life-span cognitive activity, neuropathologic burden, and cognitive aging (Abstract)|last=Wilson |first=Robert S.|date=3 July 2013 |website=Neurology |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ht0Ia2PN |archivedate=5 July 2013 |display-authors=etal}} Explained by {{cite web |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/07/being-a-lifelong-bookworm-may-keep-you-sharp-in-old-age/ |title=Being a Lifelong Bookworm May Keep You Sharp in Old Age |last=Koren |first=Marina |date=23 July 2013 |website=Smithsonian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ht0xyPkH |archivedate=5 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from spare time activities, a mentally demanding job may prevent dementia, especially during the thirties, forties and fifties.&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt;

Mental activity may help to prevent dementia by building up a "brain reserve": additional connections between [[neuron]]s are created which are more resistant to the deterioration seen in dementia.&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt;

===Physical activity===
{{Main|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise}}
Since [[vascular dementia]] is the second most common form of dementia (after [[Alzheimer's disease]]), reducing the risk of [[cerebrovascular disease]] also reduces the risk of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuźma|first=Elżbieta|last2=Lourida|first2=Ilianna|last3=Moore|first3=Sarah F.|last4=Levine|first4=Deborah A.|last5=Ukoumunne|first5=Obioha C.|last6=Llewellyn|first6=David J.|date=2018-08|title=Stroke and dementia risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(18)33250-3/abstract|journal=Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia|language=English|volume=0|issue=0|doi=10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.3061|issn=1552-5260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[physical exercise]], having good blood [[cholesterol]], healthy [[body weight]] and [[blood pressure]] lowers the risk of developing dementia.&lt;ref name ="wvdhhr"/&gt; An active lifestyle can almost halve the risk compared to a [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary one]].&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt;

Results of one meta-analysis, which investigated the relationship between physical activity and risk of cognitive decline in people without dementia, showed exercise had a significant and consistent protective effect against cognitive decline, with high levels of physical activity being most protective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sofi|first=F.|last2=Valecchi|first2=D.|last3=Bacci|first3=D.|last4=Abbate|first4=R.|last5=Gensini|first5=G.

The effect of physical activity is not limited to vascular effects. Physical activity can give rise to new [[neurons]] in the brain, as well as releasing a substance that can protect them.&lt;ref name="wvdhhr" /&gt; The protein known as [[brain-derived neurotropic factor]] (BDNF) is known to be important in the development, survival and plasticity of neurons. Regular exercise can boost BDNF levels by 2–3 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Hilary|title=Dr|url=http://www.telecare24.co.uk/blog/dr-hilary-jones-preventing-dementia-exercise/|website=telecare24/co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
[[Obesity]] increases the risk of any dementia and [[Alzheimer's disease]] in particular.&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt;  The effect of [[alcoholism|alcohol]] on the risk of dementia is a [[J curve]]:&lt;ref name=Review09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen JH, Lin KP, Chen YC |title=Risk factors for dementia |journal=J. Formos. Med.

The effects of [[omega-3 fatty acid]] in the prevention of dementia is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cederholm T, Palmblad J |title=Are omega-3 fatty acids options for prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and dementia? |journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=150–5 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20019606|doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e328335c40b |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vegetables and nuts may be of benefit,&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt; because of their high content of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s. Non-fish meat, on the other hand, increases the risk of Alzheimer's,&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt; because of its high content of [[saturated fat]]. However, consumption of fish should be limited due to concerns over mercury poisoning, which could exacerbate the symptoms of dementia.

[[Niacin]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also believed to prevent dementia as research shows those who have the highest levels of niacin in their blood, are believed to have the lowest risk of developing dementia or having cognitive decline. Niacin is involved with DNA synthesis and repair and also neural cell signaling, it improves circulation and reduces cholesterol levels. In order for niacin to have a positive effect on the brain, it is recommended that patients have 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;mg per day.&lt;ref name="Robert2006" /&gt;

There is evidence for an association between cognitive decline, [[homocysteine]] (Hcy) status, and [[vitamin B]] status relating especially to [[vitamin B12|B12]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gröber U, Kisters K, Schmidt J |title=Neuroenhancement with vitamin B12-underestimated neurological significance |journal=Nutrients |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=5031–45 |year=2013 |pmid=24352086 |pmc=3875920 |doi=10.3390/nu5125031 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to vitamins [[vitamin B6|B6]] and [[vitamin B9|B9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reay JL, Smith MA, Riby LM |title=B vitamins and cognitive performance in older adults: review |journal=ISRN Nutrition |volume=2013 |issue= |pages=650983 |year=2013 |pmid=24959550 |pmc=4045270 |doi=10.5402/2013/650983 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[vitamin B12 deficiency|deficiency of vitamin B12]] and/or [[folate deficiency|of folate]] can cause an increase in Hcy plasma levels, which in turn leads to toxic effects on the vascular and nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ansari R, Mahta A, Mallack E, Luo JJ |title=Hyperhomocysteinemia and neurologic disorders: a review |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurology (Seoul, Korea) |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=281–8 |year=2014 |pmid=25324876 |pmc=4198708 |doi=10.3988/jcn.2014.10.4.281 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep pattern===
More than nine hours of sleep per day (including daytime napping) may be associated with an increased risk of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2009.02618.x |pmid=19473367 |year=2009 |last1=Benito-León |first1=J |last2=Bermejo-Pareja |first2=F |last3=Vega |first3=S |last4=Louis |first4=ED |title=Total daily sleep duration and the risk of dementia: a prospective population-based study |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=990–7 |journal=European Journal of Neurology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lack of sleep]] may also increase risk of dementia by increasing [[beta-amyloid]] deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/267710.php|title=Lack of sleep may increase Alzheimer's risk|work=Medical News Today|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality and Mental Health===
Being [[Neuroticism|neurotic]] increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's, a type of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news-detail/11160/Neuroticism-and-other-personality-traits-in-midlife-linked-to-Alzheimers-risk/|title=Neuroticism and other personality traits in midlife linked to Alzheimer’s risk - Alzheimer's Research UK|date=1 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/news/20141001/jealous-moody-women-may-face-higher-alzheimers-risk-study-says|title=Jealous, Moody Women May Face Higher Alzheimer's Risk, Study Says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroticism]] is associated with increased brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in life, while [[conscientiousness]] has a protective effect by preventing brain atrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exploring the relationship between personality and regional brain volume in healthy aging| pmc=2891197 | pmid=20036035 | doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2009.12.009| volume=32| date=December 2011|vauthors=Jackson J, Balota DA, Head D | journal=Neurobiol. Aging| pages=2162–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depression ===
Depressive symptoms can be a part of the clinical presentation of dementia, leading to debate as to whether depression is a cause or a symptom of dementia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The evidence remains unclear.  However, Livingstone et al. (2014)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; report that it is "biologically plausible" that depression increases the risk of dementia.  There is some evidence that late-life depression increases the risk of dementia however&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diniz|first=Breno S.|last2=Butters|first2=Meryl A.|last3=Albert|first3=Steven M.|last4=Dew|first4=Mary Amanda|last5=Reynolds|first5=Charles F.|date=May 2013|title=Late-life depression and risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of community-based cohort studies|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=202|issue=5|pages=329–335|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.112.118307|issn=1472-1465|pmc=3640214|pmid=23637108}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting treating depression in mid-life might delay or prevent dementia.

==Medication==

===Hypertension===
Some studies say Alzheimer's and other dementias may be caused by high blood pressure, since it can cause blood vessel damage through constriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7528539.stm|title=Blood pressure drug dementia hope|date=28 July 2008|accessdate=2 October 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Blood Pressure Drugs May Protect Against Alzheimer's|date=27 July 2008|publisher=Boston University School of Medicine|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/27/AR2008072701213.html|accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etiology of [[vascular dementia]] includes [[hypertension]], and thus, lowering blood pressure with [[antihypertensive]]s may have a positive effect in the prevention of dementia, just as physical activity.

However, one study failed to demonstrate a link between high blood pressure and developing dementia. The study, published in the ''Lancet Neurology'' journal of July 2008, found that blood pressure lowering medication did not reduce the incidence of dementia to a statistically significant degree.  A prospective meta-analysis of the data from this study with other studies suggested that further research might be warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters R, Beckett N, Forette F, Tuomilehto J, Clarke R, Ritchie C, Waldman A, Walton I, Poulter R, Ma S, Comsa M, Burch L, Fletcher A, Bulpitt C; HYVET investigators |title=Incident dementia and blood pressure lowering in the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial cognitive function assessment (HYVET-COG): a double-blind, placebo controlled trial |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=683–9 |date=August 2008 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70143-1 |author-separator=  |pmid=18614402 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of participants in the Leisure World Cohort Study and The 90+ Study showed that people whose high blood pressure began in their 80s might be less likely to develop dementia than people who did not have high blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=María M. Corrada, Kathleen M. Hayden, Annlia Paganini-Hill, Szofia S. Bullain, Jaime DeMoss, Colette Aguirre, Ron Brookmeyer, Claudia H. Kawas |title=Age of onset of hypertension and risk of dementia in the oldest-old: The 90+ Study|journal=Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia|volume=7|issue=|pages=683–9|date=January 16, 2017|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70143-1 |author-separator=  |pmid=18614402|url=http://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(16)32962-4/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the results of studies are somewhat inconsistent, it has been recommended that hypertension in mid-life (45–65 years) and older age (65+ years) should be actively treated to reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Anti-diabetic drugs===
Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for [[vascular dementia]], and is thus the risk is lowered with [[anti-diabetic drug]]s.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Diabetes and Alzheimer's linked |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |date=6 November 2008 |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diabetes-and-alzheimers/AZ00050 |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, [[Rosiglitazone]] (Avandia) improves memory and thinking ability for people with mild Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism of the effect may be the ability of the drug to reduce [[insulin resistance]].&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt; Thus, less insulin needs to be released to achieve its metabolic effects. Insulin in the bloodstream is a trigger of [[amyloid beta]]-production,&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/20050808/obesity-alzheimers-risk|title=Obesity Today, Alzheimer's Disease Tomorrow?|work=WebMD|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; so decreased insulin levels decrease the level of amyloid beta. This leads to less formation of [[amyloid]] plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease.

===Steroid hormones===
[[Estrogen]] may also help in the prevention of dementia but cannot help when dementia is already present and when cognitive function is already impaired. It increases cerebral blood flow and is an anti-inflammatory agent, enhancing activity at the neuronal synapses in the brain.

===NSAIDs===
[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) can decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt; The length of time needed to prevent dementia varies, but in most studies it is usually between 2 and 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18509093 |year=2008 |last1=Szekely |first1=CA |last2=Green |last3=Breitner |last4= Østbye |last5=Beiser |last6=Corrada |last7=Dodge |last8=Ganguli |last9=Kawas |title=No advantage of "Aβ42-lowering" NSAIDs for prevention of AD in six pooled cohort studies |volume=70 |issue=24 |pages=2291–8 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000313933.17796.f6 |journal=Neurology |first2=RC |first3=JC |first4=T |first5=AS |first6=MM |first7=HH |first8=M |first9=CH |pmc=2755238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15084783 |year=2004 |last1=Cornelius |first1=C |last2=Fastbom |last3=Winblad |last4=Viitanen |title=Aspirin, NSAIDs, risk of dementia, and influence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele in an elderly population |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=135–43 |doi=10.1159/000075957 |journal=Neuroepidemiology |first2=J |first3=B |first4=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12869452 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7407.128 |year=2003 |last1=Etminan |first1=M |last2=Gill |last3=Samii |title=Effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on risk of Alzheimer's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies |volume=327 |issue=7407 |pages=128 |journal=BMJ |first2=S |first3=A |pmc=165707}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12827329 |year=2003 |last1=Nilsson |first1=SE |last2=Johansson |last3=Takkinen |last4=Berg |last5= Zarit |last6=Mcclearn |last7=Melander |title=Does aspirin protect against Alzheimer's dementia?

Alzheimer's disease causes inflammation in the [[neuron]]s by its deposits of [[amyloid beta]] peptides and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s. These deposits irritate the body by causing a release of e.g. [[cytokines]] and [[acute phase protein]]s, leading to inflammation. When these substances accumulate over years they contribute to the effects of Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10858586 |year=2000 |last1=Akiyama |first1=H |last2=Barger |last3=Barnum |last4=Bradt |last5=Bauer |last6=Cole |last7=Cooper |last8=Eikelenboom |last9=Emmerling |title=Inflammation and Alzheimer's disease |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=383–421 |journal=Neurobiology of Aging |doi=10.1016/S0197-4580(00)00124-X |first2=S |first3=S |first4=B |first5=J |first6=GM |first7=NR |first8=P |first9=M |pmc=3887148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSAIDs inhibit the formation of such inflammatory substances, and prevent the deteriorating effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16386371 |year=2006 |last1=Tortosa |first1=E |last2=Avila |last3=Pérez |title= Acetylsalicylic acid decreases tau phosphorylation at serine 422 |volume=396 |issue=1 |pages=77–80 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2005.11.066 |journal=Neuroscience Letters |first2=J |first3=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16125740 |year=2005 |last1=Hirohata |first1=M |last2=Ono |last3=Naiki |last4=Yamada |title=Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have anti-amyloidogenic effects for Alzheimer's beta-amyloid fibrils in vitro |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=1088–99 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2005.07.004 |journal=Neuropharmacology |first2=K |first3=H |first4=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 11711868 |year=2001 |last1=Thomas |first1=T |last2=Nadackal |last3=Thomas |title=Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit amyloid-beta aggregation |volume=12 |issue= 15 |pages=3263–7 |journal=NeuroReport |doi=10.1097/00001756-200110290-00024 |first2= TG |first3= K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccine===
There is as yet no [[vaccine]] against dementia.&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt; It has been theorized that a vaccine could activate the body's own [[immune system]] to combat the [[beta amyloid]] plaques in Alzheimer's disease. One problem to overcome is overreaction from the immune system, leading to [[encephalitis]].&lt;ref name="wvdhhr"/&gt;

'''Reproductive technology''' encompasses all current and anticipated uses of technology in human and animal [[reproduction]], including [[assisted reproductive technology]], [[contraception]] and others.

==Applications==

===Assisted reproductive technology===
{{Main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is the use of reproductive technology to treat low fertility or infertility. ART is currently the only form of reproductive technology in clinical use&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;, and is more effective in those suffering from ovulatory disorders or endometriosis (those without a functional uterus, for example, for the time being can only conceive through surrogacy methods)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campo|first=Hannes|last2=Cervelló|first2=Irene|last3=Simón|first3=Carlos|title=Bioengineering the Uterus: An Overview of Recent Advances and Future Perspectives in Reproductive Medicine|url=https://link-springer-com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/article/10.1007/s10439-016-1783-3|journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1710–1717|doi=10.1007/s10439-016-1783-3|pmid=28028711|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of ART include ''in vitro'' fertilization and its possible expansions, including:
* [[artificial insemination]]
* [[artificial reproduction]]
* [[cloning]] (see [[human cloning]] for the special case of human beings)
* [[cytoplasmic transfer]]
* [[cryopreservation]] of [[Spermatozoon|sperm]], [[oocyte]]s, [[embryos]]
* [[embryo transfer]]
* [[fertility medication]]
* [[hormone treatment]]
* [[in vitro fertilization]]
**[[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]]
*[[in vitro generated gametes]]
* [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]

===Prognostics===
Reproductive technology can inform [[family planning]] by providing individual prognoses regarding the likelihood of pregnancy. It facilitates the monitoring of [[ovarian reserve]], [[Ovarian follicle|follicular]] dynamics and associated [[female reproductive biomarkers|biomarkers]] in females&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Telfer | first2 = E. E. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = R. A. | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms043 | title = The ageing ovary and uterus: New biological insights | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–83 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23103636| pmc =3508627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[semen analysis]] in males.

===Contraception===
[[Contraception]] is a form of reproductive technology that enables people to control their fertility.

===Others===
The following reproductive techniques are not currently in routine clinical use; most are still undergoing development:
* [[artificial womb]]s
* [[germinal choice technology]]
* ''in vitro'' [[parthenogenesis]]
* [[reprogenetics]]

====Same-sex procreation====
Research is currently investigating the possibility of same-sex procreation, which would produce offspring with equal genetic contributions from either two females or two males. This form of reproduction has become a possibility through the creation of either [[female sperm]] (containing the genetic material of a female) or [[male egg]]s (containing the genetic material of a male). Same-sex procreation would remove the need for lesbian and gay couples to rely on a third party donation of a sperm or an egg for reproduction.

The first significant development occurred in 1991, in a patent application filed by U.Penn. scientists to fix male sperm by extracting some sperm, correcting a genetic defect in vitro, and injecting the sperm back into the male's testicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|5858354|Repopulation of testicular Seminiferous tubules with foreign cells, corresponding resultant germ cells, and corresponding resultant animals and progeny}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the vast majority of the patent application dealt with male sperm, one line suggested that the procedure would work with XX cells, i.e., cells from an adult woman to make female sperm.

In the two decades that followed, the idea of female sperm became more of a reality. In 1997, scientists partially confirmed such techniques by creating chicken female sperm in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tagami T, Matsubara Y, Hanada H, Naito M |title=Differentiation of female chicken primordial germ cells into spermatozoa in male gonads |journal=Dev Growth Differ. |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=267–71 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9227893 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-169X.1997.t01-2-00002.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; They did so by injecting blood stem cells from an adult female chicken into a male chicken's testicles. In 2004, other Japanese scientists created two female offspring by combining the eggs of two adult mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kono|first=Tomohiro|last2=Obata|first2=Yayoi|last3=Wu|first3=Quiong|last4=Niwa|first4=Katsutoshi|last5=Ono|first5=Yukiko|last6=Yamamoto|first6=Yuji|last7=Park|first7=Eun Sung|last8=Seo|first8=Jeong-Sun|last9=Ogawa|first9=Hidehiko|date=1 April 2004|title=Birth of parthenogenetic mice that can develop to adulthood|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature02402|journal=Nature|volume=428|issue=6985|pages=860–864|doi=10.1038/nature02402|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, research was done specifically for methods on creating human female sperm using artificial or natural [[Y chromosome]]s and testicular transplantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samesexprocreation.com/archive/sprmpict.pdf|format=PDF|title=Color illustration of female sperm making process|publisher=Human Samesex Reproduction Project}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK-based group predicted they would be able to create human female sperm within five years. So far no conclusive successes have been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/nsw/scientists-turn-bone-marrow-into-sperm-ng-59b4273be880d39210e725126b676986|title=Scientists turn bone marrow into sperm|last=MacRae|first=Fiona|date=1 February 2008|publisher=The Courier and Mail (Australia&amp;nbsp;– Feb. 2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Chinese research scientists produced 29 viable mice offspring from two mother mice by creating sperm-like structures from haploid [[Embryonic stem cell]]s using [[Genome editing|gene editing]] to alter imprinted regions of DNA. They were unable to get viable offspring from two fathers.  Experts noted that there was little chance of these techniques being applied to humans in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/genomic-imprinting-silenced-in-haploid-stem-cells-produces-fatherless-mice|title=Chinese Researchers Have Spawned Healthy Mice With 2 Biological Mothers And No Father|last=McRae|first=Mike|date=11 October 2018|work=Science Alert|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhi-Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Le-Yun|last3=Wang|first3=Li-Bin|last4=Feng|first4=Gui-Hai|last5=Yuan|first5=Xue-Wei|last6=Liu|first6=Chao|last7=Xu|first7=Kai|last8=Li|first8=Yu-Huan|last9=Wan|first9=Hai-Feng|date=1 October 2018|title=Generation of Bimaternal and Bipaternal Mice from Hypomethylated Haploid ESCs with Imprinting Region Deletions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934590918304417|journal=Cell Stem Cell|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.09.004|issn=1934-5909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
Many issues of reproductive technology have given rise to [[bioethics|bioethical]] issues, since technology often alters the assumptions that lie behind existing systems of sexual and reproductive [[morality]]. Other ethical considerations arise with the application of ART to women of advanced maternal age, who have higher changes of medical complications (including [[pre-eclampsia]]), and possibly in the future its application to post-[[Menopause|menopausal]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Brittany J|last2=Hilton|first2=Tara N|last3=Riviere|first3=Raphael N|last4=Ferraro|first4=Zachary M|last5=Deonandan|first5=Raywat|last6=Walker|first6=Mark C|date=16 August 2017|title=Advanced maternal age: ethical and medical considerations for assisted reproductive technology|url=https://www.dovepress.com/advanced-maternal-age-ethical-and-medical-considerations-for-assisted--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJWH|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=9|pages=561|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S139578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, ethical issues of [[human enhancement]] arise when reproductive technology has evolved to be a potential technology for not only reproductively inhibited people but even for otherwise reproductively healthy people.

==In fiction==
*Films and other fiction depicting contemporary emotional struggles of [[assisted reproductive technology]] have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-21/news/0906190243_1_fertility-treatments-ovulation-artificial-insemination|title=Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Colleen Mastony|date=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the number of people that can relate to it {{Further|Assisted reproductive technology#Fictional representation}}
*Science fiction has tackled the themes of creating life through other than the conventional methods since [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''. In the 20th century, [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) was the first major fictional work to anticipate the possible social consequences of reproductive technology. Its largely negative view was reversed when the author revisited the same themes in his utopian final novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962).

[[File:Robert Spencer Stone.jpg|thumb|Canadian American and pioneer in radiology, radiation therapy and radiation protection]]

==Life==
Robert Spencer Stone, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] was born in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham]], [[Chatham-Kent|Kent County]], [[Ontario]] the son of Spencer ‘Pen’ Stone and Flora Maude Campbell. The Pen Stone family consisted of children Robert, Thomas, John, and Elizabeth.
R.S. Stone married Wilhemina Rose Crawford on 24 June 1924 in [[London, Ontario]]. The Stone’s had 3 children: Robert Spencer, Ian Crawford and Margaret Isobel.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
In 1917 Stone entered military service in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and gained the rank of [[Lieutenant]]. He was assigned to the 111th Overseas Battalion, [[Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force]] and fought in [[France]] during [[World War I]]. After being wounded in battle, he returned to Canada in 1919.

==Education and career==
Stone attended the University of Toronto and earned a B.A. in 1917, M.A. in 1922, M.B. in 1924 and M.D. in 1928. From 1919 – 1921 he traveled to [[Peking, China]] to teach and work as an assistant in [[anatomy]] at the [[Peking Union Medical College|Peking Union Medical School]]. Stone went to [[Detroit]], Michigan for his [[internship]] at [[Sinai-Grace Hospital|Grace Hospital]] to study [[radiology]] under his uncle Dr. Rollin H. Stevens from 1925 – 1928.

During the time in Peking, he produced his first two scientific publications. One paper dealt with abnormal sex ensemble of goats and the other paper described the [[central nervous system]] of a human [[cyclops]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Stone, Robert Spencer. (1923). The central nervous system of the human cyclops. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 Stone moved to [[San Francisco]] to become the first [[radiologist]] on the faculty at the [[University of California]] School of Medicine. He stayed there until retirement in 1962. Stone developed a keen interest in [[radiation therapy]] and [[radiation protection]]. He continued his pursuits in retirement and earned the distinction as [[Emeritus Professor]].

In 1935 Stone worked at the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]], on the Berkeley Campus in an old wooden building abandoned by the Department of Engineering. This building was the first home of the 37-inch [[cyclotron]] held together by chicken wire and sealing wax. The cyclotron produced 32P for biological studies.
In that dilapidated building other pioneers that included [[John H. Lawrence]], Paul C. Aebersold, and J. G. Hamilton were busy at work. Dr. Aebersold collaborated with Dr. Stone as one of the physicists who developed the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] into a [[neutron therapy]] source. Their work was published in 1939, and in 1940 their patient studies were published.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Abersold, Paul C. (October 1939). The production of a beam of fast neutrons. Phys. Rev. 56: 714-727.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Robert S., John H. Lawrence, and Paul C. Aebersold. (September 1940). A Preliminary report on the use of fast neutrons in the treatment of malignant disease. Radiology 35: 322-327.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr. Stone and Dr. Hamilton were early pioneers in cyclotron produced “artificial radionuclides”, and published results on the distribution of radiosodium in man in February 1937.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. HAMILTON, and R. S. STONE. (February, 1937). The intravenous and intraduodenal administration of radio-sodium. Radiology 28: 178-188.&lt;/ref&gt;
Early on, most of the staff at the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]] was interested in pure [[physics]]. Money became available to establish the [[Crocker Laboratory for Medical Research]], with a 60-inch [[cyclotron]], capable of producing [[neutrons]] for Stone to pursue the treatment of [[malignant disease]]. Stone was allotted cyclotron time one afternoon each week for the treatment of patients. He was ahead of his time in the experimental treatment of tumors. 
This work was suspended by [[World War II]], and Dr. Stone became responsible for the [[health and safety]] of the workers of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] of the [[University of Chicago]]. The [[Met Lab]] was doing initial research on the [[metabolism]] of fission and fissionable products in collaboration with the [[Crocker Radiation Laboratory]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]], Tennessee, and others. Stone's talents as physician and administrator became apparent since there were little or no over-exposures or radiation injuries, with numerous research and ancillary personnel involved in developing the techniques and procedures of the atomic age.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, K.G., (1968), Robert Spencer Stone, (1895-1966), RADIATION RESEARCH, 33: 675-676.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scarlet Alliance''' is Australia's national [[Peak organisation|peak]] [[Sex Workers' Rights Movement|sex worker organisation]]. It was formed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scarlet Alliance History|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/who/history/index_html/view |publisher=Scarlet Alliance, the Australian Sex Workers' Association|accessdate=26 April 2012|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an organisation maintained entirely by current and former [[sex worker]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex @ work: the ordinary, extraordinary lives of sex workers|url=http://nchsr.arts.unsw.edu.au/media/File/Workshop_27_Sex__work.pdf |publisher=The HIV Consortium for Social and Policy Research on HIV, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Kate DeMaere|page=3|date=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet Alliance aims to achieve equality, [[Social equality|social]], [[Equality before the law|legal]], political, cultural and [[Social justice|economic]] justice for workers in the sex industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/who/ |publisher=Scarlet Alliance, the Australian Sex Workers Association|accessdate=26 April 2012|language=English, Thai, Cantonese|date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Since its inception, Scarlet Alliance has primarily relied on [[Voluntarism (action)|volunteers]] to manage the organisation. Despite receiving various funding grants over the last decade and a half,{{when|date=July 2018}} the majority of Scarlet Alliance's work has remained unfunded. The organisation has stated its commitment to aims and objectives, to its membership and the broader sex worker community as always coming first. However, if funding can be sourced towards supporting key areas of this work without compromising political objectives, then it has been sought in order to boost the organisation's capacity as well as to support greater equity and access to events such as the annual national forum. In 2004 Scarlet Alliance was granted [[Non-governmental organization#Funding|government funding]] to undertake project work in Australia and within the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia/ Pacific region]]. This funding came to an end in 2012 when the Australian government allocated a greater amount of "foreign aid" towards running offshore detention facilities (defunding other projects).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Scarlet Alliance also employed two part-time bilingual migrant sex workers (Thai, Chinese and/or Korean) for nine years as part of a successful migration project with Empower Thailand. The project was informed by a steering committee of migrant sex workers across Australia and ensured migrant sex workers were represented in Australia’s round table which met to response to trafficking.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Scarlet Alliance aims to promote an increased understanding of sex workers and the issues affecting them. The organisation lobbies for policies which recognize sex workers as self-determining agents, with the option to choose [[Prostitution in Australia|where and how they work]]. Scarlet Alliance has undertaken campaigns to increase [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]] standards in the sex industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Best Practise Occupational Health and Safety in the Australian Sex Industry|url=http://www.hivpolicy.org/Library/HPP000370.pdf |publisher=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize the [[human rights]] and [[Prostitution law#Labor laws|labour rights]] of sex workers, and to repeal laws and policies which [[Sex workers' rights#Discrimination and stigmatization|discriminate against sex workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Civil Liberties/Human Rights in the Northern Territory June 2011|url=http://www.cla.asn.au/Article/2011/NT%20REPORT%2030%20June%202011.pdf |publisher=Australian Council for Civil Liberties|accessdate=25 April 2012|author1=Kristine Klugman|author2=Bill Rawlings|page=8|format=Executive Summary|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution law puts sex workers at risk|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/05/14/2899297.htm?site=darwin |publisher=ABC Darwin|accessdate=25 April 2012|author=Phoebe Stewart|date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex worker rights highlighted in Alice|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/02/15/2819728.htm |publisher=abc.net.au|accessdate=25 April 2012|author=Emma Sleath|date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As a national organisation, Scarlet Alliance facilitates an annual membership forum which is attended by sex worker delegates from around Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/events/|title=- Sex Worker Events|work=scarletalliance.org.au|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year the forum is held in a different [[States and territories of Australia|state]] to maximise the inclusion of local sex workers. An [[Annual General Meeting|Annual General Meeting (AGM)]] and public symposium or rally are also included within the forum's program.

Scarlet Alliance holds training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/Education/ |title=Education|work=scarletalliance.org.au|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; participates in forums and presents workshops at universities in Australia and within the Asia/ Pacific region. The organisation aims to break down the [[Social stigma|stigma]], [[Stereotype|negative stereotyping]] and popular misconceptions surrounding sex work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to Sex Workers: Decriminalization and Anti-Discrimination Protection|url=http://www.interfacejournal.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Interface-3-2-Scarlet-Alliance.pdf |publisher=Interface Journal, Volume 3 (2)|accessdate=26 April 2012|author1=Jane Green|author2=Christian Vega|author3=Audry Autonomy|author4=Elena Jeffreys|pages=271–287|format=Article|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates from the organisation present [[Evidence-based practice#Social policy|evidence based research and information]] about who sex workers are, what is involved in sex work and why sex workers choose sex work.

Scarlet Alliance produces an annual magazine, ''proVision''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Body Politic|url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/monthly-essays-emily-maguire-body-politic-2700 |publisher=''The Monthly'' magazine|accessdate=25 April 2012|author=Emily Maguire|format=Article|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine contains information about the organisation's activities, articles exploring current sex work policy issues and contributions from national and international sex workers. In keeping with the principle of [[community ownership]], ''proVision'' is produced entirely by sex workers.

Scarlet Alliance networks with sister peer led sex worker organisations including:
* Friends Frangipani Association in Papua New Guinea
* [[EMPOWER|Empower]] in Thailand
* [[IUSW]] on the United Kingdom
* [[DMSC]] in India
* Women's Network for Unity in Cambodia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnu.womynsagenda.org/ Women's Network for Unity in Cambodia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The Scarlet Alliance National Training and Assessment Program (SANTAP) contains two parts- a learning tool and an assessment framework. The assessment framework offers sex workers the opportunity to have their skills in peer education and community mobilisation formally recognised through recognition of prior learning by peer assessors. On completion of the multi-module assessment process, participants are awarded a nationally recognised diploma.
The learning tool provides new or existing sex worker peer educators the required knowledge and grounding to apply for the diploma.

The Scarlet Alliance National Training Project (SANTP) is an assessment package consisting of 14 core modules and 4 elective modules. The project provides [[Peer education|sex worker peer educators]] with an [[Educational assessment#Informal and formal|assessment tool]] which formally recognizes the unique skills they utilize in undertaking [[health promotion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion|url=http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/ottawa/en/index.html |publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=26 April 2012|format=Charter|date=21 November 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[community development]] work within sex worker communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SANTP: Scarlet Alliance National Training Project|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/projects/santp/ |publisher=Scarlet Alliance, the Australian Sex Worker Association|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the training project are required to undertake an assessment process, supported by a qualified peer assessor, to achieve a nationally recognized Diploma of Community Education qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessor Network|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/projects/santp/asnet/ |publisher=Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex Worker Association|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To successfully achieve the qualification, participants are required to demonstrate and document how they have employed peer education principles in their work with sex workers.

Modules in the training project include:
* [[communication]]
* community development
* [[project management]]
* public and community education
* working with sex workers

The training package was developed as a strategy to assist sex worker organisations and projects to deliver a nationally consistent standard of peer education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scarlet Alliance National Training Project: The Initial Project Aims|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/projects/santp/aims/ |publisher=Scarlet Alliance, the Australian sex workers association|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
Scarlet Alliance is a key advocate and participant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://www.afao.org.au/who-we-are/members |publisher=Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[HIV]] and [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) prevention work in Australia. Sex worker communities in Australia have high rates of condom use, and low rates of STIs, including HIV/[[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Steps Back?|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000108 |publisher=Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations|accessdate=24 April 2012|author=John Godwin|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian sex industry's low rates of STIs and HIV has been attributed to sex worker [[Community organizing|communities self organizing]] to form [[Sex workers' rights|peer led sex worker advocacy]] organisations in the early years of the HIV epidemic.  Sex worker organisations, including Scarlet Alliance, employed [[community development]] principles to educate sex workers, [[Sex industry|sex industry business owners]] and sex industry clients about the need to adopt [[Safe sex|safer sex]] practices and [[harm reduction]] strategies to avoid potentially contracting HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National HIV Strategy 2005-2008: Revitalizing Australia's Response|url=http://www.ashm.org.au/images/hiv%20national%20strategy/5th%20national%20hiv%20aids%20strategys%202005-2008.pdf |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=24 April 2012|page=4|format=National Strategy (Briefing paper)|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet Alliance continues to lobby state and national governments about the difficulties of effective HIV prevention whilst sex work remains a criminalized occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Sex Workers|url=http://www.whatworksforwomen.org/chapters/7/sections/9 |publisher=What works for women and girls|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence against sex workers and HIV prevention|url=http://www.who.int/gender/documents/sexworkers.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=24 April 2012|language=English|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminalisation harms sex workers|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/55476.html |publisher=abc.net.au|accessdate=24 April 2012|author=Elena Jeffreys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schiller–Duval body''' is a cellular structure seen by [[microscope]] in [[endodermal sinus tumor]]s (yolk sac tumors) which are the most common testicular cancer in children. Schiller-Duval bodies are present in approximately 50% of these tumors, and if found are [[pathognomonic]].&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Abbas, Fausto. ''Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th edition.'' Philadelphia; Elsevier-Saunders, 2005. 1042.&lt;/ref&gt; They are named for [[Mathias-Marie Duval]] and [[Walter Schiller]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2831.html  "Schiller–Duval bodies" at whonamedit.com]&lt;/ref&gt; who described them in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Duval M.

Schiller–Duval bodies are said to resemble a [[glomerulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Abbas, Fausto. ''Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th edition.'' Philadelphia; Elsevier-Saunders, 2005. 1101.&lt;/ref&gt; They have a [[mesoderm]]al core with a central [[capillary]], all lined by flattened layers of both visceral and parietal cells. [[Immunofluorescence|Immunofluorescent]] stain may show eosinophilic [[hyalin]]-like globules both inside and outside the [[cytoplasm]] that contain [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]] and [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5642">'''Sham surgery''' ('''placebo surgery''') is a faked [[surgery|surgical intervention]] that omits the step thought to be therapeutically necessary.

In [[clinical trials]] of surgical interventions, sham surgery is an important [[scientific control]]. This is because it isolates the specific effects of the treatment as opposed to the incidental effects caused by [[anesthesia]], the [[Surgical incision|incision]]al trauma, pre- and postoperative care, and the patient's perception of having had a regular operation. Thus sham surgery serves an analogous purpose to [[placebo]] drugs, neutralizing biases such as the [[placebo effect]].

==Human research==
A number of studies done under [[Institutional review board|IRB]]-approved settings have delivered important and surprising results. With the progress in [[minimally invasive surgery]], sham procedures can be more easily performed as the sham incision can be kept small similarly to the incision in the studied procedure.

In a number of situations, sham-controlled interventions have identified interventions that are useless but had been believed by the medical community to be helpful based on studies without the use of sham surgery.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/review/042599surgery-ethics-review.html |author=Stolberg SG|publisher=The [[New York Times]] |title=Sham Surgey Returns as a Research Tool| date=April 25, 1999 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=an/&gt;&lt;ref name=moseley/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihvonen"/&gt;

===Examples===

====Cardiovascular diseases====
In 1939 Fieschi introduced [[internal mammary artery|internal mammary]] ligation as a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart. Not until a controlled study was done two decades later could it be demonstrated that the procedure was only as effective as the sham surgery.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cobb LA, Thomas GI, Dillard DH, Merendino KA, Bruce RA |title=An evaluation of internal-mammary-artery ligation by a double-blind technic.| journal=New England Journal of Medicine |pmid=13657350| year=1959| volume=260| issue=22| pages=1115–8| doi=10.1056/NEJM195905282602204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CNS disease====
In neurosurgery, cell-transplant surgical interventions were offered in many centers in the world for patients with [[Parkinson disease]] until sham-controlled experiments involving the drilling of [[Burr (cutter)|burr]] holes into the [[Human skull|skull]] demonstrated such interventions ineffective and possibly harmful.&lt;ref name=an&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim SY, Frank S, Holloway R, Zimmerman C, Wilson R, Kieburtz K |title=Science and Ethics of Sham Surgery. A Survey of Parkinson Disease Clinical Researchers. |journal=Arch Neurol |date=September 2005|pmid=16157742 |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=1357–60 |doi=10.1001/archneur.62.9.1357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, over 90% of surveyed investigators believed that future neurosurgical interventions (i.e. [[gene transfer]] therapies) should be evaluated by sham-controlled studies as these are superior to open-control designs, and have found it unethical to conduct an open-control study because the design is not strong enough to protect against the placebo effect and bias.&lt;ref name=an/&gt; Kim et al. point out that sham procedures can differ significantly in invasiveness, for instance in neurosurgical experiments the investigator may drill a burr hole to the [[dura mater]] only or enter the brain.&lt;ref name=an/&gt; In March 2013 a [http://medicine.buffalo.edu/news_and_events/news.host.html/content/shared/smbs/news/2013/03/ccsvi-ms-2482.detail.html sham surgical study] of a popular but biologically inexplicable venous balloon angioplasty procedure for multiple sclerosis showed the surgery was no better than placebo.

====Orthopedic diseases====
Moseley and coworkers studied the effect of [[arthroscopic surgery]] for [[osteoarthritis]] of the knee establishing two treatment groups and a sham-operated control group.&lt;ref name=moseley&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moseley JB, O'Malley K, Petersen NJ, Menke TJ, Brody BA, Kuykendall DH, Hollingsworth JC, Ashton CM, Wray NP | title=A controlled trial of arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |year=2002 |pmid=12110735 |volume=347 |issue=2 |pages=81–8 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013259}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that patients in the treatment arms did no better than those in the control group. The fact that all three groups improved equally points to the placebo effect in surgical interventions.
In a recent study it was found, that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy does not offer any benefit over sham (or fake) surgery in relieving symptoms of knee locking or catching in patients with degenerative meniscal tears.&lt;ref name="Sihvonen"&gt;Sihvonen R, Englund M, Turkiewicz A, Järvinen TL: Mechanical Symptoms and Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy in Patients With Degenerative Meniscus Tear: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Trial. Ann Intern Med. 2016 Feb 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal research==
Sham surgery has been widely used in surgical animal models. Historically, studies in animals also allowed the removal or alteration of an organ; using sham-operated animals as control, deductions could be made about the function of the organ. Sham interventions can also be performed as controls when new surgical procedures are developed.

'''Strandavatnet''' is a lake in [[Hol]] municipality, [[Norway]]. The lake covers an area of {{convert|23.75|km2|sqmi}}, and lies {{convert|975|m}} above sea level.'
The lake is a reservoir for the Rud hydroelectric powerstation in [[Hovet, Buskerud]]. In 1952/1953 a dam was constructed which lifted the lake level 28 meters, thus the lake varies between 950 and 978 m above sea level.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==First rock filling dam in Norway==
The dam in the Strandavatnet was the first rock filling (embankment) dam in Norway. You can see the dam on your left hand side from FV 50 at Myrland (the road to Raggsteindalen goes over the dam). The Hol 1 power station, in [[Hovet, Buskerud]] utilizes water from two watercourses, Urunda, where Strandavatnet, is the intake reservoir, and Votna where Varaldset is the intake reservoir. Stolsvatnet is the biggest and highest reservoir in the Votna watercourse. See figure below.&lt;ref&gt;E-CO energi{{Incomplete short citation|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abnormal morphology ==
Tumor endothelial cells (TECs) have been documented to demonstrate abnormal morphologic characteristics such as ragged margins and irregular cytoplasmic projections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In normal blood vessels, it is known that endothelial cells form regular monolayers with [[tight junction]]s without overlap, but TECs create disorganized and loosely connected monolayers, often branching and extending across the lumen to overlap with their neighbors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hashizume|first=Hiroya|last2=Baluk|first2=Peter|last3=Morikawa|first3=Shunichi|last4=McLean|first4=John W.|last5=Thurston|first5=Gavin|last6=Roberge|first6=Sylvie|last7=Jain|first7=Rakesh K.|last8=McDonald|first8=Donald M.|date=2017-04-21|title=Openings between Defective Endothelial Cells Explain Tumor Vessel Leakiness|journal=The American Journal of Pathology|volume=156|issue=4|pages=1363–1380|doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65006-7|issn=0002-9440|pmc=1876882|pmid=10751361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tumor endothelium is often described as mosaic due to its aberrant expression of traditional endothelial cell markers ([[CD31]] and [[Endoglin|CD105]]), supporting the existence of irregular gaps between endothelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=di Tomaso|first=Emmanuelle|last2=Capen|first2=Diane|last3=Haskell|first3=Amy|last4=Hart|first4=Janet|last5=Logie|first5=James J.|last6=Jain|first6=Rakesh K.|last7=McDonald|first7=Donald M.|last8=Jones|first8=Rosemary|last9=Munn|first9=Lance L.|date=2005-07-01|title=Mosaic tumor vessels: cellular basis and ultrastructure of focal regions lacking endothelial cell markers|journal=Cancer Research|volume=65|issue=13|pages=5740–5749|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4552|issn=0008-5472|pmid=15994949}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a more macro level, beyond the observation of small intercellular openings between nearby TECs, larger gaps in the walls of tumor blood vessels have been described.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Causes of abnormalities ===
Many tumors are characterized by high expression of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), which is a strong vasodilator. VEGF has been indicated to stimulate sprouting and tip branching in endothelial cells, leading to defective endothelial monolayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nagy|first=Janice A.|last2=Dvorak|first2=Ann M.|last3=Dvorak|first3=Harold F.|date=2007-01-01|title=VEGF-A and the induction of pathological angiogenesis|journal=Annual Review of Pathology|volume=2|pages=251–275|doi=10.1146/annurev.pathol.2.010506.134925|issn=1553-4006|pmid=18039100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research supports that compression of tumor vessels by surrounding tumor cells results in mechanical tension and changes in blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padera|first=Timothy P.|last2=Stoll|first2=Brian R.|last3=Tooredman|first3=Jessica B.|last4=Capen|first4=Diane|last5=di Tomaso|first5=Emmanuelle|last6=Jain|first6=Rakesh K.|date=2004-02-19|title=Pathology: cancer cells compress intratumour vessels|journal=Nature|volume=427|issue=6976|pages=695|doi=10.1038/427695a|issn=1476-4687|pmid=14973470}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that these flow-mediated changes cause abnormal expression of transcription factors which promotes aberrant endothelial morphology, size, and differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Val|first=Sarah|last2=Black|first2=Brian L.|date=2009-02-01|title=Transcriptional control of endothelial cell development|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=16|issue=2|pages=180–195|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.014|issn=1878-1551|pmc=2728550|pmid=19217421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller capillaries are often surrounded by supporting [[pericyte]]s which help with vessel stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirschi|first=K. K.|last2=D'Amore|first2=P.

=== Blood vessel leakiness ===
Where these branched tumor-associated endothelial cells form small gaps in the blood vessel wall, [[Red blood cell|erythrocytes]] often pool and form blood lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van den Brenk|first=H.

=== Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect ===
The increased permeability of tumor-associated endothelial cells permits [[macromolecule]]s to leave the blood system and directly enter the tumor interstitial space.

== Roles in tumor progression ==

=== Angiogenesis ===
The idea of tumors promoting [[angiogenesis]], or the process of forming new blood vessels, has been around since the discovery of VEGF in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=A.

Angiogenesis was originally introduced as a [[The Hallmarks of Cancer|Hallmark of Cancer]] based on assumptions that the underlying processes were similar amongst different tumor types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanahan|first=Douglas|last2=Weinberg|first2=Robert A.|date=2011-03-04|title=Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation|url=http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(11)00127-9|journal=Cell|language=English|volume=144|issue=5|pages=646–674|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013|pmid=21376230|issn=0092-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now multiple studies that illustrate the complexity behind these previous simple conceptions of angiogenesis, indicating that the way cancer cells interact with and co-opt new blood vessel growth varies amongst cancer types and must be studied.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pezzella|first=F|last2=Harris|first2=A L|last3=Tavassoli|first3=M|last4=Gatter|first4=K C|date=2015-12-21|title=Blood vessels and cancer much more than just angiogenesis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/cddiscovery201564|journal=Cell Death Discovery|language=en|volume=1|doi=10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.64|issn=2058-7716|pmc=4979496|pmid=27551488|page=15064}}&lt;/ref&gt; This must be studied in order to improve clinical design strategy and select for patients with tumors that are more likely to benefit from anti-angiogenic drugs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Angiogenesis inhibitors ====
Various angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed to interfere with different steps in the process.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Kristina M.|last2=Figg|first2=William D.|date=2010-07-01|title=Angiogenesis inhibitors: current strategies and future prospects|journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians|volume=60|issue=4|pages=222–243|doi=10.3322/caac.20075|issn=1542-4863|pmc=2919227|pmid=20554717}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bevacizumab]] ([[Avastin]]) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF, preventing the stimulation of the VEGF receptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shih|first=Ted|last2=Lindley|first2=Celeste|date=2006-11-01|title=Bevacizumab: an angiogenesis inhibitor for the treatment of solid malignancies|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1779–1802|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.11.015|issn=0149-2918|pmid=17212999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sorafenib]] and sutinib are additional angiogenesis inhibitors that bind and block receptors on endothelial cells that have important roles in downstream pathways contributing to angiogenesis progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gotink|first=Kristy J.|last2=Verheul|first2=Henk M.

=== Immune suppression ===
Immune therapies depend heavily on the abilities of effector lymphocytes to infiltrate tumors, and the tumor endothelium is a known crucial regulator of T-cell trafficking. The tumor-associated endothelium has been found to be able to function as an immune barrier to [[T cell|T-cells]], inhibiting the effectiveness of immune therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckanovich|first=Ronald J.|last2=Facciabene|first2=Andrea|last3=Kim|first3=Sarah|last4=Benencia|first4=Fabian|last5=Sasaroli|first5=Dimitra|last6=Balint|first6=Klara|last7=Katsaros|first7=Dionysios|last8=O'Brien-Jenkins|first8=Anne|last9=Gimotty|first9=Phyllis A.|date=2008-01-01|title=Endothelin B receptor mediates the endothelial barrier to T cell homing to tumors and disables immune therapy|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v14/n1/full/nm1699.html|journal=Nature Medicine|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=28–36|doi=10.1038/nm1699|pmid=18157142|issn=1078-8956}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tumor-associated endothelial cells have been found to over-express the [[Endothelin receptor type B|endothelin B receptor]], which suppresses T-cell adhesion and targeting to tumors upon activation by ET-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kandalaft|first=Lana E.|last2=Facciabene|first2=Andrea|last3=Buckanovich|first3=Ron J.|last4=Coukos|first4=George|date=2009-07-15|title=Endothelin B Receptor, a New Target in Cancer Immune Therapy|url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/15/14/4521|journal=Clinical Cancer Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=14|pages=4521–4528|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0543|issn=1078-0432|pmc=2896814|pmid=19567593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metastasis ===
The vasculature can promote [[metastasis]] by capturing cancer cells at their primary sites and providing for their delivery to secondary organs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jahroudi|first=N.|last2=Greenberger|first2=J. S.|date=1995-01-01|title=The role of endothelial cells in tumor invasion and metastasis|journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=99–108|issn=0167-594X|pmid=7543941|doi=10.1007/bf01053415}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tumor-associated endothelial cells can also release factors and supply nutrients that promote the growth of the primary tumor mass and its aggressive spread.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, angiogenesis is intimately linked to metastasis, as delivery of nutrients and oxygen through blood vessels is required for invasive tumor growth and spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Folkman|first=Judah|date=2002-12-16|title=Role of angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis|url=http://www.seminoncol.org/article/S0093-7754(02)70065-1/abstract|journal=Seminars in Oncology|language=English|volume=29|issue=6|doi=10.1016/S0093-7754(02)70065-1|issn=0093-7754|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Immunization Week''' is a [[global health|global public health]] campaign to raise awareness and increase rates of immunization against [[vaccine-preventable diseases]] around the world. It takes place each year during last week of April.

Immunization can protect against 25 different infectious agents or diseases, from infancy to old age, including [[diphtheria]], [[measles]], [[pertussis]], [[polio]] and [[tetanus]]. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates active immunization currently averts 2 to 3 million deaths every year. However 22.6 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines, mostly in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/ Immunization coverage.] WHO Fact sheet N° 378, updated February 2014. Accessed 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate immunization coverage rates often result from limited resources, competing health priorities, poor management of [[health systems]] and inadequate surveillance. The goal of World Immunization Week is to raise public awareness of how immunization saves lives, and support people everywhere to get the vaccinations needed against deadly diseases for themselves and their children. 

World Immunization Week sprung out of the efforts taking place across different countries and regions for a week-long immunization awareness commemoration. World Immunization Week is one of eight official campaigns marked by the [[WHO]], along with [[World Health Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]] and [[World AIDS Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/en WHO campaigns.] Accessed 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

* History

[[Image:Poliodrops.jpg|right|thumb|A child being immunized against [[polio]].]]
The [[World Health Assembly]] endorsed World Immunization Week during its May 2012 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/immunization-week/2014/campaign-essentials/en/ World Immunization Week essentials.] Accessed 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Previously, Immunization Week activities were observed on different dates in different regions of the world. Immunization Week was observed simultaneously for the first time in 2012, with the participation of more than 180 countries and territories worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Public Health Association, [http://www.cpha.ca/en/about/digest/xxxvi-1/7.aspx The World’s First “World Immunization Week”.] Accessed 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [https://www.cdc.gov/features/worldimmunizationweek/ World Immunization Week.] Accessed 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Each World Immunization Week focuses on a theme. The themes have included the following:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/immunization-week/2014/en/ World Immunization Week 2014.] Accessed 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/immunization-week/2016/event/en/ World Immunization Week 2016.] Accessed 27 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Štěchovice Reservoir''' (in [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Vodní nádrž Štěchovice'') is a [[dam]] on [[Vltava River]] built from 1937 to 1945 as the second stage of the [[Vltava Cascade]]. The dam is named after nearby village [[Štěchovice]].

The construction started before World War 2 and because of the need for electricity resources were allocated for the project in spite of general shortage. The power station was put in action in 1943. The reservoir had flooded [[St John's Rapids]] (''Svatojánské proudy''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svatojanske-proudy.cz/&lt;/ref&gt;), the most dangerous but romantic part of Vltava.

The main role of the reservoir is to balance the water runoff from peak-load power station at [[Slapy Dam]] and to propel two [[Kaplan turbine]]s with total installed power 2 x 11.25 [[Megawatt|MW]] (Štěchovice I). A [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] (20.1 m difference between water levels, length 118 m) handles ships with [[Displacement (fluid)|displacement]] up to 1,000 tons.

The reservoir is also used by the [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage hydroelectric plant]] Štěchovice II whose upper reservoir was created on the top of hill Homole. The plant was set in operation in 1947 and closed in 1991 due to obsolescence. From 1992 to 1996 a new hydroelectric plant using the reservoirs was built. This plant uses reverse [[Francis turbine]] with power 45 MW.

During [[2002 European floods|2002 floods]] the turbines of both power plants were severely damaged. After overhaul the plants were put back in production in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
