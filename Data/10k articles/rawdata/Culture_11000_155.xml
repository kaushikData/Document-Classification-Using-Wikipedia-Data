      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">The '''3D Print Canal House''' is a three-year, publicly accessible "Research &amp; Design by Doing" project in which an international team of partners from various sectors works together on [[3D printing]] a [[canal house]] in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/491666/first-3d-printed-house-to-be-built-in-amsterdam|title=First 3D Printed House to Be Built In Amsterdam|work=ArchDaily|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By building the house, all parties research the possibilities of 3D printing architecture and form connections between design, science, culture, building, software, communities and the city.  The project serves as both an exhibition of 3D printing technology, as well as a research site into 3D printing architecture. The project is initiated by DUS architects and the site, in Amsterdam North, opened to the public on March 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opp.today/how-3d-printing-by-robots-is-set-to-transform-building/|title=OPP.Today - How 3D printing by robots is set to transform building|work=OPP.Today|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/architecture/the-printed-house-coming-soon/article24432799/|title=The printed house, coming soon: Futurists see 3-D technology radically changing the way houses are built|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kamermaker ==
The house is constructed by a [[fused deposition modeling]] printer developed by DUS: the Kamermaker ("Room builder"), able to print elements of up to 2.2×2.2×3.5 metres. It is a movable pavilion with the size of a shipping container. The machine itself is 6 meters tall. The Kamermaker can be moved by truck or by ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/what-to-do/attractions-and-sights/overview-of-attractions/3d-print-canal-house|title=3D Print Canal House|work=iamsterdam.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">The '''ASPRO chronology''' is a nine-period dating system of the ancient [[Near East]] used by the [[Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée]] for [[archaeological]] sites aged between 14,000 and 5,700 BP.&lt;ref name="Hours1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Hours|title=Atlas des sites du proche orient (14000 - 5700 BP)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlZtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 July 2011|year=1994|publisher=Maison de l'Orient méditerranéen|isbn=978-2-903264-53-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASPRO : Atlas des Sites du Proche-Orient|url=http://www.mom.fr/ressources-numeriques/bases-de-donnees/ASPRO|website=MAISON DE L'ORIENT ET DE LA MÉDITERRANÉE JEAN POUILLOUX|accessdate=25 September 2016|ref=MOM.FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASPRO stands for the "Atlas des sites du Proche-Orient" (Atlas of Near East archaeological sites), a French publication pioneered by [[Francis Hours]] and developed by other scholars such as [[Olivier Aurenche]].

The periods, [[archaeological culture|cultures]], features and date ranges of the original ASPRO chronology are shown below:

{| align="center" class="wikitable"

In 2001, the institute revised the chronology of the first six periods based on newer carbon data and calibration curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Auranche | first=O | title=Proto-neolithic and Neolithic Cultures in the Middle East — the Birth of Agriculture, Livestock Raining, and Ceramics: a Calibrated 14C Chronology 12,500–5500 cal BC | journal=Radiocarbon | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=1191–1202 | year=2001 | url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/PDF/RadioCarbon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Period 3 an early and late phase could be distinguished, but Periods 4 and 5 were merged. Overall they found more overlap in time between different cultural phases between different sites.

'''Alternative modeling''' is a branch of the [[Model (profession)|modeling]] industry that features models who do not [[Conformity|conform]] to mainstream [[Ideals of Beauty|ideals of beauty.]] Alternative models are often [[niche market|niche]]-specific, with a personal style that represents subcultures like [[goth subculture|goth]], [[Steampunk fashion|steampunk]], and [[fetishism]]. An alternative model may, for example, be [[tattoo]]ed, [[Body piercings|pierced]], or have other [[body modification]]s, have distinctively subcultural hair such as being [[Shaved head|shaved]], dyed a distinctively unnatural color, or styled into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] or [[dreadlocks]]. Alternative modeling can be clothed or [[Nude (art)|unclothed]]. 

Alternative modeling was given substantial mainstream media coverage in the last decade, partly through the creation and popularization of community-based alternative modeling paysites, like [[GodsGirls]] and [[SuicideGirls]]. Alternative modeling community sites usually promote their models for their personality as well as for their looks and portfolio.

Examples of alternative models are Jéssica Veneno from Brasil and Dany Divine from London.

==Markets==
Alternative models are often employed to promote niche products, either in shops or online, particular subcultural clothing shops and websites.

[[File:Blenheim Palace (6092890723).jpg|thumb|220px|Blenheim Palace]]
[[Blenheim Palace]] has frequently been the setting for books, TV programs and films and other events presumably enjoyed by the paying public. These include:

[[architecture|Architectural]] [[history|historian]] [[Dan Cruickshank]] selected the Palace as one of his four choices for the 2002 [[BBC]] [[television]] [[documentary series]] ''[[Britain's Best Buildings]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/programme_archive/best_buildings_05.shtml | title=Choosing Britain's Best Buildings | accessdate = 2008-06-03| author= | last=Cruickshank | first=Dan | authorlink= | coauthors= | date= | year= | month= | work= | publisher=BBC History | pages= | doi= | archiveurl= | archivedate= | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blenheim Horse Trials]] is an annual [[three-day event]] rated [[Concours Complet International|CCI***]] (the second highest level of eventing), and Blenheim hosted the [[European Eventing Championships]] in 2005.

The [[Wakestock 2008]] music and wakeboarding festival took place at the front of Blenheim Palace in June 2008

A number of sources also credit the Berlin book-burning rally in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' as having been filmed at Blenheim Palace. However, these scenes were actually filmed at [[Stowe School]] in Buckinghamshire.

=== Other film-based media ===
The Roman Style Bridge features in synthpop band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark|OMD]]'s music video for their 1981 single, ''[[Souvenir (song)|Souvenir]].'' Other parts of the video show band member [[Andy McCluskey]] driving his [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]] through the grounds.

=== Other media ===
The [[BBC Radio Four]] programme ''[[Just a Minute]]'' was recorded (twice) at Blenheim with [[Clement Freud]], [[Derek Nimmo]], [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] and [[Kit Hesketh-Harvey]]. They were broadcast in 1998.

==Blenheim in fiction==
* The setting for [[T. H. White]]'s novel ''Mistress Masham's Repose'' is a huge, ruined estate called Malplaquet. While this is an obvious parody of Blenheim Palace, it is also related to the landscape, architecture and local geography of Stowe School where T.H. White taught for many years.
* In [[Neil Simon]]'s play [[Brighton Beach Memoirs]], (and the film adaptation), Eugene mentions "Blenheim Castle" in the dinner scene.
* There is a scene in a partially finished Blenheim Palace in ''[[The System of the World (novel)|The System of the World]]'', the last volume of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s [[Baroque Cycle]]. [[John Churchill]] also plays a prominent role in the last book.
*Blenheim Palace, the [[Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough|9th Duke]], [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]] and [[Gladys Deacon]] feature prominently in [[Robin Paige]]'s novel ''Death at Blenheim Palace''.

== Blenheim in art ==
American musician Barry Manilow performed a concert for over 40,000 fans on the grounds of the Palace on August 27, 1983.  The recorded concert was released on VHS and later on DVD as "Barry Manilow: The Concert at Blenheim Palace."

The British painter [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] (1903–1992) was commissioned to paint scenes in the grounds of the palace during the 1980s. In 2012, an exhibition of the artist's work entitled ''John Piper at Blenheim Palace'' was held in a room at the palace to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Piper's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=John Piper: Blenheim Palace | publisher=[[Blenheim Palace]] | author=Bapasola, Jeri | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-9502344-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, British jazz-pop pianist [[Jamie Cullum]] released "Live at Blenheim Palace," a 145-minute live concert [[DVD]] of his performance at the Blenheim Palace Music Festival on 1 July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jamie-Cullum-Live-Blenheim-Palace/dp/B0002IO9P2 Amazon.com listing], "Jamie Cullum – Live at Blenheim Palace [DVD] (2004)", retrieved 25 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist/music/detail.aspx?pid=11102&amp;aid=6099 Verve Music Group artist/item page], "Jamie Cullum – Live At Blenheim Palace [DVD]", retrieved 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/features/2004/07/blenheim_music_fest.shtml BBC page for 2004 Blenheim Palace Music Festival], retrieved 25 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chronopolis''''' is a 1983 [[science fiction film]] directed by Polish animator [[Piotr Kamler]] with music composed by [[Luc Ferrari]] and narration by [[Michael Lonsdale]]. It was Kamler's first and only full-length film. The film won "Best Children's Film" at [[Fantafestival]] in 1982 and "Critics' Award - Special Mention" at [[Fantasporto]]. The film was shown out of competition at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1676/year/1982.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Chronopolis |accessdate=2009-06-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Chronopolis tells the story of a gargantuan city lurking in the sky colonized by powerful immortals who have become jaded with eternal life. Most of their time is spent monotonously constructing bizarre and unusual objects while waiting for the ultimate gift to arrive in their hands.

==Production==
With a grant under $400,000 from the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel of Paris and Centre National du Cinema, Piotr Kamler completed the film within a five-year period from 1977 to 1982. Most of the animation and CGI he accomplished on his own. Kamler openly admitted that the script he provided to obtain his funding had nothing to do with his original concept. Only after building the characters and set did the film's "story" take shape.

There exists two versions of the film. The original 1982 version runs at 66 minutes and was released in North America through a company in Boston. The official and final cut, re-released in 1988, has 14 minutes of footage taken out leaving it at 52 minutes. Within that version:

*All of the narration is omitted
*The scene where the explorer flies around the giants is cut
*Additional dancing between the explorer and the ball was taken out
*The ending is cut by 10 minutes which includes extra scenes of the immortals and both the ball and the explorer leaving Chronopolis.

'''''{{lang|fr|Cinq à sept}}''''' ({{small|French:}} {{IPAc-fr|s|in|q|à|s|è|t}}, literally 'five to seven') is a French term for activities taking place after work (sometime with late work as a cover up), and before returning home or having dinner (roughly between 5 and 7&amp;nbsp;p.m.). 
It may also be written as ''{{lang|fr|5 à 7}}'' or 5@7. 

=== Quebec French === 
In [[Quebec French]], the term stands for a social gathering.  It may bring together friends or colleagues or may be organized around a specific event, such as a book launch or [[vernissage]].  Wine, beer, and cocktails are served along with finger foods and other [[hors d'oeuvres]]. Such a party held later may be named for the specific time (e.g. ''{{lang|fr|six à huit}}).''

A ''{{lang|fr|cinq à sept}}'' can be a formal gathering held in a wide range of public and private spaces, such as [[art galleries]], [[University]] campuses, and places of work, but it is also commonly used more informally as a promotion in [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s to attract patrons.&lt;ref&gt;http://montreal.about.com/od/montreal-words-expressions/qt/5-a-7-montreal-happy-hour-expressions-french-quebec-words.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The English equivalent might be a "wine and cheese" gathering in the more formal usage or "[[happy hour]]" in the informal usage.

=== In France ===
''{{lang|fr|Cinq à sept}}'' originally referred to a time for a [[wikt:tryst|tryst]], and consequently a [[metonymy]] for visit to one's mistress, an [[Extramarital sex|affair]], and the mistress (or lover) involved. It derived from the time of day French men would make such a visit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843018,00.html "Love in the Afternoon," Time Magazine, November 11, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still commonly considered today as the moment of the day to meet one's mistress or lover, and the term is understood with a sexual content (as opposed to Quebec habit).

[[Image:Smith Family clothing bin.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Smith Family clothing bins at the [[Duffy, Australian Capital Territory|Duffy]] [[shopping centre]] in [[Canberra, Australia]]. These bins have been vandalised, and have had [[rubbish]] placed outside them.]]

A '''clothing bin''' is a [[wikt:container|container]] in which [[clothing]] is placed to be donated to [[Charitable organization|charity]] organizations (e.g., the [[Salvation Army]] or [[The Smith Family (charity)|The Smith Family]]) or for [[recycling]] in other ways. They are typically provided by the charities themselves or by [[local authorities]]. 

Bins are often [[vandalised]] or filled with unsuitable materials (including [[rubbish]]). These are costly for the organizations concerned to dispose of, and this misuse has at times lead to bins being withdrawn. On-the-spot [[fine (penalty)|fines]] are often threatened through [[sign]]s on the bins.

{{Culture of Japan}}
The culture of [[Japan]] has evolved greatly over the millennia, from the country's prehistoric time [[Jōmon period]], to its contemporary modern culture, which absorbs influences from Asia, Europe, and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Japan's Open Future: An Agenda for Global Citizenship  |last=Haffner |first=John  |last2=Klett |first2=Tomas |last3=Lehmann |first3=Jean-Pierre |publisher=Anthem Press  |year=2009 |isbn=978-1843313113 |pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong Chinese influences are still evident in traditional Japanese culture as China had historically been a regional powerhouse, which has resulted in Japan absorbing many elements of Chinese culture first through [[Korean influence on Japanese culture|Korea]], then later through direct cultural exchanges during China's [[Japanese missions to Sui China|Sui]] and [[Japanese missions to Tang China|Tang]] dynasties. The inhabitants of Japan experienced a [[Sakoku|long period of relative isolation from the outside world]] during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] after [[Japanese missions to Imperial China]], until the arrival of the "[[Black Ships]]" and the [[Meiji period]]. Today, the culture of Japan stands as one of the leading and most prominent cultures around the world, mainly due to the global reach of its [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=How Japan became a pop culture superpower |magazine=The Spectator|date=31 January 2015|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/01/how-japan-became-a-pop-culture-superpower/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamaki|first1=Taku|title=Japan has turned its culture into a powerful political tool|website=The Conversation|url=http://theconversation.com/japan-has-turned-its-culture-into-a-powerful-political-tool-72821|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Japanese language|Japanese dialects}}
[[File:Genryaku Manyosyu.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Page from the Man'yōshū|A page from the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'', the oldest anthology of classical [[Japanese poetry]]]]
Japanese is the official and primary language of Japan. Japanese has a lexically distinct [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch-accent system]]. Early Japanese is known largely on the basis of its state in the 8th century, when the three major works of [[Old Japanese]] were compiled. The earliest attestation of the Japanese language is in a Chinese document from 252 AD.

Japanese is written with a combination of three scripts: [[hiragana]], derived from the Chinese cursive script, [[katakana]], derived as a shorthand from Chinese characters, and [[kanji]], imported from China. The [[Latin alphabet]], [[Romanization of Japanese|rōmaji]], is also often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names and logos, advertising, and when inputting Japanese into a computer. The [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu-Arabic numerals]] are generally used for numbers, but traditional [[Japanese numerals|Sino-Japanese numerals]] are also very common.

==Literature==
{{Main|Japanese literature}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}

Early works of Japanese literature were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and [[Chinese literature]], often written in [[Classical Chinese]]. [[Indian literature]] also had an influence through the spread of [[Buddhism]] throughout Japan. Eventually, Japanese literature developed into a separate style in its own right as Japanese writers began writing their own works about Japan. Since Japan reopened its ports to Western trading and diplomacy in the 19th century, Western and Eastern literature have strongly affected each other and continue to do so.

==Music==

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}

The music of Japan includes a wide array of performers in distinct styles both [[Folk music|traditional]] and [[20th-century music|modern]]. The word for music in Japanese is 音楽 (ongaku), combining the [[kanji]] 音 "on" (sound) with the kanji 楽 "gaku" (enjoyment).&lt;ref&gt;Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan is the second largest [[Music industry|music market]] in the world, behind the United States, and the largest in Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2008/02/26/buble-winehouse-nickelback-biz-media-cx_lh_0226foreign.html|title=America's Top Pop Imports|publisher=Forbes|date=26 February 2008|accessdate=2010-09-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303004419/http://www.forbes.com/business/2008/02/26/buble-winehouse-nickelback-biz-media-cx_lh_0226foreign.html|archivedate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the [[Market (economics)|market]] is dominated by [[List of Japanese artists|Japanese artists]]. {{Citation needed|date = September 2010}}

Local music often appears at [[karaoke]] venues, which is on lease from the [[record label]]s.

===Painting===

{{Main|Japanese painting}}
Painting has been an art in Japan for a very long time: the brush is a traditional writing and painting tool, and the extension of that to its use as an artist's tool was probably natural.  Japanese painters are often categorized by what they painted, as most of them constrained themselves solely to subjects such as animals, landscapes, or figures.  Chinese [[papermaking]] was introduced to Japan around the 7th century. Later, [[washi]] was developed from it. Native Japanese painting techniques are still in use today, as well as techniques adopted from continental Asia and from the [[Western world|West]].  Schools of painting such as the Kano school of the 16th century became known for their bold brush strokes and contrast between light and dark, especially after [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] began to use this style.  Famous Japanese painters include [[Kanō Sanraku]], [[Maruyama Ōkyo]], and [[Tani Bunchō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Laws of Japanese Painting|last = Bowie|first = Henry P.|publisher = Dover Publications, Inc.|year = 1952|isbn = |location = |pages = 4, 16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calligraphy===
{{Main|Japanese calligraphy}}
The flowing, brush-drawn Japanese rendering of text itself is seen as a traditional art form as well as a means of conveying written information. The written work can consist of phrases, poems, stories, or even single characters. The style and format of the writing can mimic the subject matter, even to the point of texture and stroke speed. In some cases, it can take over one hundred attempts to produce the desired effect of a single character but the process of creating the work is considered as much an art as the end product itself.

This calligraphy form is known as 'shodō' (書道) which literally means 'the way of writing or calligraphy' or more commonly known as 'shūji' (習字) 'learning how to write characters'.
Commonly confused with Calligraphy is the art form known as 'sumi-e' (墨絵) literally means 'ink painting' which is the art of painting a scene or object.

===Sculpture===
[[File:NaraTodaijiStatue0214.jpg|thumb|right|Guardian in [[Tōdai-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]]]
{{Main|Japanese sculpture}}
Traditional Japanese sculptures mainly focused on [[Buddhist]] images, such as [[Tathagata]], [[Bodhisattva]], and [[Myō-ō]]. The oldest sculpture in Japan is a wooden statue of [[Amitābha]] at the [[Zenkō-ji]] temple. In the [[Nara period]], Buddhist statues were made by the national government to boost its prestige. These examples are seen in present-day [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]], most notably a colossal bronze statue of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] [[Vairocana]] in the [[Tōdai-ji]] temple.

Wood has traditionally been used as the chief material in Japan, along with traditional [[Japanese architecture]]. Statues are often [[lacquered]], [[Gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted, although there are little traces on the surfaces. Bronze and other metals are not used. Other materials, such as [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[pottery]], have had extremely important roles in the plebeian beliefs.

===Ukiyo-e===
{{Main|Ukiyo-e}}
Ukiyo-e, literally "pictures of the floating world", is a genre of [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]] that exemplifies the characteristics of pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] Japanese art. Because these prints could be mass-produced, they were available to a wide cross-section of the Japanese populace — those not wealthy enough to afford original paintings — during their heyday, from the 17th to 20th century.

===Ikebana===
{{Main|Ikebana}}
{{Nihongo|Ikebana|生け花, 活花, or 挿花}} is the Japanese art of flower arrangement. It has gained widespread international fame for its focus on harmony, color use, rhythm, and elegantly simple design. It is an art centered greatly on expressing the seasons, and is meant to act as a symbol to something greater than the flower itself.

==Religion==
[[File:Japan-1454396 640.jpg|thumb|Torii entrance gate at Kamigamo shrine, Kyoto]]
[[Shintoism]] and [[Buddhism]] are the primary religions of Japan.

=== Shintoism ===
{{Main|Shinto}}Shintoism is an ethnic religion that focuses on ceremonies and rituals. In Shintoism, followers believe that [[kami]], a Shinto deity or spirit, are present throughout nature, including rocks, trees, and mountains. Humans can also be considered to possess a kami. One of the goals of Shintoism is to maintain a connection between humans, nature, and kami. The religion developed in Japan prior to the sixth century CE, after which point followers built [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] to worship kami.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions|title=Japanese Religions|last=Watt|first=Paul|date=October 2003|website=FSI {{!}} SPICE|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Buddhism|Buddhism in Japan}}[[File:Buddha-830916 640.jpg|thumb|Buddha sculpture]]Buddhism developed in India around the 6th and 4th centuries BCE and eventually spread through China and Korea. It arrived in Japan during the 6th century CE, where it was initially unpopular. Most Japanese people were unable to understand the difficult philosophical messages present in Buddhism, however they did have an appreciation for the religion's art, which is believed to have led to the religion growing more popular. Buddhism is concerned with the soul and life after dying. In the religion a person's status was unimportant, as every person would get sick, age, die, and eventually be reincarnated into a new life, a cycle called [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]. The suffering people experienced during life was one way for people to gain a better future. The ultimate goal was to escape the cycle of death and rebirth by attaining true insight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Performing arts==
{{Main|Theatre of Japan}}
[[File:春日神社ー篠山ー翁奉納P1011774.jpg|thumb|[[Noh]] play at traditional Noh theatre]]
The four traditional theatres from Japan are ''[[noh]]'' (or ''nō''), ''[[kyōgen]]'', ''[[kabuki]]'', and ''[[bunraku]]''. Noh had its origins in the union of the ''[[sarugaku]]'', with music and dance made by [[Kanami]] and [[Zeami Motokiyo]].&lt;ref name="noh"&gt;{{cite web| last =Web| first = Japan| authorlink =| title = Japan Fact Sheet| work = Noh and Kyogen: The world's oldest living theater| publisher =| url = http://web-japan.org/factsheet/pdf/NOANDKYO.pdf| format = PDF| doi = | accessdate = 1 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409123933/http://web-japan.org/factsheet/pdf/NOANDKYO.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the characteristic aspects of it are the masks, costumes, and the stylized gestures, sometimes accompanied by a [[Fan (implement)|fan]] that can represent other objects. The ''noh'' programs are presented in alternation with the ones of ''kyōgen'', traditionally in number of five, but currently in groups of three.

The ''kyōgen'', of humorous character, had older origin, in 8th century entertainment brought from China, developing itself in ''sarugaku''. In ''kyōgen'', masks are rarely used and even if the plays can be associated with the ones of noh, currently many are not.&lt;ref name="noh" /&gt;

''Kabuki'' appears in the beginning of the [[Edo period]] from the representations and dances of [[Izumo no Okuni]] in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name="kabuki"&gt;{{cite web| last =Web| first = Japan| authorlink =| title = Japan Fact Sheet| work = Kabuki: A vibrant and exciting traditional theater| publisher =| url = http://web-japan.org/factsheet/pdf/KABUKI.pdf| format = PDF| doi = | accessdate = 1 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409123948/http://web-japan.org/factsheet/pdf/KABUKI.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to prostitution of actresses of ''kabuki'', the participation of women in the plays was forbidden by the government in 1629, and the feminine characters had passed to be represented only by men (''[[onnagata]]''). Recent attempts to reintroduce actresses in ''kabuki'' had not been well accepted.&lt;ref name="kabuki" /&gt; Another characteristic of kabuki is the use of makeup for the actors in historical plays (''[[kumadori]]'').

Japanese puppet theater ''bunraku'' developed in the same period, that ''kabuki'' in a competition and contribution relation involving actors and authors. The origin of ''bunraku'', however is older, lies back in the [[Heian period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Web| first = Japan| authorlink =| title = Japan Fact Sheet| work = Bunraku: Puppet theater brings old Japan to life| publisher =| url = http://web-japan.org/factsheet/pdf/BUNRAKU.pdf| format = PDF| doi = | accessdate = 1 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409123942/http://web-japan.org/factsheet/pdf/BUNRAKU.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, appeared the [[Takarazuka Revue]] a company solely composed by women who introduced the [[revue]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kageki.hankyu.co.jp/english/history.html |title=Takarazuka History |publisher=[[Takarazuka Revue]] |accessdate=1 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225043432/http://kageki.hankyu.co.jp/english/history.html |archivedate=25 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Horyu-ji45s2s4500.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hōryū-ji]] is widely known to be the oldest wooden architecture existing in the world.]]
{{Main|Japanese architecture}}
Japanese architecture has as long of a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture. Originally heavily influenced by [[Chinese architecture]], it has developed many differences and aspects which are indigenous to Japan. Examples of traditional architecture are seen at [[Buddhist temple (Japan)|temples]], [[Jinja (Shinto)|Shinto shrines]], and [[Japanese castle|castles]] in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Some of these buildings are constructed with [[Japanese garden|traditional gardens]], which are influenced from [[Zen]] ideas.

Some modern architects, such as [[Yoshio Taniguchi]] and [[Tadao Ando]] are known for their amalgamation of Japanese traditional and Western architectural influences.

==Gardens==
{{Main|Japanese garden}}
[[File:Ritsurin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ritsurin Garden]]]]
Garden architecture is as important as building architecture and very much influenced by the same historical and religious background. A primary design principle of a garden is the creation of the landscape based on, or at least greatly influenced by, the three-dimensional monochrome ink ([[Inkstick|''sumi'']]) landscape painting, ''sumi-e'' or ''suibokuga''.

In Japan, the garden has the status of artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kuitert | first = Wybe | title =  Themes, Scenes and Taste in the History of Japanese Garden Art. | publisher = J.C.Gieben, Publisher, Amsterdam | year = 1988 |isbn =978-90-5063-021-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional clothing==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
{{Main|Kimono}}
[[File:Stylish person at Fukuoka City Hall.jpg|thumb|Woman in kimono at Fukuoka City Hall.]]
Traditional Japanese clothing distinguishes Japan from all other countries around the world. The Japanese word [[kimono]] means "something one wears" and they are the traditional garments of Japan. Originally, the word kimono was used for all types of clothing, but eventually, it came to refer specifically to the full-length garment also known as the naga-gi, meaning "long-wear", that is still worn today on special occasions by women, men, and children.  The earliest kimonos were heavily influenced by traditional Han Chinese clothing, known today as hanfu (漢服, kanfuku in Japanese), through Japanese embassies to China which resulted in extensive Chinese culture adoptions by Japan, as early as the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name="Dalby, Liza 2001"&gt;Dalby, Liza (2001). Kimono: Fashioning Culture. Seattle: University of Washington Press. {{ISBN|9780295981550}}. OCLC 46793052.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the 8th century, however, that Chinese fashions came into style among the Japanese, and the overlapping collar became particularly women's fashion.&lt;ref name="Dalby, Liza 2001"/&gt; Kimono in this meaning plus all other items of traditional Japanese clothing is known collectively as wafuku which means "Japanese clothes" as opposed to yofuku (Western-style clothing). Kimonos come in a variety of colors, styles, and sizes. Men mainly wear darker or more muted colors, while women tend to wear brighter colors and pastels, and, especially for younger women, often with complicated abstract or floral patterns.

The kimono of a woman who is married ([[tomesode]]) differs from the kimono of a woman who is not married ([[furisode]]). The tomesode sets itself apart because the patterns do not go above the waistline. The furisode can be recognized by its extremely long sleeves spanning anywhere from 39 to 42&amp;nbsp;inches, it is also the most formal kimono an unwed woman wears. The furisode advertises that a woman is not only of age but also single.

The style of kimono also changes with the season, in spring kimonos are vibrantly colored with springtime flowers embroidered on them. In Autumn, kimono colors are not as bright, with Autumn patterns. Flannel kimonos are most commonly worn in winter; they are made of a heavier material and are worn mainly to stay warm.

One of the more elegant kimonos is the [[Kimono#Uchikake|uchikake]], a long silk overgarment worn by the bride in a wedding ceremony. The uchikake is commonly embellished with birds or flowers using silver and gold thread.

Kimonos do not come in specific sizes as most western dresses do. The sizes are only approximate, and a special technique is used to fit the dress appropriately.

The [[Obi (sash)|obi]] is a very important part of the kimono. Obi is a decorative sash that is worn by Japanese men and women, although it can be worn with many different traditional outfits, it is most commonly worn with the kimono. Most women wear a very large elaborate obi, while men typically don a more thin and conservative obi.

Most Japanese men only wear the kimono at home or in a very laid back environment, however it is acceptable for a man to wear the kimono when he is entertaining guests in his home. For a more formal event a Japanese man might wear the [[haori]] and [[hakama]], a half coat and divided skirt. The [[hakama]] is tied at the waist, over the kimono and ends near the ankle. Hakama were initially intended for men only, but today it is acceptable for women to wear them as well. Hakama can be worn with types of kimono, excluding the summer version, [[yukata]]. The lighter and simpler casual-wear version of kimono often worn in Japanese summer festival is called yukata.

Formal kimonos are typically worn in several layers, with number of layers, visibility of layers, sleeve length, and choice of pattern dictated by social status, season, and the occasion for which the kimono is worn. Because of the mass availability, most Japanese people wear western style clothing in their everyday life, and kimonos are mostly worn for festivals, and special events. As a result, most young women in Japan are not able to put the kimono on themselves. Many older women offer classes to teach these young women how to don the traditional clothing.

[[Happi]] is another type of traditional clothing, but it is not famous worldwide like the kimono. A happi (or happy coat) is a straight sleeved coat that is typically imprinted with the family crest, and was a common coat for firefighters to wear.

Japan also has very distinct footwear.

[[Tabi]], an ankle high sock, is often worn with the kimono. Tabi are designed to be worn with geta, a type of thonged footwear. [[Geta (footwear)|Geta]] are sandals mounted on wooden blocks held to the foot by a piece of fabric that slides between the toes. Geta are worn both by men and women with the kimono or yukata.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Breakfast at Tamahan Ryokan, Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional breakfast at ryokan]]
{{Main|Japanese cuisine}}
Through a long culinary past, the Japanese have developed sophisticated and refined [[cuisine]]. In more recent years, Japanese food has become fashionable and popular in the United States, Europe, and many other areas. Dishes such as [[sushi]], [[tempura]], [[Japanese noodles|noodles]], and [[teriyaki]] are some of the foods that are commonly known.  The Japanese diet consists principally of rice; fresh, lean seafood; and pickled or boiled vegetables.

[[File:剣魂 広島大学体育会剣道部 2005 (9014981997).jpg|thumb|Two students practicing [[kendo]] at Hiroshima University]]
{{Main|Sport in Japan}}
In the long feudal period governed by the [[samurai]] class, some methods that were used to train warriors were developed into well-ordered martial arts, in modern times referred to collectively as [[koryū]]. Examples include [[kenjutsu]], [[kendo]], [[kyūdō]], [[sōjutsu]], [[jujutsu]], and [[sumo]], all of which were established in the [[Edo period]]. After the rapid social change in the [[Meiji Restoration]], some martial arts changed into modern sports, called [[gendai budō]]. [[Judo]] was developed by [[Kanō Jigorō]], who studied some sects of jujutsu. These sports are still widely practiced in present-day Japan and other countries.

[[Baseball]], [[Association football]], and other popular western sports were imported to Japan in the [[Meiji period]]. These sports are commonly practiced in schools, along with traditional martial arts.

Baseball, soccer, football, and ping pong are the most popular sports in Japan. Association football gained prominence in Japan after the J League ([[Japan Professional Football League]]) was established in 1991. Japan also co-hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. In addition, there are many semi-professional organizations, which are sponsored by private companies: for example, volleyball, basketball, [[rugby union]], table tennis, and so on.

==Popular culture==
{{Main|Japanese popular culture}}
[[File:Vagabond21.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Miyamoto Musashi|Musashi Miyamoto]] in ''[[Vagabond (manga)|Vagabond]]'' by [[Takehiko Inoue]], adapted from an [[Eiji Yoshikawa]]'s novel, ''[[Musashi (novel)|Musashi]]'']]
[[Japanese popular culture]] not only reflects the attitudes and concerns of the present day, but also provides a link to the past. Popular films, television programs, [[manga]], music, [[anime]] and [[video games]] all developed from older artistic and literary traditions, and many of their themes and styles of presentation can be traced to traditional art forms. Contemporary forms of popular culture, much like the traditional forms, provide not only entertainment but also an escape for the contemporary Japanese from the problems of an industrial world.

When asked how they spent their leisure time, 80 percent of a sample of men and women surveyed by the government in 1986 said they averaged about two and a half hours per weekday watching television, listening to the radio, and reading [[newspapers]] or [[magazines]]. Some 16 percent spent an average of two and a quarter hours a day engaged in hobbies or amusements. Others spent leisure time participating in sports, socializing, and personal study. Teenagers and retired people reported more time spent on all of these activities than did other groups.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Many [[anime]] and [[manga]] are very popular around the world and continue to become popular, as well as Japanese video games,  fashion, and game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ "Cool Japan: Why Japanese remakes are so popular on American TV, and where we’re getting it wrong"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915232726/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ |date=15 September 2008 }}. [[AsianWeek]]. Retrieved on 2008-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, the family was the focus of leisure activities, such as excursions to parks or shopping districts. Although Japan is often thought of as a hard-working society with little time for leisure, the Japanese seek entertainment wherever they can. It is common to see Japanese commuters riding the train to work, enjoying their favorite [[manga]], or listening through earphones to the latest in [[popular music]] on portable music players.

A wide variety of types of popular entertainment are available. There is a large selection of music, films, and the products of a huge comic book industry, among other forms of entertainment, from which to choose. Game centers, bowling alleys, and [[karaoke]] are popular hangout places for teens while older people may play [[shogi]] or [[Go (board game)|go]] in specialized parlors.

Together, the publishing, film/video, music/audio, and game industries in Japan make up the growing Japanese content industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaj.org/ |title=Digital Content Association Of Japan |publisher=Dcaj.org |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National character==
{{Main|Nihonjinron}}
[[File:Culture Map 2017.png|thumb|300px|Cultural map of the world according to the [[World Values Survey]], describing Japan as highest in the world in "Secular-Rational Values"]]
The Japanese "national character" has been written about under the term ''Nihonjinron'', literally meaning "theories/discussions about the Japanese people" and referring to texts on matters that are normally the concerns of [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[History of Japan|history]], [[linguistics]], and [[philosophy]], but emphasizing the authors' assumptions or perceptions of Japanese exceptionalism; these are predominantly written in Japan by Japanese people,&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Dale, ''The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness'' (London: Routledge, 1990; {{ISBN|0-415-05534-2}}), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; though noted examples have also been written by foreign residents, journalists and even scholars.

'''[[Libya]]''' is a [[North Africa]]n country along the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is bordered by [[Egypt]] to the east, [[Sudan]] to the southeast, [[Chad]] and [[Niger]] to the south, and [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] to the west. The Libyan culture is a blend of many influences, due to its exposure to many historical eras. Its culture involves roots in Berber, African, Turkish and Arab cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =|first =|date =|title =Culture and Art|url =http://www.weforum.org/en/Communities/Women%20Leaders%20and%20Gender%20Parity/GenderGapNetwork/index.htm|journal =Social Overview|doi =|pmid =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20101203061713/http://www.weforum.org/en/Communities/Women%20Leaders%20and%20Gender%20Parity/GenderGapNetwork/index.htm|archivedate =2010-12-03|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libya was also an Italian colony for about three decades, which had a great impact on the culture. Libya has managed to keep its traditional folk culture alive to today.

Most Libyans are Berber and Arab, and 96.6% are Muslim Sunnis. Languages spoken in Libya include Arabic, Berber, Italian and English.

90% of the country is desert and that is the reason that only 10% of Libya’s population lives outside the coastline region.

== Flag ==
[[File:Flag of Libya.svg|thumb|right|[[Flag of Libya]]]]
Flag: In February 2011, when the Libyan revolution took place, the national Transition Council reintroduced the old flag used by the kingdom prior to Gaddafi’s military coup in 1969.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Witherbee, Amy. "Libya."&amp;nbsp;''Our World: Libya''&amp;nbsp;(2015): 1.&amp;nbsp;''MasterFILE Premier''. Web. 21 Feb. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; The flag consists of three colors, red, black and green, which represent the three major regions of the country, red for Fezzan, Black for Cyrenaica and green for Tripolitania; the crescent and star represent the main religion of Libya, Islam.

==Literature==
{{Main|Libyan literature}}
Libyan literature has its roots in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], but contemporary writing from [[Libya]] draws on a variety of influences.

Libyan poet [[Khaled Mattawa]] remarks:
:''"Against claims that Libya has a limited body of literature, classicists may be quick to note that ancient Greek lyric poet [[Callimachus]] and the exquisite prose stylist [[Sinesius]] were Libyan. But students of [[Libyan history]] and literature will note that a vast time gap between those ancient luminaries and the writers of today. [...] Libya has historically made a limited contribution to [[Arabian literature]]"''.

The [[Arab Renaissance]] (''Al-Nahda'') of the late 19th and early 20th centuries did not reach Libya as early as other Arab lands, and Libyans contributed little to its initial development. However, Libya at this time developed its own literary tradition, centred on [[oral poetry]], much of which expressed the suffering brought about by the [[History of Libya as Italian Colony|Italian colonial period]].

Libyan literature began to bloom in the late 1960s, with the writings of [[Sadeq al-Neihum]], [[Khalifa al-Fakhri]], [[Khamel al-Maghur]] ([[prose]]), [[Muhammad al-Shaltami]], and [[Ali al-Regeie]] ([[poetry]]). Many Libyan writers of the 1960s adhered to [[Nationalism|nationalist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], and generally [[Progressivism|progressive]] views.

In 1969, a [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Coup d'état of 1969|military coup]] brought [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] to power. In the mid-1970s, the new government set up a single publishing house, and authors were required to write in support of the authorities. Those who refused were imprisoned, emigrated, or ceased writing. Censorship laws were loosened, but not abolished in the early 1990s, resulting in a literary renewal. Some measure of dissent began to be expressed in Libyan literature, but books remained censored and self-censored to a significant extent.

With the overthrow of Gaddafi's government in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], literary censorship was abolished, and Article 14 of the [[Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration|interim constitution]] guarantees "liberty of the press, publication and mass media". Contemporary Libyan literature is influenced by "local lore, North African and Eastern Mediterranean Arabian literatures, and world literature at large" (K. Mattawa). Émigré writers have also contributed significantly to Libyan literature, and include [[Ibrahim Al-Kouni]], [[Ahmad Al-Faqih]], and [[Sadeq al-Neihum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Khaled Mattawa]], "Libya", ''in'' ''[[Literature from the "Axis of Evil"]]'' (a [[Words Without Borders]] anthology), {{ISBN|978-1-59558-205-8}}, 2006, pp.225–228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Libyan cuisine}}Libyan dishes borrow from the Arabic, Mediterranean and Italian cultures that met in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Olives, palm oil, dates, unleavened bread, and stuffed sweet peppers appear frequently in meals. Libyans do not consume any type of pork and all meats must be halal (killed humanely and prayed over according to Muslim customs). Attention to detail in Libyan cooking is very important; in fact, many spices are used in all the dishes and they need to be put in by the right amounts to enrich the taste. The Libyan diet is rich with seafood and includes a diversity of vegetables and cereals.

Meals are of great symbolic importance in the Libyan culture and the biggest meal of the day is lunch. Shops and businesses close for a couple of hours in the afternoon to allow families to gather together and eat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meals usually end with fruit or melon (Libya is known to have excellent fruit crops). They also drink green tea after meals to help aid digestion. Libyans love tea and coffee, and families usually gather together for their afternoon tea/coffee and catch up on the daily gossip. Libyan tea is known with it thick consistency.The Libyan tea is like black syrup, very strong. To follow tradition, the tea is usually first poured into a mug and then into another then back to the original mug, back and forth for a few minutes then poured from a high distance to the glass to form ‘ragwwa’ or foam.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.temehu.com/Libyan-food.htm|title = Libyan Food and the main dishes &amp; meals in Libya|last = Temehu.com|website = www.temehu.com|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libyan soup is a very famous dish throughout Libya and is often presented as a starter. It is considered to be an important dish in Ramadan, where people usually break their fast with soup (after having a glass of milk and a couple of dates).&amp;nbsp; It is a thick highly spiced soup, known simply as&amp;nbsp;''Shorba Arabiya'', or "Arabian soup". It contains many of the ingredients from many other Libyan dishes, including&amp;nbsp;onions,&amp;nbsp;tomatoes, meat&amp;nbsp;(chicken&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;lamb),&amp;nbsp;chili peppers,&amp;nbsp;cayenne pepper,&amp;nbsp;saffron,&amp;nbsp;chickpeas,&amp;nbsp;mint,&amp;nbsp;cilantro, and&amp;nbsp;parsley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/dining/04liby.html|title = In Libya, for Starters, It's the Soup|last = Fabricant|first = Florence|date = 2006-01-04|newspaper = The New York Times|issn = 0362-4331|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bazeen&amp;nbsp;is also a very recognizable Libyan food. It is made of a mixture of&amp;nbsp;barley&amp;nbsp;flour, with a little plain flour. The flour is boiled in salted water to make a hard dough, then it kneaded into a semi-spherical ball and placed in the middle of a large bowl (women sit on the floor and hold the pan between their legs while using a wooden ladle to mix and kneed the dough to its solid and thick consistency), around which the sauce is poured. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, adding&amp;nbsp;turmeric,&amp;nbsp;salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper,&amp;nbsp;fenugreek, sweet&amp;nbsp;paprika, and&amp;nbsp;tomato paste.&amp;nbsp;Potatoes&amp;nbsp;can also be added. Finally,&amp;nbsp;eggs&amp;nbsp;are boiled and arranged around the dome. The dish is then served with a well-known Libyan salad/complement of pickled carrots, cucumber and chili peppers, known as&amp;nbsp;''amasyar''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another type of Bazzin is called ‘Aish’ or ‘Aseeda’ which basically follows the same concept of the Bazzin except it is made with pure white flour, has a smoother and softer texture and is eaten sweet by adding honey, date syrup or on some occasions powdered sugar. Aish is normally eaten as breakfast or in special occasion, like a baby born or ‘Maylood’, (Mohammed’s birthdate).

One of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine, which is also a Libyan specialty, since it is not found anywhere else, is&amp;nbsp;''batata mubattana''&amp;nbsp;(filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.

Some other popular dishes in Libya include a diversity of pasta, which are one of Italy’s lasting influences and couscous, which is widely popular across the North African region.

All&amp;nbsp;alcohol&amp;nbsp;is banned in Libya, in accordance with&amp;nbsp;Sharia, the religious laws of&amp;nbsp;Islam. Bottled mineral water is widely consumed, as well as various soft drinks, such as&amp;nbsp;Coca-Cola.

== Libyan Traditional Dress ==
Nowadays, in modern Libya, people no longer wear the traditional dress very often, especially women, except the elderly Libyans, who still comply with traditions. The normal dress includes international modernized fashion that has spread out from the Western World. Women in Libya dress modestly and most of them wear the Hijab (Islam women choose whether or not to wear this.)

The traditional dress is now limited to special occasions; men wear it more often. In fact, it is popularly worn for Friday prayers, Eid (Islamic holiday) and weddings. Although the outfit slightly differs from one area to another, Libyan men’s clothes tend to be similar across entire Libya. It consists of a long white shirt ‘Jalabiya’or ‘Qamis’, long trousers ‘Sirwal’ and a vest called ‘Sadriya’ that is usually heavily knit with black silk and has buttons on its front. Men also wear a headdress called a ‘Shashiyah’ that is usually red or black.&amp;nbsp;Men in Tripolitania prefer wearing the black Shashiyah while the men in Cyrenaica wear both. Libyan men also wear a tight, knitted, white cap underneath the Shashiyah for when they are indoors. A large outer cloak known as ‘Jarid’ is worn on top and wrapped around the body in a Roman-toga way, except in Libya, the Jarid is usually tied at the right shoulder and the remainder is brought around up over the head. Libyan men wear leather boots, usually with a heel for riding horses, leather sandals or slippers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lazWAQAAQBAJ|title = Encyclopedia of National Dress: Traditional Clothing Around the World [2 Volumes]|last = Condra|first = Jill|date = 2013-04-09|publisher = ABC-CLIO|isbn = 9780313376375|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Libyan women, the traditional outfit differs slightly from one region to another; however, the general outfit consists of a blouse with baggy sleeves that are embroidered with beads and silver/gold thread and baggy silk trousers that have an elastic band at the bottom. On top of that, women wear brightly colored cloths are made into dresses like togas and held together by silver brooches. Women in the rural areas use heavy woven rug-like cloths due to the climate. The head is covered using a colorful cloth embellished with colorful pom-poms. Libyan women wear large pieces of gold or silver jewelry. The neckwear usually goes down to the knees and the bracelets are 4–6 inches wide. The large silver brooches used to attach the cloth are now replaced with gold and are usually decorated with a “Khamaisah”, a hand shaped symbol, or other charms that are believed to keep the evil eye off.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Women only wear the full outfit with the jewelry in special occasions and weddings. It is traditional for the groom to give the outfit with the gold to his bride at their wedding and for the bride to wear it the day after. The women’s traditional outfit is very expensive, but the prices vary depending on the quality and weight of gold or silver.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Libya}}

==Media==
Government control over the media has resulted in much of the population preferring to entertain itself by watching videos or foreign stations via satellite. Libyan television programmes are mostly in Arabic with a 30-minute news broadcast each evening in English and French. It is also possible to watch the occasional sports programs. However, the majority of programming is cultural and thus showcases more traditional Libyan music and entertainment.

Libya's daily newspaper is Al-Fajr al-Jadid and is published in [[Tripoli]]. Foreign newspapers are available, but are often very out-of-date by the time they reach the shops.

==History==

The Schwob brothers named the company ''[[wikt:cyma|cyma]]'', a Latin word meaning "sprout", and the origin of the French "cime" or [[wikt:summit|summit]]. In early years, the company had a staff of 40 people and 55 machines that together produced about 40 watches a day. However, it was not until 1892 in which the brothers partnered with Frédéric Henri Sandoz, the owner of the watch wholesale company, ''Henri Sandoz et Cie'', that the business expanded. Under Sandoz's leadership, the company became the Cyma Watch Company and built the Cyma factory in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], Switzerland in the [[Jura Mountains]], near [[Le Locle]]. Both towns had been the center of the Swiss watchmaking industry during the 19th century.

The company is currently located in Le Locle and is provincially managed by Claude and Françoise Guilgot. On 9 September 2010, Cyma SA and E-Watch organised an event in Yverdon to launch their new brand collection: Myriad.

==Price and value==

Cyma watches from the 1950s retailed between approximately $400 and $25,000 (figures adjusted to 2010 inflation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Setting==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2009}}

''Eclipse Phase'' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] game of conspiracy and horror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eclipsephase.com/game|title = The Game &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Eclipse Phase|author = Posthuman Studios|accessdate = 2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place after a [[World War III]] project to create [[artificial intelligence]] has gone rogue under the influence of an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] entity known as the "Exsurgent" (best described as an organic [[computer virus]] with the capacity to infect both machines and animals with [[sapience|sapient]] qualities), resulting in the deaths of over 90% of the inhabitants of Earth.

Earth is subsequently abandoned, and existing colonies throughout the Solar System are expanded to accommodate the refugees. The setting explores a spectrum of socioeconomic systems in each of these colonies:
*A [[capitalist]] / [[Republicanism|republican]] system exists in the Inner System (Mars, the Moon, and Mercury), under the Planetary Consortium, a corporate body which allows the election of representatives but whose shareholders are nominally most powerful.
*An [[Extropianism|Extropian]]/[[Propertarian]] system is established in the [[Asteroid Belt]]. The Extropians are split into two subfactions, an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] group, more closely related to the Hypercapitalists and a [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] group, related closely to the Anarchists.
*A military oligarchy rules the moons around Jupiter.
*An alliance of Scandinavia-style [[social democracy]] and [[Collectivist anarchism]] are dominant in the Outer System.

From there, the setting explores various scientific advances, extrapolated far into the future. [[Nanotechnology]], [[terraforming]], [[Weightlessness|Zero-G living]], [[uplift (science fiction)|upgrading animal sapience]], and [[reputation system]]s are all used as plot points and background.

With all of this, the game encourages players to confront existential threats like aliens, weapons of mass destruction, Exsurgent Virus outbreaks, and political unrest.

==Mechanics==
''Eclipse Phase'' uses a simple roll-under [[percentile die]] system for task resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher = [[Posthuman Studios]]|title = Eclipse Phase Core Rulebook|page = 114|isbn= 978-0-9845835-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players roll the percentile dice (by rolling two ten-sided dice with one of the dice representing a 10 value), and compare that roll to a target number with the goal being to match or go under that number with the roll. Unlike most similar systems, a roll of 00 does not count as a 100. In addition, any roll of a double (11, 22, 33 etc.) is a critical. If the double is under the target number it is a critical success, while being over the target number constitutes a critical failure.

For damage resolution (whether physical damage caused by [[injury]] or [[mental stress]] caused by [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] events), players roll a designated number of ten-sided dice and add the values together, along with any modifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher = [[Posthuman Studios]]|title = Eclipse Phase Core Rulebook|page = 192|isbn= 978-0-9845835-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Four of the Apocalypse''''' ({{lang-it|I quattro dell'apocalisse}})  is a 1975 [[Italy|Italian]] [[spaghetti western]] film directed by [[Lucio Fulci]] and starring [[Fabio Testi]], [[Tomas Milian]] and [[Michael J. Pollard]].&lt;ref name="allmovie" /&gt;

== Plot ==
Set in the year 1873, professional gambler Stubby Preston arrives in the [[Wild West]] town of Salt Flats, Utah with plans to work the local casino but is arrested by the sheriff the moment he steps off the stagecoach. What Stubby doesn't know is that a group of locals have planned a vigilante attack on the casino that night, which the sheriff plans to turn a blind eye to. The only criminals to survive are those who were in the jail when it happened: Stubby, a pregnant prostitute named Bunny, a disturbed but gentle black man named Bud, and an alcoholic named Clem.

In the morning the sheriff sees the four safely out of the town and gives them a wagon and horses in exchange for their remaining money and all of Stubby's possessions. The four set out for the next town and spend their first night with a group of traveling Amish evangelists, whose patriarch mistakes the pregnant Bunny as Stubby's wife. The four play along and Stubby and Bunny continue to pretend they are married in order to avoid unnecessary attention. After splitting from the evangelists the four hide themselves from a group of bandits just in time.

Later that day, they are approached by a Mexican gunman named Chaco who offers to protect and hunt for the group. They accept and for a while things go well, until Chaco saves the group from lawmen and then proceeds to mercilessly torture the surviving lawman to everyone's disgust. Despite this the group accepts the gift of [[peyote]] buttons which they all take by the campfire. In the morning they all awaken to being tied. Chaco taunts and beats the men, rapes Bunny, shoots Clem in the leg and leaves them for dead. Stubby, Bunny and Bud manage to put Clem on a stretcher and quietly witness Chaco meet up with his bandit compatriots. Together the bandits decimate the evangelists that the four had met earlier.

The four take shelter in a [[ghost town]] where they operate on Clem, who later dies from his wounds. This sends the already fragile minded Bud into a mad and confused state. Stubby and Bunny admit love to each other and have sex. Later Bud returns with meat he managed to find which they all cook and eat. Bud shows the extent of his madness by insisting that the residents of the ghost town have been coming out to meet him every night. When Stubby discovers the meat came from the corpse of Clem, Stubby and Bunny decide to leave Bud to his friends the ghosts as there is nothing they can do for him.

On the road, the two run into an old pastor friend of Stubby's shortly before Bunny goes into pained labor. Rushing to a snowy, mountaintop mining town populated entirely by men, the local chauvinistic townsmen are disturbed that a woman is giving birth in their home, but as they discuss it become fascinated and excited that their town would give new life instead of just taking it. Bunny dies in childbirth which leaves Stubby in shock. The townsmen, now enraptured with the child, gather round and take care him and insist that the pastor perform a baptism. Needing a name, the most enthusiastic townsman names the child Lucky. This awakens Stubby from his shock and he gratefully grants guardianship of Lucky to the townsmen.

Now alone, Stubby heads out and seeks revenge on Chaco, discovering him hiding with his two bandits in a barn with Stubby's possessions in their cart. He realizes the sheriff of Slat Flats and Chaco were in cahoots the whole time. Stubby quickly kills the sheriff and bandits and taunts and tortures a wounded Chaco, who taunts back by holding up the dead evangleist's cross and reminding him of Bunny's rape. Stubby shoots Chaco dead without another word, and heads off into the horizon after welcoming a stray dog to join him.

== Critical reception ==

{{quotefarm|date=February 2018}}

A '''free lunch''' is a sales enticement that offers a [[meal]] at no [[cost]] in order to attract customers and increase [[revenue]]s from other offerings. It was a tradition once common in [[Western saloon|saloons]] in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a "free" lunch, varying from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink.&lt;ref name=south/&gt; The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day.

Free food or drink is sometimes supplied in contemporary times, often by [[gambling]] establishments such as [[casino]]s.

The saying "[[there ain't no such thing as a free lunch]]" refers to this custom, meaning that things which appear to be free are always paid for in some way.

== History ==
In 1875, ''[[The New York Times]] ''wrote of elaborate free lunches as a "custom peculiar to the Crescent City" ([[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]), saying, "In every one of the drinking saloons which fill the city a meal of some sort is served free every day. The custom appears to have prevailed long before the [[American Civil War|war]].... I am informed that there are thousands of men in this city who live entirely on the meals obtained in this way." As described by this reporter,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A free lunch-counter is a great leveler of [[social class in the United States|classes]], and when a man takes up a position before one of them he must give up all hope of appearing either dignified or consequential. In New-Orleans all classes of the people can be seen partaking of these free meals and pushing and scrambling to be helped a second time. [At one saloon] six men were engaged in preparing drinks for the crowd that stood in front of the counter. I noticed that the price charged for every kind of [[liquor]] was fifteen cents, [[Punch (drink)|punches]] and cobblers costing no more than a glass of [[ale]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The repast included "immense dishes of butter," large baskets of bread, "a monster silver boiler filled with a most excellent [[oyster]] soup," "a round of beef that must have weighed at least forty pounds," vessels filled with potatoes, stewed [[mutton]], stewed tomatoes, and [[macaroni]] ''à la Français.'' The proprietor said that the patrons included "at least a dozen old fellows who come here every day, take one fifteen cent drink, eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant, and then complain that the beef is tough or the potatoes watery."&lt;ref name=south&gt;"Free Lunch in the South." The New York Times, Feb 20, 1875, p. 4. Re value of the lunch,  this source speaks of patrons who "take one fifteen cent drink [and] eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant." https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/02/20/82755928.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ($0.15 in 1875 is {{Inflation|US|0.15|1875|r=2|fmt=eq}}; $1 in 1875 is {{Inflation|US|1|1875|r=2|fmt=eq}})

== Free-lunch fiend ==
The nearly indigent "free-lunch fiend" was a recognized social type. An 1872 ''New York Times'' story about "loafers and free-lunch men" who "[[Matthew 6:28|toil not, neither do they spin]], yet they 'get along,'" visiting saloons, trying to bum drinks from strangers; "should this inexplicable lunch-fiend not happen to be called to drink, he devours whatever he can, and, while the bartender is occupied, tries to escape unnoticed."&lt;ref&gt;"The Loafer and Free-Lunch Men;" The New York Times, June 30, 1872, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[Western saloon|saloon]] bars from the late 19th century until Prohibition, [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] had, in addition to their role of removing drunks who were too intoxicated to keep buying drinks, fighters, and troublemakers, the unusual role of protecting the saloon's free buffet. To attract business, "...many saloons lured customers with offers of a "free lunch"—usually well salted to inspire drinking, and the saloon "bouncer" was generally on hand to discourage [those with too] hearty appetites".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hoboes.com/Politics/Prohibition/Notes/Drinking/ Drinking in America: A History - Search for Consensus: Drinking and the War Against Pluralism, 1860-1920]'' – Lender, Mark Edward &amp; Martin, James Kirby, The Free Press, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom was well-developed in [[San Francisco]]. An 1886 story on the fading of the days of the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]] calls "the free lunch fiend the only landmark of the past." It asks "How do all these idle people live" and asserts, "It is the free lunch system that keeps them alive. Take away that peculiarly California institution and they would all starve."&lt;ref&gt;"Old Things Passing Away," The New York Times, March 5, 1886, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudyard Kipling]], writing in 1891, noted how he

&lt;blockquote&gt;came upon a barroom full of bad Salon pictures in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter. It was the institution of the "free lunch" I had struck. You paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat. For something less than a [[rupee]] a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in San Francisco, even though he be a bankrupt. Remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rudyard|last=Kipling|title=American Notes|publisher=Standard Book Company|year=1930}} (published in book form in 1930, based on essays which appeared in periodicals in 1891)&lt;br/&gt;
{{Gutenberg|no=977|name=American Notes by Rudyard Kipling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1919 novel compared a war zone to the free lunch experience by saying "the shells and shrapnels was flyin round and over our heads thicker than hungry [[Homelessness|bum]]s around a free [[lunch counter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Love Letters of a Rookie to Julie|author=Barney Stone|year=1919|publisher=The Sherwood Company}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=15544|name=Love Letters of a Rookie to Julie by Barney Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The [[temperance movement]] opposed the free lunch as promoting the consumption of alcohol. An 1874 history of the movement writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the cities, there are prominent rooms on fashionable streets that hold out the sign "Free Lunch." Does it mean that some [philanthropist]... has gone systematically to work setting out tables... placing about them a score of the most beautiful and winning young ladies... hiring a band of music? Ah, no!... there are men who do all this in order to hide the main feature of their peculiar institution. Out of sight is a well-filled bar, which is the centre about which all these other things are made to revolve. All the gathered fascinations and attractions are as so many baits to allure men into the net that is spread for them. Thus consummate art plies the work of death, and virtue, reputation, and every good are sacrificed at these worse than [[Moloch]] shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Years History of the Temperance Cause: Intemperance the Great National Curse|first=Jane E. |last=Stebbins|author2=T. A. H. Brown|publisher=L. Stebbins|location=Hartford, Connecticut|year=1874}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04396205&amp;id=u8dQFo3yQzwC&amp;pg=RA3-PA133&amp;vq=%22free+lunch%22&amp;as_brr=1 p. 133]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of writers, however, suggest that the free lunch actually performed a social relief function. Reformer [[William T. Stead]] commented that in winter in 1894 the suffering of the poor in need of food
&lt;blockquote&gt;would have been very much greater had it not been for the help given by the [[labor unions]] to their members and for an agency which, without pretending to be of much account from a charitable point of view, nevertheless fed more hungry people in Chicago than all the other agencies, religious, charitable, and municipal, put together. I refer to the Free Lunch of the saloons. There are from six to seven thousand saloons in Chicago. In one half of these a free lunch is provided every day of the week.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
He states that "in many cases the free lunch is really a free lunch," citing an example of a saloon which did not insist on a drink purchase, although commenting that this saloon was "better than its neighbors." Stead cites a newspaper's estimate that the saloon keepers fed 60,000 people a day and that this represented a contribution of about $18,000 a week toward the relief of the destitute in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If Christ Came to Chicago|first=William T.|last=Stead|year=1894|publisher=[[Laird &amp; Lee]]}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC02495421&amp;id=olqCOpl4SWoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;as_brr=1 pp. 139–140]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1896, the New York State legislature passed the [[Raines law]] which was intended to regulate liquor traffic. Among its many provisions, one forbade the sale of liquor unless accompanied by food; another outlawed the free lunch. In 1897, however, it was amended to allow free lunches again.&lt;ref&gt;"Revolt in Clubdom; Probability of Passage of Amendments to Raines Law Causes Consternation; Free Lunch to Come Back." ''The Boston Globe,'' April 9, 1897, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Great Greed''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Bitamīna Oukoku Monogatari'''''|ビタミーナ王国物語||lit. "Vitamina Kingdom Story"}}, is an environmentally-themed [[role-playing video game]] for the [[Nintendo]] [[Game Boy]] released by [[Namco]] in [[1992 in video games|1992]].

==Story==
The game's plot deals with a protagonist whose name that the player sets, but referred to as "Sierra Sam" in the game's promotional materials. Sam, a resident of the "real world," is transported to the fictional world of Greene in order to prevent Biohazard Harry (simply referred to as "Bio-Haz" in the game) from continuing to pollute Greene, a world of seven nations. Sam finds himself stuck in Greene because Microwave, who brought him there in the first place, lost her power in the previous battle.
Sam's adventures range from collecting debut records to helping to expose a corrupt politician.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Greatgreedbattle.png|thumb|Sam faces off against a Weiner.]]

The game plays similarly to many other RPGs of the time, although there are a few significant differences. The graphics are very similar to those of ''[[Final Fantasy Legend]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Legend 2]]''. However, battles are reminiscent of ''[[Dragon Warrior]]''. Only one character fights (Sam), and only one monster fights at a time. The game features [[random encounter]] battles, and the player's progress can be saved anytime, except during battle, by using the select button. Additionally, most of the characters, enemies, and towns in the game are named after different types of [[food]] or food-related products.

Through the menu screen, the player can talk to the party for information on where to go next.

===Battle===
Each battle action in ''Great Greed'' is assigned to a button.  The "A" button attacks, the "B" button defends and the "Start" button attempts to escape from the battle.  Magic scrolls that the player has found or purchased can be set to one of the four directional buttons on the [[d-pad|directional pad]], with "Down" being the only direction in which the player can assign a healing spell. Sam and the enemy attack at the same time, with healing occurring before attacking.

===Multiple endings===
At the end of the game, the king asks the player if they wish the main character to marry one of his daughters. Out of his five daughters, Gum Drop is engaged to be married, while the other four (Cup Cake, Citrus, Candy, and Truffle) are presented as available (although Princess Cup Cake is only eleven years old, and the king states the main character will have to wait until she's grown). While the player can pick any of the four, they can also talk Gum Drop out of her betrothal upon repeated interaction.

In addition, the player is also able (with repeated interaction) to talk the Court Witch (Microwave), Chief of Bodyguards (Lunch Box), Court Administrator (either Time Out or Lunch Break because of a localization inconsistency), or even break up the marriage of the king and queen to marry someone out of any of the ten characters present in the final scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7382">The '''Interaction hypothesis''' is a [[second-language acquisition theories|theory]] of [[second-language acquisition]] which states that the development of [[language proficiency]] is promoted by [[face-to-face interaction]] and [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor1-last = Johnson | editor1-first = Keith | editor2-last = Johnson | editor2-first = Helen | title = Interaction Hypothesis | encyclopedia = Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Linguistics: A Handbook for Language Teaching | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 1999 | page = 174 | isbn = 978-0-631-22767-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea existed in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Long | first = Michael | chapter = Input and Second Language Acquisition Theory | pages = 377–393 | editor1-last = Gass | editor1-first = Susan | editor2-last = Madden | editor2-first = Carolyn | title = Input in second language acquisition | publisher = Newbury House | location = Rowley, Mass | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-0-88377-284-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ellis | first = Rod | title = Classroom Second Language Development: A Study of Classroom Interaction and Language Acquisition | publisher = Pergamon | location = Oxford, UK | year = 1984 | page = 95 | isbn = 978-0-08-031516-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is usually credited to [[Michael Long (academic)|Michael Long]] for his 1996 paper ''The role of the linguistic environment in second language acquisition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Long | first = Michael | chapter = The role of the linguistic environment in second language acquisition | pages = 413–468 | editor1-last = Ritchie | editor1-first = William | editor2-last = Bhatia | editor2-first = Tej | title = Handbook of second language acquisition | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-12-589042-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GassSelinker2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course | last1 = Gass | first = Susan | last2 = Selinker | first2 = Larry | year = 2008 | page = 350 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-8058-5497-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of the Interaction Hypothesis: the "strong" form and the "weak" form. The "strong" form is the position that the interaction itself contributes to language development. The "weak" form is the position that interaction is simply the way that learners find learning opportunities, whether or not they make productive use of them.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999" /&gt;

== Outline ==
Similar to [[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]]'s [[input hypothesis]], the interaction hypothesis claims that [[comprehensible input]] is important for language learning. In addition, it claims that the effectiveness of comprehensible input is greatly increased when learners have to negotiate for [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref name="Ellis1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ellis | first = Rod | title = Second Language Acquisition | publisher = Oxford University Press| series = Oxford Introductions to Language Study | location = Oxford, New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-437212-1 | pages = 47–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when there is a breakdown in communication which interlocutors attempt to overcome.&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Interaction Hypothesis | editor1-last = Richards | editor1-first = Jack | editor2-last = Schmidt | editor2-first = Richard | encyclopedia = Longman dictionary of language teaching and applied linguistics | publisher = Longman | location = London New York | year = 2002 | page = 264 | isbn = 978-0-582-43825-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the participants in a [[conversation]] will say something that the other does not understand; the participants will then use various [[communicative strategies]] to help the interaction progress. The strategies used when negotiating meaning may include slowing down speech, speaking more deliberately, requests for clarification or repair of speech, or [[paraphrase]]s.&lt;ref name="Brown2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = H Douglas | title = Principles of Language Learning and Teaching | publisher = Longman | location = White Plains, NY | year = 2000 | pages = 287–288 | isbn = 978-0-13-017816-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactions often result in learners receiving [[negative evidence]].&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; That is, if learners say something that their interlocutors do not understand, after negotiation the interlocutors may model the correct language form. In doing this, learners can receive [[feedback]] on their [[Speech production|production]] and on [[grammar]] that they have not yet mastered.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; The process of interaction may also result in learners receiving more input from their interlocutors than they would otherwise.&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002" /&gt; Furthermore, if learners stop to clarify things that they do not understand, they may have more time to [[Speech perception|process]] the input they receive. This can lead to better understanding and possibly the acquisition of new language forms.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; Finally, interactions may serve as a way of focusing learners' [[attention]] on a difference between their knowledge of the [[second language|target language]] and the reality of what they are hearing; it may also focus their attention on a part of the target language of which they are not yet aware.&lt;ref name="GassSelinker2008" /&gt;

== Primacy of interaction ==
Although there are several studies that link interaction with language acquisition,&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see {{cite book | title = Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course | last1 = Gass | first = Susan | last2 = Selinker | first2 = Larry | year = 2008 | pages = 353–355 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-8058-5497-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; not all researchers subscribe to the idea that interaction is the primary means by which language proficiency develops.&lt;ref name="Brown2000" /&gt; In a [[Literature review|survey of the literature]] on the subject, [[Diane Larsen-Freeman|Larsen-Freeman]] and Long say that interaction is not necessary for language acquisition; they do say, however, that it helps in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Larsen-Freeman | first1 = Diane | last2 = Long | first2 = Michael | title = An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research | publisher = Longman | location = London, New York | year = 1991 | pages = 143–144 | isbn = 978-0-582-55377-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gass and Selinker claim that as well as interaction facilitating learning, it may also function as a priming device, "setting the stage" for learning rather than being the means by which learning takes place.&lt;ref name="GassSelinker2008" /&gt; In addition, [[Rod Ellis|Ellis]] notes that interaction is not always positive. He says that sometimes it can make the input more complicated, or produce amounts of input which overwhelm learners. According to Ellis, this can happen if interlocutors use lengthy paraphrases or give complex [[definition]]s of a word that was not understood, and he comes to the conclusion that the role of interaction in language acquisition is a complex one.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;

'''''Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles''''' ({{lang-fr|Lettre a M. D'Alembert sur les spectacles}}) is a 1758 essay written by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in opposition to an article published in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|Jean d'Alembert]], that proposed the establishment of a theatre in [[Geneva]]. More generally, it is a critical analysis of the effects of culture on morals, that clarifies the links between politics and social life.&lt;ref name="fermon"&gt;{{cite book |title=Domesticating Passions: Rousseau, Woman, and Nation |last=Fermon |first=Nicole |year=1997 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |location=Hanover |isbn=978-0-8195-6305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau relates the issue of a theatre in Geneva to the broader social context, warning of the potential the theatre has to corrupt the morality in society.&lt;ref name="dent"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Rousseau Dictionary |last=Dent |first=Nicholas  |year=1992 |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-631-17569-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Letter'' is considered to be highly personally relevant to Rousseau, whose patriotism and affinity for Geneva shows through as he writes to defend his country from moral decay. By focusing on his belief in the natural order and harmony of traditional sex roles and community, Rousseau writes to convince D'Alembert, and the public of Geneva, that a theatre is a threat to an ideal, natural way of life.&lt;ref name="grimsley"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jean-Jacques Rousseau |last=Grimsley |first=Ronald |year=1983 |publisher=The Harvester Press |location=Sussex |isbn=978-0-389-20378-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Rousseau generally opposed the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thrust that was occurring during his lifetime. He sought to distance himself philosophically from the views that the universal use of reason, science, uninhibited freedom of thought, and increasing appreciation for the fine arts would make society a better place. Rousseau is often characterized as the father of [[Romanticism]], as he opposed [[modernity]] and the Enlightenment and glorified the heroic ethos of [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite book |title=Politics and the Arts. Letter to M. d'Alembert on the Theater. By Jean-Jacques Rousseau |last=Bloom |first=Allan |authorlink=Allan Bloom |year=1960 |publisher=The Free Press |location=Glencoe, Illinois |isbn=978-0-8014-9071-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend of the Enlightenment among philosophers, since [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], was to move towards a society with minimized restrictions. Rousseau adhered to the belief that restrictions and censorship are often justified to maintain civil order.&lt;ref name="dent2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rousseau |last=Dent |first=Nicholas |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-28350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecclesiology|Ecclesiastical]] groups as well, namely the [[Jansenism|Jansenists]], harshly condemned the theatre due to it being incompatible with Christian morality. However, after the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], new philosophical ideas began to emerge about embracing earthly pleasure, and the theatre found more and more supporters. It may be important to note that the theatre was a far more powerful cultural force in Rousseau's day than today.&lt;ref name="grimsley" /&gt; D'Alembert's article in support of the theatre was influenced by [[Voltaire]], who not only was against censorship, but frequently put on theatrical performances at his home outside of Geneva.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rousseau's Political Imagination: Rule and Representation in Lettre a d'Alembert |last=Coleman |first=Patrick |year=1984 |publisher=Libraire Droz SA |location=Geneva |isbn=978-2-600-03602-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The ''Letter'' begins by Rousseau establishing the respect he has for his friend D'Alembert. But after quoting a passage from D'Alembert's letter, Rousseau writes that it is imperative to discuss the potential disasters that a theatre could bring. He also responds to some comments D'Alembert makes praising the tolerance of the Geneva clergy while criticizing the intolerance of [[Roman Catholicism in France|French Roman Catholicism]]. Rousseau is, however, reluctant to engage this discussion in depth.&lt;ref name="grimsley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;

The main letter is divided into three general areas: "A) The Theatre in Relation to What Is Performed in It"; "B) The Theatre Considered in Relation to the Stage and Actors"; and "C) The Establishment of a Theatre in Geneva".

===The theatre in relation to what is performed in it===
Rousseau writes that the theatre, at first glance, is a form of amusement. Amusements are acceptable in moderation, when they are necessary, but they become a burden if they consume the minds of men enough to waste their time. The principle of the theatre is to please, it is not, Rousseau argues, functional because the characters are always distant from man. If the play is a comedy, for example, the content is undermined, and if it is tragic, the heroic ideals are exaggerated and placed out of the reach of man. Even if the play happens to portray moral ideals well, the awareness of the audience that it is a fiction does not do the ideas justice.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

Rousseau continues to say that though [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] society functioned well with tragic and violent content in theatres because it was part of the traditions specific to the time and place, putting these plays in a French context would be far more dangerous. However, tragedies are not as dangerous as [[Comedy|comedies]], because the characters more closely resemble French citizens.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

He extensively discusses playwright [[Molière]]'s work, and uses the play ''[[The Misanthrope|Le Misanthrope]]'' to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, the audience will not find it funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

Rousseau turns to the topic of love, which, he says, is in the realm of women. Women naturally have power over men via resistance in the area of relationships and this power can be extended to the play, where women can have the same control over the audience. This extension of the empire of women is against natural order. Rousseau refers to ancient [[Sparta]], where the most virtuous and appreciated women were those who were modest and generally not spoken about. In the decadence of France, Rousseau claims the most esteemed woman is the one who is most social, most talked about, judgmental and authoritative.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

===The theatre considered in relation to the stage and actors===
Even if the theatre is morally innocuous, Rousseau argues, its presence is disruptive to potentially productive use of time. Moreover, theatre is incompatible with the rural mindset, where people work hard, and as a result should find simple relaxation pleasurable, rather than the extravagant, over-stimulating entertainment which retards the imagination. A theatre in Geneva would cause the hardworking people to be distracted and pre-occupied if they were to develop a taste for it. Though a theatre can work to distract the masses of the cities from crime, it is of no use to a smaller city like Geneva, which is relatively innocent. Rousseau also describes the weather and geography of Geneva, and argues that it is not particularly conducive to supporting a theatre.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

If a theatre is established it will change the maxims and prejudices of Geneva, for better or worse, and the best way to deal with this is simply prevention, Rousseau argues. In other words, it is easier to not have to deal with corrupted morality and have to change the laws accordingly.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

In this section, Rousseau expresses his belief that actors and actresses themselves are people of an undesirable lifestyle and potentially weak moral foundation. Rousseau describes them as scandalous, hedonistic, and compares them to [[jester]]s, who were more blatantly indecent and obscene. Once again looking to Greece and Rome as an ideal, he says that [[Sparta]] did not tolerate theatres, and Rome considered the acting profession dishonourable. He writes that the actor is someone who is artificial, performs for money, subjects himself to disgrace, and abandons his role as a man. Though the actor is not necessarily malevolent with his talents of deception, Rousseau goes on, the seductive, manipulative nature of acting could potentially be used by actors to do harm in society outside of the theatre. It is also problematic, according to Rousseau for women and men to be working together as actors and actresses. Because of the natural respect men have for the moral sense and timidity of women, for men to be amongst women as actresses will be a further threat to men's morality.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

===The establishment of a theatre at Geneva===
Rousseau portrays Geneva in a very romantic and positive light, where people are productive, happy and hard at work, but he also recognizes the extreme wealth and poverty in the city. He first tries to sway Geneva away from the idea of theatre by suggesting that it is not economically feasible, and that the population is too low to support a theatre.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

He goes on to criticize women's social activity in public and private venues in Paris and Geneva, suggesting women produce the only gossip, and the moral decay of men, women and children. He states that though men have their vices, like drinking, they are far less harmful to society than women's vices. He argues that the presence and authority of women in public spaces corrupts the male youth, turning them effeminate and void of patriotic passion. Once again, the morality of Ancient Rome and Greece is frequently referenced as an ideal that should be aspired to.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

Towards the middle of this final section Rousseau reasons that the theatre does very little good for the poor, who cannot afford the taxes required to support a theatre. Geneva, which already has a large degree of inequality, does not need any more. Rousseau continues to say that actors coming to the town of Geneva will be indifferent to the town's morality, and will quickly corrupt it. Even though there are other forms of entertainment in Geneva that exemplify bad manners, Rousseau claims that none of these areas are more destructive to the people's good taste than the theatre. The best alternative to theatres is open-air festivals, in nature, to provide a unifying, patriotic spirit.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

==Rousseau's style and personality==
In spite of the letter being addressed directly to D'Alembert, it is undoubtedly meant to have an effect on the general population. The work is famous for displaying Rousseau's charismatic rhetoric and digressive tendencies, all with his personal experience woven into the text. It may be considered to portray Rousseau's vanity, narcissism and biases, but the text could also be thought of more positively; as expressive, lyrical and austere. The ''Letter'' shows Rousseau's tendency to think of the events in his own life as highly significant, as reflections of the larger social picture. An example is how the ''Letter'' itself is open and expressive in style, while the content of the ''Letter'' is about this openness.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt;

The ''Letter'' starts off with a more grim and urgent tone, then shifting at the end to a brighter and optimistic one when the community oriented solution to the problem of the theatre is discussed.&lt;ref name="grimsley"/&gt;

==Reception==
D'Alembert himself was moved by the response, even intimidated.&lt;ref name="rolland"&gt;{{cite book |title=The living thoughts of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Living Thoughts Library) |last=Rolland |first=Romain |authorlink=Romain Rolland |edition=3 |year=1946 |publisher=Cassell |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; With impartiality, he decided it fit for publication (he himself at one time worked as a censor). Rousseau and D'Alembert managed to maintain their friendship after the response, though somewhat at a distance. The letter attracted remarkable attention; over four hundred articles and pamphlets were written in response to it. Overall, the population of Geneva agreed with the ''Letter''.&lt;ref name="dent"/&gt;

==Social and political themes==
Rousseau believed that the theatre took people away from the community, and replaced any patriotic, unifying spirit with artificial emotions.&lt;ref name="dent2"/&gt; To have a prosperous state, Rousseau believed, people needed to work together and harmoniously.&lt;ref name="dent2"/&gt; As an alternative to the theatre, Rousseau proposed open-air republican festivals, with a rich community atmosphere. One of Rousseau's pivotal points in the ''Letter'' is that customs, opinions and priorities which are common and well-accepted among all citizens should be those that make accepting laws in favour of respect, equality and harmony a pleasurable and natural experience. In other words, people have to share the concerns with legislators if a state is to be successful.&lt;ref name="dent"/&gt;

==Women and the family==
In the ''Letter'', Rousseau rejected the traditional notion of male politicians being responsible for moral reform, and thought it was women's responsibility. He considered women, by virtue of their nature, to be the primary agents of moral reform, and that the success of the state depends on the harmony within private, domestic life. Rousseau opposed marriage without love (i.e. marriage for financial reasons, order, lust, convenience). In Rousseau's opinion, true love for the nurturing, feminine mother, instead of lustful love for a mistress, goes hand in hand with patriotism and civic harmony. The legislator's task is to make sure a society's women are in order.&lt;ref name="fermon"/&gt;
	
Rousseau believed that public morals could be created not by laws or punishment, but simply by women, who have access to their senses and largely control the way men think.&lt;ref name="fermon"/&gt; He praised Geneva for its moral women, and its ordered familial sphere, while criticizing the women of the salons in France for making men womanly and cowardly.&lt;ref name="grimsley"/&gt;

==Present-day relevance==
In post-modern thinking, there has been renewed interest and appreciation for Rousseau's ''Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles'', with the acceptance since Rousseau's time of [[utopia]]n and primitivist elements in political thought. Rousseau's letter can help to understand the distinction between lived-in culture and theoretical political order.&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt; Rousseau's views on the theatre are also thought to echo current concerns with global entertainment, television and Internet taking over local customs and culture.&lt;ref name="dent"/&gt;

In [[Philippines|Philippine]] folk culture, '''''lihí''''' is a condition of pregnancy food craving in which a notable characteristic is that [[pregnant]] women usually desire food such as sour, unripe [[mango]] with [[bagoong]]. While it is a cultural concept restricted among the [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], analogous cultural phenomena of pregnancy food cravings have been observed in various cultures. It is still debatable as to whether ''lihí'' can be classified and established as either a biological or psychological condition or a purely social and cultural one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Placek C | title = A test of four evolutionary hypotheses of pregnancy food cravings: evidence for the social bargaining model | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 4 | issue = 10 | pages = 170243 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29134058 | pmc = 5666241 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.170243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superstitions==
''Lihí'' also broadly encompasses a folk belief that whatever a woman had craved during pregnancy will [[Maternal impression|imprint characteristics on the child.]] When a child resembles a [[manatee]], for example, it is said that the mother enjoyed looking at that particular animal during the gestational period.

In other regions, ''lihí'' refers to the belief that any sensory stimuli imbibed by a pregnant woman influences the development of her child. Among some ethnic groups in the northern Philippines, it is [[taboo]] to mention anything about animals such as rats or pigs near a pregnant woman for fear that her child may acquire the features of the mentioned animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">In [[mathematics]], the '''Liouville–Neumann series''' is an [[infinite series]] that corresponds to the [[resolvent formalism]] technique of solving the [[Fredholm integral equation]]s in [[Fredholm theory]].

==Definition==
The Liouville–Neumann (iterative) series is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\phi\left(x\right) = \sum^\infty_{n=0} \lambda^n \phi_n \left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which, provided that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is small enough so that the series converges, is the unique [[continuous function|continuous]] solution of the [[Fredholm integral equation]] of the second kind,

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation =  &lt;math&gt;f(t)= \phi(t) - \lambda \int_a^bK(t,s)\phi(s)\,ds.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}

If the ''n''th iterated [[Kernel (integral operator)|kernel]] is defined as ''n''−1 nested integrals of ''n'' operators {{mvar|K}},
:&lt;math&gt;K_n\left(x,z\right) = \int\int\cdots\int K\left(x,y_1\right)K\left(y_1,y_2\right) \cdots K\left(y_{n-1}, z\right) dy_1 dy_2 \cdots dy_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n\left(x\right) = \int K_n\left(x,z\right)f\left(z\right)dz&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_0\left(x\right) = f\left(x\right)~,&lt;/math&gt;
so ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  may be taken to be {{math|''δ''(''x−z'')}}.

The [[Resolvent formalism|resolvent]] (or solving kernel for the integral operator) is then given by a schematic analog "geometric series",
:&lt;math&gt;R\left(x, z;\lambda\right) = \sum^\infty_{n=0} \lambda^n K_{n} \left(x, z\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; has been taken to be {{math|''δ''(''x−z'')}}.

The solution of the integral equation thus becomes simply
:&lt;math&gt;\phi\left(x\right) = \int R\left( x, z;\lambda\right) f\left(z\right)dz.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar methods may be used to solve the [[Volterra equation]]s.

{{Literature}}
'''Literary adaptation''' is the [[adaptation (arts)|adapting]] of a literary source (e.g. a novel, short story, poem) to another genre or medium, such as a film, stage play, or video game.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It can also involve adapting the same literary work in the same genre or medium just for different purposes, e.g. to work with a smaller cast, in a smaller venue (or on the road), or for a different demographic group (such as adapting a story for children). Sometimes the editing of these works without the approval of the author can lead to a court case.

It also appeals because it obviously works as a story; it has interesting characters, who say and do interesting things. This is particularly important when adapting to a dramatic work, e.g. film, stage play, teleplay, as dramatic writing is some of the most difficult. To get an original story to function well on all the necessary dimensions—concept, character, story, dialogue, and action—is an extremely rare event performed by a rare talent.

Perhaps most importantly, especially for producers of the screen and stage, an adapted work is more bankable; it represents considerably less risk to investors, and poses the possibilities of huge financial gains. This is because:
* It has already attracted a following.
* It clearly works as a literary piece in appealing to a broad group of people who care.
* Its title, author, characters, etc. may be a franchise in and of themselves already.

==Film==
{{main|Film adaptation}}
Works of literature have been adapted for film from the dawn of the industry. Some of the earliest examples come from the work of [[Georges Méliès]], who pioneered many film techniques. In 1899, he released two adaptations — ''Cinderella'' based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] story of the same name and ''[[King John (1899 film)|King John]]'', the first known film to be based on the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The 1900 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes Baffled]]'', directed by [[Arthur Marvin]] featured [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s detective character [[Sherlock Holmes]] intruding upon a pseudo-supernatural burglary. The film, considered the first detective movie, ran for only 30 seconds and was originally intended to be shown in hand-cranked [[Mutoscope]] machines.

Méliès' 1902 original science-fiction feature ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' was based loosely on two popular novels of the time: [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''.&lt;ref name=Greatest&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Dirks |title=A Trip to The Moon |work= FilmSite.org |url=http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html |accessdate=2007-01-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117090347/http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html| archivedate= 17 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of many adaptations of the [[Brothers Grimm]] tale ''[[Snow White]]'' was [[Snow White (1902 film)|released in 1902]] while the earliest surviving copy is [[Snow White (1916 film)|the 1916 version]]. 1903 saw the release of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1903 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' directed by [[Cecil Hepworth]] and [[Percy Stow]], the first movie adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s children's book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0000420|title=Alice in Wonderland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first feature-length film to be shot entirely in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] was [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s first assignment, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'', in 1914, which was the first of three movie versions (all directed by DeMille) based on [[Edwin Milton Royle]]'s [[play (theatre)|play]] [[The Squaw Man (play)|of the same name]]. Since the early days of the genre, major films have been largely adapted:
* Novels: [[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]] (1939), [[From Here to Eternity]] (1953), and [[The Godfather]] (1972) were all adapted from novels of the same name.
* Plays: [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] (1942), [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|Streetcar Named Desire]] (1951), and [[Equus (film)|Equus]] (1977) were all adapted from stage plays.
* Short stories: [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]] (1947), [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]] (1961), [[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (film)|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]] (1968), [[The Shawshank Redemption|Shawshank Redemption]] (1994), and [[Brokeback Mountain]] (2005) were all made from short stories.
The most celebrated of the early adaptations is [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'', a 1924 adaptation of the 1899 novel ''[[McTeague]]'' by naturalist writer [[Frank Norris]]. The director intended to film every aspect of the novel in great detail, resulting in a 9½-hour epic feature. At studio insistence, the film was cut down to two hours and was considered a flop upon its theatrical release. It has since been restored to just over four hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/03/entertainment/ca-39909|title=A 'Greed' More as Stroheim Had Intended|last=THOMAS|first=KEVIN|date=1999-12-03|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. 

One book that has been adapted very frequently (in one form or another) is [[Charles Dickens]]' Christmas story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', which has around 20 film adaptations to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://collider.com/a-christmas-carol-adaptations-ranked/|title='A Christmas Carol' Adaptations Ranked from "Bah Humbug!" to "God Bless Us Everyone!"|date=2015-12-25|work=Collider|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
From a legal standpoint, when a literary source has not passed into the [[public domain]], rights must be arranged for the adaptation to be performed legally. Plagiarism occurs in every [[genre]], and throughout history, but such literary rights violations can be challenged in court. In the case of Hollywood films, judgments for the [[plaintiff]] can run into the millions of dollars, but these have typically been for outright theft of a screenplay idea rather than for fraudulent adaptations (see ''[[Buchwald v. Paramount]]'').

Because of the importance of telling a story with a limited number of [[Character (arts)|character]]s, short stories often make better sources for adaptable material than do novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://screencraft.org/2015/11/13/5-reasons-short-stories-are-easier-to-adapt-than-novels/|title=5 Reasons Short Stories Are Easier to Adapt Than Novels|date=2015-11-13|work=ScreenCraft|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the stage, in addition, theater audiences tend to accept and prefer works of a more conceptual, thought-based nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/what-fences-misses-about-adapting-plays-for-the-screen|title=What “Fences” Misses About Adapting Plays for the Screen|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning their preferences need to be considered when selecting a work for adaptation, but also when determining how best to adapt it. The stage imposes physical limits of size and technology. Not every [[illusion]] that can be made to appear real on the [[movie screen]] can be made to appear so on stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">'''Manasology''' (кyrgyz. ''Манастаануу'') is a separate line of research within Kyrgyz studies, which looks into the scientific study of the Kyrgyz [[Manas epic]]. Representatives of this [[scientific]] area are called ''manasologists''.

==Periods of development==
Scientific research of the epic began in the second half of the XIX century by Ch. [[Valikhanov]] and V. [[Radlov]]. Valikhanov had recorded one of the episodes ("Pominki po Kyokyotoyu") in 1856 and partially translated it into Russian. The texts published by Radlov in 1885 in St. Petersburg (in Kyrgyz and German languages) occupy 12,454 lines (including 9449 lines about "Manas")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalaev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas|date=1984|location=Frunze|url=https://bilim.akipress.org/lib/book:333/manas-po-variantu-sayakbaya-karalaeva-kniga-1-frunze-1984g/?from=bilim&amp;place=type|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Full record of the texts of the "Manas" [[trilogy]] has been carried out since 1920, however, fixing versions by [[manaschi]], let alone their full publication are still far from complete.

Kazakh writer M.O. Auezov wrote the first work after Chokan Valikhanov’s works, a monograph on the Kyrgyz "[[Epic of Manas|Manas]]" epic, by creating of a free version of his texts. Monuments were erected for both Kazakh researchers in the [[Bishkek]] city. Among the [[Russian scientists]] who studied the epic, V. Radlov should be noted (the author of the first Russian translation of fragments of the epic), P. Falev (the author of the first [[Soviet]] study on "Manas" - articles "How the Kara-Kygyz epic is built") and S. [[Malov]].

The All-Union Scientific Conference of 1952 in [[Bishkek|Frunze]] came to the conclusion that the epic "is folk in its basis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karalayev|first1=Sayakbai|title=Manas II|date=1984|location=Frunze|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Among the translators of the epic into Russian are S. [[Lipkin]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlovskiy and others. The largest Russian translation (prosaic) is in 4 volumes  so far by A.S. Mirbadaleva and N. V. Kydaish-Pokrovskaya for a bilingual edition in the series "Epic of the Peoples of the USSR" (1984-1995), covers about 50 thousand lines (according to S.Orozbakov).

The first one who played the "Manas" epic in [[Russian language]] in the translations of E. [[Polivanov]], L. [[Penkovsky]], M. Tarlevsky and S. [[Lipkin]], is a national artist of Kyrgyzstan Valery Rovinsky.

Abbreviated versions of the epic exist in [[Kazakh language]] (4 volumes in M. Auezov's presentation, including 2 parts about Manas and the part about Semetey and Seytek) and in [[Uzbek language]] (the poet Mirtemir); separate episodes were translated into German, Hungarian, English and other languages.

==Scientific institutions==
The main center of manasology is the National Center for Manasology and Art Culture of the National Academy of Sciences of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]] (director - Akmataliev, Abdyldazhan Amanturovich).

'''Max Factor''' is a line of cosmetics from [[Coty, Inc.]]. It was founded in 1909 as Max Factor &amp; Company by [[Max Factor, Sr.|Maksymilian Faktorowicz]], a beautician from [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yourrootsinpoland.com/en/blog-en/two-great-polish-enterpreneures-max-factor-helena-rubenstein/|title=Two Great Polish enterpreneures - Max Factor &amp; Helena Rubenstein ⋆ Your Roots in Poland|date=17 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whilst reference to the founder(s) is evident in the brand’s etymology, with the advent of silent film and cinematography, Max Factor demonstrated the importance of custom, technical make-up application, according to individual nuances in facial structure, contour, and creative characterisation. It was later postulated that the brand name, Max Factor, shares its etymology with a particular branch of medicine concerned with specialised  ‘maxillofacial’ surgery. More recently abbreviated to ‘Max Facs’ , medical expertise within the field pertains to the entire craniomaxillofacial complex: the anatomical area of the mouth, jaws, face, skull, and associated hard and soft local tissue.  

Max Factor specialized in movie make-up. Until its 1973 sale for US$500 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|2.84|2016|r=1}} billion in 2017 dollars), Max Factor &amp; Company was owned by several generations of the family, becoming an international company during that time. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] purchased it in 1991.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}

After immigrating from a town of [[Zduńska Wola]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lodz.onet.pl/slynny-max-factor-urodzil-sie-w-zdunskiej-woli/tc5dg|title=Słynny Max Factor urodził się w Zduńskiej Woli|date=6 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Congress Poland]]) to the United States in 1904 Max Factor moved his family and business to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], seeing an opportunity to provide made-to-order wigs and theatrical make-up to the growing film industry. Besides selling his own make-up products he soon became the West Coast distributor of both Leichner and Minor, two leading theatrical make-up manufacturers.

In the early years of movie-making, greasepaint in stick form, although the accepted make-up for use on the stage, could not be applied thinly enough, nor did the colors work satisfactorily on the screen. Factor began experimenting with various compounds in an effort to develop a suitable make-up for the new film medium. By 1914 he had perfected his first cosmetic product. With this major achievement to his credit, Max Factor became the authority on cosmetics in film-making. Soon movie stars were eager to sample his "flexible greasepaint".

In the early years of the business Factor personally applied his products to actors and actresses. He developed a reputation for being able to customize makeup to present actors and actresses in the best possible light on screen. Among his most notable clients were [[Ben Turpin]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Judy Garland]]. As a result, virtually all of the major movie actresses were regular customers of the Max Factor [[beauty salon]], located near [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

In 1918 Max Factor completed development of his "Color Harmony" range of face powder which, due to its wide range of shades, allowed him to customize and provide more consistent make-up for each individual actor or actress. He created many appearances for these actresses, such as [[Clara Bow]]'s heart-shaped/[[pierrot]] lips. Years later, he exaggerated [[Joan Crawford]]'s naturally full lips to distinguish her from the many would-be stars copying the Clara Bow look he created. He also created shades specifically for them: Platinum (for [[Jean Harlow]]), Special Medium (for [[Joan Crawford]]), Dark (for [[Claudette Colbert]]) and Light Egyptian (for [[Lena Horne]]). For [[Rudolph Valentino]] he created makeup which complemented his complexion, and masked the darkness of his skin on screen.

In 1920 Max Factor gave in to his son Frank’s suggestion and officially began referring to his products as "make-up" based on the verb phrase "to make up" (one's face). Until then the term "cosmetics" had been used; the term "make-up" was considered vulgar, to be used only by people in the theater or of dubious reputation and not something to be used in polite society.

In 1922 while on holiday in Europe with his wife, Factor visited the headquarters of Leichner in Germany. He was by then the biggest retailer of their theatrical stick greasepaint, yet he was snubbed and kept waiting at reception.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Upset at this treatment he left and immediately cabled his sons to begin selling his own brand of greasepaint. Until then Factor had been making his own greasepaint for use on his clients, but had made no attempt to market it while he was representing other brands. Now he concentrated on his own products, which he offered in a collapsible tube, instead of in the stick form used by other producers. His tube greasepaint was not only more hygienic but also could be applied more thinly and evenly. Soon Max Factor's version was the leading brand.

By the 1920s his sons Davis and Frank were heavily involved in the business, with Davis the general manager and Frank assisting his father in the development of new products.

In 1925 the company received its biggest order to date when it had to complete a rush order to supply 600 gallons of light olive makeup to the set of the movie ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' to ensure that the skin color of the extras used in filming undertaken in America would match that of the darker skinned Italian extras in the scenes filmed in Italy.

In 1926 for the film ''[[Mare Nostrum (1926 film)|Mare Nostrum]]'' Max and Frank Factor developed the first waterproof theatrical make-up.

By the 1920s Max Factor was becoming known outside of the film community, which led to the company in the early 1930s developing an in-house public relations department.

==National distribution==
While Max Factor was perfectly happy for the company to remain a specialized supplier of products to the film community, his children were convinced that they could grow the company into a much larger enterprise. National distribution began in 1927 when Sales Builders, an established distribution company, obtained the rights to advertise, distribute and sell Factor’s products.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his strong connection with the film community Max Factor was able to use celebrity endorsements in advertising its products. In return for a nominal payment of US$1 to the actress the advertising would also promote the star’s latest film.

==Development of Panchromatic==
The introduction of sound-on-film led to the replacement of the old noisy carbon lights with tungsten lights, which were much hotter and created a softer light. At the same time the [[orthochromatic]] film, which until that time had been used by the industry, was replaced by super-sensitive faster [[Panchromatic]] film which noticeably darkened skin colors. These developments required six months of intensive development to create make-up compatible with the new environment. Because they had been designed for black and white film the existing products were unsuitable for everyday use. This new Panchromatic make-up was trademarked in October 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Pan-Cake==
The development of [[Technicolor]] film required the company to develop a new line of products as its existing Panchromatic make-up left a slight sheen on the skin which reflected surrounding colors. As a result of how bad they looked in color many actors and actresses refused to appear in color films. Because Max Factor was recovering from being hit by a delivery van at the time, Frank Factor took the lead in the two years it took to develop a suitable make-up, initially called the "T-D" and then renamed the "Pan-Cake" series. It was sold in a solid cake form and applied with a damp sponge which offered the advantage of concealing skin imperfections under a transparent matte finish. Its first appearance was in the film ''[[Vogues of 1938]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an immediate hit and its advantages led to women stealing it from the film sets and using it privately. Its only disadvantage for everyday use was that it could not be used at night as it made the skin too dark under all except under the powerful lights used in film studios. While Max Factor wanted to reserve the product for film use, Frank Factor was open to the commercial possibilities and began developing lighter shades. At the time the company was only able to produce enough to meet studio demand, which delayed commercial release until production could be increased. The company used the release of ''Vogues of 1938'' in August 1937 and five months later ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]'', the second film to use the make-up, to commercially release Pan-Cake to the public, backed by a color-based national advertising campaign. It immediately became the fastest and largest selling single make-up item to date, as well as the standard make-up used in all Technicolor films.

==Beauty micrometer==
{{main article|Beauty micrometer}}
In the 1930s, Factor helped to develop a mask-like device to measure the contours of subjects' faces. He called it the "Beauty Micrometer". Its purpose was to detect even barely-visible structural flaws, that might be magnified and more-noticeable on camera. A technician could then apply makeup to mask the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&amp;thinsp;'Beauty Micrometer' Analyzes Facial Flaws for Makeup|work=Modern Mechanix|accessdate=6 August 2013|url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/beauty-micrometer-analyzes-facial-flaws-for-makeup/|date=2006-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Max Factor's death==
After Max Factor's death in 1938, Frank Factor took the name [[Max Factor, Jr.]], and expanded the still private cosmetics firm, along with members of the immediate family including Sidney Factor, Louis Factor, Davis Factor and Max Firestein.

In 1939 Max Factor, Jr., began development of a smear-proof lipstick which would also both be non-irritating and not change color. A kissing machine was constructed to test the formula’s resistance to fading. The result was released in 1940 as "Tru-Color" in six shades of red.

During World War II, Max Factor developed make-up shades for use by the US Marine Corps in camouflaging faces.

In 1947 after 26 months of development by Max Factor, Jr., the company released "Pan-Stik", a cream make-up supplied in stick form and designed to take advantage of the latest changes in studio lighting and film stock. This product was quick to apply as well as non-greasy. It was released to the public in 1948 and was immediately commercially successful.

In 1951 the company expanded their range to offer a range of male shampoo, aftershave lotion, deodorant and shaving foams.

The introduction of color television lead the company to develop Max Factor Color TV Make-up, which became the standard for use in color television.

In 1955 the company released "Electrique", its first fragrance and three years later "Primitif".

In 1956 Max Factor inc. purchased Sales Builders, which had until that time handled all of their national sales and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a complete reorganization of the company’s American markets, advertising, sales and distribution division.

By the 1960s, Max Factor, Jr., Max Firestein, and grandsons Donald Factor, Alfred Jay Firestein and Chester Lee Firestein were still involved. Under his leadership, in 1965 Max Factor, Jr., established "Geminesse", a line of makeup, skincare and perfume products that were sold only by uniformed clerks in department stores. The packaging and products were different; many of the containers were designed to resemble Greek sculptures.

The early 1960s saw the company become a public company and list its Class A stock on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. This period also saw the third generation of the Factor family, Barbara Factor, Davis Jr. Factor, Donald Factor, Alfred Firestein, and Chester Firestein rising to senior positions within the company. His&lt;!-- Whose? --&gt; place of work is now a museum located in downtown Hollywood.

==Merger with Norton Simon==
By the early 1970s Sidney Factor had retired from the board, and Barbara Factor, Donald Factor and Davis Jr. Factor from the third generation had also left the company to pursue other interests. As a result, there was decreasing family involvement. Davis Factor was still board chairman while Alfred Jay Firestein was president and CEO when in 1973 the company agreed to merge with Norton Simon. This event was marred weeks later by the sudden death of Alfred Jay Firestein at the age of 48. Chester Firestein succeeded him as president of the company, only to resign three years later in 1976, to devote his time to his personal interests; he was replaced by a non-family member. His departure, together with that of Max Factor, Jr., in the same year, meant that there were now no members of Max Factor's immediate family working for the company.

During Chester Firestein’s time in charge the company expanded overseas and launched many new products including Musk For Men, UltaLucent Waterproof make-up and, in 1975, the successful [[Halston]] line of fragrances, which quickly became the second best-selling designer fragrance in the world, trailing [[Chanel No. 5]].

It was under Norton Simon that Max Factor launched "Maxi", a line of makeup aimed at a younger, more savvy consumer. Maxi sold products aimed at adolescent tastes, such as lip gloss, color rubs and "mood" lipsticks. Maxi was priced to compete with market leaders [[Bonne Bell]] and [[CoverGirl]]. Neither Maxi, Geminesse, nor Max Factor were able to lift the company's declining profits and market share.

In 1983 Norton Simon was taken over by [[JBS USA|Esmark]], by which time no one in the Factor family was involved in the company’s day-to-day operations. A year later Esmark merged with [[Beatrice Foods]], which lumped Max Factor into their [[Playtex]] beauty division and moved the Max Factor headquarters from Los Angeles to Stamford, Connecticut. In 1986, [[Ronald Perelman]] of [[Revlon]] bought the Playtex beauty division for $500 million. In 1991, Revlon sold Max Factor to [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] for $1.5 billion. {{As of|2011}}, Procter &amp; Gamble still owns the Max Factor brand.

By the first quarter of 2010, Procter &amp; Gamble had discontinued Max Factor in the United States, instead focusing its marketing efforts on the more successful CoverGirl cosmetics line. Max Factor will continue to be marketed overseas.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;Ellen Byron. "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124414272231986091 Max Factor kisses America goodbye]", &lt;!-- and while I'm normally a scrupulous WP editor, I'm going to add here, secretly, "ASSHOLES! I loved this stuff!" --&gt;''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (only opening paragraph is available free), June 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations==
Max Factor is credited with many cosmetic innovations, among which are:
*'''1914:''' Released the first cosmetic made specifically for motion pictures, a thinner greasepaint made in 12 shades. It was in cream form and packaged in jars, as opposed to the thicker stick greasepaints used for theater.
*'''1917:''' Released "Supreme Liquid Whitener" which provided the means of obtaining an alabaster smoothness on the neck, shoulder, arms and hands.
*'''1918:''' Released "Color Harmony", a range of face powder which due to its wide range of shades allowed the customizing of consistent make-up for an individual actor or actress.
*'''1925:''' Released "Max Factor's Supreme Nail Polish," a metal pot of beige-colored powder that was sprinkled on the nails and buffed with a chamois buffer, to give nails shine and some tint.
*'''1927:''' Released "Society Nail Tint," a small porcelain pot containing rose colored cream. Applied to the nail and buffed, it gave a natural rose color. "Society Nail White" was also released.  This was a tube of chalky white liquid that was applied under nail tips and left to dry. The end result resembled the modern [[French manicure]].
*'''1928:''' Developed cosmetics specifically for use in black-and-white films. Max Sr. was awarded an Oscar award for this innovation.
*'''1930''': Invented [[lip gloss]].
*'''1932''': Developed a line of "Television Make-up," specifically to meet the needs of television.
*'''1934:''' Released Liquid Nail Enamel, forerunner of today's nail polishes.

'''Micro-schooling''' is the reinvention of the one-room school house, where class size is typically smaller than that in most schools (15 students or less in a classroom) and there are mixed-age level groupings. Generally, micro-schools do not meet all 5 days of the school week, and their schedules look different than a traditional public or private school. Classes can be taught using a [[flip teaching|flipped classroom]] approach, a form of [[blended learning]], though not all micro-schools focus on technology in the same ways.  Classes tend to be more impactful due to meeting fewer times in the week. Classes may use instructional methods, ranging from traditional lecture-based approaches to hands-on and activity-based approaches.  Micro-schooling is viewed as a replacement for various school paradigms that are standard worldwide.

Micro-schooling is seen as being in between homeschooling and private schooling and is designed to offer a full-year of education at around $10,000 or often less. Its growing popularity stems from a general dissatisfaction of how schools (public and private) often structure their content. Homeschool families are drawn to the idea because of how micro-schooling establishes a core set of learning experiences similar to what might be found in normal schools that parents can then expand on and individualize for their children. Private and public school parents see micro-schooling as an affordable option that provides their children with a more worldly education that some might consider as [[Constructivism (learning theory)]] in approach.

== History ==
Micro-schooling began in the UK as small [[independent school]]s, privately funded by groups of like minded parents, with no dedicated premises (home rotation) led by a full-time paid [[tutor]]s (as opposed to [[homeschooling]] where a parent tutors their own child (or children)). Cushla Barry first coined the term micro-schooling in February 2010. It has also been explored by education writers like Anya Kementz, who spoke about the return of the one-room school house &lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/07/02/326196530/the-return-of-the-one-room-schoolhouse|title=The Return Of The One-Room Schoolhouse|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
It is set to be a rising trend in the UK, where getting your child into a good local [[school]] is becoming increasingly difficult due to underfunding and overcrowding. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative party]] alluded to the concept of Micro-Schooling in 2007 with their concept of Pioneer schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556740/Tories-propose-parent-run-pioneer-schools.html|title=Tories propose parent-run 'pioneer schools'|first=Brendan Carlin, Political|last=Correspondent|date=6 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York City===
In the early 2000s, as the cost of private school became increasingly exorbitant and availability of spaces declined, a movement of preschool co-ops and homeschool co-ops started by teachers and parents started emerging to directly meet the needs of children in the community.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; CottageClass is one company which supports the creation of microschools, with fifteen schools operating in Brooklyn alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2018/03/01/cottageclass-homeschooling-startup|title=Brooklyn's new thing is taking your kids out of school and using this startup instead - Technical.ly Brooklyn|date=1 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== San Francisco Bay Area ===
Since 2010, micro-schooling has evolved in scope from the simple idea of privately funded groups of learners to a full concept of a specialized learning environment dedicated to ensuring individual understanding of the subjects being taught. Students attend a school for up to 2 days a week and cover a more diverse set of topics and subjects than would otherwise be accessible in small, private groups.

== Pedagogy ==
In order to provide the same amount of learning in fewer days, micro-schooling has of late become associated with a movement in education to provide students with hands-on and activity-based learning that often pairs experts with the students in the classroom. The overall approach might be considered [[Constructivism (learning theory)]] in approach. Lecture, worksheets, and book work are often eschewed in favor of carefully constructed activities that are designed to help the learner to develop their own personal understanding. In this model, teachers will typically avoid making definitive statements of understanding to the students and will instead help the students work towards their own understanding. It is uncommon to see letter grading in micro-schools. Micro-schools will often pair suggested extracurricular activities, field trips, programs, books, and other multimedia with their classes so that students will have a broader exposure to content than what is just offered in the classroom.

=== Learning Outcomes ===
Despite the relatively short time frame that micro-schools have existed, there has been evidence that shows students are often learning more concepts in the classroom in a shorter time frame. It is unclear whether or not those students are retaining those concepts over longer periods of time due to the short time frame that micro-schooling has existed.

=== National Standards ===
As a potential point of controversy, micro-schooling often does not consider national standards as relevant to the educational needs of students and instead seeks to develop content and curriculum that helps create a passion for learning in the students that focuses on real-world knowledge and skills. Educators involved with micro-schooling often feel that standards hamper their flexibility to develop engaging and enriching curriculum. Micro-schools will often choose their own set of standards and it can readily be shown that many of those standards, but not all, map to the [[Common Core]]. In many cases the content covered by micro-schools can exceed the standards provided by the state, particularly in regard to the four key content areas of mathematics, language arts, history, and especially science.

The '''Mutoscope''' was an early [[film|motion picture]] device, invented by [[W.K.L. Dickson]] and [[Herman Casler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=David |date=1996 |title=From Peep Show to Palace: the Birth of American Film |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=56 |isbn=0-231-10338-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later patented by [[Herman Casler]] on November 21, 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Spehr, Paul C. (2000). "Unaltered to Date: Developing 35mm Film," in ''Moving Images: From Edison to the Webcam'', ed. John Fullerton and Astrid Söderbergh Widding, pp. 3–28 (p. 17). Sydney: John Libbey &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]], it did not project on a screen and provided viewing to only one person at a time. Cheaper and simpler than the Kinetoscope, the system, marketed by the American Mutoscope Company (later the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]]), quickly dominated the coin-in-the-slot [[peep show|peep-show]] business.

==Operation==
The Mutoscope worked on the same principle as the [[flip book]]. The individual image frames were conventional black-and-white, silver-based photographic prints on tough, flexible opaque cards. Rather than being bound into a booklet, the cards were attached to a circular core, rather like a huge [[Rolodex]]. A reel typically held about 850 cards, giving a viewing time of about a minute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gameroomshow.com/shop/mutoscopes-reels/ Mutoscopes &amp; Reels], [https://www.gameroomshow.com Gameroom Show].&lt;/ref&gt; The reel with cards attached had a total diameter of about ten inches (25&amp;nbsp;cm); the individual cards had dimensions of about {{frac|2|3|4}}"&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|7|8}}" (7&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4.75&amp;nbsp;cm).

Mutoscopes were coin-operated. The patron viewed the cards through a single lens enclosed by a hood, similar to the viewing hood of a [[stereoscope]]. The cards were generally lit electrically, but the reel was driven by means of a geared-down hand crank. Each machine held only a single reel and was dedicated to the presentation of a single short subject, described by a poster affixed to the machine.

The patron could control the presentation speed only to a limited degree. The crank could be turned in both directions, but this did not reverse the playing of the reel. Nor could the patron extend viewing time by stopping the crank because the flexible images were bent into the proper viewing position by tension applied from forward cranking. Stopping the crank reduced the forward tension on the reels causing the reel to go backwards and the picture to move from the viewing position; a spring in the mechanism turned off the light and in some models brought down a shutter which completely blocked out the picture.

==Manufacture==
Mutoscopes were originally manufactured from 1895 to 1909 for the American Mutoscope Company, later American Mutoscope and Biograph Company (1899) by the Marvin &amp; Casler Co., Canastota, New York formed by two of the founding Managers of American Mutoscope Company. In the 1920s the Mutoscope was licensed to William Rabkin who started his own company, the [[International Mutoscope Reel Company]], which manufactured new reels and also machines from 1926 until 1949. The term "Mutoscope" is no longer a registered trademark in the United States.

==Usage==
Mutoscopes were a popular feature of [[penny arcade (venue)|amusement arcades]] and [[Pier#Pleasure piers|pleasure piers]] in the UK until the introduction of [[decimalisation|decimal coinage]] in 1971.  The coin mechanisms were difficult to convert, and many machines were subsequently destroyed; some were exported to Denmark where pornography had recently been legalised. The typical arcade installation included multiple machines offering a mixture of fare. Both in the early days and during the revival, that mixture usually included "girlie" reels which ran the gamut from risqué to outright soft-core pornography. It was, however, common for these reels to have suggestive titles that implied more than the reel actually delivered. The title of one such reel, ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', became a by-word, and Mutoscopes are commonly known in the UK as "What-the-Butler-Saw machines." (What the butler saw, presumably through a keyhole, was a woman partially disrobing.)

==Public response==
''The San Francisco Call'' printed a short piece about the Mutoscope in 1898, which claimed that the device was extremely popular: "Twenty machines, all different and amusing views...are crowded day and night with sightseers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 November 1898 |title=The Mutoscope |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18981106.2.142&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-Mutoscope-------1 |newspaper=The San Francisco Call |location=San Francisco, CA |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just a few months later, the same newspaper published an editorial railing against the Mutoscope and similar machines: "...a new instrument has been placed in the hands of the vicious for the corruption of youth...These vicious exhibitions are displayed in San Francisco with an effrontery that is as audacious as it is shameless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 April 1899 |title=The Corruption of Youth |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18990401.2.76&amp;srpos=9&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-Mutoscope-------1 |newspaper=The San Francisco Call |location=San Francisco, CA |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, ''[[The Times]]'' also printed a letter inveighing against "vicious demoralising picture shows in the penny-in-the-slot machines. It is hardly possible to exaggerate the corruption of the young that comes from exhibiting under a strong light, nude female figures represented as living and moving, going into and out of baths, sitting as artists' models etc. Similar exhibitions took place at [[Rhyl]] in the men's lavatory, but, owing to public denunciation, they have been stopped."

'''Native American identity in the United States''' is an evolving topic based on the struggle to define "[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]" or "(American) Indian" both for people who consider themselves Native American and for people who do not.  Some people seek an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that will provide for a stable definition for legal, social, and personal purposes.  There are a number of different factors which have been used to define "Indianness," and the source and potential use of the definition play a role in what definition is used. Facets which characterize "Indianness" include [[culture]], [[society]], [[genes]]/[[biology]], [[law]], and [[self-identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003), Paredes (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  An important question is whether the definition should be dynamic and changeable across time and situation, or whether it is possible to define "Indianness" in a static way.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"&gt;Peroff (1997) p487&lt;/ref&gt;  The dynamic definitions may be based in how Indians adapt and adjust to dominant society, which may be called an "oppositional process" by which the boundaries between Indians and the dominant groups are maintained.  Another reason for dynamic definitions is the process of "[[ethnogenesis]]", which is the process by which the ethnic identity of the group is developed and renewed as social organizations and cultures evolve.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  The question of identity, especially [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] identity, is common in many societies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;

The future of their identity is extremely important to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s.  Activist [[Russell Means]] spoke frequently about the crumbling Indian way of life, the loss of traditions, languages, and sacred places. He was concerned that there may soon be no more Native Americans, only "Native American Americans, like [[Polish American]]s and [[Italian American]]s." As the number of Indians has grown (ten times as many today as in 1890), the number who carry on tribal traditions shrinks (one fifth as many as in 1890), as has been common among many ethnic groups over time.  Means said, "We might speak our language, we might look like Indians and sound like Indians, but we won’t be Indians."&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (1997) p492&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There are various ways in which Indian identity has been defined.  Some definitions seek universal applicability, while others only seek definitions for particular purposes, such as for tribal membership or for the purposes of legal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  The individual seeks to have a personal identity that matches social and legal definitions, although perhaps any definition will fail to categorize correctly the identity of everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

American Indians were perhaps clearly identifiable at the turn of the 20th century, but today the concept is contested.  Malcolm Margolin, co-editor of ''News From Native California'' muses, "I don’t know what an Indian is... [but] Some people are clearly Indian, and some are clearly not."&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (1997) p489 quoting Fost (1991) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cherokee]] Chief (from 1985–1995) [[Wilma Mankiller]] echoes: "An Indian is an Indian regardless of the degree of Indian blood or which little government card they do or do not possess."&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield p107-108 quoted from Hales 1990b: 3A - Hales, Donna. 1990a "Tribe Touts Unregistered Artists", Muskogee (Okla.) ''Daily Phoenix'', September 3, 1990 1A 10A&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, it is difficult to know what might be meant by any Native American ''racial'' identity.  Race is a disputed term, but is often said to be a [[Race (human classification)|social (or political)]] rather than [[Race (biology)|biological construct]].  The issue of Native American racial identity was discussed by [[Steve Russell (writer)|Steve Russell]] (2002, p68), "American Indians have always had the theoretical option of removing themselves from a tribal community and becoming legally white.  American law has made it easy for Indians to disappear because that disappearance has always been necessary to the '[[Manifest Destiny]]' that the United States span the continent that was, after all, occupied."  Russell contrasts this with the reminder that Native Americans are "members of communities before members of a race."&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2002) p68 is quoting López (1994) p55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional===
[[File:teepee-logcabin.jpg|thumb|250px|Reservation life has often been a blend of the traditional and the contemporary. In 1877, this Lakota family living at South Dakota's Rose Bud Agency had both [[tipi]]s and log cabins.]]
Traditional definitions of "Indianness" are also important.  There is a sense of "peoplehood" which links Indianness to sacred traditions, places, and shared history as indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  This definition transcends academic and legal terminology.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  Language is also seen as an important part of identity, and learning [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native languages]], especially for youth in a community, is an important part in tribal survival.&lt;ref&gt;Etheridge (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Indian artists find traditional definitions especially important. [[Crow Nation|Crow]] poet [[Henry Real Bird]] offers his own definition, "An Indian is one who offers tobacco to the ground, feeds the water, and prays to the four winds in his own language."  Pulitzer Prize-winning [[Kiowa]] author [[N. Scott Momaday]] gives a definition that is less spiritual but still based in the traditions and experience of a person and their family, "An Indian is someone who thinks of themselves as an Indian.  But that's not so easy to do and one has to earn the entitlement somehow.  You have to have a certain experience of the world in order to formulate this idea.  I consider myself an Indian; I've had the experience of an Indian.  I know how my father saw the world, and his father before him."&lt;ref&gt;Bordewich (1996) p67&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructed as an imagined community ===
Some social scientists relate the uncertainty of Native American identity to the theory of the constructed nature of identity.  Many social scientists discuss the construction of identity.  [[Benedict Anderson]]'s "[[imagined communities]]" are an example.  However, some see construction of identity as being part of how a group remembers its past, tells its stories, and interprets its [[myths]].  Thus [[cultural identity]] is made within the discourses of history and culture.  Identity thus may not be a fact based in the essence of a person, but a positioning, based in politics and social situations.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1997) p53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood quantum===
A common source of definition for an individual's being Indian is based on their blood (ancestry) quantum (often one-fourth) or documented Indian heritage.  Almost two-thirds of all Indian federally recognized Indian tribes in the United States require a certain blood quantum for membership.&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003) p16&lt;/ref&gt; Indian heritage is a requirement for membership in most American Indian Tribes.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  The [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 used three criteria: tribal membership, ancestral descent, and blood quantum (one half).  This was very influential in using blood quantum to restrict the definition of Indian.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p284&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of blood quantum is seen by some as problematic as Indians [[interracial marriage|marry out to other groups]] at a higher rate than any other [[demography of the United States|United States ethnic or racial category]].  This could ultimately lead to their absorption into the rest of multiracial American society.&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (1997) p487 gives the rate of interracial marriage for Native Americans as 75%, whites as 5% and blacks as 8%&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence on tribal lands===
[[File:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|left|thumb|300px|BIA map of reservations in the United States]]
Related to the remembrance and practice of traditions is the residence on tribal lands and [[Indian reservation]]s.  Peroff (2002) emphasizes the role that proximity to other Native Americans (and ultimately proximity to tribal lands) plays in one's identity as a Native American.&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (2002) uses complexity theory methods to model the maintenance of traditions and self-identity based on proximity.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction by others===
[[File:Bismarck Indian School.jpg|thumb|left|Students at the Bismarck Indian School in the early twentieth century.]]
European conceptions of "Indianness" are notable both for how they influence how American Indians see themselves and for how they have persisted as stereotypes which may negatively affect treatment of Indians.  The [[noble savage]] stereotype is famous, but [[European colonization of the Americas|American colonists]] held other stereotypes as well.  For example, some colonists imagined Indians as living in a state similar to their own ancestors, for example the [[Pict]]s, [[Gaul]]s, and [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] before "[[Julius Caesar]] with his [[Roman legion]]s (or some other) had ... laid the ground to make us tame and civil."&lt;ref&gt;quoted from Robert Johnson, promoter for the fledgling Virginia Colony in Dyar (2003) p819&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th century, particularly until [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]]'s tenure as Commissioner of Indian Affairs began in 1933, various policies of the United States federal and state governments amounted to an attack on Indian cultural identity and attempt to force assimilation.  These policies included but were not limited to the banning of traditional religious ceremonies; forcing traditional hunter-gatherer people to begin farming, often on land that was unsuitable and produced few or no crops; forced cutting of hair; coercing "conversion" to [[Christianity]] by withholding rations; coercing Indian parents to send their children to boarding schools where the use of [[Native American languages]] was not permitted; freedom of speech restrictions; and restricted allowances of travel between reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2002) p66-67&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Southwest sections of the U.S. under Spanish control until 1810, where the majority (80%) of inhabitants were Indigenous, Spanish government officials had similar policies.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2002) p67&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have pointed to a connection between social identity of Native Americans and their political status as members of a tribe.rev&lt;ref&gt; Ray (2007) p399&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 561 [[List of Native American Tribal Entities|federally recognized tribal governments]] in the United States, which are recognized as having the right to establish their own legal requirements for membership.&lt;ref&gt;This right was upheld by the US Supreme Court in [[Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez]] in 1978, which is discussed in Ray (2007) p403, see also {{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/200501281313241CJsamohT0.7689478.html|work=america.gov|title=The U.S. Relationship To American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes|accessdate=February 8, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519065837/https://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/200501281313241CJsamohT0.7689478.html|archivedate=May 19, 2009|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent times, legislation related to Indians uses the "political" definition of identifying as Indians those who are members of federally recognized tribes. Most often given is the two-part definition: an "Indian" is someone who is a member of an Indian tribe and an "Indian tribe" is any tribe, band, nation, or organized Indian community recognized by the United States.

The government and many tribes prefer this definition because it allows the tribes to determine the meaning of "Indianness" in their own membership criteria.  However, some still criticize this saying that the federal government's historic role in setting certain conditions on the nature of membership criteria means that this definition does not transcend federal government influence.&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p299"&gt;Brownell (2001) p299&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus in some sense, one has greater claim to a Native American identity if one belongs to a federally recognized tribe, recognition that many who claim Indian identity do not have.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel remarks that 1,878,285 people marked Native American as their ethnicity on the 1990 US Census, while the number of members of federally recognized tribes is much smaller, Nagel (1995) p948&lt;/ref&gt;  Holly Reckord, an anthropologist who heads the BIA Branch of Acknowledgment and Recognition, discusses the most common outcome for those who seek membership: "We check and find that they haven't a trace of Indian ancestry, yet they are still totally convinced that they are Indians.  Even if you have a trace of Indian blood, why do you want to select that for your identity, and not your Irish or Italian? It's not clear why, but at this point in time, a lot of people want to be Indian.".&lt;ref&gt;Bordewich (1996) 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990|Arts and Crafts Act]] of 1990 attempts to take into account the limits of definitions based in federally recognized tribal membership.  In the act, having the status of a state-recognized Indian tribe is discussed, as well as having tribal recognition as an "Indian artisan" independent of tribal membership.  In certain circumstances, this allows people who identify as Indian to legally label their products as "Indian made", even when they are not members of a federally recognized tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p313&lt;/ref&gt;  In legislative hearings, one Indian artist, whose mother is not Indian but whose father is [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] and who was raised on a Seneca reservation, said, "I do not question the rights of the tribes to set whatever criteria they want for enrollment eligibility; but in my view, that is the extent of their rights, to say who is an enrolled Seneca or [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] or [[Navajo people|Navajo]] or [[Cheyenne]] or any other tribe.  Since there are mixed bloods with enrollment numbers and some of those with very small percentages of genetic Indian ancestry, I don't feel they have the right to say to those of us without enrollment numbers that we are not of Indian heritage, only that we are not enrolled.... To say that I am not [Indian] and to prosecute me for telling people of my Indian heritage is to deny me some of my [[civil liberties]]...and constitutes racial discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p314&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics believe that using federal laws to define "Indian" allows continued government control over Indians, even as the government seeks to establish a sense of deference to tribal sovereignty.  Critics say Indianness becomes a rigid legal term defined by the BIA, rather than an expression of tradition, history, and culture.  For instance, some groups which claim descendants from tribes that predate European contact have not been able to achieve federal recognition. On the other hand, Indian tribes have participated in setting policy with BIA as to how tribes should be recognized.  According to Rennard Strickland, an Indian Law scholar, the federal government uses the process of recognizing groups to "divide and conquer Indians: "the question of who is 'more' or 'most' Indian may draw people away from common concerns."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-identification===
{{Further|List of people of self-identified Cherokee ancestry}}
In some cases, one's opinion about one's self is sufficient to define one as Indian.  One can often choose to identify as Indian without outside verification when filling out a census form, a college application, or writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt; A "self-identified Indian" is a person who may not satisfy the legal requirements which define a Native American according to the United States government or a single tribe, but who understands and expresses her own identity as Native American.&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003) p82&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many people who do not satisfy tribal requirements identify themselves as Native American - whether due to biology, culture, or some other reason.  The [[United States census]] allows citizens to check any ethnicity without requirements of validation.  Thus, the census allows individuals to self-identify as Indian, merely by checking the racial category, "Native American/Alaska Native".&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p276-277 notes that much of the $180 billion dollars a year in federal money for the benefit of Indians are apportioned on the basis of this census population&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, about 60 percent of the more than 1.8 million persons identifying themselves in the census as American Indian were actually enrolled in a federally recognized tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton 1997, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Using self identification allows both uniformity and includes many different ideas of "Indianness".&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p315"&gt;Brownell (2001) p315&lt;/ref&gt;  It also avoids marginalizing the nearly half a million who receive no benefits because 
* they are not enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe, or
* they are full members of tribes which have never been recognized, or
* they are members of tribes whose recognition was terminated by the government during programs in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p299"/&gt;

Identity is in some way a personal issue; based on the way one feels about oneself and one's experiences.  Horse (2001) describes five influences on self-identity as Indian:
*"The extent to which one is grounded in one’s Native American language and culture, one’s cultural identity";
*"The validity of one’s American Indian genealogy";
*"The extent to which one holds a traditional American Indian general philosophy or worldview (emphasizing balance and harmony and drawing on Indian spirituality)";
*"One’s self-concept as an American Indian"; and
*"One’s enrollment (or lack of it) in a tribe."&lt;ref&gt;Horse (2005) p65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Kansas]] sociologist Joane Nagel traces the tripling in the number of Americans reporting American Indian as their race in the U.S. Census from 1960 to 1990 (from 523,591 to 1,878,285) to federal Indian policy, American ethnic politics, and American Indian political activism.  Much of the population "growth" was due to "[[ethnic switching]]", where people who previously marked one group, later mark another.  This is made possible by our increasing stress on ethnicity as a social construct.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel (1995) p948&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since 2000 [[self-identification]] in US censuses has allowed individuals to check multiple ethnic categories, which is a factor in the increased American Indian population since the 1990 census.&lt;ref&gt;Russell 149&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, self-identification is problematic on many levels.  It is sometimes said, in fun, that the largest tribe in the United States may be the "[[Poseur|Wantabes]]".&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p315"/&gt;

Garroutte identifies some practical problems with self-identification as a policy, quoting the struggles of Indian service providers who deal with many people who claim ancestors, some steps removed, who were Indian. She quotes a social worker, "Hell, if all that was real, there are more Cherokees in the world than there are [[Chinese people|Chinese]]."&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003) p83&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Personal reasons for self-identification ====
Many individuals seek broader definitions of Indian for personal reasons.  Some people whose careers involve the fact that they emphasize Native American heritage and self-identify as Native American face difficulties if their appearance, behavior, or tribal membership status does not conform to legal and social definitions.  Some have a longing for recognition.  Cynthia Hunt, who self-identifies as a member of the [[state-recognized]] [[Lumbee]] tribe, says: "I feel as if I'm not a real Indian until I've got that BIA stamp of approval .... You're told all your life that you're Indian, but sometimes you want to be that kind of Indian that everybody else accepts as Indian."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p275&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance that one "look Indian" can be greater than one's biological or legal status.  Native American Literature professor Becca Gercken-Hawkins writes about the trouble of recognition for those who do not look Indian; "I self-identify as Cherokee and [[Irish American]], and even though I do not look especially Indian with my dark curly hair and light skin, I easily meet my tribe's blood quantum standards.  My family has been working for years to get the documentation that will allow us to be enrolled members of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].  Because of my appearance and my lack of enrollment status, I expect questions regarding my identity, but even so, I was surprised when a fellow graduate student advised me—in all seriousness—to [[straighten my hair]] and work on a tan before any interviews.  Thinking she was joking, I asked if I should put a feather in my hair, and she replied with a straight face that a feather might be a bit much, but I should at least wear traditional Native jewelry."&lt;ref&gt;Gercken-Hawkins (2003) p200&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherokee/[[Choctaw]] author [[Louis Owens]] discusses his feelings about his status of not being a real Indian because he's not enrolled. "Because growing up in different times, I naively thought that Indian was something we were, not something we did or had or were required to prove on demand. Listening to my mother's stories about [[Oklahoma]], about brutally hard lives and dreams that cut across the fabric of every experience, I thought I was Indian."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Marie Garroutte opens with these lines in her book, ''Real Indians: identity and the survival of Native America''. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic struggles==
[[Florida State]] anthropologist J. Anthony Paredes considers the question of Indianness that may be asked about pre-ceramic peoples (what modern archaeologists call the [[Archaic period in the Americas|"Early" and "Middle Archaic" period]]), pre-maize burial mound cultures, etc.  Paredes asks, "Would any &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] high priest&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; have been any less awed than ourselves to come upon a so-called [[Paleo-Indian]] hunter hurling a spear at a woolly [[mastodon]]?"  His question reflects the point that indigenous cultures are themselves the products of millennia of history and change.&lt;ref&gt;Paredes (1995) p346&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of "Indianness" was different in colonial times.  Integration into Indian tribes was not difficult, as Indians typically accepted persons based not on ethnic or racial characteristics, but on learnable and acquirable designators such as "language, culturally appropriate behavior, social affiliation, and loyalty."&lt;ref name="Dyar 2003 p823"&gt;Dyar (2003) p823&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Indian captives were often adopted into society, including, famously, [[Mary Jemison]].  As a side note, the "[[Running the gauntlet|gauntlet]]" was a ceremony that was often misunderstood as a form of torture, or punishment but within Indian society was seen as a ritual way for the captives to leave their European society and become a tribal member.&lt;ref name="Dyar 2003 p823"/&gt;

[[File:John Ross of the Cherokee.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee chief John Ross]]
Since the mid-19th century, controversy and competition have worked both within and outside tribes, as societies evolved. In the early 1860s, novelist [[John Rollin Ridge]] led a group of delegates to [[Washington D.C.]] in an attempt to gain federal recognition for a "Southern Cherokee Nation" which was a faction that was opposed to the leadership of rival faction leader and Cherokee Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]].&lt;ref name="Christiensen 1992"&gt;Christiensen 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, [[Arthur C. Parker]], [[Carlos Montezuma]], and others founded the [[Society of American Indians]] as the first national association founded and run primarily by Native Americans.  The group campaigned for full citizenship for Indians, and other reforms, goals similar to other groups and fraternal clubs, which led to blurred distinctions between the different groups and their members.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2005) p141&lt;/ref&gt;  With different groups and people of different ethnicities involved in parallel and often competing groups, accusations that one was not a real Indian was a painful accusation for those involved.  In 1918, [[Arapaho]] Cleaver Warden testified in hearings related to Indian religious ceremonies, "We only ask a fair and impartial trial by reasonable white people, not half-breeds who do not know a bit of their ancestors or kindred. A true Indian is one who helps for a race and not that secretary of the [[Society of American Indians]]."

In the 1920s, a famous court case was set to investigate the ethnic identity of a woman known as "[[Princess Chinquilla]]" and her associate [[Red Fox James]] (aka Skiuhushu).&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2005) p139&lt;/ref&gt; Chinquilla was a New York woman who claimed to have been separated from her Cheyenne parents at birth.  She and James created a fraternal club which was to counter existing groups "founded by white people to help the red race" in that it was founded by Indians.  The club's opening received much praise for supporting this purpose, and was seen as authentic; it involved a Council Fire, the peace pipe, and speeches by [[Robert Ely]], [[White Horse Eagle]], and [[American Indian Defense Association]] President Haven Emerson.  In the 1920s, fraternal clubs were common in New York, and titles such as "princess" and "chief" were bestowed by the club to Natives and non-Natives.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2005) p143&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed non-Natives to "try on" Indian identities.

Just as the struggle for recognition is not new, Indian entrepreneurship based on that recognition is not new.  An example is a stipulation of the [[Creek Treaty of 1805]] that gave [[Creek people|Creeks]] the exclusive right to operate certain ferries and "houses of entertainment" along a federal road from [[Ocmulgee, Georgia]] to [[Mobile, Alabama]], as the road went over parts of Creek Nation land purchased as an easement.&lt;ref&gt;Paredes (1995) p357&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unity and nationalism==

[[File:Tecumseh02.jpg|right|thumb|1848 drawing of Tecumseh was based on a sketch done from life in 1808.]]
The issue of Indianness had somewhat expanded meaning in the 1960s with Indian nationalist movements such as the [[American Indian Movement]].  The American Indian Movement unified nationalist identity was in contrast to the "brotherhood of tribes" nationalism of groups like the [[National Indian Youth Council]] and the [[National Congress of American Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonney (1977) p210&lt;/ref&gt;  This unified Indian identity has been cited to the teachings of 19th century [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]] to unify all Indians against "white oppression."&lt;ref&gt;Particularly cited is Tecumseh's concern with the alienation of Indian lands and his 1812 statement about Indian unity as discussed in Bonney (1977) p229&lt;/ref&gt; The movements of the 1960s changed dramatically how Indians see their identity, both as separate from whites, as a member of a tribe, and as a member of a unified category encompassing all Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Different tribes have unique cultures, histories, and situations that have made particular the question of identity in each tribe.  Tribal membership may be based on descent, blood quantum, and/or reservation habitation.

===Cherokee===

Historically, race was not a factor in the acceptance of individuals into [[Cherokee society]], since historically, the [[Cherokee people]] viewed their self-identity as a political rather than racial distinction.&lt;ref&gt;AIRFA Federal Precedence Applied in State Court {{cite web |url=http://www.nativeamericanchurch.net/stott.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230402/http://www.nativeamericanchurch.net/stott.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Going far back into antiquity based upon existing social and historical evidence as well as oral traditions among the [[Cherokee]] themselves, the Cherokee society was best described as an Indian Republic. Race and [[blood quantum]] are not factors in [[Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma]] tribal citizenship eligibility. To be considered a citizen in the Cherokee Nation, an individual needs a direct Indian ancestor listed on the [[Dawes Rolls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherokee.org/home.aspx?section=services&amp;service=Registration&amp;ID=8sRG9ZCF7PE=|title=Cherokee Nation  &gt; Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe currently has members who also have African, Latino, Asian, white and other ancestry, and an estimated 75% of tribal members are less than one-quarter Indian by blood.&lt;ref&gt;https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/politics/disappearing-indians-part-ii-the-hypocrisy-of-race-in-deciding-whos-enrolled/&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[Cherokee heritage groups]] operate in the [[Southeastern U.S.]].

Theda Perdue (2000) recounts a story from "before the American Revolution" where a black slave named Molly is accepted as a Cherokee as a "replacement" for a woman who was beaten to death by her white husband.  According to Cherokee tradition, vengeance for the woman's death was required for her soul to find peace, and the husband was able to prevent his own execution by fleeing to the town of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]] (where according to Cherokee Law he was safe) and purchasing Molly as an exchange.  When the wives family accepted Molly, later known as "Chickaw," she became a part of their clan (the [[Deer Clan]]), and thus Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheritance was largely matrilineal, and kinship and clan membership was of primary importance until around 1810, when the seven [[Cherokee clans]] began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government.  Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established.   When in 1825, the National Council extended citizenship to biracial children of Cherokee men, the matrilineal definition of clans was broken and clan membership no longer defined Cherokee citizenship.  These ideas were largely incorporated into the 1827 Cherokee constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000) p564&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution did, state that "No person who is of negro or mulatlo [sic]parentage, either by the father or mother side, shall be eligible to hold any office of profit, honor or trust under this Government," with an exception for, "negroes and descendants of white and Indian men by negro women who may have been set free."&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000) p564-565&lt;/ref&gt; Although by this time, some Cherokee considered clans to be anachronistic, this feeling may have been more widely held among the elite than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000) p566&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus even in the initial constitution, the Cherokee reserved the right to define who was and was not Cherokee as a political rather than racial distinction.  Novelist [[John Rollin Ridge]] led a group of delegates to Washington D.C. as early as the 1860s in an attempt to gain federal recognition for a "Southern Cherokee Nation" which was a faction that was opposed to the leadership of rival faction leader and Cherokee Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]].&lt;ref name="Christiensen 1992"/&gt;

===Navajo===
Most of the 158,633 [[Navajo people|Navajo]]s enumerated in the 1980 census and the 219,198 Navajos enumerated in the 1990 census were enrolled in the [[Navajo Nation]], which is the nation with the largest number of enrolled citizens.  It is notable as there is only a small number of people who identify as Navajo who are not registered.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lumbee===

When the [[Lumbee]] of [[North Carolina]] petitioned for recognition in 1974, many federally recognized tribes adamantly opposed them.  These tribes made no secret of their fear that passage of the legislation would dilute services to historically recognized tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p304&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lumbee were at one point known by the state as the Cherokee tribe of Robeson County and applied for federal benefits under that name in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2007"&gt;Barrett (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] has been at the forefront of the opposition of the Lumbee.  It is sometimes noted that if granted full federal recognition, the designation would bring tens of millions of dollars in federal benefits, and also the chance to open a casino along Interstate 95 (which would compete with a nearby Eastern Cherokee Nation casino).&lt;ref name="Barrett 2007"/&gt;

'''''Nucai''''' ({{zh|c=奴才|p=Núcái}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{mongolUnicode|ᠠᡥᠠ}}, [[Transliterations of Manchu|Mölendroff]]: ''aha'') is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term that can be translated as, 'lackey', 'yes-man', 'servant', 'slave', or a 'person of unquestioning obedience'. It originated in the tribes of northeastern China as a negative and derogatory term, often reserved for insult for someone perceived to be useless or incompetent. However, it was used most prominently in the [[Qing dynasty]] as a [[Chinese honorifics|deprecatory first-person pronoun]] by [[Manchu people|Manchu]] officials at court when addressing the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]]. [[Han Chinese]] officials were forbidden from using the term for self-address; they used "''chen''" ({{zh|c=臣}}) instead.

==Usage==
During the [[Qing dynasty]], addressing oneself as ''nucai'' became a sort of 'privilege' reserved for [[Manchu people|ethnic Manchu]] officials. Officials of [[Han Chinese]] origin were forbidden to address themselves as ''nucai'', and must address themselves as ''chen'' ({{lang|zh|臣}}, literally "your subject").&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/theory/2006-10/03/content_5144504.htm|title="奴才"一称的特殊地位 (The special status of "nucai")|last=Yi|first=Shuisheng|date=2006-10-03|publisher=Xinhua|language=Chinese|accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule was applied both in written and spoken situations. Such a rule surrounding the term ''nucai'' reflected that the relationship between Manchu officials and the Emperor as that between "master and servant" in a household, while that between Han Chinese officials and the Emperor as simply between ruler and subject.&lt;ref name=ma/&gt; The equivalent Manchu term for ''nucai'' is ''[[Slavery in seventeenth-century China|booi aha]]''. The exclusivity of the term ''nucai'' meant that Han Chinese officials are given lower status at court, even though ''chen'' was historically considered as a more prestigious form of self-address.

In 1773, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] received a joint [[Official Communications of the Chinese Empire#Memorials|memorial]] about [[imperial examination]]s from Manchu official Tianbao and Han Chinese official Ma Renlong. Both officials jointly signed the memorial as ''nucai'', angering the Qianlong Emperor, who accused Ma Renlong of 'pretending to be a ''nucai''' when he was not, and later decreed that if a Han Chinese and Manchu official were jointly petitioning the Emperor, they must uniformly use ''chen'' instead of ''nucai''.&lt;ref name=ma/&gt;

Chinese scholar Li Xinyu wrote that although the words of "master and servant" (i.e. ''nucai'') has been institutionally abolished with the Chinese monarchy in 1911, people's "''nucai'' mentality" ([[pejorative]] phrase for an attitude of servitude to the state or other authority figures) still exists in contemporary China.&lt;ref name=lxy&gt;{{cite web|date=3 October 2008|last=Li|first=Xinyu|title=李新宇：皇帝崇拜与奴才意识 (The worship of Emperors and the ''Nucai'' Mentality)|url=http://www.aisixiang.com/data/detail.php?id=21166#|publisher=Aisixiang|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social critics point out that there is a degree of support for the so-called "''nucai'' mentality" within elite circles, particularly by those who adhere by "[[Asian values]]". At the 2009 [[Boao Forum for Asia]], actor [[Jackie Chan]] criticized [[Taiwan]]ese and [[Hong Kong]] society as "chaotic" because they are "too free", saying "I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If we're not being controlled, we'll just do what we want."&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/18/jackie-chan-chinese-peopl_n_188541.html|title=Jackie Chan: Chinese People Need To Be Controlled|date=2009-04-18|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing controversy, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] of Taiwan attacked Chan for having "too strong of a ''nucai'' mentality" ({{lang|zh|奴才意識}}) and demanded that the [[Taipei]] Municipal Government remove Chan as the spokesman of the Taipei [[Deaflympics]].&lt;ref name=huff/&gt;

'''Pierce Boston''' is a 378-feet-tall tower located in the [[Fenway–Kenmore]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], Massachusetts (USA), at the corner of [[Boylston Street]] and [[Brookline Avenue]]. The 30-story building is currently under construction as a [[mixed-use development]] with condo, apartment, and retail components.

Originally proposed in 2013 as a 22-story residential tower called the Point,&lt;ref&gt;Casey Ross, [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-34266768.html "Going Up; Plan for Boylston, Brookline Corner Would Be Latest Step in Fenway Redevelopment"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 16, 2013 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the project was enlarged in 2015 to become a 30 story, $290 million project with 240 apartments, 109 condominiums, and retail space.  The glass tower will be the tallest in the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Newsham, [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-37711345.html "Signature Fenway Tower's Height Grows"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 27, 2015 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce Boston is located across the street from the [[Landmark Center (Boston)|Landmark Center]]. It is the first Boston project for the Miami-based architecture firm [[Arquitectonica]]. The tower will be clad in glass and metal, but with paneling in a pattern intended to reflect the masonry buildings around it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/791582/arquitectonica-designs-new-luxury-residential-tower-for-boston "Arquitectonica Designs New Luxury Residential Tower for Boston"], [[ArchDaily]], July 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Competition law}}
In its most general sense, the '''practice of law''' involves giving [[legal advice]] to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal [[negotiation]]s and [[court]] proceedings such as [[lawsuit]]s, and is applied to the professional services of a [[lawyer]] or attorney at law, [[barrister]], [[solicitor]], or [[civil law notary]]. However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by  [[Agency (law)|agents]]. These professions include [[real estate]], [[banking]], [[accounting]], and [[insurance]]. Moreover, a growing number of [[legal document assistant]]s (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by [[computer]]-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions that are posed by the [[software]] in order to construct the [[Legal instrument|legal documents]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the practice of law is conditioned upon [[Admission to practice law|admission to practice of law]], and specifically [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] of a particular [[U.S. state|state]] or other territorial [[jurisdiction]]. The [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Law Institute]] are among the organizations that are concerned with the interests of lawyers as a profession and the promulgation of uniform standards of professionalism and ethics, but regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf |title=State Definitions of the Practice of Law |format=PDF |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114222449/https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unauthorized practice of law===

"Unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) is an act sometimes prohibited by [[statute]], [[regulation]], or court rules.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;

====Definition====
The definition of "unauthorized practice of law" is variable, and is often conclusory and [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]],&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garner, Bryan A. ed. |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=7th |place=St. Paul MN |publisher=West |pages=1191–1192 |authorlink=Bryan A. Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''i.e.'', it is the doing of a lawyer's or [[counsel]]or's work by a non-lawyer for money.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  There is some agreement that appearing in a legally constituted court in a legal proceeding to represent clients (particularly for a fee) is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; But other variations are subject to interpretation and conflicting regulation, particularly as to the scope and breadth of the prohibition.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines unauthorized practice of law as "The practice of law by a person, typically a nonlawyer, who has not been licensed or admitted to practice law in a given jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

The [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The definitions and tests employed by courts to delineate unauthorized practice by non-lawyers have been vague or conclusory, while jurisdictions have differed significantly in describing what constitutes unauthorized practice in particular areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain activities, such as the representation of another person in litigation, are generally proscribed.  Even in that area, many jurisdictions recognize exceptions for such matters as small-claims and landlord-tenant tribunals and certain proceedings in administrative agencies.  Moreover, many jurisdictions have authorized law students and others not locally admitted to represent indigent persons or others as part of clinical legal education programs. . . .&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"&gt;{{cite book |title=Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers |publisher = American Law Institute|year=1998 |edition=4 cmt c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is more controversial is out-of-court activities, particularly drafting of documents and giving advice, and whether that is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"/&gt; Some states have defined the "practice of law" to include those who appear as a representative in arbitration or act as arbitrators in disputes.&lt;ref name="Spector"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |format=PDF |title=Arbitration and The Unauthorized Practice of Law |journal=[[ARIAS Quarterly U.S.]] |publisher=AIDA Reinsurance &amp; Insurance Arbitration Society |date=First Quarter 2006 |volume=13 |pages=16–19 |first1=David M. |last1=Spector |first2=Jessica |last2=Romero |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725085329/http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there is a growing conflict between the multijurisdictional practice of law in arbitration proceedings in the financial service industry and state regulation of lawyers.&lt;ref name="BNA"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uslawwatch.com/2010/08/16/finance/bna-insights-state-regulation-unauthorized-practice-law-arbitration-mediation-trend-permitting-multijurisdictional-practice-alternative-dispute-resolution/  |title=BNA INSIGHTS: State Regulation of Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arbitration and Mediation: The Trend Toward Permitting Multijurisdictional Practice in Alternative Dispute Resolution |date=August 16, 2010 |work=Securities Regulation &amp; Law Report |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a few exceptions, the general rule is that an appearance at an arbitration does not constitute the practice of law.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfRtIxtVG48C&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;f=false |title=Arbitration: essential concepts |first1=Steven C. |last1=Bennett |pages= 175–178 |place=New York |date=May 2002 |publisher=Incisive Media, LLC |isbn= 978-0-9705970-8-3}} {{ISBN|0-9705970-8-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States bankruptcy court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee|Eastern District of Tennessee]] has held that "providing clients with explanations or definitions of such legal terms of art ... is, by itself, giving legal advice."&lt;ref name=software/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt; The [[North Carolina State Bar]] has held that "definition of lien law terms, warnings regarding time requirements, and reminders about sending out preliminary notices within five to ten days of beginning work, when combined with its preparation of legal documents [in the manner described], constitute providing legal advice."&lt;ref name=software&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Software Practice Law?

[[Texas]] law generally prohibits a person who is not an attorney from representing a client in a personal injury or property damage matter, and punishes a violation as a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.123.  Chapter 38 of the penal code, containing 38.122 and 38.123] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501190606/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also criminalize the separate behavior of falsely claiming to be lawyer (in Texas, for example, this is a felony).&lt;ref&gt;Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enforcement====
Criminal laws and enforcement of "Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)" statutes is the organized bar's preferred method. In Florida, the unauthorized practice of law is a third degree felony,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0400-0499/0454/Sections/0454.23.html §454.23 Fla. Stat.] (2016)("Any person not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice law in this state who practices law in this state or holds himself or herself out to the public as qualified to practice law in this state ... commits a felony of the third degree."&lt;/ref&gt; which is punishable by up to six months in prison&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.082.html §775.082(3)(e) Fla. Stat.](2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and $5000 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.083.html §775.083(1)(c) Fla. Stat.] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] has a law which makes it a “[[Disorderly conduct|disorderly person]]s offense” to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a “crime in the fourth degree” to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL.&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=21|section=22|citeonly=true}} In a 2015 survey by the American Bar Association, Florida had the largest budget—$1.8 million—nationwide for prosecuting the unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Draper|first1=Lindsay|title=2015 Survey of Unlicensed Practice of Law Committees|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/2015_upl_report_final.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=17 December 2016|date=September 2015|quote=The Florida Bar continues to lead the country in funding UPL enforcement, spending approximately $1.8 million annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the state's interest in protecting the public and so-called "learned professions" from having unschooled persons practising them, and the state's insistence on enforcing a [[monopoly]], the existence of laws governing (or defining) "unauthorized practice of Law" does not, ''ipso facto'' mean that they will be enforced.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Unauthorized+Practice |title=Unauthorized practice |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History and future====
The American Bar Association proposed model rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which Judge [[Richard Posner]] characterized as an attempt to perpetuate a monopoly to the disadvantage of consumers.&lt;ref name="Federalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/detail/the-abas-attack-on-unauthorized-practice-of-law-and-consumer-choice |title=The ABA's Attack on "Unauthorized" Practice of Law and Consumer Choice |date=May 1, 2003 |first1=George W.C. |last1=McCarter |publisher=[[The Federalist Society|The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge observed that the legal profession is “a cartel of providers of services relating to society’s laws” which cartel's focus is to restrict entry. "Modern economists call it '[[Rent-seeking|rent seeking]]', but throughout recorded history, skilled crafts and professions have tried to raise their members’ incomes by using the power of the state to limit entry."&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;

The practice of law was not formally regulated in [[Arizona]] for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Creasy'', 198 Ariz. 539 (2000). See generally Jonathan Rose, "Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arizona: A Legal and Political Problem That Won't Go Away", 34 Ariz. St. L.J. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona's statute criminalizing unauthorized practice of law was allowed to lapse from a [[Sunset provision|sunset law]] in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 593.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in ''State Bar v. Arizona Land Title &amp; Trust Co.'', 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling imposed sanctions on a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, "Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in ''Arizona Title''."&lt;ref&gt;Rose at 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attorney participation====
In the United States, the rules of professional conduct generally prohibit an attorney from assisting a non-attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. An attorney therefore may not partner with or split fees with a non-attorney in the performance of any sort of legal work. Furthermore, an attorney may not employ a disbarred or suspended attorney in a legal practice where former clients of the disbarred or suspended attorney will be represented. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10378">'''Professional writing''' is [[writing]] for reward or as a [[profession]], or it is any form of written communication produced in a workplace environment or context. Works produced with the professional writing style allow professionals (e.g. employers, lawyers, businesspeople, etc.) to make informed decisions. Professional writing involves the use of precise language to convey information in a way that is easily understood by its intended audience, and it may be directed to inform, persuade, instruct, stimulate debate, or encourage action. For example, in a business office, a [[memorandum]] (abbrev. memo) can be used to provide a solution to a problem, make a suggestion, or convey information. 

A professional [[writer]] may be freelance, meaning he or she works on a self-employed basis, or fully employed in an occupation where a professional writing standard is a prerequisite, such as [[journalism]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], the [[military]], or [[technical writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academics/programs/majors/prwr.html ''Professional Writing''.Purdue University College of Liberal Arts. Retrieved November 7, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;  While not necessarily the practitioner's primary profession, professional writing skills are essential in many other fields such as [[Legal profession|law]], [[medicine]], [[business]], [[engineering]], and [[social work]].&lt;ref&gt;Garay, Mary Sue, Bernhardt, Stephen.

==Overview==
{{further|Professional communication}}
Professional writing is any type of writing that is written with the intention of communicating with others in a professional and courteous manner to facilitate work. Professional writing is either internal or external to a business or organization, which means that the audience of a written work is either an insider or outsider of the professional writer's organization; examples of internal business writing include email messages, memos, and reports while some examples of external business writing are letters and email messages. 

Professional writing differs from other types of writing, such as academic and technical writing, because the term defines a general overview of writing that is done for profit in a workplace environment. Professional writing differs from [[academic writing]] due to the difference in purpose and readership between the two styles. Academic writing informs the audience through critical approach and directs further thinking by emphasizing clarity and thought while professional writing is applied to a business or setting (a hospital, a company, or a factory) and is meant to facilitate work through communication. The audience of academic writing is also limited in contrast to professional writing; specialized experts in specific fields make of the primary readership of academic writing while the amount and identities of readers of professional writing can be varied. When writing, professional writers must take into consideration the possibility of unexpected tertiary readers who can come across their document.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan, Richard. "Planning and Organizing Proposals and Technical Reports." https://owl.english.purdue.edu/media/pdf/20080628094326_727.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional writing differs from [[technical writing]] because of the type of content in technical writing. Technical writing could be identified as a concentration of the broad generalization of professional writing—technical writing is principally directed towards fields of interest. Both are similar in that they take place in professional workplace context and are primarily targeted to allow communication between experts; however, technical writing focuses on technical, specialized topics, such as science, technology, and engineering.

==Style==
{{further|Audience analysis}}
The audience of professional and business documents plays a significant role in the style of a professional document. Successful professional writers adapt their document to fulfill the needs of their audience. Four factors are taken into consideration when a professional writer creates a professional document:
# the audience's pre-existing knowledge of the covered material, 
# the readers' expectations of style and format based on examples of the same genre,
# the readers' level of reading based on the reason for reading the document, and
# the relationship between writer and reader.&lt;ref&gt;Tebeaux, Elizabeth, Dragga, Sam. The Essentials of Technical Communication (3rd ed.). New York: Oxford University Press, 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt;
The audience's pre-existing knowledge remains an important focus for a professional document because it would affect the audience's ability to read the document. For example, a general audience with little knowledge of a document's subject would be unable to read it if it contained specific, [[technical jargon]]. A professional writer would then have to minimize the amount technical jargon or define terms for the reader. 

Expectations of style and format are influential in the format and development of a professional document. Precedents created by earlier documents of the same genre of a professional writer's work heavily influence how the reader of his or her document will judge the [[credibility]] of both the writer and document. Documents belonging to a specific genre are expected to be written in a way that adheres to a format and style that defines that genre. If a professional writer were to produce a document that does not adhere to the precedented style, he or she and the document would lose credibility.

Regarding business and professional writing, the relationship between writer and reader is key. The familiarity between the two influences the language used. For example, an employee might write more informally via email to a coworker of the same hierarchal level than he or she would write via email to his or her employer.

==Uses==

===Communication===
There is, particularly in business, a need for concise and unambiguous communication with colleagues, suppliers, clients, and the general public. Professional writing forestalls inattentiveness and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terk|first=Natasha|publisher=Write it well|title=Professional Writing Skills|date=2010|ISBN= 978-0982447116}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Persuasion===
Persuasive professional writing is connected to the concept of [[rhetoric]], which focuses on informing or persuading and relies upon stimulating the interest of the audience through creating authoritative arguments. A professional writer uses rhetoric and persuasion when creating a document that is intended to suggest a solution to a problem or encourage action. A professional writer uses persuasive language when trying to influence the reader to do something as a result of reading a document. Professional writing [[Feasibility study|Feasibility reports]] and economic justification reports are examples of documents that have such purposes. 

===Information===
Clear and concise professional writing is vital in many fields where misunderstanding could have serious consequences, such as in law, engineering, technical manuals, and product [[label]]s. Misunderstandings might also occur with international audiences; for this reason, a professional writer would have to take careful consideration of cultural differences. The use of language, style, and even color in a document could have detrimental effects because these elements, along with others, can change meaning when translated. For example, a picture of a woman wearing a swimsuit on the beach in an ad would be met with nonchalance in the United States; however, if the same picture was shown in an area with a prevalent Muslim populace, it would be met with outrage because of the religious beliefs that bar women from showing skin. This analysis and consideration of direct and possible audiences help create clear and concise writing and language that professional language requires.


===Examples===
*Law – case studies, briefs, client correspondence
*Marketing – advertising, market analysis, proposals
*Science and Engineering – journals, technical data, manuals
*Retail – inventory reports, damage reports, data sheets, manuals, labels
*Entertainment – proposals, contracts, reviews, books
*Publishing – web content, proposals, contracts, book editing
*Military – operational reporting, orders production, policy or decision briefs, doctrine
*writing a professional career overview

==Skills==
The core skills required in professional writing are good communication, organized thought, a high standard of grammar and language, clarity, and [[Concision|conciseness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tebeaux|first=Elizabeth|title=Redesigning Professional Writing Courses to Meet the Communication Needs of Writers in Business and Industry|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skills may be acquired through practice or formal learning. While many practitioners of professional writing do so as a vocation rather than as full-time employment, the element of "professionalism" is what defines professional writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to tell if you are a professional writer|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/suwcharmananderson/2013/08/07/how-to-tell-if-you-are-a-professional-writer/|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the importance of professional writing in the modern world, many academic institutions offer courses up to degree level on the subject, with some tailored to specific professions such as social work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open University: Professional writing in social work|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/practice-based-professional-learning/activities-projects/funded-projects-and-investigations/getting-it-writeright-professional-w|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930220900/http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/practice-based-professional-learning/activities-projects/funded-projects-and-investigations/getting-it-writeright-professional-w|archivedate=30 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10355">[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|260px|thumb|right|Papa and Rangi held each other in a tight embrace]]
In [[Māori mythology]] the primal couple '''Rangi and Papa''' (or '''Ranginui''' and '''Papatūānuku''') appear in a [[creation myth]] explaining the origin of the world (though there are many different versions). In some [[South Island]] dialects, Rangi is called '''Raki''' or '''Rakinui'''.&lt;ref&gt;This article is based largely on the writings of a Te Arawa chief, Wiremu Maihi Te Rangikāheke, who is the author of much  of the material in George Grey’s ''Nga Mahi a nga Tupuna'' (Grey 1971), originally published in 1853 and later translated into English as ''Polynesian Mythology'' (Grey 1956). It should be understood that the version presented here represents just one Māori creation myth among many variants&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union and separation==
Ranginui and Papatūānuku are the primordial parents, the [[sky father]] and the [[Earth Mother|earth mother]] who lie locked together in a tight embrace. They have many children&lt;ref&gt;The specific number of children varies in different versions but numbers of 70 or more are commonly mentioned. Whether such a high number actually occurs in one early text is another matter for investigation.&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom are male, who are forced to live in the cramped darkness between them.&lt;ref&gt;Their children include, depending on the version:  Rongo-mā-tāne, Haumia-tiketike, Tūmatauenga and [[Rehua]]. The youngest is [[Ruaumoko]], who has never been born and remains inside his mother's womb. His movements cause earthquakes.&lt;/ref&gt; These children grow and discuss among themselves what it would be like to live in the light. [[Tūmatauenga]], the fiercest of 
the children, proposes that the best solution to their predicament is to kill their parents (Grey 1956:2).

But his brother [[Tāne]] disagrees, suggesting that it is better to push them apart, to let Ranginui be as a stranger to them in the sky above while Papatūānuku will remain below to nurture them. The others put their plans into action&amp;mdash;[[Rongo]], the god of cultivated food, tries to push his parents apart, then [[Tangaroa]], the god of the sea, and his sibling [[Haumia-tiketike]], the god of wild food, join him. In spite of their joint efforts Rangi and Papa remain close together in their loving embrace. After many attempts Tāne, god of forests and birds, forces his parents apart. Instead of standing upright and pushing with his hands as his brothers have done, he lies on his back and pushes with his strong legs. Stretching every sinew Tāne pushes and pushes until, with cries of grief and surprise, Ranginui and Papatūānuku were pried apart (Grey 1956:2-3, Biggs 1966:448).&lt;ref&gt;Traditions of the Taranaki region, however, assign this separating role to Tangaroa, god of the sea (Smith 1993:1-2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==War in heaven and earth==
[[File:M45 filip.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Tāne adorned Ranginui with stars]]And so the children of Ranginui and Papatūanuku see light and have space to move for the first time. While the other children have agreed to the separation  [[Tāwhirimātea]], the god of storms and winds, is angered that the parents have been torn apart. He cannot bear to hear the cries of his parents nor see the tears of Ranginui as they are parted, he promises his siblings that from henceforth they will have to deal with his anger. He flies off to join Rangi and there carefully fosters his own many offspring who include the winds, one of whom is sent to each quarter of the compass. To fight his brothers, Tāwhirimātea gathers an army of his children&amp;mdash;winds and clouds of different kinds, including fierce squalls, whirlwinds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery clouds, hurricane clouds and thunderstorm clouds, and rain, mists and fog. As these winds show their might the dust flies and the great forest trees of Tāne are smashed under the attack and fall to the ground, food for decay and for insects (Grey 1956:3-6, Tregear 1891:54, Biggs 1966:448-449).
Then Tāwhirimātea attacks the oceans and huge waves rise, whirlpools form, and Tangaroa, the god of the sea, flees in panic. [[Punga (mythology)|Punga]], a son of Tangaroa, has two children, [[Ikatere]] father of [[fish]], and [[Tu-te-wehiwehi]] (or Tu-te-wanawana) the ancestor of [[reptiles]]. Terrified by Tāwhirimātea’s onslaught the fish seek shelter in the sea and the reptiles in the forests. Ever since Tangaroa has been angry with Tāne for giving refuge to his runaway children. So it is that Tāne supplies the descendants of Tūmatauenga with canoes, fishhooks and nets to catch the descendants of Tangaroa. Tangaroa retaliates by swamping canoes and sweeping away houses, land and trees that are washed out to sea in floods (Grey 1971:5-6).

Tāwhirimātea next attacks his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike, the gods of cultivated and uncultivated foods. Rongo and Haumia are in great fear of Tāwhirimātea  but, as he attacks them, Papatūānuku determines to keep these for her other children and hides them so well that Tāwhirimātea cannot find them. So Tāwhirimātea turns on his brother Tūmatauenga. He uses all his strength but Tūmatauenga stands fast and Tāwhirimatea cannot prevail against him. Tū (or human kind) stands fast and, at last, the anger of the gods subsided and peace prevailed.

Tū thought about the actions of Tāne in separating their parents and made snares to catch the birds, the children of Tāne who could no longer fly free. He then made nets from forest plants and casts them in the sea so that the children of Tangaroa soon lie in heaps on the shore. He made hoes to dig the ground, capturing his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike where they have hidden from Tāwhirimātea in the bosom of the earth mother and, recognising them by their long hair that remains above the surface of the earth, he drags them forth and heaps them into baskets to be eaten. So Tūmatauenga eats all of his brothers to repay them for their cowardice; the only brother that Tūmatauenga does not subdue is Tāwhirimātea, whose storms and hurricanes attack humankind to this day (Grey 1971:7-10, Biggs 1966:449).

There was one more child of Ranginui and Papatūānuku who was never born and still lives inside Papatūanuku. Whenever this child is kicking the earth shakes and it causes an earthquake. [[Rūaumoko]] is his name and he is the God of earthquakes and volcanoes.

==Yearning==
Tāne searched for heavenly bodies as lights so that his father would be appropriately dressed. He obtained the stars and threw them up, along with the moon and the sun. At last Ranginui looked handsome (Orbell 1998:145). Ranginui and Papatūanuku continue to grieve for each other to this day. Ranginui's tears fall towards Papatūanuku to show how much he loves her. Sometimes Papatūanuku heaves and strains and almost breaks herself apart to reach her beloved partner again but it is to no avail. When mist rises from the forests, these are Papatūānuku's sighs as the warmth of her body yearns for Ranginui and continues to nurture mankind (Grey 1956:11).

The '''Saadian tombs''' are sepulchres in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], which date to time of the [[Saadian dynasty]] sultan [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] (1578-1603). They are located on the south side of the [[Kasbah Mosque (Marrakech)|Kasbah Mosque]]. The tombs were discovered in 1917 and were renovated by the Beaux-arts service. The tombs have, because of the beauty of their decoration, been a major attraction for visitors of Marrakech.

The [[mausoleum]] comprises the interments of about sixty members of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] that originated in the valley of the [[Draa River]]. Among the graves are those of [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] and his family. The building is composed of three rooms. The most famous is the room with the twelve columns. This room contains the grave of the son of the sultan's son, Ahmad al-Mansur. The [[stele]] is in finely worked [[cedar wood]] and [[stucco]] work. The monuments are made of Italian [[Carrara marble]].

Outside the building is a garden and the graves of soldiers and servants.

[[File:Ahnenprobe Lodron Josepha Maximiliana 1786.jpg|thumb|1786 seize quartiers document]]
'''Seize Quartiers''' is a [[French language|French]] phrase which literally means a person's "sixteen quarters", the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of their sixteen great-great-grandparents, which are typically accompanied by a five generation [[genealogy]] outlining the relationship between them and their descendant. They were used as a proof of [[nobility]] ("the proof of the Seize Quartiers") in [[Continental Europe]] beginning in the seventeenth century and achieving their highest prominence in the eighteenth. Possession of seize-quartiers guaranteed admission to any court in Europe, and bestowed many advantages. For example, [[Frederick the Great]] was known to make a study of the Seize Quartiers of his [[courtier]]s. They were less common in the [[British Isles]], seventeenth-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] examples being the most prevalent. 

According to [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] in 1909, there were very few valid examples of Seize Quartiers among British families outside a small group of "Roman Catholic aristocracy", and after diligent searching, he could only find two Britons who were entitled to ''Trente Deux Quartiers'' (five generations of ancestors who were all armigerous).&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' (1909), [[wikisource:A Complete Guide to Heraldry/Chapter 42|pp.&amp;nbsp;619-620]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some held the view that, once a family had achieved seize-quartiers, descendants in the male line would continue to be entitled to the benefits even if they continually married non-armigerous women. Their use is now generally limited to genealogical, heraldic, and [[antiquarian]] circles.

'''Silliness''' is defined as engaging in "a ludicrous [[foolishness|folly]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/silliness |title=silliness - definition of silliness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a "lack of good sense or judgment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/silliness |title=Silliness - Synonyms and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the condition of being frivolous, [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivial]], or [[superficiality|superficial]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/silliness |title=Definition of silliness |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In television, film, and the circus, portrayals of silliness such as [[exaggerated]], funny behavior are used to amuse audiences. Portrayals of silliness, provided by clowns and jesters, are also used to lift the spirits of people in hospitals.
==Psychology==
In "The Art of Roughhousing," Anthony DeBenedet and Larry Cohen argue that "wild play" between a child and a parent can foster "joy, love and a deeper connection"; among the actions they suggest is for the parent to be silly and pretend to fall over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-17/health/sc-health-0817-child-health-roughhous20110817_1_light-touch-physical-fitness-freeze |title=The benefits of horseplay - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Christianson from New York’s Big Apple Circus "became so interested in the healing qualities of physical comedy that he quit his job"..."to teach [[jester]]s, clowns and [[comedian]]s how to connect with hospital patients through his Clown Care Unit."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexthejester.com/html/historyPopup.html |title=Brief History of the Jester |publisher=Alexthejester.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor named [[Patch Adams]] "...leads a merry band of mirth makers on trips around the world to locations of crisis or suffering in order to serve up some levity and healing."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"/&gt;


In the US and Mexico, the US practical joke group Improv Everywhere has created an 'international celebration of silliness' by asking commuters to board the New York and Mexico City subways without trousers on a specific day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jan/14/no-pants-subway-day-video |title=No Pants Subway Ride celebrates silliness - video &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2013-01-14|accessdate=2013-07-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the circus==

[[File:Clown chili peppers.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A clown with "happy face" painting]]
In the [[circus]], one of the roles that [[clown]]s play is engaging in silliness. When clowning is taught, the different components of silliness include "funny ways of speaking to make people laugh," making "silly face[s] and sound[s]," engaging in "funny ways of moving, and play[ing] with extreme emotions such as "pretending to laugh and cry." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimdalling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50:clown-activities-structured-silliness&amp;catid=18:teachers-resources&amp;Itemid=59 |title=Jim Dalling |publisher=Jimdalling.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Northern Arts and Cultural Centre]] held a Children's Festival of Silliness in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706012355/http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-06 |title=Northern Arts and Cultural Centre: NACC 1st Annual Children's Festival of Silliness! |publisher=Naccnt.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.S. Lewis]] noted that “Children have one kind of silliness, as you know, and grown-ups have another kind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/silliness |title=Quotes About Silliness (11 quotes) |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stallmästaregården''' (or '''Stallmästargården''') is a historic [[Public_house#Inns|inn]] adjacent to the [[Hagaparken|park around the Royal Pavilion at Haga]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], just north of the [[Stockholm]] city limits.

'''Symbolic anthropology''' or, more broadly, '''symbolic and interpretive anthropology''', is the study of cultural symbols and how those symbols can be used to gain a better understanding of a particular society. It is often viewed in contrast to [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]].{{by whom|date=December 2012}}{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], "[b]elieving, with [[Max Weber]], that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Geertz |first=Clifford |title=The Interpretation of Cultures |year=1973 |publisher=Basic Books |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent symbolic anthropologists include [[Clifford Geertz]], [[David M. Schneider|David Schneider]], [[Victor Turner]] and [[Mary Douglas]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In music, '''syncopation''' involves a variety of [[Rhythm|rhythms]] which are in some way unexpected, making part or all of a tune or piece of music [[off-beat (music)|off-beat]]. More simply, syncopation is "a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm": a "placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn't normally occur."&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;

{{Cite web | last = Hoffman | first = Miles | title = Syncopation |work = National Symphony Orchestra | publisher = NPR | date = 1997 | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/nso/classicalmusiccompanion/syncopation.html | doi = | accessdate = 13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the correlation of at least two sets of time intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, William Morrison, 'Rhythm of Prose'( Introductory Outline), Columbia University Press 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

Syncopation is used in many musical styles, especially [[dance music]]: "All dance music makes use of syncopation and it's often a vital element that helps tie the whole track together".&lt;ref name="Dance"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snoman|first=Rick|date=2004|title=Dance Music Manual: Toys, Tools, and Techniques|page=44|isbn=0-240-51915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the form of a [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|back beat]], syncopation is used in virtually all contemporary [[popular music]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Syncopation can also occur when a strong [[harmony]] is placed on a weak [[Beat (music)|beat]], for instance when a [[7th chord|7th-chord]] is placed on the second beat of {{music|time|3|4}} measure or a [[dominant chord]] is placed at the fourth beat of a {{music|time|4|4}} measure. The latter frequently occurs in tonal [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] in 18th and early 19th century music and is the usual conclusion of any section.

A [[hemiola]] can also be seen as one straight measure in three with one long chord and one short chord and a syncope in the measure thereafter, with one short chord and one long chord. Usually, the last chord in a hemiola is a (bi-)dominant, and as such a strong harmony on a weak beat, hence a syncope.

==Types of syncopation==
Technically, "syncopation occurs when a temporary displacement of the regular metrical accent occurs, causing the emphasis to shift from a strong accent to a weak accent."&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Ted (1997). ''Progressive Steps to Syncopation for the Modern Drummer'', p.33. {{ISBN|0-88284-795-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Syncopation is," however, "very simply, a deliberate disruption of the two- or three-beat stress pattern, most often by stressing an [[Off-beat (music)|off-beat]], or a note that is not on the beat."&lt;ref name="Dummies"&gt;Day, Holly and Pilhofer, Michael (2007). ''Music Theory For Dummies'', p.58-60. {{ISBN|0-7645-7838-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Suspension===
In the following example, there are two points of syncopation where the third beats are carried over (sustained) from the second beats. In the same way, the first beat of the second bar is carried over from the fourth beat of the first bar.

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond" override_midi="Two point syncopation.mid"&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
   \clef percussion
   \time 4/4
   \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
   c4-&gt; c2-&gt; c4-&gt;~  c c2-&gt; c4-&gt;
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Though syncopation may be highly complex, dense or complex looking rhythms often contain no syncopation. The following rhythm, though dense, stresses the regular [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeats]], 1 and 4 (in {{music|time|6|8}}):&lt;ref name="Dummies" /&gt;

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond" override_midi="Not syncopation example.mid"&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
   \clef percussion
   \time 6/8
   \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 80
   c8-&gt; c c
   c16-&gt; \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c
   c32-&gt; c c \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1  c c c \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1  c c c c
   c8-&gt; c c
}
&lt;/score&gt;

However, whether it's a placed rest or an accented note, any point in a piece of music that moves your perspective of the downbeat is a point of syncopation because it's shifting where the strong and weak accents are built."&lt;ref name="Dummies" /&gt;

===Off-beat syncopation===
The stress can shift by less than a whole beat so it falls on an [[Offbeat (music)|offbeat]], as in the following example where the stress in the first bar is shifted back by an [[eighth note]] (or quaver):

:&lt;score lang="lilypond" vorbis="1" override_midi="Syncopation example.mid"&gt; {
    \relative c' {
        \time 4/4
        d8 a'4 c8~ c e4 gis,8  a1
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Whereas the notes are expected to fall ''on'' the beat:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond" vorbis="1" override_midi="Unsyncopated off beat example.mid"&gt; {
    \relative c' {
        \time 4/4
        d4 a' c e gis,  a2.
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Playing a note ever so slightly before, or after, a beat is another form of syncopation because this produces an unexpected accent:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond" vorbis="1" override_midi="Off-beat example other way.mid"&gt; {
    \relative c' {
        \time 4/4
        \partial8 d8 a'4 c e gis,8 a~  a1
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

It can be helpful to think of a {{music|time|4|4}} rhythm in [[eighth note]]s and count it as "1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and". In general emphasizing the "and" would be considered the off-beat.

===Anticipated bass===
'''Anticipated bass'''&lt;ref&gt;Peter Manuel (1985). "The anticipated bass in Cuban popular music," ''Latin American Music Review,'' Vol. 6, No. 2, Autumn-Winter, pp. 249–261.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Bass note|bass]] tone that comes syncopated shortly before the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]], which is used in [[Son montuno]] [[Cuban dance music]]. Timing can vary, but it usually falls on the 2+ as well as the 4 of the {{music|time|4|4}} time, thus anticipating the third and first beats. This pattern is commonly known as the Afro-Cuban bass [[tumbao]].

==Transformation==
[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]]&lt;ref name="Middleton"&gt;Middleton (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music'', p.212-13. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests adding the concept of [[Transformation (music)|transformation]] to Narmour's&lt;ref&gt;Narmour (1980). p.147-53. Cited in Middleton (1990/2002), p.212-13.&lt;/ref&gt; prosodic rules which create rhythmic successions in order to explain or generate syncopations. "The syncopated pattern is heard 'with reference to', 'in light of', as a remapping of, its partner." He gives examples of various types of syncopation: Latin, [[backbeat]], and before-the-beat. First however, one may listen to the audio example of stress on the "strong" beats, where expected: {{audio|Unsyncopated example.mid|Play}}

===Latin equivalent of simple {{music|time|4|4}}===
In the example below, the first two measures has an unsyncopated rhythm is shown in the first measure The third measure has a syncopated rhythm in which the first and fourth beat are provided as expected, but the accent unexpectedly lands in between the second and third beats, creating a familiar "Latin rhythm" known as [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]].

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
   \clef percussion
   \time 4/4
   \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
   c8-&gt; c c-&gt; c c-&gt; c c-&gt; c  c1-&gt; \bar "||"
   c8-&gt; c c c-&gt; c c c-&gt; c  c1-&gt; \bar "||"
}
&lt;/score&gt;

===Backbeat transformation of simple {{music|time|4|4}}===
The accent may be shifted from the first to the second beat in [[duple meter]] (and the third to fourth in quadruple), creating the [[BackBeat|backbeat]] rhythm:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
   \clef percussion
   \time 4/4
   \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
   c4-&gt; c c-&gt; c c-&gt; c c-&gt; c  c1-&gt; \bar "||"
   c4 c-&gt; c c-&gt; c c-&gt; c c-&gt;  c1 \bar "||"
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Different crowds will "clap along" at concerts either on 1 and 3 or on 2 and 4, as above.

==="Satisfaction" example===
The phrasing of "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]" is a good example of syncopation.&lt;ref name="Dummies"/&gt; It is derived here from its theoretic unsyncopated form, a repeated [[trochee]] (¯&amp;nbsp;˘&amp;nbsp;¯&amp;nbsp;˘). A backbeat transformation is applied to "I" and "can't", and then a before-the-beat transformation is applied to "can't" and "no".&lt;ref name="Middleton"/&gt;

                   1  &amp;  2  &amp;  3  &amp;  4  &amp;  1  &amp;  2  &amp;  3  &amp;  4  &amp;  
 Repeated trochee: ¯           ˘           ¯           ˘           
                   I           can't       get         no –  o
 Backbeat trans.:        ¯           ˘     ¯           ˘           
                         '''I'''           '''can't''' get         no –  o
 Before-the-beat:        ¯        ˘        ¯        ˘              
                         I        '''can't'''    get      '''no''' –  o
{{audio|Satisfaction transformations.mid|Play}}

This demonstrates how each syncopated pattern may be heard as a remapping, "'with reference to'," or, "'in light of'," an unsyncopated pattern.&lt;ref name="Middleton"/&gt;

==History==
Syncopation has been an important element of European musical composition since at least the Middle Ages. Many Italian and French compositions of the music of the 14th-century [[Music of the Trecento|Trecento]] make use of syncopation, as in  of the following [[Madrigal (Trecento)|madrigal]] by Giovanni da Firenze. (See also [[hocket]].)[[File:Giovanni da Firenze, Appress' un fiume.png|thumb|center|600px| Giovanni da Firenze, Appress' un fiume.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMaUOL4e14M Listen]]]Composers of the musical High Renaissance [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], such as [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] (1557–1612), exploited syncopation in both their secular madrigals and instrumental pieces and also in their choral sacred works, such as the motet ''Domine, Dominus noster'':[[File:Gabrieli Domine Dominus noster.png|thumb|center|600px|Giovanni Gabrieli, [http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/472691.html "Domine, Dominus noster"]]]Denis Arnold (1979, p.&amp;nbsp;93) says "the syncopations of this passage are of a kind which is almost a Gabrieli fingerprint, and they are typical of a general liveliness of rhythm common to Venetian music."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, D. (1979) ''Giovanni Gabrieli''.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] (1959, p 91), no stranger to syncopation himself, spoke of "those marvellous rhythmic inventions" that feature in Gabrieli's music.&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky, I. and Craft, R. (1959) ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky''.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] used syncopated rhythms as an inherent part of their compositions. One of the best-known examples of syncopation in music from the Baroque era was the "Hornpipe"  from [[Handel]]’s ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'' (1733). [[File:Handel Hornpipe from Water Music.png|thumb|center|500px|Handel Hornpipe from Water Music. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h4mAceHmrI Listen]]][[Christopher Hogwood]] (2005, p.37) describes the Hornpipe as “possibly the most memorable movement in the collection, combining instrumental brilliance and rhythmic vitality… Woven amongst the running quavers are the insistent off-beat syncopations that symbolise confidence for Handel.”&lt;ref&gt;Hogwood, C. (2005) Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks. Cambridge University press&lt;/ref&gt; Bach's [[Brandenburg Concertos|Brandenburg Concerto No. 4]] features striking deviations from the established rhythmic norm in its first and third movements. According to Malcolm Boyd (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;53), each [[ritornello]] section of the first movement, "is clinched with an [[Epilogue|''Epilog'']] of syncopated [[antiphony]]":&lt;ref name="Boyd, M. 1993"&gt;Boyd, M. (1993) ''Bach: The Brandenburg Concertos''.  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bach Brandenburg 4 closing bars of first movement.png|thumb|center|600px| Bach Brandenburg 4 closing bars of the ritornello that ends the first movement. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6hQvvhqfJo&amp;t=6m57s Link to passage]]] Boyd (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;85) also hears the [[Coda (music)|coda]] to the third movement as "remarkable… for the way the rhythm of the initial phrase of the [[fugue]] subject is expressed… with the accent thrown   on to the second of the two minims (now staccato).":&lt;ref name="Boyd, M. 1993"/&gt;[[File:Bach Brandenburg 4 coda to the 3rd movement.png|thumb|center|600px|Bach Brandenburg 4 coda to the 3rd movement. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6hQvvhqfJo&amp;t=15m13s Link to passage]]]

[[Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] used syncopation to create variety especially in their symphonies. The opening movement of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|''Eroica'']] Symphony No. 3 exemplifies powerfully the uses of syncopation in a piece in triple time.  After setting up a clear pattern of three beats to a bar at the outset, Beethoven disrupts it through syncopation in a number of ways:
(1)	By displacing the rhythmic emphasis to a weak part of the beat, as in the first violin part in bars 7-9:[[File:Eroica 1-9.png|thumb|center|600px|Beethoven Symphony No.3, opening of first movement. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGEiJ44K3Oo Listen]]]

Taruskin (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;658) describes here how "the first violins, entering immediately after the C sharp, are made palpably to totter for two bars."&lt;ref name="WestHist"&gt;Taruskin, R. (2010), ''The Oxford History of Western Music''.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2)	By placing accents on normally weak beats, as in bars 25-26 and 28-35 :[[File:Beethoven, Symphony No. 3, ist movement, bars 23-37, first violin part.png|thumb|center|600px|Beethoven, Symphony No. 3, first movement, bars 23–37, first violin part. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGEiJ44K3Oo&amp;t=0m27s Link to passage ]]]

This "long sequence of syncopated sforzandi"&lt;ref name="WestHist" /&gt; recurs later during the development section of this movement, in a passage that Antony Hopkins (1981, p.&amp;nbsp;75) describes as "a rhythmic pattern that rides roughshod over the properties of a normal three-in-a bar."&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A. (1981) ''The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven''. London, Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;
(3)	By inserting silences (rests) at points where a listener might expect strong beats, in the words of George Grove (1896, p61), "nine bars of discords given fortissimo on the weak beats of the bar.":&lt;ref&gt;Grove, G. (1896) ''Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies''. London, Novello, 1896&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Beethoven, Symphony No.3, first movement, bars 123-131, first violin part.png|thumb|center|600px|Beethoven, Symphony No.3, first movement, bars 123–131, first violin part.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13450">"'''The Californian Ideology'''" is a 1995 essay by English media theorists [[Richard Barbrook]] and Andy Cameron of the [[University of Westminster]].  Barbrook describes it as a "critique of dotcom neoliberalism".&lt;ref name="Barbrook 2007"&gt;Barbrook 2007, [http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/other-works Imaginary Futures: Other Works].&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, Barbrook and Cameron argue that the rise of networking technologies in [[Silicon Valley]] in the 1990s was linked to American [[neoliberalism]] and a paradoxical hybridization of beliefs from the political left and right in the form of hopeful [[technological determinism]].

The original essay was published in [[Mute (magazine)|''Mute'']] magazine&lt;ref name="Barbrook, Cameron 1995"&gt;The Californian Ideology, Barbrook, Cameron, 1995-09, Mute Vol 1 #3 CODE, {{ISSN|1356-7748}}, Mute, London, http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/californian-ideology&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 and later appeared on the ''[[nettime]]'' Internet mailing list for debate.  A final version was published in ''Science as Culture'' in 1996.  The critique has since been revised in several different versions and languages.&lt;ref name="Barbrook 2007" /&gt;

[[Andrew Leonard]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' called Barbrook &amp; Cameron's work "one of the most penetrating critiques of neo-conservative digital hypesterism yet published."&lt;ref name="leonard19990910"&gt;{{Citation

==Critique==
{{quote box|width=26%|align=right|quote="This new faith has emerged from a bizarre fusion of the cultural bohemianism of San Francisco with the hi-tech industries of Silicon Valley...the Californian Ideology promiscuously combines the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies."|source=Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron&lt;ref&gt;Barbrook &amp; Cameron, [http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2/ Revised SaC Version]; Borsook 2000, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1990s, members of the [[digerati|entrepreneurial class]] in the [[information technology]] industry in [[Silicon Valley]] vocally promoted an ideology that combined the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] with elements of radical [[individualism]], [[libertarianism]], and neoliberal economics, using publications like ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine to promulgate their ideas.  This ideology mixed [[New Left]] and [[New Right]] beliefs together based on their shared interest in [[anti-statism]], the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and [[techno-utopianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ouellet 2010; May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents believed that in a [[post-industrial society|post-industrial]], [[post-capitalism|post-capitalist]], [[Knowledge economy|knowledge-based economy]], the exploitation of information and knowledge would drive growth and wealth creation while diminishing the older power structures of the state in favor of connected individuals in [[virtual communities]].&lt;ref&gt;May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics contend that the Californian Ideology has strengthened the power of corporations over the individual and has increased social stratification, and remains distinctly [[Americentric]].  Barbrook argues that members of the [[digerati]] who adhere to the Californian Ideology, embrace a form of [[reactionary modernism]].  According to Barbrook, "American neo-liberalism seems to have successfully achieved the contradictory aims of reactionary modernism: economic progress and social immobility. Because the long-term goal of liberating everyone will never be reached, the short-term rule of the digerati can last forever."&lt;ref name="Barbrook 1999"&gt;Barbrook 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
According to [[Fred Turner (academic)|Fred Turner]], sociologist Thomas Streeter of the University of Vermont notes that the Californian Ideology appeared as part of a pattern of Romantic individualism with [[Stewart Brand]] as a key influence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 2006, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adam Curtis]] connects the origins of the Californian Ideology to the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosophy of [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;Curtis 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
While in general agreement with Barbrook &amp; Cameron's central thesis, David Hudson of ''Rewired'' takes issue with their portrayal of ''Wired'' magazine's position as representative of every viewpoint in the industry. "What Barbrook is saying between the lines is that the people with their hands on the reins of power in all of the wired world...are guided by an utterly skewed philosophical construct."  Hudson maintains that there is not one, but a multitude of different ideologies at work.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Leonard of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' calls the essay "a lucid lambasting of right-wing libertarian digerati domination of the Internet" and "one of the most penetrating critiques of neo-conservative digital hypesterism yet published."  Leonard also notes the "vitriolic" response from [[Louis Rossetto]], former editor and publisher of ''Wired'' magazine.&lt;ref name="leonard19990910" /&gt;

Rossetto issued a rebuttal to the original version published in ''[[Mute (magazine)|Mute]]'' magazine, calling it "a totally out-to-lunch excursion", "a descent into the kind of completely stupid comments on race in America that only smug Europeans can even attempt", an "utterly laughable Marxist/Fabian kneejerk that there is such a thing as the info-haves and have-nots – this is equivalent to a 1948 Mute whining that there were TV-haves and have-nots because television penetration had yet to become universal", an "anal retentive attachment to failed 19th century social and economic analysis and bromides is what allows you to claim that the laughable French [[Minitel]] system is a success" and finally, "a profound ignorance of economics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Gary Kamiya, also of ''Salon'', recognized the validity of the main points in the essay, but like Rossetto, Kamiya attacked Barbrook &amp; Cameron's "ludicrous academic-Marxist claim that high-tech libertarianism somehow represents a [[recrudescence]] of racism."&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture historian [[Kazys Varnelis (historian)|Kazys Varnelis]] of Columbia University found that in spite of the privatization advocated by the Californian Ideology, the [[economic growth]] of Silicon Valley and California were "made possible only due to exploitation of the immigrant poor and defense funding...government subsidies for corporations and exploitation of non-citizen poor: a model for future administrations."&lt;ref&gt;Varnelis 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 documentary, ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', Curtis concludes that the Californian Ideology failed to live up to its claims:

{{quote|The original promise of the Californian Ideology, was that the computers would liberate us from all the old forms of political control, and we would become [[Randian hero]]es, in control of our own destiny.  Instead, today, we feel the opposite—that we are helpless components in a global system—a system that is controlled by a rigid logic that we are powerless to challenge or to change.&lt;ref name="Curtis"/&gt;}}

'''''The Songs of Bilitis''''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɪ|ˈ|l|iː|t|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-fr|Les Chansons de Bilitis}}) is a collection of erotic, essentially lesbian, poetry by [[Pierre Louÿs]] published in Paris in 1894 (see [[1894 in poetry]]). Since Louÿs claimed that he had translated the original poetry from Ancient Greek, this work is considered a [[pseudotranslation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Venuti|first1=Lawrence|title=The Scandals of Translation|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=34–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poems are in the manner of [[Sappho]]; the collection's introduction claims they were found on the walls of a [[tomb]] in [[Cyprus]], written by a woman of [[Ancient Greece]] called '''Bilitis''', a [[courtesan]] and contemporary of Sappho to whose life Louÿs dedicated a small section of the book. On publication, the volume deceived even expert scholars. Though the poems were actually clever fabulations, authored by Louÿs himself, they are still considered important literature.

Louÿs claimed the 143 prose poems, excluding 3 epitaphs, were entirely the work of this ancient poet &amp;mdash; a place where she poured both her most intimate thoughts and most public actions, from childhood innocence in [[Pamphylia]] to the loneliness and chagrin of her later years.

Although for the most part ''The Songs of Bilitis'' is original work, many of the poems were reworked epigrams from the ''[[Greek Anthology|Palatine Anthology]]'', and Louÿs even borrowed some verses from [[Sappho]] herself. The poems are a blend of mellow sensuality and polished style in the manner of the Parnassian school, but underneath run subtle Gallic undertones that Louÿs could never escape.

To lend authenticity to the forgery, Louÿs in the index listed some poems as "untranslated"; he even craftily fabricated an entire section of his book called "The Life of Bilitis", crediting a certain fictional archaeologist Herr G. Heim ("Mr. C. Cret" in German) as the discoverer of Bilitis' tomb. And though Louÿs displayed great knowledge of Ancient Greek culture, ranging from children's games in "Tortie Tortue" to application of scents in "Perfumes", the literary fraud was eventually exposed. This did little, however, to taint their literary value in readers' eyes, and Louÿs' open and sympathetic celebration of lesbian sexuality earned him sensation and historic significance.

==Background==

In 1894 Louÿs, travelling in Italy with his friend [[Ferdinand Hérold]], met [[André Gide]], who described how he had just lost his virginity to a Berber girl named Meriem in the oasis resort-town of [[Biskra]] in [[Algeria]]; Gide urged his friends to go to Biskra and follow his example. The ''Songs of Bilitis'' are the result of Louÿs and Hérold's shared encounter with Meriem the dancing-girl, and the poems are dedicated to Gide with a special mention to "M.b.A", Meriem ben Atala.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mZGxs0PCwzEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Andr%C3%A9+Gide:+a+life+in+the+present&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hqURnVISKc&amp;sig=y9p67rpmyvSa8WxrGOD5rbejcZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sql0TPilFMOwcd-Tof8F&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alan Sheridan, "André Gide: a life in the present", p.101]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic structure==

The ''Songs of Bilitis'' are separated into three cycles, each representative of a phase of Bilitis' life: [[Bucolic]]s in Pamphylia— childhood and first sexual encounters, [[Elegy|Elegies]] at Mytilene— indulgence in homosexual sensuality, and [[Epigram]]s in the Isle of Cyprus— life as a courtesan. Each cycle progresses toward a melancholy conclusion, each conclusion signalling a new, more complex chapter of experience, emotion, and sexual exploration. Each of these melancholy conclusions is demarcated by a tragic turn in Bilitis' relationships with others. In the first stage of her life, Bucolics, she falls in love with a young man but is then raped by him after he comes upon her napping in the woods; she marries him and has a child by him, but his abusive behavior compels her to abandon the relationship. In the second stage (Elegies) her relationship with her beloved Mnasidika turns cold and ends in estrangement, prompting her to relocate once again. Finally, in the Epigrams in the Isle of Cyprus, despite her fame she finds herself longing for Mnasidika. Ultimately she and her beauty are largely forgotten; she pens her poems in silent obscurity, resolute in her knowledge that "those who will love when [she is] gone will sing [her] songs together, in the dark."

One of Louÿs' technical accomplishments was to coincide Bilitis' growing maturity and emotional complexity with her changing views of divinity and the world around her— after leaving Pamphylia and Mytilene, she becomes involved in intricate mysteries, moving away from a mythical world inhabited by satyrs and Naiads. This change is perhaps best reflected by the symbolic death of the satyrs and Naiads in "The Tomb of the Naiads".

==Influence==
Like the poems of Sappho, those of ''The Songs of Bilitis'' address themselves to [[Sapphic love]]. The book became a sought-after cult item among the 20th-century [[lesbian]] underground and was only reprinted officially in the 1970s. The expanded French second edition is reprinted in facsimile by [[Dover Books]] in America. This second edition had a title page that read: "This little book of antique love is respectfully dedicated to the young women of a future society."

Seventy years later, the first lesbian organization would call itself the [[Daughters of Bilitis]]. Founded in 1955 in [[San Francisco]], it was organized for lesbians to meet other lesbians while promoting the acceptance of lesbians as legitimate members of society.

==Adaptations==
*Louÿs' close friend [[Claude Debussy]] in 1897 musically set three of the poems — ''La flûte de Pan'', ''La chevelure'' and ''Le tombeau des Naïades'' — as songs for female voice and piano. The composer returned to the collection in a more elaborate fashion in 1900, creating ''Musique de scene pour les chansons de bilitis'' (also known as ''Chansons de bilitis'') for recitation of twelve of Louÿs' poems. These pieces, were scored for two flutes, two harps and celesta. According to contemporary sources the recitation and music were accompanied by ''tableaux vivants'' as well. Apparently only one private performance of the entire creation took place in Venice. Debussy did not publish the score in his lifetime, but later adapted six of the twelve for piano as ''[[Six Epigraphes Antiques]]'' in 1914.
*[[Joseph Kosma]] wrote the 1954 ''comédie musicale'' (or operetta) ''Les chansons de Bilitis'' for soloists and piano.
*[[Michael Findlay]] and [[Roberta Findlay]] made a 1966 [[sexploitation]] film titled ''Take Me Naked'' which features narrated passages from ''The Songs of Bilitis''. In the film, the main character is shown in bed reading the collected works of Pierre Louÿs. He then has a series of erotic dreams depicting nude or scantily dressed women while a female voice narrates passages of the Bilitis poetry.
*In 1977 a French film was released with the title ''[[Bilitis (film)|Bilitis]]'', directed by [[David Hamilton (British photographer)|David Hamilton]]. It had, however, little connection with Louÿs' original, being concerned with a twentieth century (heterosexual) girl and her sexual awakening.
*More recently ''Songs of Bilitis'', a play adapted from the poems by Katie Polebaum with music by [[Ego Plum]], was performed by [[Rogue Artists Ensemble]] under a commission from the [[Getty Villa]] in Los Angeles.
In 2010, the faculty and students of [[Southwestern University]] (Georgetown, Texas) performed the complete corpus of Debussy's Bilitis-inspired music, together with original musical compositions and one original poem inspired by the story of Bilitis. The performances featured a reconstruction of the 1901 performance using pantomime, recitation, and ''tableaux vivants''. It also included a modern "deconstruction" of the Bilitis story, also using pantomime and tableaux vivants, to the music of Debussy's ''6 Epigraphes antiques'', much of which is based on the music used for the 1901 performance. The theatrical performances were directed by Kathleen Juhl, who also performed the recitation of the poems. Debussy's 3 Chansons de Bilitis were performed by mezzo-soprano Carol Kreuscher and pianist Kiyoshi Tamagawa in Victoria Star Varner's megalographic installation ''The Mysteries Revisited'', which was inspired by the [[Villa of the Mysteries]] and addresses some of the themes present in Louÿs' Bilitis poems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southwestern.edu/sarofim/bilitis/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations==
''The Songs of Bilitis'' has been illustrated extensively by numerous artists.

The most famous illustrator to grace the collection with his drawings was [[Louis Icart]], while the most famous illustrations were done by [[Willy Pogany]] for a 1926 privately circulated English language translation: drawn in an [[art-deco]] style, with numerous visual puns on sexual objects.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Other artists have been [[Georges Barbier]], [[Edouard Chimot]], [[Jeanne Mammen]], [[Pascal Pia]], [[Joseph Kuhn-Régnier]], Pierre Leroy, Alméry Lobel Riche, Suzanne Ballivet, Pierre Lissac, Paul-Emile Bécat, Monique Rouver, Génia Minache, Lucio Milandre, A-E Marty, J.A. Bresval and James Fagan.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The '''Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML)''' is a [[not-for-profit organization]] dedicated to the promotion, preservation, and use of maps and [[geospatial information]].  Its purpose as stated in its by-laws&lt;ref name="WamlBylaws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waml.org/bylaws.html|title=WAML Bylaws|publisher=waml.org|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is:

"to encourage high standards in every phase of the organization and administration of map libraries by:
 
*Providing a forum to discuss mutual concerns and interests;
*Exchanging information on experiences, ideas and methods;
*Encouraging higher production standards of map manufacturers.
*Establishing and improving standards of professional service in this field."

Founded in 1967, WAML was the first independent organization centered on map collections and the librarians who oversee them. [[Academic libraries]] have always been strongly represented in the membership, but members also hail from [[public libraries]], private collections, and government and commercial entities, or have been simply aficionados of maps and cartographic information. While paper map collections were traditionally the focus of attention, the advent of [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and other digital platforms for geospatial data have led to a change in emphasis.  Presentations at WAML's meetings range from cartographic history and innovative uses of historical maps and [[aerial photography]] to developments in [[digital cartography]] and issues of GIS use in a library setting.  WAML has always had a practical bent, providing its members with networking opportunities and continuing education for their work in or with cartographic collections and geospatial data.  As a result, it has attracted members from far beyond its principle region of the western [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==History==
The Western Association of Map Libraries had its beginnings with a meeting held in November 1966 at the Map Room of the main library on the Berkeley campus of the [[University of California]]. Map librarians Sheila Dowd of Berkeley, Carlos Hagen of UCLA, and Ed Thatcher of the [[University of Oregon]] had issued an invitation to colleagues at institutions in several states. Discussion involved the need for an organization focused on map libraries, the geographical scope, and whether to affiliate with other organizations with a geographic orientation, such as the [[Geoscience Information Society (GSIS)]] or the Geography and Map Division of the [[Special Libraries Association]]. Concluding that such affiliation would not meet their needs, the Berkeley meeting attendees appointed an interim Executive Committee to "develop recommendations concerning affiliation, possible projects to be undertaken, and plans for the next meeting." That meeting occurred on July 1, 1967, at the library of [[San Francisco State University]], at which the fifteen attendees formally established the Western Association of Map Librarians. (The last word was changed to "Libraries" in March 1969.) Stan Stevens, Map Librarian at the University of California at Santa Cruz, was elected President, and he presented his draft of a Constitution for the organization, which was adopted unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley D. Stevens, "A short history of the Western Association of Map Libraries" ''WAML Information Bulletin'', vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; A set of By-laws was approved by the membership in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;"Results of WAML election and referendum on by-laws amendments" ''WAML Information Bulletin'', vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 49-52&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the Constitution and By-Laws have been amended several times in the decades since. The 1969 by-laws included a definition of the association's "principal region": "The following Provinces of Canada and States of the United States shall comprise the Principal Region for membership purposes: Alberta, British Columbia, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming." Meetings would always be held within the principal region, unless the membership voted to hold a meeting outside of it. This occurred for the first time in September 1998, when WAML met at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;"Minutes, WAML fall meeting, September 16-18, 1998, Washington, D.C.," ''WAML Information Bulletin'', vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and projects==
WAML's activities and projects have included:

* Regular meetings of the membership. A tradition developed of meeting in both the Spring and Fall of each year, with individual members volunteering to organize and host each meeting. WAML managed to keep to this schedule until recently, when the expense of travelling to meetings rose and the amount of travel funds from members' institutions was decreasing. 
* Directory of Map Collections. Compiled under the direction of Mary Schell, Head of government publications at the California State Library, it listed 111 collections in the Pacific Coast area.  It was published in 1969 by the California State Library's Government Publications Section as GPS Publication no. 4.&lt;ref&gt;''WAML Information Bulletin'', vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
* Publishing the WAML Information Bulletin. Launched in 1969 by Robert Sivers during his term as President, the "IB" has contained organizational business, lists and reviews of new publications, and articles on the history of cartography and practical aspects of map librarianship and map collections. 
* Occasional publications. WAML has published several publications useful for library reference, including major "cartobibliographies" that inform the user of what maps have been published for a certain region or by a given government agency. These include:
** ''Union List of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps Held by Institutions in the United States and Canada, v.1: Alabama to Missouri'', by R. Philip Hoehn (Occasional Paper no. 1, published in 1976)
** ''Union List of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps held by Institutions in the United States and Canada, v.2: Montana to Wyoming; Canada and Mexico'', by William S. Peterson-Hunt and Evelyn L. Woodruff; with a Supplement and Corrigenda to Volume 1, by R. Philip Hoehn (OP 3, 1977)
** ''Map Index to Topographic Quadrangles of the United States, 1882-1940'', by Riley Moore Moffat (OP 10, 1986)
** ''Cartobibliography of Separately Published U.S. Geological Survey Special Maps and River Surveys'', by Peter L. Stark (OP 12, 1990)
* Cartographic Users Advisory Council. WAML was a founding member of this group, whose aim was to advocate for the availability of and access to cartographic products and information from federal agencies and to create "a forum for exchange of ideas and information between the cartographic information community and the agencies disseminating cartographic products.&lt;ref&gt;"Cartographic Users Advisory Council Constitution &amp; by-laws" ''WAML Information Bulletin'', vol. 14, no. 3, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Map Librarian's toolbox: a set of web pages on WAML's website bringing together various resources related to map librarianship.
* Scanning Projects Clearinghouse. This project sought to create a "union list" of map digitization projects among libraries in the principal region, so as to increase knowledge and accessibility to these projects and reduce duplication of effort.

== Geography ==

The exact boundaries of Zomia differ among scholars:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fss.ulaval.ca/cms/upload/ant/fichiers/michaudjgh2010_editorial.pdf Michaud 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003064323/http://www.fss.ulaval.ca/cms/upload/ant/fichiers/michaudjgh2010_editorial.pdf |date=October 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all would include the [[Highland (geography)|highlands]] of north [[Indochina]] (north [[Geography of Vietnam|Vietnam]] and all [[Geography of Laos|Laos]]), [[Thai Highlands|Thailand]], the [[Shan Hills]] of northern [[Myanmar]], and the [[mountains of Southwest China]]; some extend the region as far west as [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibet]], [[Northeast India]], [[Geography of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Afghanistan]]. These areas share a common elevated, rugged [[terrain]], and have been the home of [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]] that have preserved their local cultures by residing far from [[State (polity)|state]] control and influence. Other scholars have used the term to discuss the similar ways that Southeast Asian governments have handled minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, J. (2009, February). "Handling Mountain Minorities in China, Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos: From History to Current Concerns." ''Asian Ethnicity'' 10: 25–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zomia covers more than {{convert|2500000|km2}} over the [[Southeast Asian Massif]] and comprises nearly one hundred million marginal people. This large area is inside the fringe of eight states and the entirety of one, stretching across the standard regional designations (South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia). Along with its ecological diversity and its relation to states, it arouses a lot of interest. It stands for an original entity of study, a type of international appellation, and a different way in which to study regions.

==James C. Scott==
Professor [[James C. Scott]] of [[Yale University]] used the concept of Zomia in his 2009 book ''[[The Art of Not Being Governed|The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia]]'' to argue that the continuity of the ethnic cultures living there provides a counter-narrative to the traditional story about [[modernity]]: namely, that once people are exposed to the conveniences of modern technology and the modern state, they will [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]]. Rather, the [[tribe]]s in Zomia are conscious [[refugees]] from state rule and state-centered economies. From his preface:

{{quote|
[Hill tribes] seen from the valley kingdoms as 'our living ancestors,' 'what we were like before we discovered [[wet-rice]] cultivation, [[Buddhism]], and civilization' [are on the contrary] best understood as runaway, fugitive, maroon communities who have, over the course of two millennia, been fleeing the oppressions of state-making projects in the valleys — slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare.
}}

Scott goes on to add that Zomia is the biggest remaining area of earth whose inhabitants have not been completely absorbed by nation-states, although that time is coming to an end. While Zomia is exceptionally diverse linguistically, the languages spoken in the hills are distinct from those spoken in the plains. Kinship structures, at least formally, also distinguish the hills from the lowlands. Hill societies do produce "a surplus", but they do not use that surplus to support kings and monks. Distinction of status and wealth abound in the hills, as in the valleys. The difference is that in the valleys they tend to be enduring, while in the hills they are both unstable and geographically confined.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, he maintains that many traits that are viewed in mainstream cultures as "primitive" or "backward" and used to denigrate hill peoples are actually adaptations to avoid state incorporation, such as lack of a written language, shifting messianic religious movements, or nomadism.  Their presence is absent from most histories, since, as Scott puts it, "it is the peasants' job to stay out of the archives."  Nonetheless, in reality he sees the relationship between upland and lowland peoples as reciprocal, since upland peoples are essential as a source of trade.

==Differing perspectives==
Jean Michaud explains the many dilemmas that arise from the language used to address the group of people residing in Zomia in his ''Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

D., Anthropologist|publisher= Université Laval, Québec, Canada|accessdate=September 22, 2011|quote= Jean Michaud is a social anthropologist and specialises since 1988 on issues of social change among highland populations of Asia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Zomia are often referred to as "national minority groups," and Michaud argues that contention arises with each of these words. In regards to the word "[[nation]]al," Michaud claims that the peoples of the [[Southeast Asian Massif]] are in fact transnational, as many groups span over several countries. According to Michaud, "[[Minority group|minority]]" is not the legitimate way to label the group either, since the populations are so vast. Michaud even claims that the word "group" is problematic because of its connotation with community and “social cohesion” that not all groups share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Michaud|first= Jean|title= Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif |url= http://www.scarecrowpress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=^DB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=081085466X|accessdate=September 8, 2011|series= Historical Dictionaries of Peoples and Cultures #4 |date=April 2006|publisher= [[Scarecrow Press]]|location= Lanham, Maryland

First, it discusses how historical and anthropological approaches can relate to each other, in the field of the highland margins of Asia and beyond. Second, it explores how we might further our understandings of the uplands of Asia by applying different terms such as ‘Haute-Asie’, the ‘Southeast Asian Massif’, the ‘Hindu Kush–Himalayan region’, the 'Himalayan Massif', and in particular 'Zomia', a neologism gaining popularity with the publication of James C.

In 2010, the ''[[Journal of Global History]]'' published a special issue, "Zomia and Beyond".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?jid=JGH&amp;volumeId=5&amp;seriesId=0&amp;issueId=02

|quote= Published for London School of Economics and Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this issue, contemporary historians of Southeast Asian history respond to Scott’s arguments. For example, although Southeast Asian expert [[Victor Lieberman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://lsa.umich.edu/history/facstaff/facultydetail.asp?ID=95|title= Victor B. Lieberman |accessdate=September 7, 2011|work= Marvin B. Becker Collegiate Professor of Southeast Asia, pre-modern Burma, early modern world history|publisher= [[University of Michigan]]|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; agrees that the highland people crafted their own social worlds in response to the political and natural environments that they encountered, he also finds Scott's documentation to be very weak, especially its lack of Burmese-language sources, saying that not only does this undermine several of Scott's key arguments, but it brings some of his other theories about Zomia into question.

Furthermore, Lieberman argues that Scott is overestimating the importance of manpower as a determinant in military success. While the bulk of Scott’s argument rests on the efforts of lowland states to dominate the highlands, Lieberman shows the importance of maritime commerce as an equally contributing factor.

Lieberman also says  that examples not included in Scott's analysis need to be taken into consideration. Scott firmly believes that the culture took shape as a defensive mechanism, as a reaction to surrounding political and social environments. Lieberman, however, argues that the highland peoples of [[Borneo]]/[[Kalimantan]] had virtually the same cultural characteristics as the Zomians, such as the proliferation of local languages and [[Shifting cultivation|swidden cultivation]], which were all developed without a lowland predatory state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2010/10/zomia-reconsidered.html

More recently, Scott's claims have been questioned by [[Tom Brass]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Brass (2012), "Scott's 'Zomia,' or a Populist Post-modern History of Nowhere", ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', 42:1, 123–33&lt;/ref&gt; Brass maintains that it is incorrect to characterize upland Southeast Asia as "state-repelling" "zones of refuge/asylum" to which people voluntarily migrate. This is, he argues, an idealization consistent with the "new" populist postmodernism, but not supported by ethnographic evidence. The latter suggests that populations neither choose to migrate to upland areas (but go because they are forced off valley land), nor – once there – are they beyond the reach of the lowland State. Consequently, they are anything but empowered and safe in such contexts.

[[Edward Stringham]] and Caleb J. Miles analyzed historical and anthropological evidence from societies in Southeast Asia and concluded that they have avoided states for thousands of years. Stringham further analyzes the institutions used to avoid, repel and prevent would-be states. He further concludes that stateless societies like "Zomia" have successfully repelled states using location, specific production methods, and cultural resistance to states.&lt;ref name=Stringham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=Repelling States: Evidence from Upland Southeast Asia|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|date=2012|volume=25|issue=1|pages=17–33|ssrn=1715223|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The title track of Singapore-based art rock band [[The Observatory (band)|The Observatory]]'s ''Oscilla'' (2014) makes reference to Zomia.
